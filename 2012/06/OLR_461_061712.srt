Tonight, June 17th, 2012

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Have new details leaked out on the next Xbox?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Rumors intensify that Star Wars The Old Republic may go free to play

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And did Nintendo withhold some big games from E3?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And that's okay too

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
People are confusing

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just because

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Am I sending you mixed signals?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, I'm just wondering why I'm like actually in a somewhat good mood

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And everybody else is pissy

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're not pissy

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You've thrown off the balance

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, I'm not pissy

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I maybe wasn't as chipper in the opening as I usually am

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But that's because I had the coffee an hour ago as opposed to five minutes ago

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I just finished my coffee, it was fantastic

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It was delicious

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I've noticed at Whole Foods there's two types of people

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods, what are you doing here?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then there's the, oh let me, go ahead of me

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Like the lady, I had like my salad, she's like, why don't you check out ahead of me? Go on

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You sure?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, go ahead

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I wish there was more people like that in the world

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Alright, say hello as well to tech master Loki

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hello

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who is not at Whole Foods today

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How you doing, Loki?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I tend to like to buy my food in, you know, the whole form

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is that like a Costco endorsement? I'm not sure

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, I'm just saying that like, you know, I don't want half foods

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I see, alright, I get it, there's a joke there

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And checking the comments in our chat room, I'm not sure

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's see, I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts, I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know, I checked out that game this week

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That game's messed up

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It is, it really is

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's a disturbing little game

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But it's a very different kind of game

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But looks can be deceiving, it's more like a twin stick shooter

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In Zelda's kind of box

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It may work, you can do like a, it tells you, it's weird

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When you go into the options, it tells you, use joy to pad

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To use whatever joystick

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've just been using the keyboard

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If someone says, don't know what it is? Google it

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Which I found funny

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've just been using keyboard

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I was just, I thought it was very strange

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Which I might find treasure in

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I was like, this is

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The hell is this?

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But I won't spoil it, I won't spoil it

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This crazy mom

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Did you get any of the items?

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Cause one of the first items you get is mom's underpants

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And I was like

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I actually didn't get too far into it

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This creeper right there

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cause I had mass effect

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright, well we are going to talk about our gaming weeks

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And all the games that we've been playing this week

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
At the top of the show here

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
For one, if you were listening to Bobby

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
When he gave us a call there at the end of the show

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that's correct

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know next year, or next year, next week

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is the ten year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you can believe it

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We had our very first show

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Way back on the live 365 network

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
June 23rd of 2002

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And here we are, ten years later

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
For some reason, still doing this

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And no, I know why we still do this

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But it's interesting because a lot of shows

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, I'm not

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Cause you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And all that other stuff

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't make it

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Heck, two or three years even

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a milestone to get to one year

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What do you think has caused us to go for ten whole years

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where other people don't make it?

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We've set the bar really low

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's true

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You know, we don't have a huge audience

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And that's okay

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, we were doing

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That first show

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're doing better than twelve

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The first show was for twelve people

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And for internet radio, that was huge

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, we were really excited

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
To have twelve people who gave a shit enough to listen to us

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And that's the way it was for many years

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It wasn't really till a couple things happened

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We got a couple Konami exclusives

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
With some of the DDR games

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Which helped bring a lot of eyes to our show

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know, a few years ago

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Before we went to the podcast format

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then certainly

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Being a video game podcast that existed

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When iTunes launched podcasting

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We never will have a week that big again

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's for sure

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That was a huge week

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And, you know, now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All over the iTunes market

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So it gets a little harder to stand out

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you're not, you know, IGN or 1UP

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Or one of the, you know, big deep pocketed producers out there

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But, you know, I'm really happy with the following that we do have

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it does seem like, you know, the folks that do show up

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And participate with our show every week

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are really the reason for me that

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Kind of we keep doing this, you know

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thanks to this show

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And it is a way for me to hang out with Darkstalker and Loki

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who are, you know, they're okay

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Eh

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Jamie, what's-

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Were you talking?

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Jamie, what's motivated you for the past ten years?

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She's thinking

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It was at my house

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For a while

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
For a little bit

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But not in the beginning

166
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Dan says he misses the show being at the house

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Does he?

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's actually kind of a nice compliment

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Um

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My ego

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Mhm

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Spite

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're not getting paid for it

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Me, me, me

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Bitch, please

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a hobby

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's something you do for fun, you know

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I do it for more than just for fun

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I do it for the people who are waiting to listen to us

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We do have an audience

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mhm

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, I'm

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Even if it's all of 50 people

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Right

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't care

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's more that download it

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mhm

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know, clearly by the numbers

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And even if they can't make it into the chat room live

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or catch the podcast later on, you know

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm doing it

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, I enjoy it

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Except your ego

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, except my ego, of course

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Make my ego grow!

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Um

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But, no

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just do it because I like attention

203
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I mean, because I like all of you

204
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's why I kinda, I don't know

205
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's why, and I've talked a little bit about this

206
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I don't want to be very direct

207
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily

208
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But I get a little uncomfortable

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When I see people who have been doing a podcast

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
For like one or two years

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know, or whatever, maybe three, I don't know

212
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Kinda stop doing it

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then request a heck of a lot of money to do it again

214
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mhm

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like, what's your motivator?

216
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have integrity

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's your motivator there?

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have integrity

219
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We really do

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mhm

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, you ask, we deliver

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mhm

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Unless you're being bitches

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then we'll, you know, tell you off

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Or Rob will have a hissy fit

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, I don't know

227
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, it's certainly, let me tell you this

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's certainly not money that motivates us

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll tell you that much, that's for sure

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We've had some generous people

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And we've had good things fall into our laps

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer

233
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ronma, mostly, wasn't it?

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I mean

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It was a variety of people

236
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, I don't wanna give one person more credit than another

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But that was, that was a really great

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I also

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Gesture

241
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You know that too

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, hi Shane

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network

246
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was a little slow in activating the check-in

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer

248
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to put a button to do it

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Lazy

250
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But you can now check into the show

251
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000

At live.vognetwork.com and get your points

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sorry about that

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Slacker

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I just wanted you, I just wanted you to wait for it

256
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He was busy playing that game on his iPad

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The Pocket Planes

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Pocket Planes

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute

261
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

262
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
PokePlane, PokePlane

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We'll start with you

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I played Mass Effect

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I played, um

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I started a new guild

268
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So anyone who plays World of Warcraft

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I made an all druid guild

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you have to be a druid to be in it

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And, uh, it's called Druidia

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And if you don't get the joke

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then I feel very, very sorry for you

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And probably a little old

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I was also, I was either gonna name it that

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Or Jewish Princesses

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or Order of Vespa

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, you should all get where that comes from

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I played, like, a little Lotor

280
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But, you know, I, I

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This week has really been kind of exhausting for me

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And next week is gonna be exhausting as well

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I've had some design work

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come onto my plate

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That I'm getting a little bit for

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I did a book cover

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, um, I really haven't

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've been playing more games than usual, though

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've played some Fractal

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You know, I love freaking Fractal

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That game pisses me off and I love it for it

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's like an abusive boyfriend

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So, I was right that you, uh

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Are gonna really like Mass Effect

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Even though you're on the first game

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like you'll play through the series

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That was messed up

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What you were telling me about that

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But, like I was telling you in chat last night

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's, you know, I'm still gonna play it

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Cause I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And you will, you, I mean, there's so many subplots

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
About the various characters

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But not so much in one, I hate to say it

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But when you get to two, there's a lot

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm looking forward to Miranda

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Miranda's great, Miranda's hot

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, if not for my overwhelming just fandom of Garrus

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I would totally romance that bitch

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You can't as a fem chef

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sucks!

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can only lez out with Liara, I think

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Ashley, Ashley's a bitch

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And Liara's too skinny

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can't be lesbian, lesbianic with Ashley

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't think, no, I'm pretty sure you can't

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know what character I'm also looking forward to?

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Jack

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Jack is awesome

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, it's a great story

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My friend Gary's sister

324
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just saying

325
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But yeah, she was pretty cool

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Infinel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's true, and you know what, DarkSakura?

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
By the time you get to three

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's gonna be that extra content

332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the enriched ending

333
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like pop-up video?

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Exactly

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
See, this is what this meant

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In case you didn't get it

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

340
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's all about Miranda's assets

341
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She is a nice war asset

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's round

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's round and plump

345
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And you just wanna reach in the screen and get squished

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's modeled after the voice actress

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know who I love too?

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Talk about genetic perfection

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Not that I'm into aliens

350
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm very secure in my homosexuality

351
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But if I were to get it on with a fam alien

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Samara's kinda hot

353
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just sayin'

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Even though her children are apparently fucked up

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Aha! You haven't even played to yet

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know this

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The Mass Effect wiki

359
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And it came up with whatever it is that they have

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And I know one of them's like addicted to

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, yeah

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And so I actually, out of curiosity

363
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it

364
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
With the crazy chick

365
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And of course, dead

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So that was pretty funny

367
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I also

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I've decided that if I play through it as a dude

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm totally going after Tali

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Cause she's just funny and cute

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, there's so much I wanna say

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But I can't, just keep playing, keep going

373
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Mass Effect lounge radio

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't believe I missed this series

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
For so many years

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's so flippin' good

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Anyway

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
At any rate, I've been averaging like

379
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A planet a play

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If that makes sense, Rob

381
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So, like, I just

382
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, actually no, two plays

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Got me all the way through

384
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The Citadel stuff

385
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then, cause I had a better idea of what I was doing

386
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Cause I'd already played that

387
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And then instead of going to

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Naveria like I did the first time

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I actually went to

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Pick up Liara

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then, now I'm heading back to Naveria

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Which, I should at least

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Be where I was

394
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Probably by the end of

395
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The night one night when I'm playing

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Cause I tend to, you know, play

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And chat with people at the same time

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I multitask, I multitask

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And Acidic Vampire asked me who my

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Favorite character is so far in the first game

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And, I mean, Shepard's actually

402
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Pretty, pretty badass

403
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I dig her

404
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm assuming you're playing Paragon, cause everybody plays Paragon the first time

405
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Actually, I'm playing neutral

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm holding it neutral

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And my Renegade actually points

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are about even right now

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, between my, uh

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
My charm and Intimidate

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If that makes sense

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So, but I'd have to say

413
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Of anyone other than

414
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Shepard, Garrus

415
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's just so

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He can be a dick

417
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you love him and he's like Thor, kind of

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Except, you know, not as the invalid

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Wearing his mother's drapes

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think all boys that play Mass Effect

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Go on a bromance, Garrus, too

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's it

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He can be kind of a jerk

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But he's a good jerk and you like him

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He's just a nice, jerky

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He's like your husband

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He's like Dan, he's really like Dan

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And you just can't help but be charmed

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
By his degrees of arrogance

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
By the way, I do

432
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't mean to veer off

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Track too much, but we are

434
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Currently in the

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
VOG Network Clubhouse on Sony Home

436
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And if you want to log into PlayStation Home

437
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And search for VOG Network

438
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up

439
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
VOG Network

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't know, what the hell is Spazinator wearing?

441
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's like a chicken costume

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It is a turkey costume with the head of

443
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Sweet Tooth and I'm not sure

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The glowing thing is

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That is disturbing me

446
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm not looking at that anymore

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's also somebody with a sack boy and there's a mime

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, yeah, Blender's the mime, I get that

449
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I also really like Rex

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Rex is cuddly

451
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He's just

452
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I like the gruff, sort of, you know

453
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mercenary attitude, I mean, I've always

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Had a thing for that kind of character

455
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
While I'm at it, okay, Liara

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Is too talkative and she needs to

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Shut up sometimes, I mean, there's one

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Take things and run away with it

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ashley's a bitch, I thought I would like her

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But she's really just kind of a bitch hoe bag

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And, uh

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Kate, I hate to say it

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Caden is just too

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mr. Generic Pretty Guy

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Get out of my house

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry, you know what I mean

468
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He's, he's, I mean

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Maybe he'll get better

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I haven't used him that much

471
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I really think that Tali is adorable

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She's just so cute

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Alright, I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But going to some of the comments from our chat room

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
At vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Garris is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad

477
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
When he does bad things

478
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Not as much as Liara

479
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Moving on, anything else for your

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Gaming week, DarkSakura?

482
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I would not have Romanced Rex, I'm sorry

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But that's too much like doing it

484
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
With, um

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't even say with

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Like, Jabba the Hutt

487
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sorry

488
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Alright, Loki, how is your gaming? I know you're not a Mass Effect

489
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Addict, so you have something else going on

490
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, thank god

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This is turning into like a soap opera

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Just talking about all the people that you would have sex with

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
In Mass Effect

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So how many block people have you Romanced in Minecraft?

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There are no block people in Minecraft

496
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's just blocks

497
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And farm animals

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
How many farm animals have you Romanced?

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
None, because I'm playing on peaceful

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So there's none

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know, sneak up on you

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I tunneled from

506
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
My original track

507
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That went from the one station to the next

508
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
To my volcanic layer now

509
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And so I have that

510
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I love that you have an evil underground layer

511
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, it's above ground

512
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's the tallest mountain in the

513
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I thought it was in the volcano

514
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It is in a volcano

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Aren't a lot of evil layers in volcan- I swear that was in a James Bond movie

516
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I swear

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It was also in, uh, you know, Austin Powers

518
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's true

519
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But

520
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I was, uh, hollowing out the volcano

521
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
To build more stuff

522
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Although I'm starting to kind of wonder what the hell

523
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm supposed to fill this volcano with

524
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Um, I tried making

525
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A library

526
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But apparently if the library

527
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Or the bookshelves

528
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Are too close to lava

529
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Even though the lava could be, like, on several

530
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You know, on the other side of a wall

531
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Several layers away

532
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It'll still catch those books on fire

533
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I need more, uh, more materials

535
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
To build in my library

536
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Come back and the whole library burned down

537
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm like, ah, dammit

538
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories

539
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But we are going to talk a little bit about some things

540
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That changed in Minecraft this week

541
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And one of them is the removal of the duping bug

542
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How are you feeling about that, Loki?

543
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I just haven't updated yet

544
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Never! I'll never update

545
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, I will update, it's just, it's a little annoying

546
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is how I built, like, a huge old

547
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Storage facility now that I'm slowly filling

548
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring

549
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Duping stuff

550
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version

551
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They'll have creative mode in there

552
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, they're gonna have creative mode

553
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But even technically that they patched out the duping

554
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There are still ways for me to get stuff

555
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That I want to have a save file editor

556
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That you can edit what you have in your inventory

557
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I can still dupe that way if I wanted

558
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But it's just a pain to, like, pull the save off

559
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And do this

560
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I know they fixed the, um, you know

561
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The clay spawn rate and stuff

562
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So you can actually find clay now

563
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Instead of it being, like, diamond

564
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You know, like, searching for a diamond

565
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But even though diamond's a lot easier to find

566
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Than this right now

567
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And you have to start a new world

568
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
In order for all those update effects

569
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
To take effect in your world

570
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So, like, if we respawn the vogseed

571
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or whatever, it'd actually have different things in it

572
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And they're gonna do the same thing again with pistons

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So, right now I'm just gonna stick with this world

574
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I'm not gonna bother starting a new one

575
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Just to get more clay cause I don't really want clay

576
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And, um

577
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think I'm gonna start over

578
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I need to do some work in Peaceful

579
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like, that's what was slowing me down before

580
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Was that I was too, like, I could not get to stuff

581
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because of the stupid creepers

582
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And all that stuff

583
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I realize that's kinda part of the fun of the game

584
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But I would like to just do Peaceful

585
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then, once I have my underground lair built

586
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I will turn on the monsters

587
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Make it the point to go out and destroy them all

588
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna do

589
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But right now, it's just kinda fun

590
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If I could stop playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

591
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I would do that

592
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For the record, the chatroom and I are talking about Mass Effect still

593
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Don't spoil it for Jamie

594
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
She's in the same position I was in about three months ago

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
She really doesn't know a whole lot about what's upcoming

596
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So, just saying that

597
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Be kind

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So, I played that stuff

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What else did I do?

600
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Um

601
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I played Call of Duty

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Modern Warfare 3 a little bit

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
A little bit of the System Link stuff

604
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Still, wish I had some more maps to play

605
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Because a lot of them are really big

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Whereas the first game, you know, Modern Warfare

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small

608
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That we could actually play on

609
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And it wasn't, you know, such a big deal

610
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There was only, like, a couple that were too big

611
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And now it's like the reverse problem

612
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Um, so hopefully there will be

613
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Some more maps that we can check out

614
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Hopefully for free

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody

616
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And then, um, I was gonna play

617
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Gravity Rush

618
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I

619
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What the fuck?

620
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know

621
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Home is interesting

622
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's all I can really say

623
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says

624
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It gets hard

625
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Get your minds out of the gutter

626
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's a big piece of wood

627
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm not helping, am I?

628
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That says it gets hard

629
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There's a lot of these double entendres

630
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In Sony Home

631
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Dirty ass people who play Home

632
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Like me

633
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But yeah, I've been good this weekend

634
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I have not played any Minecraft this weekend

635
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that

636
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that

637
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, um, I did not play any Minecraft

638
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Today, or yesterday

639
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

640
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Uh, that's it

641
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Not a lot for me to report

642
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects

643
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

644
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Still kinda consumes

645
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sentinel, who's awesome

646
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Uh, I considered

647
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Buying Mass Effect 3 on PC

648
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just so I could play with Alan

649
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC

650
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But now I'm not gonna be able to

651
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real

652
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We think it's the power supply

653
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like, he was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours

654
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yesterday

655
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And finally there was just this loud

656
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It was during Undersedation Live and I was listening

657
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There's just loud pfft

658
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Damn it, I forgot your game

659
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Come to my house next week

660
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We'll see

661
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway

662
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Anyway, off-air discussion

663
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Where was I? Damn it, you threw me off

664
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, Mass Effect

665
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, Alan's computer broke

666
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC

667
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I ended up having to buy a power supply

668
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
For Alan's computer, so

669
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You know, maybe in the future

670
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect

671
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
As Renegade on Xbox 360

672
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Other stuff

673
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I have been playing that's

674
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Non-Mass Effect

675
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I checked out a little more of Sony Playstation Home this week

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Thanks to the VOG Clubhouse

677
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more

678
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There's positives and negatives

679
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Positives is there's a whole lot more

680
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It seems like to do

681
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
In Home now

682
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
A lot more of these mini-games

683
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That are pretty well rounded

684
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house

685
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You can just walk up to it and play it

686
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's called Cluster Puck

687
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Which is kind of a

688
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't know, it's like

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Tetris Attack meets

690
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't know

691
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There's this weird mechanic where you move

692
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You can actually move pieces

693
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling

694
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And once you attach it to another piece

695
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It becomes part of the big block

696
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That you're moving, and then when they all fall down

697
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If you have three in a row

698
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They go away, it was weird

699
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But I liked it, it was a pretty cool, kind of different little puzzle game

700
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And you unlock dumb little rewards for it

701
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was checking out Sony's E3 booth

702
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I checked out some type of

703
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What is it, Midway thing?

704
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But, they

705
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Won 99 cents for 50 tickets

706
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
To actually play the games

707
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And it's all a contest

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And I was like, I don't think I want to do that

709
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
My only real complaint about Home is that

710
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Some of it's really slow

711
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer

712
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
A lot, like

713
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You know, if it's your first time in Home

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You have to download everything

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
For a little while, and I like to think I have a fast connection

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's really the only thing

717
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That really bums me out though

718
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is that Home is kind of

719
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something

720
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That you could launch

721
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Other games from

722
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And it was going to be literally Home

723
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like, you wouldn't go into your crossbar

724
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You'd go into Home

725
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And kind of do everything from there

726
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's too slow, you could never do anything like that

727
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's like a computer

728
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
From the 1980's

729
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It takes two and a half minutes to boot

730
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sometimes, you know, that's the only

731
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
When it loads, and when you have things

732
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Cached, if you've loaded all the areas

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Or whatever, it's pretty cool

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Once you get in there, once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse

735
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And all that, it's pretty cool, but

736
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Moving seamlessly is a little rough still

737
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But I do like, they've really

738
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If you haven't checked out Home since it first

739
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Launched three years ago

740
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There's like a million more things in there now

741
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters

742
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's pretty cool, I like that

743
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Multiple theatres

744
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Dedicated to the Twilight trailer

745
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, really?

746
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No, I'm just making shit up

747
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home

748
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is it a Sony movie? I don't know

749
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out

750
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You better believe they do stuff like that in Home

751
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, by the way, Rob

752
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Before I forget

753
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Actually, there's one more game that I'm playing

754
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm doing the

755
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Mass Effect 3

756
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I

757
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's like a Facebook game, yeah

758
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, but I'm already

759
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Preparing for Mass Effect 3

760
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You're committed

761
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I've also been playing an iOS game and it's

762
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game

763
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
From the makers of Tiny Tower

764
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Where now you fly planes

765
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?

766
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Right

767
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No, Pocket Planes is not a ripoff of

768
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Dream Heights

769
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though

770
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But yes, you

771
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Go to airports, you buy planes

772
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And you ship people and cargo between them

773
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Exact same art as assets from Tiny Tower

774
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Although, obviously, they had to go in

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And draw planes and clouds

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But it's like the same style, the same universe

777
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I kind of like that they have the two

778
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Very different kind of games yet in the same universe

779
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I've heard from some people, though, they don't care

780
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
For Pocket Planes

781
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's not as easy to get

782
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
As Tiny Tower was

783
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get

784
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Pocket Planes is a little

785
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The airport, you have to manage the planes

786
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So you're not just managing a tower

787
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're kind of having to juggle two things

788
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There's a lot more places to sink money

789
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
As well, and there's Twitter

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Integration and all this

791
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The one reason why nimble bits games do so well, though

792
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is that you really do get the full experience for free

793
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And it doesn't nag you ever

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
About buying things

795
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But if you want to buy the little bucks that make things

796
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Go faster, sure, you can go get a handful

797
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Of those easy

798
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
For 99 cents or 5 bucks or whatever

799
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But the nice thing is

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The game will give you bucks

801
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Slowly

802
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You'll start to get bucks, but

803
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You have to be patient if you don't want to pay

804
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
To go all the way

805
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We do have a whole little flight team

806
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or was it flight squad?

807
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's just VOG

808
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If you put in as the tag

809
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And you can see how you're doing in the world events

810
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
With folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf

811
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And whoever else on the network is playing

812
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The Pocket Planes

813
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's it for my gaming week

814
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever

815
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let's move on

816
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news

817
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll quickly say housekeeping

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

819
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Slash OLR and follow us on Facebook

820
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

821
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
One more reminder

822
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We are going to get a notice out there

823
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this

824
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But our 10 year anniversary special

825
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Is next week

826
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I do know we're going to have some guests

827
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We don't hardly ever have guests anymore

828
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
In studio

829
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But I know we're going to have some next week

830
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That are going to show up

831
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That part is of course inevitable

832
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That there's going to be people who want to come out for the 10th anniversary

833
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We have some people traveling a great distance to be here

834
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So that's going to be very cool

835
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And some clips from the oldies episodes

836
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And so forth

837
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I really encourage you guys to be here live

838
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
For that

839
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Please participate with us

840
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
At vognetwork.com

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We have some special piece of loot in it for you

842
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Can't say too much but maybe

843
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It will be on the podcast feed though

844
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If you absolutely have another commitment

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Sunday nights of course it will be on the podcast feed

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We would just love to see you live

847
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Cancel them

848
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Cancel them for us

849
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time

850
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And

851
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
After tonight's show

852
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
If you want to leave a message for the 10 year anniversary show

853
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can do that

854
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And you can do that through Friday

855
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We will put your information up on Twitter and Facebook

856
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
After the show

857
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But that will be open

858
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We encourage our fellow podcasters to call

859
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Our fans to call

860
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
My only suggestion because we are anticipating

861
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There will be a handful

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Not to be all ego

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
A lot of people have been asking

864
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We are anticipating a lot

865
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So try to keep your messages brief

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
If you ramble on for 5 minutes I can't play it

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We're not going to have the time next week

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But if you make it 30 seconds

869
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Again more details on Twitter and Facebook

870
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
After the show tonight

871
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Alright now we can get into some gaming news

872
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Loki start us off tonight please

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Ok so there's some more details regarding the Wii U

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Some of the programming stuff

875
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
First off they have infrastructure

876
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
In place to allow free to play games

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Which is kind of interesting when you think about it

878
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because they've made many comments

879
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
In the past about how they

880
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Didn't like the fact that some of the games

881
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
On the iOS platform and stuff like that

882
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Were too cheap and devaluing everything else

883
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But apparently they said

884
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We've designed a system

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
From a technical standpoint to allow developers

886
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
To freely take advantage of things like free to play

887
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And microtransactions

888
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So that's kind of nice

889
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We'll see some of that stuff coming that way

890
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And of course they're saying

891
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Currently

892
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
They're not actively looking to

893
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Enter the free to play market

894
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
For their first party content

895
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But

896
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They are making it available

897
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
For anybody else that may want to

898
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Make a free to play game

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Nintendo's not going to do that

900
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then of course

901
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
There's some

902
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
There was some

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Rumors that they may be getting away

904
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
From doing friend codes for

905
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This new system and god I wish

906
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That were the case but apparently

907
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
They're not

908
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Friend codes are still going to be a part

909
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Of the online service

910
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
However they're going to change

911
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
They're not

912
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Saying exactly how

913
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Just saying that

914
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Friends codes

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They're going to be there

916
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But not the existing friend code system

917
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You'll be able to identify people as friends

918
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And have a certain level of interaction

919
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Versus different level of interaction

920
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
For more general

921
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Population

922
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So

923
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know is that like

924
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The Google groups or something like that

925
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You can do that with Google plus or something

926
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Who knows but still

927
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Kind of annoying that you have to do that

928
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But whatever

929
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And then of course they also said that the system

930
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Will allow achievements in games

931
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
However it's not mandatory

932
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So some games will have

933
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Achievements and some may not

934
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I just get this

935
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Feeling from reading some of the

936
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Stuff that it's like Nintendo's

937
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Putting a lot of this

938
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You know stuff that they have available for

939
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Other platforms right now

940
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Like achievements or trophies

941
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And some of this other

942
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Like you know different online places

943
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And they have this

944
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Available for third parties but

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Nintendo themselves aren't really

946
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Taking advantage of it it's like

947
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh yeah we're just going to

948
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Kind of do things the way we have been doing them

949
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And we're not really going to do

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
A lot of this online stuff

951
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Or you know have achievements

952
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And things like that I mean it'd be nice

953
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If they did but I don't know

954
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Kind of doing all this new fancy stuff

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
They're just kind of be you know repeating what

957
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
They've done before

958
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We don't like to do what everybody

959
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Else does we're going to do our thing

960
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If everyone jumped off the bridge would you?

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Perhaps

962
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
How high is the bridge?

963
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What do you think though about that achievement part

964
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Not being mandatory I find that kind of interesting

965
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Because it seems like the makers

966
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want

967
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean some might kind of make it

968
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
In parity with whatever's on 360

969
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And Steam and so forth but others

970
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
May just decide not to do it

971
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It kind of reminds me of Steam though because Steam has that kind of thing

972
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Where some games do have you know

973
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Achievements and some don't I don't think it's

974
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Necessarily a deal breaker it's kind of

975
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Disappointing that there's not going to be achievements

976
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Along there I mean

977
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It just for me it seems like

978
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Eh we don't really want to

979
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Do that so but I know

980
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You guys want to so we're going to go ahead and

981
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Allow you to do it but we're not going to do it

982
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I mean it just kind of seems like

983
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They're just taking the easy way out

984
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
For a lot of this stuff I mean how hard

985
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Have they straight up said the Pikmin's not going to have them?

986
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They haven't said it yet but

987
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Pikmin doesn't have certain things that they

988
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You know kind of hinted

989
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That it would have and then of course

990
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Their reasoning for why it doesn't have said

991
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You know feature is because

992
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's too hard

993
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So you know

994
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't know

995
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We'll get to that later but

996
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's just it's stupid

997
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Do you think they could land some big free to play games?

998
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You know I don't know you're thinking of

999
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Steam and so forth like I don't know

1000
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well DC Universe is a Sony game so no

1001
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?

1002
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You know it's good that they have

1003
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That infrastructure in place so they could

1004
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Possibly do that and also it would be nice

1005
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
To see if they have like more of like an MMO

1006
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Type thing in place I'd imagine

1007
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's free to play with microtransactions

1008
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I wouldn't see it being too

1009
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Difficult for them to have microtransactions

1010
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
For like you know subscription

1011
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Models and stuff like that but

1012
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's nice to have the options there

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But at the same time I just kind of wish

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
There was a little bit of a parity between

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Everything that they're doing

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Uh BlackWolf

1017
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In our chatroom says certain Nintendo

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But suck too

1020
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Alright moving on

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
One of the other big things that came out of E3

1022
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Was obviously Microsoft Smart Glass

1023
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And this is the whole iPhone

1024
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
iOS and Android

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And likely you know whatever Windows tablets

1026
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Have is the whole

1027
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They're all gonna be able to run this Smart Glass app

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And a lot of people

1029
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
When they saw that said

1030
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh Wii U just got stolen

1031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And done better, Wii U's dead, Wii U's gone

1032
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So of course Nintendo

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Was asked to comment on this whole situation

1034
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
How does Nintendo intend to differentiate

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Between what Microsoft's doing with

1036
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Smart Glass and what Nintendo's doing

1037
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And essentially according to Satoru Iwata

1038
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Who was interviewed here

1039
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He said that

1040
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Basically it boils down to the fact that

1041
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The controls on the tablet devices

1042
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Often suck

1043
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Quote

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
From what we have seen so far

1045
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It looks to us as what they are able to offer

1046
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Really is only a small facet

1047
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Of what the Wii U is capable of

1048
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
We know that the core users

1049
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Who love playing video games like controllers

1050
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That you hold with two hands

1051
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What you don't have on smartphones and tablets

1052
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Are the buttons and the control sticks

1053
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They prefer to use

1054
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Now if they could hold a controller with two hands

1055
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And hold a tablet or a smartphone with another hand

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There would be no issue

1057
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Unfortunately this is not possible for humans to do that

1058
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That sounds like a challenge

1059
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You can't play a game in a way you can play

1060
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
With the Wii U

1061
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website

1062
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You can check that out

1063
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
In that interview

1064
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That's also officially full of shit

1065
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Really?

1066
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's see here

1067
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What they are describing is basically saying

1068
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because the Wii U tablet has the buttons

1069
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And stuff like that

1070
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You can play games

1071
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Using that you can't play regularly

1072
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But at the same time

1073
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Look at the games that they are showcasing

1074
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That use that tablet and stuff

1075
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
They have a game where you flick ninja stars

1076
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
At the screen

1077
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That uses buttons because

1078
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't see any buttons being used there on the touch screen

1079
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Or some of the other games

1080
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That use that as a secondary display

1081
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You know

1082
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't necessarily have to hold the tablet

1083
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
To have a secondary display

1084
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I can sit it down on the coffee table

1085
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Or something like that

1086
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
They may not require you to necessarily have

1087
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
To hold that

1088
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
To play these games

1089
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I just think that they are

1090
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They are not going to say

1091
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh shit they are right

1092
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They are going to steal our thunder

1093
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well we should have thought better next time

1094
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They are not going to say anything like that

1095
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Of course they are going to talk it down

1096
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Now along similar lines here since we are talking about smart glass

1097
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think it is worth bringing up that the official

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Xbox Live app on iOS

1099
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Was updated

1100
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And yes there is a Microsoft

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Xbox app on iOS

1102
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Officially by Microsoft

1103
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It was updated this week

1104
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
With the smart glass features in it

1105
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now this feature only works on the phone for some reason

1106
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And not on the iPad which I found a little strange

1107
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But what you can do with it

1108
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Once you update it you hit the little button

1109
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
When your Xbox is on that says connect to Xbox

1110
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And your iPhone essentially becomes a controller

1111
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
For the Xbox

1112
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It actually has a little A button in the middle

1113
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So you can kind of use it like a TV remote

1114
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But you can also use it to launch a game

1115
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And then when you launch a game

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The little iPhone turns into a display

1117
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That tells you about the game

1118
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It is nothing really that great

1119
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is kind of a pain to set up

1120
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Because you have to do it each and every time

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So it is not like a big time saving thing

1122
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But it is certainly showing hints of what is to come

1123
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What they are trying to do with this whole second screen technology

1124
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It is a little weird that it is not on the iPad yet

1125
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But it is available definitely on the iPhone

1126
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And that is up now

1127
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You can download that now

1128
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The other thing you can argue with Nintendo

1129
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Is that I don't have to buy another system

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
To be able to have this technology

1131
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Or whatever

1132
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It is going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet

1133
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But at the same time, like I said last week

1134
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I am just worried we are going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff

1135
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Not necessarily

1136
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
First off, I literally think we are going to get DS stuff

1137
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I think they are going to do Virtual Console with the DS

1138
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I mean, duh

1139
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It has got the same setup

1140
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So we are going to see that eventually

1141
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But literally it is just going to be

1142
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Using

1143
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The second screen for just crap that you would have

1144
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like in a start menu or something

1145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Because there was a lot of

1146
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Games on the DS

1147
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It just didn't really need that second screen

1148
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But it was there

1149
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So they used it for like

1150
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Here is a map

1151
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Here is some neat touch screen things you can do

1152
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Some things were really cool though

1153
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like Elite Beat Agents

1154
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But I don't see that really working on the Wii U

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It is kind of like everything is there on the touch screen

1156
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So it is like, why would I look up

1157
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And look at my TV ever

1158
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
There is really not a lot to do

1159
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So I am curious

1160
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
To see further developments

1161
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Of what is actually coming out for Wii U

1162
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And unfortunately E3

1163
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Kind of didn't show enough

1164
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But we will have more on that a little later

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
In the meantime DarkSakura

1166
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Let's switch on to the

1167
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Xbox thing

1168
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Not under the name of the lube

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Unfortunately

1170
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Because that would have been awesome

1171
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There is a document leak

1172
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
About an X

1173
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I should just say for the new listeners of OLR

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
We kind of missed that

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We had a naming contest

1176
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
In our popular list list segment a couple months ago

1177
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We decided the official name

1178
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Of the next Xbox here on OLR

1179
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is the Xbox lube

1180
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So if you are wondering where the hell did that come from

1181
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We are done

1182
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well at any rate

1183
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
There was a 56 page document

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That was leaked

1185
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
For what was listed as the Xbox 720

1186
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Which I am pretty sure

1187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That is not going to be the final name

1188
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It looks kind of like a squishy dreamcast

1189
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I think that is funny

1190
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But it was talking about

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Having new things like a metro dashboard

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Xbox TV apps

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Smart glass of course

1194
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And then

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It was really

1196
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Do you remember Rob that E3

1197
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
When they announced the 360

1198
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And all the stuff they wanted it to do

1199
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And how they wanted it to be a big hub

1200
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It looks like they are still trying

1201
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
To keep that hub

1202
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Thing going on with the new one

1203
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But it is also supposed to have

1204
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Blu ray support

1205
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Native 3D output

1206
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And glasses

1207
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Concurrent apps

1208
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Peripheral support

1209
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Sensors

1210
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Additional sensors sorry

1211
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It says something about a connect 2

1212
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And that they are debating whether or not to use

1213
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
6 or 8

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ARM or the

1215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
They are just

1216
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Really pretty much debating processors

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Debating memory

1218
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Debating the cores

1219
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But they are basically trying to make

1220
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It be the be all end all

1221
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Of anything that you should have

1222
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
In your living room

1223
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They are putting a price point on it

1224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Of $299 with a projected

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
10 year life cycle

1226
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And they think that they will sell more than 100 million

1227
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Units and it is supposed to be out in 2013

1228
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The one thing on here

1229
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That I think is kind of neat

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Is what they are calling project

1231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Fortaleza I guess

1232
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The connect glasses

1233
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Where basically it is kind of like a VR

1234
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Thing

1235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You can actually see all those lasers that the connect

1236
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is actually firing out

1237
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If you saw some of those early videos

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What was it, infrared?

1239
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
If you actually look at the connect in infrared

1240
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It is like oh my god my room is full of lasers

1241
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Well the thing that I think is kind of cool

1242
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
About this

1243
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Is that

1244
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It is like an in person interactivity kind of thing

1245
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Which I don't know if you have to have

1246
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
A decent living room

1247
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Or if it is adjustable or whatever the crap

1248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But

1249
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It makes me think of a kind of

1250
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Augmented reality kind of thing

1251
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Which honestly I think is fully possible

1252
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't know if you saw

1253
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
For anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr

1254
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Which is

1255
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I will post it later

1256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
On my Tumblr I posted a link about

1257
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
These new

1258
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That are

1259
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Full on display that basically

1260
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Will

1261
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Project an image directly to the retina

1262
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And

1263
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They are using it as enhancing

1264
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Poor eyesight and

1265
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Portable television that you can watch

1266
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
With your eyes closed pretty much

1267
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And

1268
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I am thinking that if they have gone that far

1269
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That this is simple

1270
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This would be simple technology in comparison

1271
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Also

1272
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The document that was leaked

1273
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Was removed

1274
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So even if they are saying

1275
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh no that is not true

1276
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It was removed at the request of

1277
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Covington and Burlington LLP

1278
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The international law firm

1279
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That Microsoft has hired

1280
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Hmm

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The plot thickens

1282
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh and by the way

1283
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014

1284
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Loki I know you have been

1285
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Following this new story as well

1286
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Do you think it is fanboy wank

1287
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Or do you think it is the real deal

1288
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Well I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down

1289
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So there is something in it

1290
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Basically it is two years old

1291
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The document is not exactly

1292
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Brand new but a lot of stuff

1293
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It is interesting

1294
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I do not know

1295
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
How much

1296
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It is all speculation

1297
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They are just kind of talking about

1298
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And thinking about something that is not necessarily

1299
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Their step by step plan

1300
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I did think it is interesting

1301
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
How they are talking about acquiring

1302
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
On live and that one of the things

1303
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
That they are going to incorporate

1304
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Later on like in 2015 or something

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
After the console would launch

1306
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Would be that you would never

1307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Need another console again

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Any time that you would need to

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Upgrade to games and the platform

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Can't handle it, it is just streamed

1311
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I do not know if that is necessarily

1312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Going to work

1313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But a better Kinect is something

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That we would expect

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
More processing power

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The glass thing looks weird

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It is kind of like that project glass

1318
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That Google did

1319
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And it does not mean it is going to happen

1320
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I think that is important to say too

1321
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Just because they are talking about this two years ago

1322
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Does not mean it is actually going to happen

1323
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean look at something like the Wii Vitality sensor

1324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That even came out on the E3 stage

1325
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And suddenly disappeared

1326
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It does not mean the glasses thing will happen

1327
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This seems to me to be more of an R&D

1328
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Type of document

1329
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Well, I personally

1330
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I am sorry, I will let you finish

1331
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But personally I think it is a real document

1332
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I do and I think the fact that the lawyers

1333
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Took it down, it is what they call

1334
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
What is it, Streisand syndrome

1335
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I think it is called that

1336
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The Streisand effect or something

1337
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And yes that is as in Barbara Streisand

1338
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Because one time

1339
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
She tried to sue a company

1340
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Or her lawyers sued a company that published

1341
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
A picture of her house

1342
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Like four people in the world saw

1343
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The picture of that house

1344
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Two of them being the lawyers until she sued the company

1345
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Then millions of people saw the picture

1346
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Of her house

1347
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So I think there is a little bit of that going on here

1348
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because the Microsoft lawyers by taking down the document

1349
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Have somewhat proven

1350
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That there is legitimacy to it

1351
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because Microsoft could have come out and said

1352
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh that thing is a bunch of crap

1353
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And maybe it was not crap

1354
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But nobody would have been any wiser

1355
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No, if they just said

1356
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Oh it is crap and then

1357
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
However

1358
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I do not think it is a deep within

1359
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Microsoft document

1360
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It did not look professional enough

1361
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
To be something that was done deep within Microsoft

1362
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I think this thing leaked out of some type

1363
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Of affiliate arrangement

1364
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think a third party company put this thing together

1365
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I do not think it is

1366
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Directly Microsoft

1367
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Necessarily

1368
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Where there is smoke there is fire

1369
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And I think there is definitely some hot stuff in this document

1370
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Or perhaps

1371
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It was

1372
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
A quote leak

1373
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If you know what I mean

1374
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Basically get it out there long enough for the

1375
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
News centers to catch up on it

1376
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yank it

1377
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Make it look official

1378
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I also think that

1379
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If it was like a hype generating

1380
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Stunt or something

1381
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I just do not really think it would generate

1382
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It is not really generating hype

1383
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because it is just all very speculative

1384
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Especially if Microsoft is supposed to be announcing a new

1385
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Tablet on Monday as all the rumors say

1386
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Doing something like that between

1387
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
E3 and a new tablet is kind of

1388
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Dumb

1389
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I do not know

1390
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
There is too much coincidence in here

1391
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
For this to not be real

1392
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing

1393
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I think the depth of that document

1394
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Would have been a lot to whip up

1395
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one

1396
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
On the internet if that is the case

1397
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Again

1398
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I think there is some legitimacy to this

1399
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But I do not think everything in here should be accepted

1400
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
As fact because

1401
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
A. The age

1402
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
B. Ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light

1403
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That is

1404
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Basically what it boils down to

1405
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That is what good brainstorming is regardless

1406
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
True

1407
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You throw out the idea you see if it is possible

1408
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
If the whole thing is

1409
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Some dumb underground

1410
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Marketing ploy

1411
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Viral thing

1412
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Microsoft is trying to get feedback on the glasses thing

1413
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I just think this is a dumb way to do it

1414
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
If that is the case

1415
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
If you put out anything the internet will respond to it

1416
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It is a guarantee

1417
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And if it is something big like Microsoft

1418
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Anything attached to Microsoft

1419
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
The internet is definitely going to give some feedback

1420
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But let me just put it this way

1421
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
If they are going to come to the table with something like that

1422
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You know in like two years time

1423
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That is not good for Nintendo

1424
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Because Nintendo does not

1425
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
They are not bringing a whole lot to the table right now

1426
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
They are bringing like

1427
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Hey look we can use the tablet with our system

1428
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And it is basically a Wii that does HD

1429
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That is not

1430
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
This opens up a lot of possibilities

1431
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Of how you can make games and other applications

1432
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And stuff but

1433
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I do not know we will see

1434
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Especially since they are talking about these glasses

1435
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Or whatever not launching with the system

1436
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I do not know

1437
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
All we need to see either way

1438
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1439
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Not a whole lot of comments on this story

1440
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
A lot of people still commenting about DS

1441
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And tech specifications and all this stuff

1442
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But Tiger Claw says

1443
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Smart glass how about dumb glass

1444
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I do not know

1445
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
There are things I like and things I do not like

1446
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
About this whole smart glass idea

1447
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I do not think it is as revolutionary as they make it sound

1448
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I mean whoopty shit

1449
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can have some information

1450
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Some of the movies do this

1451
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Like the Tron Blu-ray

1452
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And there are other Blu-rays where you can do a very similar thing

1453
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It is cool

1454
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It is like the director's commentary track

1455
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Very few people go that extra mile to use it

1456
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let's be real

1457
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Some of you do

1458
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Especially for movies that you love

1459
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That is a given but very few people do it

1460
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And it is not necessarily that this is something

1461
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That is not possible right now

1462
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Before this update

1463
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because EA games have been doing this

1464
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
With Mass Effect and stuff

1465
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
They will have stuff that ties in with that

1466
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Hell you can even do with Call of Duty Elite

1467
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You can get the app for that on your Android

1468
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
IOS devices

1469
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And you can tweak shit on there

1470
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Before you play the game

1471
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
So they have this kind of stuff available already

1472
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And it is not that like

1473
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That does not sell a game tip for me

1474
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I mean if you know

1475
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet

1476
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I am not going to go oh I have to get Madden now

1477
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I mean it does not seem like it is something

1478
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That is really going to sell me on games

1479
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I love this DC Nate in our chat room says

1480
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
An alternate screen for your console

1481
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Dreamcast sheds another tear

1482
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It was just

1483
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It further proves that thing was just ahead of its time

1484
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Well and

1485
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Nintendo kind of already

1486
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Had that going on with that

1487
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Connection to the

1488
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Crystal Chronicles

1489
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We will just call it the Crystal Chronicles

1490
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That and Four Swords were the only games that really used it

1491
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Pac-Man

1492
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific

1493
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals

1494
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Five games used it and then it disappeared

1495
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah

1496
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So

1497
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Like their LAN adapter

1498
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
One game used it and then it disappeared

1499
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And then a bunch of people hacked it

1500
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So Mario Kart could use the warp pipe

1501
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Or whatever it was

1502
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Well that was over the internet stuff

1503
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I am talking about using the actual

1504
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
LAN adapter

1505
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter

1506
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Maybe online but as far as LANs

1507
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Oh yeah you are right

1508
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Alright let's move on

1509
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So we can get to the classic game of the week

1510
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And release dates and all that good stuff

1511
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But first some more news stories Loki

1512
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Alright so

1513
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
There is some hoo-ha

1514
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I guess about UDraw

1515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And basically

1516
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
A Georgia law firm is investigating

1517
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
THQ to see

1518
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
If they misled their investors

1519
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
About the demand

1520
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
For the UDraw tablet

1521
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Honestly I thought it was a really cool idea

1522
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So I could see where they

1523
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Think that the demand would be really high

1524
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And then it wasn't

1525
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And also I wonder if a lot of that

1526
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying

1527
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That I think at one time

1528
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Nintendo was going to make a few

1529
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Games or whatever that would support it

1530
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And hell

1531
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Let's just get on the topic of the Wii U here

1532
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Why wasn't Mario Paint one of the

1533
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Launch titles for this system

1534
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I mean

1535
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That seems like a perfect title for the Wii U

1536
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Just saying

1537
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
But yeah

1538
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
They're still checking them out

1539
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And making sure that there wasn't

1540
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Any false and misleading statements

1541
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
About its progress

1542
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I want to say that this is

1543
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Not the first franchise

1544
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That they were kind of

1545
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Supposedly misleading

1546
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
People on

1547
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I want to see maybe UFC or something

1548
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I don't know

1549
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Interesting

1550
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I know those UDraw tablets

1551
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Are one of them sitting around

1552
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And they're going for dirt cheap

1553
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Mmm

1554
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
THQ's been in a company that's had some

1555
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Rough times lately too

1556
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
This is a fascinating story to me

1557
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
What is like

1558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I mean could it be that they just said

1559
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Okay

1560
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I understand that they are saying the demand is high

1561
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
What if they believe the demand

1562
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They literally believe that the demand

1563
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Is going to be high for it and it just flops

1564
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Is that misleading your investors

1565
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate

1566
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
With how much the demand is but what if

1567
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's just like no one gave a shit

1568
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
No shits were given that day

1569
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Would it be fair to say that

1570
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
38 studios misled

1571
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The state of Rhode Island

1572
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Well that's a whole different story

1573
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It isn't it isn't

1574
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Well I don't believe

1575
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Kingdoms of Amalur had a

1576
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You know a peripheral that was tied to

1577
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Only you know certain games

1578
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Well it was that MMO never coming

1579
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Out too that really didn't do well

1580
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I mean I always have a problem

1581
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
When you have a device that requires

1582
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
A special peripheral

1583
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Because now you're locked in the buying games

1584
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That require that peripheral and if it's not something

1585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's widely used by a bunch of different companies

1586
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Because it was only THQ that was putting out

1587
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Stuff for it I mean they had licenses for

1588
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Spongebob and Disney princess stuff

1589
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And all that but no one

1590
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Really cares about that and they tried

1591
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Some funky stuff like with

1592
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Actually the Spongebob game they tried making

1593
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
A kind of wire-wire type game

1594
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And it was dumb

1595
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So I could see why it just

1596
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Didn't sell very well and then they tried putting it

1597
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
On other platforms and just

1598
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It bombed kind of like the Tony Hawk

1599
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Skateboard idea

1600
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I mean it was terrible

1601
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room theorizes perhaps Mario Paint is coming later

1602
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It might just be one of their apps

1603
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I don't know I kind of think Nintendo

1604
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is over Mario Paint

1605
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago

1606
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It still should

1607
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Pictochat

1608
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Was Mario Paint

1609
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Ooh do you think there's going to be something like Pictochat on the Wii U

1610
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Or like over the internet?

1611
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh is there oh

1612
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I guess I haven't been paying attention

1613
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You can leave messages and forms and stuff and you can also draw pictures

1614
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And stuff

1615
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That's kind of cool so if I want to just send Dark Sakura a big penis

1616
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I can do that

1617
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Well no there's moderation remember

1618
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh my gosh what if I don't want to post it publicly

1619
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
What if I just want to send her a private penis

1620
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh well

1621
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I don't know how

1622
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Private peni are the best

1623
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't know how deep the moderation goes

1624
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Are they that deep

1625
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too

1626
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So I mean

1627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
How long before penises are being sent

1628
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
All over the Wii U network privately

1629
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Instantly

1630
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's no doubt about it I'm just saying that

1631
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination

1632
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Check out what I do with my Wii U

1633
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You're listening to Orange Penis Radio

1634
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Someone will see that penis

1635
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And it will be the moderator

1636
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
The moderator will come home after the first day

1637
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like I've seen so much penis today

1638
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I feel like I'm working in the porn industry

1639
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Oh Lord dry up

1640
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
This river of penis

1641
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I knew you would get that one

1642
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Well you know what's funny

1643
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Is that

1644
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I don't remember if we talked about this on the show

1645
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody

1646
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
After the fact so I apologize if I'm not

1647
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Crediting the right person with this

1648
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But somebody was theorizing I think maybe it was on Facebook

1649
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That Nintendo's probably

1650
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Gonna hire an outsource company to do

1651
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
All this moderation

1652
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So you're gonna have

1653
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
This huge

1654
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Call center-esque thing filled with people

1655
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
In either the Philippines or India

1656
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
These poor people are gonna see

1657
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Penises all day long

1658
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It won't be done in Redmond

1659
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think that's a damn

1660
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Fine theory that it's probably gonna be outsourced

1661
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I think I see that's my

1662
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Problem with this system is I think if

1663
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You know I'm an adult

1664
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I believe that I should be allowed

1665
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
To you know post like

1666
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You know if I have my friends that I'm playing

1667
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Super Mario Brothers U with or whatever

1668
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And

1669
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Like Rob keeps dying at this one spot

1670
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And goes oh this is so hard

1671
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And I can tell him quit whining you

1672
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Fucking pansy you know and

1673
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Should be able to have that little thing pop up

1674
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Over world 3-1 or something like that

1675
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Why should that all be censored?

1676
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You're censoring my fun

1677
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
No one wants to censor my fun

1678
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers

1679
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And all of a sudden

1680
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You have a message

1681
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh open up the message penis

1682
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh my god

1683
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Or tits I mean come on

1684
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Alright

1685
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm going to lie

1686
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
They should totally have it in New Super Mario Brothers U

1687
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Where you can draw on the background

1688
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Of the levels you should be able to just stop

1689
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And sketch something on the levels

1690
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Uh alpha

1691
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Kananagram in chat says sky mario paint on the

1692
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
DS was Wario do it yourself

1693
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I forgot about that

1694
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That was Nintendo we don't want to fucking

1695
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Make a game you make it yourself

1696
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me

1697
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Uh let's see

1698
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
The chat room is wondering

1699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Where pen15 is tonight

1700
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
This would be a perfect conversation for him

1701
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But sadly not here alright

1702
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Anyhow anything else you want to say about

1703
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Penis or I'm sorry this news story

1704
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That's it

1705
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U

1706
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Uh apparently

1707
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo

1708
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Didn't show their big game at E3

1709
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
After all destiny wasn't shown

1710
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
On the Xbox so maybe

1711
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Something was held back a little bit

1712
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And this is because of a tweet

1713
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That game trailers editor in chief

1714
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Shane Satterfield said

1715
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Uh apparently

1716
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
He said before E3

1717
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That the Wii U launch lineup

1718
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Was looking pretty damn good

1719
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Well if that's the case then he's probably the only one

1720
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
That was thinking that

1721
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But it came out later he went on Twitter

1722
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And said quote

1723
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just realized that a Wii U game

1724
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I knew about well before E3

1725
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Was never announced at the show

1726
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm guessing there's others

1727
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
To come as well

1728
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh really? Yeah

1729
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Well sure why not

1730
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Because this

1731
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Got me into a topic on Twitter

1732
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Earlier this week that revealed

1733
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
To me what I believe is the actual

1734
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Launch day for the Wii U

1735
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Which would be November 18th

1736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I have to check my date

1737
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's a Sunday of course

1738
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Of course that way you can camp out Saturday right

1739
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sundays

1740
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays

1741
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And I don't know why they're just obsessed with fucking Sundays

1742
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So yes November 18th

1743
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Now remember before I said

1744
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Well the 13th

1745
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Is gonna be out the 13th or before

1746
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Because there was a game that was dated for the 13th

1747
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Well there's other games dated for the 20th

1748
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Makes sense

1749
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You know just like the Vita launch

1750
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
There was stuff that was out the week before

1751
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Could it just be a really good guest placeholder

1752
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Because honestly if I were to make an educated guess

1753
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Hmm the weekend before Thanksgiving

1754
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah it's kind of in line with the way

1755
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
They usually do it

1756
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays

1757
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh okay

1758
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And the game in question would be from Disney

1759
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And it's

1760
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Der their big game

1761
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Which would be

1762
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Epic Mickey 2

1763
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Which has not been announced yet

1764
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
For the Wii U and I don't know when it will be announced

1765
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But it's coming

1766
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup

1767
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That they didn't talk about

1768
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
At all

1769
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
What up G in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1770
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Says rumor has it Nintendo is gonna show

1771
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Metro's game which of course

1772
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You know still is nowhere to be seen

1773
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Maybe it's the F-Zero game

1774
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Dream dream dream fanboy wank wank wank

1775
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It would be cool

1776
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I mean

1777
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I don't know but yeah I mean so

1778
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
There that's you know

1779
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
One and I know that

1780
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
There was one I saw for

1781
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Transformers the new Transformers Prime

1782
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You know people don't really care about that

1783
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But I mean Epic Mickey 2 that's a pretty big fucking

1784
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Title not to mention

1785
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
At all I mean unless

1786
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They're worried that it's not gonna be at launch but

1787
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I have things

1788
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That say otherwise

1789
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Alright well right alongside

1790
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That a story came out that

1791
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U

1792
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Third party games are yet to be

1793
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Announced and that's a quote from

1794
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
David Yarnton who's the head of Nintendo's

1795
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
UK division

1796
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Apparently this was in Nintendo gamer

1797
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Magazine it said quote

1798
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I think a lot of third party companies are

1799
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Developing for Wii U and a lot of it hasn't

1800
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Been announced but we can't comment on

1801
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Speculation there are lots of things

1802
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Everybody wishes for

1803
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Call of Duty is another one that's

1804
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Confirmed but

1805
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
They haven't announced it yet

1806
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But then again they also haven't

1807
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Announced it for the Wii yet either so

1808
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So that comes usually later

1809
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
What does this mean Nintendo's waiting for their

1810
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Tokyo game show concurrent event because they

1811
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Don't do Tokyo game show but they usually do a big

1812
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Event they may be announcing more

1813
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Stuff there I think it's just a way that

1814
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
These companies are they announce

1815
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That far out ahead

1816
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
You know ahead sometimes like Call of Duty

1817
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Every year it seems to be it's always

1818
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Gonna be Playstation 3

1819
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Xbox 360 PC announced

1820
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And then later on like last year it was

1821
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
At their live

1822
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Call of Duty event in LA that they

1823
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Announced the Wii version

1824
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And then also DS and there was

1825
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
The you know the elite

1826
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Stuff and the

1827
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know special editions

1828
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And something none of that stuff's been announced yet

1829
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh but that's I mean

1830
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Just reality check the system's out in

1831
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Five months you know assuming it's out in November

1832
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Which is obviously a safe bet that's five

1833
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Months from now it's not

1834
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
A whole lot of time to finish up the games

1835
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
If you don't already know you're doing it

1836
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's interesting I mean

1837
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Maybe there'll be something closer

1838
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
To the end of summer when is Tokyo game show though

1839
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
October? Seattle?

1840
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Oh it's September? Usually

1841
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Maybe two months is enough lead time but one month

1842
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Definitely isn't

1843
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But a lot of these games like I mean I don't see them

1844
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo

1845
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Game show because that's not really a title

1846
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Skew towards the Japanese market

1847
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
WhatupG in our chat room says

1848
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
EA says they will announce a couple of games

1849
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
At Gamescom for Wii U

1850
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
FIFA probably

1851
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't know about NBA Live

1852
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But FIFA I think is for sure

1853
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Which Gamescom would be the place to announce

1854
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That too

1855
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah I think they've already said FIFA was gonna be on the Wii U

1856
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Madden is on the Wii U

1857
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I believe I think that's already been announced

1858
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
AkumaJP is in our chat he lives in Japan

1859
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And has gone to Tokyo game show and confirms

1860
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
It's September my bad I thought it was October

1861
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
For some reason

1862
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Still

1863
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I mean I don't know I could

1864
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah I definitely agree this stuff

1865
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Lots of it hasn't been announced yet

1866
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I mean

1867
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
For sure there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet

1868
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
But I don't know

1869
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Everything

1870
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
That's not been announced

1871
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I just know I know that one

1872
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And I know that it has a firm date on it

1873
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff

1874
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before

1875
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And the week after so

1876
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It seems to fit

1877
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And like I said

1878
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They're delaying the game

1879
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I don't know if that's even made it out yet

1880
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The game is not coming out in September anymore

1881
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
All the other platforms

1882
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's been confirmed I know for Europe

1883
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But they have not announced North America yet

1884
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But that is also going to be delayed

1885
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Europe is coming out on the 20th

1886
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So if you think about it

1887
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The console is probably not going to launch

1888
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I mean it's going to launch at the same time roughly

1889
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
In all regions but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday

1890
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Like they did with the Wii

1891
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Wii launched on that Sunday

1892
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I believe if I remember correctly

1893
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah it did

1894
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I remember we went out really late at night

1895
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And you know remember we were going out and Breslow was here

1896
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And everything and the lesbians

1897
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We all went out

1898
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well I think it was just me and Kristin

1899
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
We were at the

1900
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah Extifer was at Target with you guys wasn't he?

1901
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah Extifer

1902
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
For a little bit

1903
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
No Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me

1904
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Not at that Target we were at the

1905
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh you guys went somewhere else

1906
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah so was Extifer

1907
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't remember him being there with us

1908
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Because we were just sitting there exchanging fan fiction

1909
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I had a Wii the day it came out because Extifer camped out for it

1910
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
He was at that Target

1911
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It was a long time ago

1912
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I really don't remember seeing him then

1913
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It was a long time ago

1914
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Because we would have been hanging out with him

1915
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yeah because remember we went to WinCo I believe

1916
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And got orange soda

1917
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
No all we did was go to Krispy Kreme

1918
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And get donuts and coffee

1919
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah I remember hearing about that

1920
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I only stayed out until about 2 am and then I was like fuck it I'm going home

1921
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I'm not staying up for that

1922
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Alright one more story for you guys then we're going to travel around the world

1923
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And look at release dates but first Dark Sakura has a story for us

1924
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I do don't I

1925
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Well how about

1926
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well a game that we've brought up on the show before

1927
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Draw something

1928
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Over it

1929
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I like it

1930
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
At any rate it's kind of funny that

1931
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Just as soon as Zynga purchased

1932
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
OMG Pop

1933
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
People stopped playing it

1934
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
They dropped something like

1935
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Ten

1936
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
They did

1937
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
They lost ten million

1938
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Monthly active users

1939
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
In thirty days

1940
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But anyway they might be

1941
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Doing a TV show with CBS

1942
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's kind of along the lines

1943
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Of what Win Loser Draw was

1944
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Well they have that host with the awesome

1945
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Hair what was his name Burt something

1946
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Not Burt Reynolds but Burt something else

1947
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I don't remember

1948
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh man

1949
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But

1950
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But the

1951
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
In the mean time

1952
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
While that's still in the talks

1953
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They're thinking about bringing it out in more

1954
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Languages including Chinese

1955
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Well I mean if they have a successful

1956
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
TV show based off of it it would certainly

1957
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Justify some of that extremely

1958
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
High price

1959
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I've decided that Draw something

1960
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Would be much easier if I had an iPad

1961
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh hey this says

1962
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
A complete episode of Win, Lose

1963
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Or Draw available here

1964
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Complete with commercials

1965
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I love stuff like this on YouTube

1966
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That's amazing

1967
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's a coke commercial

1968
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Let me fast forward

1969
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There we go there's one Loser Draw

1970
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Burt Convy

1971
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah and they all sit on the floor

1972
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
To play

1973
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
This show is awesome

1974
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Dude that's Alan Thicke

1975
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
What ever happened to Lani Anderson?

1976
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Let's find out

1977
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Look I could do this all night but we better not

1978
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh it says right here in the description

1979
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds and Alan Thicke

1980
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I hope they have awesome

1981
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
B list celebrities on

1982
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Draw something TV

1983
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
That would be the only reason to watch

1984
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh my god

1985
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
She just is still kinda

1986
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Plasticy looking

1987
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well Lani Anderson's gotta be like 65 at least

1988
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
She was born in 45 so yeah

1989
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I wonder if they'll have people

1990
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Drawing really elaborate pictures

1991
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Something simple

1992
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Like Darth Vader holding a cup

1993
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And it's a cup

1994
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Acidic Vampire

1995
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
She's on her fourth marriage

1996
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Acidic Vampire in our chat room says bring back old game shows

1997
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Supermarket Suite please

1998
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Hell yes

1999
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
The last movie she was in was

2000
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
A Night at the Roxbury

2001
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Well you know what they need to do

2002
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So here's the trick

2003
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
If you want to bring Supermarket Suite back

2004
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You've gotta write a new app

2005
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
For iOS that mimics the old game show

2006
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And throwing hams into a cart

2007
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And brewing the coffee

2008
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
For a bonus $200

2009
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup

2010
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That were the bonus prizes

2011
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show

2012
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Out of your iOS game

2013
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The last two shows she was on was one called

2014
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The Mullets

2015
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And then So Notorious

2016
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh god that was the Tory

2017
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Spelling show

2018
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Actually that show was really good

2019
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Don't judge me

2020
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Do not judge me you're judging me

2021
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I am judging you

2022
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You just said

2023
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I of judgment almost

2024
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I said I am judging you

2025
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Release dates let's travel around the world

2026
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U

2027
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That statement doesn't require

2028
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Extra garbage

2029
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
To play a card game

2030
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
So coming out

2031
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Actually tomorrow

2032
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Pokemon Conquest

2033
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
On the DS it crosses

2034
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Nobunaga's Ambition

2035
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And Pokemon

2036
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Because that really needed to be crossed

2037
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Some people

2038
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Are looking forward to it

2039
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Disney Pixar's Brave

2040
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The video game on Playstation 3, Xbox

2041
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
360, Wii and DS

2042
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes

2043
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
On Playstation 3, Xbox

2044
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
360, Wii, 3DS

2045
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
DS, Vita and PC

2046
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And

2047
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Steel Battalion Heavy Armor

2048
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Game that's gonna really suck

2049
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Using the Kinect

2050
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So that is also coming out

2051
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Oh and I re-released the Quake 4

2052
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Because now Bethesda is releasing it

2053
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So

2054
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Of course, of course

2055
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering

2056
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
We better not have another power outage before

2057
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Part A finishes here

2058
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I'd rather have the power outage today than next week

2059
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Yeah right? Don't jinx it

2060
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm not jinxing it

2061
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't know what we're- next week we're gonna need to have like a

2062
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Moratorium on power in this place

2063
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Because I don't want to blow a fuse

2064
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Anyhow, going to Japan

2065
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And looking at release dates over

2066
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
There, we have on the Nintendo 3DS

2067
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Hello Kitty

2068
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Tohsekai Ryoku

2069
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Irona Kunii Dorekake

2070
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Shimasho

2071
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
From Compile, who I am pissed

2072
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Compile is around and instead of

2073
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making

2074
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Hello Kitty games

2075
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah, get with it Compile

2076
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You know what your people want

2077
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Wouldn't it be hilarious? Rare

2078
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Announces, or was it, not rare

2079
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Retro Studios, Retro Studios announces

2080
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Guardian Legend Cross

2081
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
F-Zero, the racing action

2082
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Shooter game I would jizz

2083
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm not even gonna hold back

2084
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's what would happen

2085
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Let's see

2086
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear

2087
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Solid collection coming out next week in Japan

2088
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That's not this week, sorry to say

2089
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
How about the Playstation 3?

2090
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
There's some stuff from Sega this week

2091
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
K-ON! Hokkago Live

2092
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
HD version

2093
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Mass Effect 2 gets a best hits

2094
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Version, and I think that's the version that comes with

2095
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
All the DLC, I wonder if that's localized

2096
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
With voice acting for Japan, that's pretty cool

2097
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'd like to play a copy

2098
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Of that, just, you know, cause it's fun and different

2099
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

2100
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Comes out as well, and

2101
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Shutsugeki

2102
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Otometachi

2103
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
No Senju 2 comes out

2104
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
From SystemSoft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game

2105
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
We have over here, I don't think it is

2106
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
That's not something I recognize

2107
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Lol, no

2108
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I was looking to see if

2109
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts

2110
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Japanese, I wonder if it's

2111
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I wanna see some dialogue

2112
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Oh, maybe not

2113
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Hey, this is kinda cool, actually

2114
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Something SSJ100Matt said in chat

2115
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
What's that?

2116
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release

2117
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Days on Sundays, apparently back

2118
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
In the Super Nest days, they would release games

2119
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
During the week in Japan, when games

2120
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Were released during the week, people would skip work

2121
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
In school to buy and play games

2122
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Apparently the Japanese government requested Nintendo

2123
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Change their release dates to the weekend

2124
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So there's no lost productivity

2125
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Interesting

2126
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I learned something

2127
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
From the VOG Network chat room tonight, good job

2128
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Alright

2129
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And knowing is half the battle

2130
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Exactly, alright, that's it for Japanese

2131
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Release dates, let's move on to the UK

2132
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Well, for the UK

2133
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Not a whole bunch, it's a really short

2134
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
List

2135
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
On the 20th, Magic the Gathering

2136
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Duel of the Planewalkers

2137
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
2013

2138
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
On the 21st, Mutant Mudds on 3DS

2139
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And, let's see

2140
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
On the 22nd, Civ V

2141
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Gods and Kings

2142
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And Steel Battalion, Heavy

2143
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Armor, and that's it until the 25th

2144
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So, nope

2145
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Nothing

2146
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Well, I mean, nothing

2147
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I guess, really good unless you're a big Civ fan

2148
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I guess that would apply to you, Rob

2149
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But you're not in the UK

2150
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So

2151
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
How about... Well, the good news is

2152
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's out here, and

2153
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It's out next week, or I think came out this week

2154
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I need to check

2155
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I gotta plan an epic Civ V night

2156
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
With some friends, but, like, literally

2157
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's an all-day, all-night event, so

2158
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It'll be sometime in July

2159
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So how about moving on to another story?

2160
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Alright, we can do that

2161
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I'm out of stuff for the UK

2162
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
That's really it

2163
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Let's talk about Star Wars, and how

2164
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Something that they announced during E3

2165
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That Star Wars, the older public

2166
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Is gonna be free to

2167
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Well, not really free to play, but you can play for free

2168
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Up to level 15

2169
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And, you know

2170
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
People are wondering, are they actually just

2171
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Testing the market with this?

2172
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And, apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case

2173
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
They're saying that, you know, because

2174
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Before they lost

2175
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You know, 400,000 subscribers

2176
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And it's probably gonna get worse

2177
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Once the new World of Warcraft

2178
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Expansion comes out

2179
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
But, you know, they're saying, you know

2180
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
If it was just free to play games

2181
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And they weren't very good

2182
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It wouldn't even be a question, but

2183
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
There are definitely good games out there

2184
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And good games coming out, so, of course

2185
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
All of this competition impacts your plan

2186
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And with what you wanna do

2187
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So

2188
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's interesting

2189
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
The other interesting thing is this article got pulled

2190
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
As well

2191
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But

2192
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Maybe they are gonna go all the way

2193
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And make it free to play, especially if it's just not

2194
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Panning out like they were hoping

2195
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
If that's the case, it's kinda sad and unfortunate

2196
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Because the game hasn't exactly

2197
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Been out that long, and that's a really quick turnaround

2198
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But, I mean, we've heard the fact

2199
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
That servers are

2200
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Losing people bad

2201
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And they're already talking about server merges

2202
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But when that game

2203
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Excuse me

2204
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
When that game came out, obviously it was huge

2205
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And everybody wanted to check it out

2206
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
But it had a real problem with retaining people

2207
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And I think a lot of that

2208
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It hasn't been that long either, I mean, like, five months

2209
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Five and a half months

2210
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm assuming part of that is the weekend game

2211
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But I do know some people that are into the end game and enjoying it

2212
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It seems like the launch of Star Wars

2213
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Was better than the original

2214
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
World of Warcraft launch, but then again

2215
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
What you could get away with seven years ago

2216
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
In this day and age when there's tons of MMOs to choose from

2217
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Well, and also I think from what I've been hearing

2218
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
A lot of the complaints with the Old Republic

2219
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Was that it did a lot of the

2220
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Same things that World of Warcraft does

2221
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You kinda have to make your game

2222
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
A little different. Yes, I understand it works

2223
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
For World of Warcraft, but if you just fucking copy them

2224
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It's... put it this way

2225
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Chinese knockoffs

2226
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Have never as good as the real thing

2227
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
If copying something made it just as good

2228
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
As the original, then

2229
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Why would be

2230
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Having a whole bunch of, you know, counterfeit stuff

2231
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Star Wars wasn't

2232
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff

2233
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
To me, I mean certainly there were some things inspired

2234
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
By WoW, but there was a lot

2235
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
That kinda tied into the other Star Wars

2236
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth

2237
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
There was a lot

2238
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It was a good single player game

2239
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
That's for sure, and I think that's what happened

2240
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
A lot of people played to 50 and then that was kinda it

2241
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You know, I think

2242
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
That ended up being part of the problem

2243
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
They invested so much in the single player

2244
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
In all the voice acting and everything

2245
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I kinda think that might have been one of the big mistakes

2246
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much

2247
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
In the voice acting, I mean yes

2248
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It really adds a great deep element

2249
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And immersion into the game, but I think that was

2250
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
A resource that could have been better spent somewhere else

2251
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
More servers

2252
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Well, not even that, they didn't need more servers

2253
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
They had a problem at launch, I thought

2254
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
They fixed it really quick

2255
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It was no worse than what happened in WoW when it started

2256
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I think Star Trek Online handled that type of thing better

2257
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because they really only had

2258
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Two celebrities for voice acting

2259
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
They had Leonard Nimoy doing narration

2260
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
For each of the new areas

2261
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And they had

2262
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
What's-his-face

2263
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Zachary Quinto

2264
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yes, as the

2265
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
EMH, the Emergency Medical Hologram

2266
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
For the first mission

2267
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything

2268
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You don't have people

2269
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Saying, hey, give me money

2270
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Or anything

2271
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It has very limited voice acting

2272
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah, but

2273
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
They've managed to get dedicated voice actors

2274
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
For their main people

2275
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
True

2276
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I have to say, even What's-his-face

2277
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Metzen does half of everybody

2278
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Including Thrall

2279
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
But

2280
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I think their best voice actor

2281
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Is the lady that does Sylvanas

2282
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Because, oh my god, that just chills

2283
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But anyway

2284
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
They put the money into

2285
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Making sure, there's one dedicated

2286
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Server that can handle everybody

2287
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
That's on it, you've got your beta test server

2288
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And as far as the voices go

2289
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
They didn't license any music

2290
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It's really kind of limited

2291
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But you don't care once you're playing it

2292
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Because the game itself is in depth

2293
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And I think that's where you're getting

2294
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Into the difference

2295
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week

2296
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And it has to do with Ubisoft

2297
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Or as a lot of people have been calling him since last week

2298
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Boobysoft

2299
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Is apparently talking to Warner Brothers and Paramount

2300
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
For a movie dealing with

2301
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Splinter Cell

2302
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
This is according to a report from

2303
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Deadline, Ubisoft is in talks with

2304
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Warner Brothers and Paramount over a

2305
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Film tie-in

2306
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow

2307
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It could also follow a new

2308
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Kind of story set in the same universe

2309
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
However, it is worth pointing out

2310
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
There have also been, in the past, deals on

2311
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Uncharted and Bioshock

2312
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Nothing's happened yet

2313
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So, just because they're talking

2314
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
About it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it

2315
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft

2316
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Has also registered some

2317
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Domains in regards

2318
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
To their new IP Watch Dogs

2319
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Remember that was the big game they showed

2320
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
At the end of their press conference that

2321
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Made a lot of people pay attention and some said

2322
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Kind of stole the show away from the

2323
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Big companies

2324
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie

2325
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Watch Dogs The Movie

2326
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Watch Dash Dogs The Movie and so forth

2327
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
This could mean that there's plans

2328
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Or talks about a movie

2329
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I also kind of think this could just be

2330
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Protection of the intellectual property

2331
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Just to make sure

2332
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or

2333
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Whatever or something, you know, and maybe because

2334
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
The game looks so good it could be a movie

2335
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it

2336
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
For one when they start seeing the commercials on TV

2337
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I don't think you necessarily

2338
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Want to read into this that they're absolutely

2339
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Making a movie because of this, this could just be

2340
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
You know, trying to protect someone

2341
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's the same reason why we registered

2342
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
TheVogNetwork.com

2343
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Because so many hosts

2344
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Were calling it TheVogNetwork

2345
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Kind of a similar thing

2346
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Alright, let's

2347
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Let's go back to a time when games

2348
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Were simpler and they weren't making movies

2349
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Out of every single stinking game

2350
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
In fact, the only movie that got a game was

2351
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Super Mario Bros. or excuse me, the only game

2352
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
That got a movie was Super Mario Bros. and it

2353
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Sucked

2354
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's the classic game of the week

2355
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And since it's not the classic

2356
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Video game of the week

2357
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game

2358
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It doesn't say classic

2359
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Video game of the week, she's got a point

2360
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
This is in my house too

2361
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It is

2362
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Twilight Zone that was

2363
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Done by Bally Midway

2364
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

2365
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Uh, that's Mortal Kombat

2366
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You unlock this door with the

2367
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Key of imagination

2368
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Anyway

2369
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It was designed by Pat Lawler

2370
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Who is like one of the all

2371
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Time best pinball

2372
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Table designers, like let me go over his

2373
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
List just real quick

2374
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
He did Earth Shaker and Whirlwind

2375
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
He did Fun House where you got to hit

2376
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That ugly guy in the head a bunch of times

2377
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
He did Adam's Family

2378
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
He did Safe Cracker

2379
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
With Stern, he did

2380
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Roller Coaster Tycoon, Ripley's

2381
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Believe it or not, NASCAR, Family Guy

2382
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
CSI, and Shrek

2383
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I mean this guy is

2384
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
He's done some of the best tables

2385
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Out there

2386
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But anyway, Twilight Zone

2387
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Is based off of the

2388
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Twilight Zone TV show

2389
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's one of the super pin series

2390
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Of wide body pinball tables

2391
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Other ones include

2392
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Star Trek The Next Generation and

2393
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Indiana Jones The Pinball Adventure

2394
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Which is at Disneyland again

2395
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's at the

2396
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Was it the Jungle Trader? Anyway

2397
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
But because

2398
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
He was so successful with Adam's Family

2399
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Midway's like, here you

2400
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Can do the whole thing, you don't need to ask us

2401
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Anything, and this is considered to be

2402
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
One of the most complex pinball

2403
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Tables ever designed

2404
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It has a working gumball

2405
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Machine that deposits balls

2406
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
An analog clock deposits balls

2407
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Shut up

2408
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I knew you were going to do that

2409
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It has a working analog clock

2410
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It's a timer for different modes

2411
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
A power field

2412
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Which is basically like

2413
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Right on top

2414
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Of the left hand side

2415
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Of the thing

2416
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Basically instead of using flippers

2417
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You're using magnets

2418
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
To play the ball through this little mini field

2419
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And the power ball where you use a white ceramic

2420
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Ball that's lighter

2421
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And it's given that it's

2422
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Not magnetic, it's not affected by the

2423
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Magnets in the table

2424
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It also uses

2425
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The original theme

2426
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
From the Twilight Zone

2427
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And it also uses

2428
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I don't know who likes

2429
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Their early 80's rock

2430
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But it uses the song Twilight Zone by

2431
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Golden Earring

2432
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And it actually

2433
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Has a

2434
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Really good vocal

2435
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Lightness, Tim Kittrow did

2436
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The voice of Rod Serling

2437
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
It was

2438
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Supposed to be the first game

2439
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
To use the Williams Midway

2440
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
DCS sound system

2441
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But it was still being developed

2442
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So it used the Yamaha YM-2151

2443
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Harris CVSD soundboard

2444
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And it is

2445
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Considered right now

2446
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The top rated electronic pinball

2447
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Table of Instagram

2448
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
As far as

2449
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Little fun stuff that's in there

2450
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And I'm just going to read through the list on here

2451
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It has the door from the

2452
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Opening credits right in the

2453
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Center of the play field

2454
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You have the mannequin, the zodiac

2455
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Clop from the very beginning

2456
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It has an image of

2457
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Henry Burness from the episode

2458
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Time Enough At Last

2459
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's next to the slot machine

2460
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
The hitchhiker

2461
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
The slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover

2462
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You have the most

2463
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Unusual camera

2464
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Which is actually a pretty good episode

2465
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The invader, static, the piano of the house

2466
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Has the player piano

2467
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
From that. You have

2468
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Talky Tina from the living doll

2469
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Here's your extra ball

2470
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I know, it's pretty cool

2471
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
They need the tower of terror

2472
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Where your balls just drop

2473
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Robbie the Robot

2474
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center

2475
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Whipple is on the play field

2476
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And in an animation

2477
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And different sound effects

2478
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Like the Serling voiceovers

2479
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
My favorite one which we heard right at the beginning

2480
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
You unlock this door with a key of imagination

2481
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
May I present

2482
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
A most unusual camera

2483
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You know, that type of stuff

2484
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
But the

2485
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You have different door panel modes

2486
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Where one is like

2487
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Ten million points, the light the gumball

2488
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
The town square madness, fast lock

2489
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Super skill shot, the super slot

2490
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
The extra ball

2491
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The camera

2492
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game

2493
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
There's also the spiral

2494
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Clock millions, battle the power

2495
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Greed, which actually

2496
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family

2497
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Exactly

2498
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
The hitchhiker

2499
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And the clock chaos

2500
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
There's actually one of my favorite things to do

2501
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And this is one of the skill shots in the game

2502
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Is when you use

2503
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
One of the top right flippers

2504
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And you have to hold the left flipper open

2505
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So that you're shooting it up a ramp

2506
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Under the mini field

2507
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So I mean, it's really

2508
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Complex, really hard

2509
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And then on top of that you have four different

2510
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Multiball modes

2511
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You have the standard multiball

2512
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Powerball mania

2513
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Where it happens

2514
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
When you load the powerball into the gumball machine

2515
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And then

2516
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
You have to keep making shots over the main playfield

2517
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And you get a 50 million point jackpot

2518
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You have the

2519
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Fast lock multiball

2520
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And then lost in the zone

2521
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Which is the wizard mode

2522
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Where if you light all of the door panels

2523
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
You get a door knob with a question mark

2524
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And it pops open

2525
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And you have 45 seconds

2526
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
To make an unlimited number of shots

2527
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
To all the targets

2528
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Basically every playable

2529
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Single ball mode is active during this time period

2530
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So it's basically

2531
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
45 seconds of three for all

2532
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And then

2533
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
In most of the machines though

2534
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You have your standard multiball

2535
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
With three being released

2536
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
There's all kinds of custom mods

2537
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That people have done

2538
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Like one person added in

2539
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
The Robbie the Robot toy

2540
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Into their machine

2541
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
There's other design mods like the

2542
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Third play field magnet

2543
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
The gumball flashers, the gumballs

2544
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We actually I think added an LED into ours

2545
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I want to say

2546
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But yeah we have a gumball flasher

2547
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That's an independent mod

2548
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Different you know

2549
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Colors, different things you can add in

2550
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Just all kinds, people mod their stuff

2551
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
All the way, now here's the cool stuff

2552
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
You can play Twilight Zone

2553
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Anytime you want to

2554
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's a license table for the pinball arcade

2555
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It's out on

2556
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3

2557
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
PS Vita

2558
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And it's supposed to be out for the 3DS

2559
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Windows and Mac OS

2560
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So it kind of is a game

2561
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Like a console game

2562
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Well and for anyone who still

2563
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Uses VPN which is basically

2564
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
How we played it for the longest time in my house

2565
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You can play it on Windows

2566
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I think there's also a version of PinMame

2567
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And PinMame

2568
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
For Linux

2569
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I want to say

2570
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So there you go, that's the game

2571
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It's Twilight Zone

2572
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Are you lost in the zone?

2573
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Do you unlock this door with the key of imagination?

2574
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
There it is, Twilight Zone

2575
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The pinball game but now accessible

2576
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Thanks to the wonders of emulation

2577
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
On the 360 and Playstation Network

2578
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And iPhone and all that good stuff

2579
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
There it is

2580
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Neat choice, something a little bit outside the box

2581
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I like it

2582
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So we are going to take a quick break

2583
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
There's plenty more OLR to come, don't miss it

2584
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We have the FUGL Question of the Week

2585
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Some rapid fire news coming your way

2586

And of course the mailbag and your phone calls

2587

At 1877 Game OLR

2588
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
All when we come back after a quick break

2589
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

2590
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2591
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Live at vognetwork.com

2592
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
On this June the 17th of 2012

2593
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
With the 461st episode of our show

2594
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Hey, happy Father's Day

2595
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
To all you gamer daddies out there

2596
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Happen to be listening to the show

2597
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Including Loki, of course

2598
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Has his kid Josh

2599
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I see a lot of pictures

2600
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That the Mrs. and Mrs.

2601
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And the Mrs.

2602
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And the Mrs.

2603
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And the Mrs.

2604
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I see a lot of pictures that the Mrs.

2605
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Has been putting up on Facebook, very cute

2606
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
He was playing with another kid today it looks like

2607
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Or the other day, I don't know

2608
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I saw the picture today

2609
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
He has the cutest hair

2610
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And of course

2611
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
As of course as I say

2612
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
If you're a father figure or a father to pets

2613
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I think you count too

2614
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So I'm a wicked stepfather to two cats

2615
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
One of which is being brave and coming out in the studio tonight

2616
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Usually they hide

2617
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But Maruko is out here

2618
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
He wanted food

2619
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I said tonight I'm not moving their dish tonight

2620
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
There you go

2621
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Clover Nikon in our chat room

2622
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
At live.vognetwork.com

2623
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Says I'm a gamer uncle

2624
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
You know what, close enough

2625
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I would still say that's a fatherly figure

2626
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
In somebody's life

2627
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I have a picture of Maruko, I'm gonna post it

2628
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Awesome, over to orangelaunchradio.com

2629
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Kind of a squinty picture

2630
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
While you're checking out the pictures of the kitties

2631
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
At orangelaunchradio.com

2632
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Coming by vognetwork.com

01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000

Again that's vognetwork.com

2637
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
If you're a podcast listener, sorry

2638
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Can't check into the show yet

2639
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That's all I'll say about that

2640
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Oh, by the way

2641
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I think I should post the picture of the kitty cats kissing

2642
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Outside of your

2643
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Oh, the strays out in the neighborhood

2644
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yeah, that was cute

2645
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
So, alright

2646
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
We have some gaming news here

2647
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
With rapid fire news

2648
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I do want to put out a last call for any tweets

2649
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You guys want us to talk about tonight

2650
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I'm gonna get to the foogle question of the week in a minute here too

2651
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And I think DarkSakura is in her way to opening up the mail bags

2652
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You don't have a lot of time left there

2653
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But let's do some rapid fire news, Loki

2654
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Sorry, I was looking up US Open

2655
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Results

2656
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Since when were you a tennis fan?

2657
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's not golf

2658
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm stupid

2659
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Well, no, fair enough

2660
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
This is also tennis

2661
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
No, but

2662
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
My grandpa watches it a lot

2663
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
We went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue

2664
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And he was watching it

2665
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
There was this amateur

2666
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
17 year old guy

2667
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Who was just out shooting Tiger Woods

2668
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Which I thought was hilarious

2669
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods

2670
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Tiger Woods ended up 3 over par

2671
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
For the 3 day course

2672
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I don't remember the guys name

2673
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Anyways, sorry

2674
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So let's talk Journey

2675
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Journey

2676
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Don't stop

2677
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
The journey was pretty awesome

2678
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And of course

2679
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
The developer, that game company

2680
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Is now gonna go and self publish

2681
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Their next game

2682
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And they've got

2683
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
5.5 million dollars

2684
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Of capital from Benchmark Capital

2685
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Mitch Lasky

2686
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And

2687
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
They're gonna try to publish

2688
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Their game on multiple platforms

2689
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Possibly PC

2690
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And I guess

2691
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
They haven't announced

2692
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Which platform the game's gonna be on

2693
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But I'm sure it'll be awesome

2694
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Also should note that

2695
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet

2696
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
But I kinda hinted at it

2697
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
On Twitter as well

2698
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
That Sony will be releasing

2699
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
On Playstation 3 a Journey compilation

2700
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Now

2701
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
There's only one Journey game

2702
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
To believe that it's Journey, Flower, and

2703
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Flow on disc

2704
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Sadly not the 80's

2705
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Game starring the super band

2706
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Although that would be awesome

2707
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey

2708
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
On top of that, you can throw in the music

2709
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
In there as well

2710
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Well it's funny to me though

2711
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Flower and all that is good

2712
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But the Journey

2713
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Why would you release this disc?

2714
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Because people can't go online to download it

2715
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Or they're not connected

2716
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Without being connected

2717
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
You're not really playing Journey

2718
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
That's the problem

2719
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
You're not taking the true Journey

2720
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
You're like backseat driver

2721
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know

2722
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah I know

2723
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's a cash grab

2724
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Journey still is a fantastic game

2725
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
But if you're playing it and not being online

2726
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Then I think you kinda miss the point

2727
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And that's where the other games

2728
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Like Flower and stuff become

2729
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Journey really needs to be on the Vita

2730
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Because that would be amazing

2731
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best

2732
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Racing games I've ever played

2733
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Think about it

2734
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
PlayStation Home would be interesting

2735
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
On the Vita as well

2736
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I don't know if I'd play it though

2737
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But I would probably play it more on the Vita

2738
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Than I would on the PS3

2739
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Anyways, so let's talk Minecraft

2740
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet

2741
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And there was a patch that was released

2742
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Earlier, well Friday

2743
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
The Secret Patch Friday

2744
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
There's actually a bug fix patch right now

2745
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
They didn't really do a whole lot

2746
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
As far as any of the updates to the game

2747
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes

2748
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
They added an auto save feature

2749
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So you can set it up to automatically save

2750
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Every 15 minutes or 2 hours

2751
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Or

2752
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I guess up to 2 hours

2753
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
They've also added a coordinate system

2754
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
To the map, which is kinda good

2755
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
That's good

2756
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is

2757
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Exactly

2758
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Also, they took away the dupe glitch

2759
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So you can't dupe items anymore

2760
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Some issues with clay not generating in your maps

2761
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Which is a big no-no

2762
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
So they finally fixed that

2763
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
It can actually craft stuff with clay

2764
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Also some framerate drops

2765
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Stuff not spawning

2766
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix

2767
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
So I sent them a message

2768
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire

2769
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And switch to the third person camera

2770
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That faces the front of you

2771
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
You don't see the fire

2772
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
But you'll see it from the back

2773
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
If you do that

2774
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It's a one way fire

2775
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And then I guess

2776
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Here's the other thing I didn't realize too

2777
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
They set a fix for awaiting approval

2778
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Showing all the time on some signs

2779
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I've seen that happen

2780
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved

2781
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
They don't

2782
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That's weird

2783
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Um

2784
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I want to point out some comments from chat

2785
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Clover Nikon is in chat saying

2786
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
All the children at the school I work at

2787
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Play the Minecraft demo

2788
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And I'm like, well what age?

2789
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
8-10

2790
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Which seems kind of young, but it's cool

2791
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's a great game for kids

2792
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
It's pretty awesome

2793
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I do like this

2794
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
The ability they turn

2795
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Or you can enable or disable the tool tips

2796
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time

2797
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And he's seen all this stuff already

2798
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And it'll be just like, hey

2799
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah blah blah

2800
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I'm like, yes I know, I built a giant

2801
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Volcano out of Obsidian

2802
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian

2803
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
It's just, I don't know, a little

2804
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Annoying sometimes

2805
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games

2806
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
When I was 12, or maybe 11

2807
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We used to go to the lab at the junior high

2808
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school

2809
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers

2810
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
We would play Scorched Earth

2811
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
It's epic

2812
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Scorched Earth is still epic

2813
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And what was it, Tank 256? There was another one

2814
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Just like a Tank 256 or something like that

2815
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
VGA Tank, I don't know, there was another one

2816
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That is a game right there that needs it

2817
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
That would be the perfect Facebook game

2818
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
If you think about it

2819
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Because it's not something that you take turns

2820
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
It's a game that you take turns in

2821
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And so, why not have it where

2822
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You would play Scorched Earth on Facebook

2823
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And I am not talking about

2824
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Fucking Worms

2825
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Inspired by Scorched Earth

2826
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I am talking about Scorched Motherfucking Earth

2827
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Right? Exactly

2828
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
So that would be pretty awesome

2829
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
There will be an update

2830
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Though for Minecraft, the next update

2831
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That's supposed to add pistons

2832
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And that fun stuff

2833
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That's sometime in July

2834
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I can't wait

2835
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Do you realize, literally in one week

2836
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
We're getting a Skyrim expansion

2837
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
You may not be in Minecraft

2838
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
For very long

2839
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Do you realize in one week

2840
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's the 10th anniversary of our show

2841
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
That's Bethesda's present to us

2842
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Naturally, that expansion is coming out on my birthday

2843
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
So it's Bethesda's present to me

2844
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
The guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim

2845
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You really can't

2846
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
You can never play enough Skyrim

2847
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And then finally

2848
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Tank Wars

2849
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Thank you Jim Sally

2850
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I think that was the one I was talking about

2851
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Finally, Penny Arcade

2852
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Their brand new game is going to be coming out

2853
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Not on Xbox Live Arcade

2854
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
But actually on PC, Mac

2855
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
On Steam

2856
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And Xbox Live Indie Games

2857
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
It's coming out on June 25th

2858
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th

2859
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
But they wait until July seems dumb

2860
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Which sounds great to me

2861
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And the game itself looks awesome

2862
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I wasn't a huge fan of the

2863
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Adventure game style that the first one had

2864
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But this one looks

2865
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Straight up

2866
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
2D Final Fantasy game

2867
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So I may have to pick this up

2868
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I just hope it doesn't

2869
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Require too much knowledge of the other games

2870
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Sorry, I was queuing something up here

2871
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I don't know, I zoned out when you

2872
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Mentioned Minecraft

2873
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Kirby

2874
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Thank you for ruining it Dark Soccer

2875
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I appreciate that

2876
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I was going to play the music here

2877
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And talk about

2878
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
That's right, there's a Kirby 20th Anniversary Collection coming out

2879
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
You may have already known that

2880
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
But Kirby

2881
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
20th Anniversary is going to include

2882
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Now this is the Wii game

2883
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That's kind of like the Mario game

2884
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
It was announced back in April

2885
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
But now we know what's actually going to be in it

2886
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Kirby's Dream Land

2887
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Kirby's Dream Land 2

2888
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Kirby's Adventure

2889
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Kirby Super Star

2890
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Kirby's Dream Land 3

2891
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
There's also going to be a timeline

2892
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Whatever that is

2893
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I guess a poster or something

2894
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And a soundtrack

2895
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It launches in Japan on July 19th

2896
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
No North American information

2897
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
As of yet, but I'm sure it will be

2898
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Just in time for the holidays

2899
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I think they've said September

2900
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game

2901
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
On SNES

2902
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Which was the best one

2903
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'm giving this props because

2904
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It's not a port of a Virtual Console game

2905
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Because that's all the 20th Anniversary edition was

2906
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars

2907
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Ported onto the Wii

2908
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Literally game rips of it

2909
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
The disc rips were like 30 megs

2910
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It was literally the ROM

2911
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
From Super Nintendo

2912
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
This is at least more than one ROM

2913
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And they actually have to mink something

2914
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Well, Majesco

2915
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
The makers of Zumba Fitness

2916
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Which sells really well

2917
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And NBA Baller Beats

2918
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Oh, Snapples

2919
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
All right, NBA Baller Beats

2920
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Well, they've got another baller franchise

2921
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
That they've just acquired

2922
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
American Idol is a license they just got

2923
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I want to say, when American Idol first came out

2924
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Codemasters had it, then Konami had it

2925
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I remember the American Idol karaoke revolution games

2926
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Well now, I guess Konami lost it

2927
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Or gave it up

2928
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Because Majesco now has the license

2929
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
For American Idol

2930
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
No idea what they're going to do with that

2931
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I imagine a type of karaoke game

2932
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Would make some sense

2933
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you

2934
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
A bunch of compliments

2935
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You know what's kind of funny?

2936
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Konami is actually getting out of the music game

2937
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Genre completely

2938
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Aside from Joy Sound

2939
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
That they have coming out

2940
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Which is a game that's pretty fucking old

2941
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You know, I said for the 10th anniversary

2942
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
We should have a funeral for Bomani

2943
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And never talk about it again

2944
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
But I don't know

2945
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I don't want to do that

2946
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But it's true

2947
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
In the first year, there was nothing on the floor

2948
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
At E3 about Bomani

2949
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
The very least they should have done

2950
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Was put one of those DDRX3

2951
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Versus second mix

2952
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Machines in the Konami booth

2953
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It would have been at least cool

2954
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game

2955
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Which looks pretty awesome

2956
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Anyhow, lastly here for me

2957
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Mistwalker wants to make

2958
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
RPGs for the Wii U

2959
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But nothing planned yet

2960
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Mistwalker, of course, made

2961
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
The Last Story

2962
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Which is finally coming out here in America

2963
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Some of the games before that they did

2964
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey

2965
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
A criminally underrated 360 game

2966
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I need to play that game

2967
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey

2968
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Is that the 360 flopsied in Japan

2969
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3

2970
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
We would have had a sequel

2971
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I hate to say it, but it's so true

2972
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
It's just really unfortunate

2973
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG

2974
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I love that game

2975
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
A quote from designer

2976
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Takuya Matsumoto

2977
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
The development team and Sakaguchi-san

2978
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Are looking forward to making more

2979
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Especially for the Wii U because it has another screen

2980
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Right in front of you that will add another level

2981
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Of strategic elements into the action RPG

2982
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So we really are looking forward to it

2983
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
But we really haven't planned anything

2984
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
It seems like it's something you could

2985
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Easily do, your little menus

2986
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
You could even draw attack patterns

2987
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I could see role playing action games

2988
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Working very well with the Wii U

2989
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
As long as it's in capable hands

2990
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I think Mist Walker

2991
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Has done a lot of underrated stuff

2992
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Could be good if they decide to do it

2993
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Since apparently they are

2994
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Kind of married to Nintendo now

2995
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I didn't realize this, but

2996
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
They probably sold more of the last story

2997
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly

2998
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?

2999
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Well, I have a few things

3000
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
We have, first of all

3001
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
The amount of money the

3002
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at

3003
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
$5.1 million

3004
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
So all of that

3005
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
The final amount is

3006
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
$5,105,169.91

3007
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
In two weeks

3008
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
They basically blew

3009
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Their previous records from 2 and 3

3010
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Just out of the water

3011
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
So basically

3012
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
We had

3013
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
598,794 people buy

3014
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Make purchases

3015
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
With the average price being

3016
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
$8.53

3017
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And it said that Linux users paid

3018
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
More than anyone else at $12.51

3019
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Per transaction

3020
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And Windows users were paying the least

3021
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
At $7.97

3022
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
They always pay the least

3023
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Yeah

3024
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
But basically most of the purchases

3025
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Were made on PC

3026
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And then The Last of Us

3027
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Is going to

3028
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Not be out until 2013

3029
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Well, of course

3030
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That's when all the games are coming out now

3031
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Well, it was

3032
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Technically it's late 2012

3033
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Early 2013

3034
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
But that's

3035
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
What the Naughty Dog

3036
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Director

3037
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Directors, I should say

3038
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Said on Jimmy Fallon

3039
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And then Dance Central 2

3040
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It has a June DLC

3041
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It is

3042
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Um

3043
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I don't know who this person is

3044
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Eaz

3045
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Replay

3046
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And Nelly's Hot in Here

3047
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And Kat De Luna's Wine Up

3048
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Yeah, these are all songs

3049
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Well, I've heard the Hot in Here song, but I think it's awful

3050
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are

3051
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
So, uh

3052
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I don't care

3053
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Alrighty then

3054
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
What do we have for the week?

3055
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook

3056
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And Google Plus

3057
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Put it together and you get FOOGLE

3058
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Uh, this week's question

3059
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Has to do with the story we talked about earlier

3060
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
One of the stories we were talking about tonight was

3061
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
THQ being suspected of misleading investors

3062
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
On uDraw, which got us thinking

3063
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Although all of us may not be financial investors

3064
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money

3065
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Into our gaming habit

3066
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
When was a time that you felt

3067
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Misled by a gaming company

3068
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And, you know, we kept it a little bit vague on purpose

3069
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with

3070
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
There's a lot of interesting responses tonight

3071
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Let's start with Facebook tonight

3072
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Um, I'm gonna start with Rob D

3073
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
It's hard not to feel

3074
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Constantly misled by Capcom

3075
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Their works, and especially their long-running

3076
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Franchises, show that their developers

3077
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Care about their games and have passion

3078
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
However, we're promised so much

3079
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And all we ever get is nickeled and dimed

3080
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Zombie Princess says

3081
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
The ending of Mass Effect 3

3082
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
The whole series makes you think your choices

3083
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Will make a big difference

3084
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
In actuality, it doesn't matter at all

3085
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Locopoco says

3086
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
By Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3

3087
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Not Ultimate

3088
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Was gonna have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3

3089
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Then when I bought it

3090
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
All I got was a barebones fighter

3091
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Sold it back to GameStop two hours later

3092
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
That's two strikes against Capcom

3093
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Um, let's go to

3094
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Kareem J who says

3095
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Have to agree with the above poster and Capcom

3096
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
They hype up their franchises

3097
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Then release a boatload of DLC

3098
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Which should have been on the disc

3099
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Then to add a further kick in the balls

3100
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
They release a Game of the Year edition

3101
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one

3102
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
But if you're really into one of their franchises

3103
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You want the game on day one

3104
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
You can't help but feel like a sucker

3105
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Ouch

3106
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
That's three punches for Capcom

3107
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Joe G says

3108
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
GoldenEye Reloaded

3109
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Frankly, I thought Activision was gonna make the original GoldenEye 64

3110
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Pretty with some story

3111
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
A few new missions and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan

3112
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
This isn't the case

3113
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
They gutted the game, changed around the story

3114
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
To make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay

3115
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And they fucking took out the jumping mechanics

3116
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
You can vault over objects

3117
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
But it's clunky to say the least

3118
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Tyler M says

3119
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
There's been many times

3120
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
But nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore

3121
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I do remember being

3122
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Kind of let down by Spore

3123
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Spore wasn't

3124
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I think even Will Wright

3125
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Kind of said it best

3126
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
He just tried to accomplish too damn much

3127
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I don't think he said it that way, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there

3128
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Let's see

3129
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Let me try to wrap some of this up here

3130
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Clover N says

3131
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Driver was just awfully misleading

3132
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Thank heavens EB Games has a seven day return policy

3133
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
No questions asked

3134
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's Driver 3

3135
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
It's Driver with a three in it

3136
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It is very entertaining though on its own merits

3137
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It's Lulzy for about those first seven days

3138
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And then it's over

3139
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I remember when you bought that

3140
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It's still Lulzy way after that

3141
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It's one of those you have to keep going back to after a while

3142
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I need to go back to that

3143
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Shattered Hawk said

3144
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Mass Effect 3

3145
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
All the hours being drawn in by the story and characters

3146
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end

3147
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Fuck you BioWare

3148
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom

3149
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
For Mass Effect 3

3150
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Let's go over to the Google Plus

3151
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Uh oh

3152
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Only one response on Google Plus

3153
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
You know what that means about Google Plus

3154
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
No one's on it

3155
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
That's what it's starting to look like

3156
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
We have another little kick for Google Plus

3157
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Are you saying that Google Plus isn't the amazing thing

3158
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
That they had us

3159
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Let's believe that it was

3160
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I have more I want to say about this

3161
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
But I'm going to wait because there's another Google Plus story

3162
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Coming up in a minute

3163
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I want to say this about ActDeft

3164
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Who has Google Plus all to himself

3165
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And says I think there hasn't been a game yet

3166
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That has led to think or believe I've been misled

3167
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Into buying by a game company

3168
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I usually follow the word of other gamers

3169
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And consumers before plunging into

3170
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Buy a game

3171
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans

3172
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Believing that EA and BioWare have totally

3173
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Scammed them even if they didn't

3174
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
In parentheses

3175
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
So there you have it

3176
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
That's not really a third strike against BioWare

3177
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Pointing and laughing at the other people maybe

3178
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Looks like Capcom

3179
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Took the cake on that one

3180
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I can't say I blame the listeners there

3181
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom

3182
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Over the past couple of years

3183
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Maybe they'll redeem themselves if

3184
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3

3185
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
End up being really really good

3186
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I would still like to have that

3187
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Mega Man universe someday

3188
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Or the Mega Man Legends

3189
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
They're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing

3190
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
On top of that

3191
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I mean yes that was terrible

3192
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
However I didn't buy the game so that

3193
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Wouldn't have been my choice

3194
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
My choice would have to be Saints for the Third

3195
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And not as

3196
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I mean the game itself is a little misleading

3197
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Kind of eh

3198
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
The game itself is pretty fucking funny

3199
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I mean that's just a funny

3200
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Ass game

3201
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It is a fun game

3202
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
The DLC though on the other hand

3203
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Is fucking terrible

3204
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
It's just the expansion packs

3205
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
That they had I mean don't get me wrong

3206
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I understand the costumes that's a waste of money

3207
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
But the expansion packs

3208
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I was smart enough not to buy the season pass

3209
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Because I know well enough

3210
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
That you know what I'd rather

3211
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Pay extra money

3212
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And have each one of those expansion packs

3213
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Be for you know

3214
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Definitely good

3215
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Than to just pay twenty bucks

3216
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
And have them all be terrible

3217
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And thankfully I paid seven dollars

3218
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Bought the first expansion and it was fucking terrible

3219
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Rather reason the second expansion

3220
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Even more terrible than the first expansion

3221
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Third one

3222
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Hey we get Johnny Gapat

3223
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Except he's a giant mutant

3224
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And it's fucking terrible

3225
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So

3226
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Yeah I'm not

3227
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I feel a little ripped off by them

3228
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And also all the on disc

3229
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
DLC they have more on disc

3230
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
DLC than fucking Capcom does

3231
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
It's ridiculous they're still releasing

3232
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Stuff today that's on disc

3233
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And then they have a whole

3234
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Expansion that really could have been

3235
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
An expansion of the game but now they're

3236
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Gonna make it's own retail releases thirty bucks

3237
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I'm waiting on that one

3238
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I do want to play it because I like

3239
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
The Matrix and I like Saints Row the Third

3240
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
But I'm

3241
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Very cautious going into it

3242
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight

3243
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Blender agrees with Loki

3244
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Yes Loki Saints Row the Third

3245
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
DLC pissed me off

3246
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says

3247
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Bethesda got away with making the

3248
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
True ending a DLC with Fallout 3

3249
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I don't see a problem with Bioware

3250
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Doing it as well

3251
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
He makes a good point there about sometimes our

3252
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Attention spans we let

3253
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
One company get away with something but then

3254
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Don't let the other

3255
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com

3256
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Let's go back to some news

3257
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later

3258
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Maybe some emails

3259
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Let's go to Loki with news

3260
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Let's talk a little bit about

3261
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Retro and what their plans are

3262
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Apparently

3263
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Retro Games

3264
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It's been rumored for a while

3265
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Well they've come out and said

3266
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Hey we'd love to do a Zelda game

3267
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And people started asking them

3268
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Hey what's Retro working on?

3269
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Because you know

3270
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You're not really saying anything about them

3271
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
And

3272
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Of course Miyamoto

3273
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Basically saying

3274
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
In terms of them working on a Zelda game

3275
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's not out of the question

3276
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
But

3277
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
You know

3278
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Right now they're

3279
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Incredibly busy with other things

3280
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Then of course they said traditionally I think the Zelda team

3281
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Has always had close contact with anyone

3282
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Who's working on a Zelda game

3283
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Traditionally

3284
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Except for maybe in the CDI days

3285
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Where they did not have close contact

3286
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
With people that were working on that game

3287
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
At least they probably

3288
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Distanced themselves

3289
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Ever since then

3290
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
That's why Nintendo has had a close relationship

3291
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Yeah

3292
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Of course they're saying you know

3293
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Retro is too busy

3294
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
For that sort of thing right now

3295
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
You know saying that they're

3296
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Working on something else

3297
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
And you know very busy right now

3298
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
But I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is

3299
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
That they're working on

3300
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game

3301
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright

3302
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But

3303
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I'm kind of curious to see if they are

3304
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Making a Zelda game

3305
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Could they be doing the next gen Zelda game

3306
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Because if you think about you know the next gen type

3307
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Zelda game for the Wii U

3308
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Because Nintendo hasn't really worked in

3309
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Next gen stuff I don't know if Retro's really

3310
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Gotten their feet with it

3311
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I don't know

3312
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
We'll see

3313
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Alright well I mentioned a minute ago we could come back

3314
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
And talk about Google Plus

3315
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
This is not a good thing for the service

3316
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
PopCap and

3317
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Wuga Games

3318
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
They're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform

3319
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Wuga already shut down

3320
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Monster World

3321
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Around May 1st

3322
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz

3323
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
From the service this week

3324
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I think it's already happened

3325
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
They're going to quote redeploy our resources

3326
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
To other adaptations of Bejeweled

3327
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I think that's their nice way of saying

3328
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Fucking no one's playing it on Google Plus

3329
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
So we'd rather do the phones and

3330
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
You know the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at

3331
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Wuga said

3332
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
They decided to

3333
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Decided to remove certain games from Google Plus

3334
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Because we have had a much

3335
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Larger following on Facebook

3336
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And they are active users

3337
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So goodbye Bubble Island and Diamond Dash

3338
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Those are leaving on July 1st

3339
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
PopCap does say Google is

3340
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
A valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA

3341
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And will continue to develop for Google

3342
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Platforms, that probably means Android

3343
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I think also maybe Chrome

3344
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration

3345
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
With games and stuff like that

3346
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Chrome has a bunch of the

3347
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Sort of add-ons with it too with games

3348
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Which is strange that

3349
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
You know it doesn't

3350
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
That that won't therefore

3351
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Integrate into Google Plus automatically

3352
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
But maybe it does

3353
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I don't know

3354
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I remember seeing ads for Google Plus

3355
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Like at the movies and stuff

3356
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
They really tried to push this and

3357
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
People just aren't taking the bait

3358
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
And I'm not sure I totally

3359
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Understand why I mean is it the

3360
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Interface is because maybe it's

3361
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Maybe people don't like the oversimplification

3362
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Next to Facebook I do see

3363
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Some dedicated Google Plus people

3364
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
There are definitely some people I see that use

3365
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Google Plus more than they use Facebook

3366
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And I have to admit I get so

3367
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Sick of Facebook shit

3368
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
There is so much shit on Facebook

3369
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I don't need in my life I really don't

3370
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
You know there's a lot of toxicness there

3371
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
There's a lot of just

3372
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
There's a lot of stuff

3373
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
On there and I'm not saying Google Plus is

3374
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Any better in that regard because I think

3375
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
If everybody was on Google Plus instead of

3376
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Facebook it would just be the same thing in

3377
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Reverse but

3378
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I don't know

3379
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'm just surprised more

3380
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
People didn't run away

3381
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
To Google Plus in a way

3382
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Well for a while people did

3383
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And I was like oh everyone else is still on

3384
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Facebook because people needed attention

3385
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It's true it is absolutely

3386
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
True people needed attention

3387
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
They went back to Facebook I will totally

3388
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Admit in some ways that's why I've still

3389
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Posted on Facebook it is it's

3390
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Been a great promotional tool for the show

3391
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Now I will say this

3392
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I think there's a huge

3393
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And I hope to hell

3394
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
This doesn't go away because I think there's

3395
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
A huge potential to do something great

3396
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
With Google Hangout

3397
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And some of the interviews and some of that and I think

3398
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
There's some cool untapped stuff there

3399
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
So I hope they don't just close Google Plus

3400
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
All together and you know what I don't

3401
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Care if we only have like five fans on

3402
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Google Plus that's five fans

3403
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That we have

3404
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So you know I don't want to like stop supporting

3405
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Google Plus or whatever but you know it is

3406
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
The fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook

3407
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
But MySpace

3408
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Fuck them

3409
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Fuck MySpace we don't care about that

3410
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Fuck MySpace

3411
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I still get messages on MySpace I'm like

3412
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I don't even know where my page is anymore

3413
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Let alone

3414
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
All these artists hey listen to my shit

3415
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I'm like no

3416
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Zethur in our chatroom says r.i.p. Google Plus

3417
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Well yeah

3418
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I mean the game's leaving, Bejeweled leaving

3419
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
That's when your PopCap

3420
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Games are leaving

3421
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
It's really not a good sign

3422
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Yikes

3423
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Alright anyhow

3424
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Let's move on with some more news

3425
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
DarkSaga

3426
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Who pays attention to news?

3427
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
How about some stuff about Starcraft

3428
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
That'll make people perk up

3429
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm

3430
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Is 99% done

3431
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
The lead designer Dustin

3432
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Browder basically said

3433
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And this is a quote

3434
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
99% done but that last 1% is a bitch

3435
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
So

3436
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
They're saying basically he says

3437
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
He could do a playthrough

3438
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm sorry then it's not really 99% done

3439
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That was something he said to get quoted

3440
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
May I finish?

3441
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
He said they can do a playthrough

3442
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
And are like wow this is great

3443
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Or you can do a playthrough

3444
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And then find more items to fix

3445
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
So basically it's like they're in that last

3446
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Beta stage

3447
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Or I should say alpha stage

3448
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Where they're finding those little last minute things

3449
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
It sounds like it's all about your tweaking

3450
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Which really is like the last little bit

3451
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
So you're like 90% done

3452
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Yeah

3453
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
But um

3454
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
So that's the only thing holding it back

3455
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
At least they're waiting until it's done

3456
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
What exactly do they have to do?

3457
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
They have the game done

3458
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
They're adding an expansion pack

3459
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Starcraft 2

3460
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I don't know if I want my unit right here

3461
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Do you play Starcraft 2?

3462
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
They are doing some more units and campaign analysis

3463
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Here's the thing

3464
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Starcraft 2 has to be balanced right

3465
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
There is so much

3466
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Esports and competitive gaming

3467
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And things that go into something like Starcraft 2

3468
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
It has to be right

3469
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So I understand there's gonna be some

3470
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Extensive testing that goes on with this

3471
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Because they cannot afford to have a fucked up

3472
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Balance in Starcraft 2

3473
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Literally

3474
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Hundreds of thousands of dollars go up for contests

3475
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Over Starcraft 2

3476
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
This game is huge in the competitive industry

3477
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Especially though with all the shit over Diablo 3

3478
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
You better bet your ass they're gonna

3479
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Really put effort into this

3480
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I mean really

3481
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
If you look at the competitive gaming universe

3482
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
It's Starcraft 2, League of Legends

3483
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
That's where it's at right now

3484
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
You know it's these type of games

3485
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
It's not so much the shooters these days

3486
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I mean yeah there's some of that still don't get me wrong

3487
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
But it's a huge part

3488
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
It's Starcraft, Warcraft Arena

3489
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
To some extent, League of Legends is huge

3490
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It keeps getting bigger too

3491
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Anyhow

3492
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Few more stories for you guys

3493
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
In the mailbag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com

3494
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And Skype line in a little bit

3495
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
But for first, Loki

3496
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Well something I was talking a little bit about earlier

3497
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Things that Nintendo says that they're doing

3498
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And then

3499
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Doesn't

3500
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
We just talked about Starcraft 2

3501
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And you know similar type of gameplay style

3502
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
RTS, Pikmin 3

3503
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
They're not doing online multiplayer

3504
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
A brand new system that's coming out

3505
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
HD

3506
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
And they're not fucking doing online multiplayer

3507
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Because they said

3508
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Well we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around

3509
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So it would be hard for us to track all those

3510
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Accurately on other systems

3511
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Uh

3512
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
No

3513
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
That doesn't make any sense to me

3514
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I'm sorry

3515
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Because if you think about it

3516
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
There are multiplayer RTS games

3517
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Out there

3518
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
There are multiplayer console RTS games out there

3519
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I just fucking named some in the competitive space

3520
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Hello, Starcraft, League of Legends

3521
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And you can't fucking

3522
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I mean

3523
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around

3524
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
At one time, but

3525
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Not like billions of

3526
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Pikmin running around at the same time

3527
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Ever heard of the Zerg?

3528
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
It's a big

3529
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Yeah, so it just seems like a

3530
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Piss poor excuse for that

3531
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I mean, you have a launch title

3532
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system

3533
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Your system finally gets online

3534
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U

3535
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Nintendo fucking gets online

3536
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But no, they don't fucking get online

3537
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
They don't at all

3538
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
It's no online multiplayer

3539
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
You need to be online

3540
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
And send pictures of your penis to your friends

3541
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Yay

3542
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
But there's co-op local multiplayer

3543
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again

3544
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's just all the online

3545
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Functionality that they've shown right now

3546
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
It's the same functionality we have

3547
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
The 3DS and the Wii

3548
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Send messages back and forth

3549
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And see what your friends are playing

3550
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
That's not very functional

3551
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Can fucking do on the 3DS with SwapNote

3552
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Or on the Wii

3553
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Wii has online gameplay

3554
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
We had online gameplay with Mario Kart

3555
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart

3556
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Why can't you do online gameplay for

3557
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Pikmin

3558
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Oh, I don't know

3559
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
We've never coded online games before

3560
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
What's the deal?

3561
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Oh, but we have local multiplayer

3562
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Could it have anything to do with the fact

3563
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
That the bandwidth that they have to send

3564
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Data to tablet or something

3565
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Is fucking things up

3566
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Because they have to keep things synced between the tablet

3567
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
And the system

3568
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
And then also

3569
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Other people's systems

3570
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I don't know really how it works

3571
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Because I'm not a developer

3572
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
But it just seems like a piss-poor excuse

3573
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Just saying

3574
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
And they even said

3575
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
One of the other things was that the Wii U

3576
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
The whole idea was almost scrapped

3577
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Because of the price concerns

3578
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
They were saying sometimes

3579
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
They almost gave up on the idea of additional screen

3580
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
This was due over the concern

3581
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Of expected high cost

3582
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
It may not have been feasible

3583
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
To create this and sell it

3584
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
At a reasonable price point for the consumers

3585
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Um

3586
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And of course they haven't said

3587
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
What the reasonable price point is yet

3588
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Maybe now it's more reasonable

3589
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
To pay $400 for a system

3590
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Because there's tablets out there that cost that much

3591
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
But

3592
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I guess it's just

3593
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
We're gonna have to wait and see

3594
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
You know, how much the system's gonna cost

3595
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
And if it's too much

3596
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
It's gonna flop

3597
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
If it's the right price point, it'll do okay

3598
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
But

3599
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I don't know

3600
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Alright, moving on to a story

3601
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
About a game a lot of people are looking forward to

3602
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
We talked a lot about the Wii U tonight

3603
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
And not enough about this game

3604
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Because this game looks so awesome, I can't wait to play it

3605
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It's Ni no Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch

3606
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
What's amazing is that Namco Bandai

3607
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Is actually keeping that name in America

3608
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
It's going to be called Ni no Kuni here

3609
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Now they did change the subtitle

3610
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Wrath of the White Witch has obviously

3611
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Been translated into English

3612
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
But yeah, the game is still planned

3613
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
It is, if you're not sure what this game is

3614
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
It's the whole level 5

3615
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And Studio Ghibli

3616
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Collaboration, which has been out in Japan already

3617
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
For a little bit

3618
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I don't remember when it's finally coming out here

3619
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I think it's towards the end of the year?

3620
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
2013, yet again

3621
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
The reasons why they kept the name the same

3622
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I love this, this is

3623
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee

3624
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Quote, we really wanted to make sure

3625
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
That all the fans who had come to know the game

3626
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
As Ni no Kuni would still be able

3627
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
To recognize it and find it

3628
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Having a localized name of a game, you know

3629
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Like Fight Quest 6, even though

3630
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
It could be more westernized, that doesn't quite mean

3631
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
That it has the same feel as the original game

3632
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
That's why the name of the game

3633
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Stayed with Ni no Kuni

3634
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
There's a sound to it that feels right

3635
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And the subtitle was of course localized

3636
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
To Wrath of the White Witch

3637
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Versus the original Japanese title

3638
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
You know what that means though, right?

3639
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Second Country

3640
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Ni no Kuni, Second Country

3641
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country

3642
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You know?

3643
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I'm glad they did keep that name

3644
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell

3645
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
With a title that isn't English

3646
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Then why not?

3647
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Yeah

3648
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I think that Dew Prism had a different name

3649
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Because I had been freaking looking forward

3650
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
To hoping that Dew Prism would be out

3651
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And then I hear about Threads of Fate

3652
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
And I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?

3653
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Speaking of Fight Quest 6

3654
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I really do think that they should bring over

3655
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3

3656
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Which is what I would call

3657
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Toeball 3

3658
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Because they really need a Toeball 3

3659
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Because Toeball 2 is awesome

3660
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Just saying

3661
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag

3662
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Every week you guys email us

3663
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3664
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
And DarkSakura

3665
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Dives in the mailbag head first

3666
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Surrounds herself

3667
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
In the hundreds of thousands of emails

3668
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
We get every week

3669
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
And pulls out a lucky few to read here on air

3670
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3671
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That's exactly what happens

3672
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Well, we've got a few

3673
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And there's one actually that we got

3674
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
From Redertainment

3675
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
And just to say right now

3676
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I've read it and I'm reading your thing

3677
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
And I'll give you feedback

3678
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback

3679
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Oh, it was an off-air question

3680
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Okay, sure, I'll peek later

3681
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
So

3682
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Anyway, this one

3683
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Dear O.L.R.

3684
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I first have to say that I love this show

3685
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to

3686
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Anyway

3687
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Cancel your plans

3688
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about

3689
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
O.L.R. memory I have

3690
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Aside from getting pretty close to

3691
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Dark Tetsuya

3692
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Is that the day my father passed away

3693
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
June 25th, 2003 from cancer

3694
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
You guys were there for me

3695
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I remember we were holding a show that day

3696
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
And I had delivered the news that he passed on

3697
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
And to help me get through it

3698
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
You guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirit

3699
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Ever since then

3700
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
You guys have been a huge part of my life

3701
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Thanks O.L.R. for the memories and keep up the good work

3702
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl

3703
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Wow, that's heavy

3704
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Like, you know

3705
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I think we sometimes forget

3706
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
That like people have their lives

3707
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And their drama and the things that they're going through

3708
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
And yet O.L.R. is kind of something

3709
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
That stayed constant through 10 years

3710
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And I think some people have kind of, you know

3711
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
It's really weird to say

3712
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I mean, not in a bad way

3713
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
But to hear something like that is very powerful

3714
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I mean, when somebody's

3715
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Looking for normalcy

3716
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights

3717
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
To help them get through it

3718
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Like I said

3719
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
We don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners

3720
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
To feel that kind of power

3721
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
That took one person in this case

3722
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Very

3723
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I'm glad we could help

3724
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That's all I can really say

3725
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Same here

3726
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Alright, the next

3727
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
This is the one from Reddertainment I can read

3728
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Greetings Omni Beings

3729
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Attached to this email is a picture

3730
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I took at a Best Buy on Saturday

3731
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
It's of the PC version

3732
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Of Final Fantasy XIV

3733
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
The game is drastically reduced

3734
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Not only does the price sticker read 20

3735
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
The red sticker on the game

3736
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Means the game is reduced to $10

3737
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Still, even at $10, I question whether

3738
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
This game was worth my money

3739
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I posted this picture on Twitter

3740
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Asking if the game was worth my money

3741
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
The only reply I received told me

3742
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
That the Wolverine movie game next to

3743
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing

3744
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
What does it say

3745
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
About Final Fantasy XIV that I

3746
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
The gamer who cuts his teeth on

3747
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII

3748
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Would question buying this game

3749
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And when asked, people replied

3750
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
That I should buy a movie tie-in instead

3751
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Stay black Reddertainment

3752
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
This message has been brought to you by

3753
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Locally produced microbrew beer

3754
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Which is what I bought instead of a game

3755
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
You could take a risk

3756
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
That the 2.0 version

3757
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Is going to kick a lot of ass

3758
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
One thing we didn't talk about this week

3759
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
There was a blog post on Sony's blog

3760
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
That was still happening on the PlayStation 3

3761
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Whenever the 2.0 version happens

3762
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
There's going to be a beta test later in the year

3763
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet

3764
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I just, I mean, rebooting an MMO

3765
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
And expecting people to care

3766
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I mean, it's a big

3767
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Risk

3768
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
But if you think about it, if you buy the game now

3769
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
For $10, you're not going to have to buy it again

3770
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
When the 2.0 upgrade comes out

3771
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
At least on PC

3772
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I just hope that means free to play

3773
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Final Fantasy XI

3774
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I wish those rumors about the Vita

3775
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Final Fantasy XI were true

3776
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Oh god, dream on internet

3777
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Okay

3778
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
We have two more actually

3779
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But I never remember saying this

3780
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
So, okay

3781
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I agree with Dark Soccer 100%

3782
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
When she implied that Nintendo

3783
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Redeveloped Super Mario Bros. U

3784
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
With a Crysis or Unreal type

3785
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Graphics engine and put Mario in

3786
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Real world 2D side scrolling

3787
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
environment, oh, with real skies, trees

3788
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
And weather effects, real gold coins

3789
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Abuse the power of the Wii U

3790
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I think I had said that it should

3791
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Be like, remember how Fantasy Zone

3792
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
The Sega Ages

3793
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
2500

3794
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Is, where it's all 3D

3795
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
But it's side scrolling

3796
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I think that's what I had

3797
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Said

3798
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
But

3799
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I don't know that I would want it to be

3800
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Like Crysis or Unreal

3801
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I just want it to be

3802
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
2D side scrolling

3803
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D

3804
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I think more like a game like

3805
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night

3806
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Kinda had 2D, but a little bit of 3D thrown in

3807
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I don't know

3808
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And we had one last meal that came in

3809
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
How about Paper Mario? That's a good example too

3810
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Came in last minute

3811
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And dear lord, sir

3812
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Please spell out your words

3813
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Well, sent from my iPod

3814
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
That's what's happening

3815
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I type out all of my words fully

3816
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
On my iPhone

3817
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So if I can do it, you can do it

3818
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And I'm lazier

3819
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Hey lord of the Orange Lounge

3820
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
What's your most shameful moment

3821
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
In video games?

3822
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about

3823
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Mine is Star Wars Galaxies

3824
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
The hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard

3825
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Just so I could make

3826
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Hundreds of stem packs

3827
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Because I want to be a medic

3828
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Just that bad

3829
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
That stupid game was such a let down

3830
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Tons of money and time

3831
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Never swinging a fucking light saber once

3832
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Kisses, Jim Sally

3833
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I may not want my co-workers to know about my

3834
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
World of Warcraft podcast

3835
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Actually, a lot of them already

3836
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Do know about that

3837
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
They don't get it, but they think it's

3838
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Interesting

3839
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work

3840
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I mean

3841
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
You have to remember

3842
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I work primarily

3843
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Not exclusively, but primarily

3844
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Middle-aged women

3845
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
So when I say

3846
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
When I say that I'm into video games

3847
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I usually get a, oh

3848
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
My son's really into that

3849
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Type of reaction

3850
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
We've got a few fellow geeks at my work

3851
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
But one of them is into Supernatural

3852
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Like I am

3853
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And you know, Becky works where I do

3854
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And she doesn't play games

3855
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Well, she plays R.I.P.M. but she sings

3856
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I have another friend that plays Xbox

3857
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Some of the people I talk to on the phone play games

3858
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
The person I work

3859
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Closest with at my work

3860
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Who's another trainer and her and I are the same

3861
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Subject matter experts

3862
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I will say this

3863
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I adore her very much

3864
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
We work great together, we're a great team

3865
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
But I do love the fact that even though

3866
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
She may not totally get all my game talk

3867
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
She kind of is a closet nerd

3868
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show

3869
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
But it's not like you guys know her anyway

3870
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
She's totally into comic books

3871
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Oh, I totally know who that is

3872
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
But no, she was telling me about

3873
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Oh no, before you go see the Avengers

3874
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
You need to go see Captain America

3875
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Because there's parts of the story

3876
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That are in there that you're not going to see

3877
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
In the Avengers

3878
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
She likes to tell me about

3879
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
How her and her son read comic books

3880
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Together, that used to be a bonding thing for them

3881
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
She's talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons

3882
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Together with them, and I thought that was just neat

3883
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
It was neat

3884
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of

3885
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Unless you're a DC fan

3886
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
That's why

3887
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Just to bring this back to an empowering moment

3888
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
That's why I love VoG

3889
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
The Voice of Geeks Network

3890
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek

3891
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Let your voice be heard

3892
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Nope

3893
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway

3894
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
About what, VoG?

3895
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Shame on you

3896
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
No, about people knowing what my fandoms are

3897
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You've made a career out of it, woman

3898
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
At least a nighttime career

3899
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Well, I mean, but I really am

3900
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Completely happy

3901
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You know, I like

3902
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
My nerdy stuff makes me happy

3903
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
And, you know

3904
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like

3905
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, I play games

3906
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Play Mass Effect right now, yo

3907
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I got, you know, I actually

3908
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
One of our reps was like, so what you're playing for this weekend?

3909
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Oh, sleeping video games

3910
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And like, oh, what are you playing?

3911
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I'm playing Mass Effect, really? I just finished that

3912
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
You know, I have to do the conversation

3913
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Back to work

3914
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
But, you know, I get that

3915
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I was like, oh, I play my Wii

3916
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I took one of my co-workers

3917
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
To the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco

3918
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
We drove over there

3919
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
It was awesome

3920
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
She had a blast

3921
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Anyway

3922
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
She's also a fan of this page on Facebook

3923
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
One of my co-workers, yeah

3924
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Do you be a fan of my page?

3925
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Well, you can go like Jamie, too

3926
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
But I do want to say this

3927
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
The Orange Lounge radio page is

3928
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
A part of 500

3929
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Do you think for our 10th anniversary

3930
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
You could get us 500 likes on Facebook?

3931
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Like, I could go, oh, we want

3932
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
1000 likes on Facebook and 5000

3933
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Of course we fucking want 5000 likes on

3934
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Facebook, but I'm gonna keep the goal reasonable

3935
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Let's go

3936
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
For 500 fans on Facebook

3937
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Two more fans before the next episode

3938
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
That would be great

3939
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Alright, is that it for emails?

3940
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yeah, that's all I'm gonna read anyway

3941
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Send us your emails

3942
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3943
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast

3944
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Next week

3945
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Meanwhile, let's get angsty

3946
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
My FU, I have a few FUs

3947
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
But I also have a thank you

3948
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
My first FU goes

3949
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Towards

3950
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
This trend lately

3951
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Of people having, like, you know

3952
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
A Camry or some shit

3953
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Up on these huge ass wheels

3954
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
With, like, bicycle spokes in them

3955
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
You know what I'm talking about, Rob?

3956
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
They're like wheels

3957
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
That are, like, way too big

3958
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
For the car

3959
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
And the spokes

3960
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Are kinda like wagon wheels

3961
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Except, they have spokes

3962
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
You don't get it

3963
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's like, what the fuck are you doing to your car?

3964
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And it's like, it doesn't add any

3965
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
It, first of all

3966
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It reduces

3967
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
It, um

3968
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Decreases their gas mileage

3969
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Because they have higher wind resistance

3970
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
It adds no grip to the ground

3971
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
And it's just not at all good

3972
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
For their suspension

3973
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
It's stupid, I mean

3974
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
You know what broke my heart, Rob?

3975
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
You know what really broke my heart?

3976
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
The 1970 Dodge Challenger

3977
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Which is one of my favorite muscle cars

3978
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
With the fucking wheels like that

3979
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I wanted to kill a bitch

3980
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I would have cut them so hard

3981
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Now, I think that I would just fall over dead

3982
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
If I happened to see one in the 72 Chevelle SS

3983
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I mean, that would murder me

3984
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And then, there were

3985
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
There was just the

3986
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
The people, this is the other thing

3987
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
People try to sneak around you

3988
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Without saying, excuse me

3989
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
When you don't see them, all you have to do is go

3990
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Excuse me, may I get by, please

3991
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
And I'm like

3992
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I'll step aside and be like, okay

3993
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
It's California in particular

3994
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Where people don't do that

3995
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And like, anywhere else that I've been

3996
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
People will tap me on the shoulder and say

3997
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Excuse me, may I move around

3998
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
But they don't do it here

3999
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't get why

4000
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
All you have to do is just speak to somebody

4001
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And not treat them like they're an inconvenience

4002
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
But I also

4003
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I love my mom

4004
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Because I have to direct an FU in her direction

4005
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
And you know, actually

4006
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I've got it in front of me on Facebook

4007
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I am going

4008
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Making adjustments in my diet

4009
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick

4010
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
And my mom says

4011
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I've lost 8 pounds in two weeks

4012
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And I ain't no vegan, I eat meat

4013
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Water weight

4014
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol

4015
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
And then

4016
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
You're a bitch

4017
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
But that's why we love you

4018
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And I appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy

4019
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
And eat food that's good for me

4020
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
And lose a little bit of my extra bulk

4021
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Thanks mom slash sarcasm

4022
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And so

4023
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
It's just this thing with my mom

4024
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Basically

4025
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Anything that is not in her scope of reality

4026
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
She sort of just rejects it

4027
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
And substitutes it with her own version of reality

4028
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And in some places

4029
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
They call that insanity

4030
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
So I don't know if it's just a mom thing

4031
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
She just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view

4032
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So I guess this isn't

4033
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Oh I just noticed

4034
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I know look at that

4035
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
500 likes

4036
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Thank you whoever just liked us

4037
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I can't see who it is

4038
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
50 for every year of the podcast

4039
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Alright now let's do 600

4040
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Or no I want 666 now

4041
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Well to continue

4042
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Yes

4043
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
It's just that

4044
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Again I love my mom

4045
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
It's not exactly an FU

4046
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Really you know what I mean

4047
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Where you just go really really

4048
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
It's like that meme where the

4049
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Girl is like looking sideways and making the

4050
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Face which you can't see

4051
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So this is really good radio

4052
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
You have a lot of FUs to give tonight

4053
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Oh my thank you

4054
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods

4055
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Who let me

4056
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
And my small little purchase

4057
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Go through and said oh no you've only

4058
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Got a couple you go ahead of me

4059
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I have a bunch more than you

4060
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And I was like well thank you

4061
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
You have a nice day and she's like well you too

4062
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I hope you have a great evening

4063
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Bless her heart I hope she gets some tonight

4064
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Yeah

4065
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
But it just I'm glad that there's nice

4066
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Considerate people in the world

4067
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And there need to be it just takes one

4068
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Act of kindness to make sort of

4069
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
A ripple effect cause you know if you

4070
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
If you take that moment and make a difference

4071
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
In somebody else's day

4072
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference

4073
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
In somebody else's day that's all I'm saying

4074
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I'm done

4075
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Spent

4076
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Loki

4077
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Uh

4078
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I don't know I don't have anything

4079
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
FU to my throat being sore

4080
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
For a third week in a row

4081
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
She's not going away

4082
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
So I guess I gotta go see the doctor now

4083
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Cause it could

4084
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
No I don't know what it could be

4085
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Maybe allergies

4086
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
This is annoying

4087
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I have to make mine

4088
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Intentionally extremely vague

4089
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Tonight but FU

4090
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
To my fear of the

4091
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Uncertain and the

4092
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Uncomfortable probably causing

4093
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity

4094
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
That's all I'm gonna say

4095
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Alright

4096
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Really there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear

4097
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Nothing wrong with changing brands

4098
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
No that part's fun

4099
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Are you kidding?

4100
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
That's like

4101
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I know they might fit a little differently

4102
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Than your current brand

4103
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
That's the incentive to lose weight

4104
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
It's like Rob if you lose weight

4105
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
You can go buy new underwear

4106
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Yes

4107
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I meant like changing your brand

4108
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Oh

4109
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
They may fit a little weird in some places

4110
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Maybe a little too snug

4111
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
But it's a new opportunity

4112
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
They might be cheaper and better made

4113
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear

4114
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
On Orange Lawn's radio so I think we need to move on

4115
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I think it'll be a good idea

4116
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Please let's move on with something else

4117
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Let's talk about Harmonix and

4118
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
What they're planning on working on

4119
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
They actually have three more projects

4120
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Or three or more projects

4121
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
They're in the work right now

4122
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And none of them are Rock Band

4123
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Or Dance Central

4124
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
So that's pretty awesome

4125
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And

4126
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Of course they can't

4127
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Talk about it but

4128
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
At least they're coming out with something new

4129
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Eventually

4130
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Eventually

4131
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
But they said yeah

4132
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
They'll have some crazy stuff to talk about

4133
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Hopefully next year

4134
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Hopefully soon

4135
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Coming soon

4136
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Or not

4137
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Yes

4138
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Someday

4139
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Eventually

4140
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Alright let's move on

4141
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Moving on to

4142
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
One more story

4143
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
It's about Capcom

4144
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
And you gotta love this guy

4145
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
He's so animated

4146
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Yoshinori Ono

4147
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
He's the guy behind

4148
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
One of the producers of Street Fighter 4

4149
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
He's awesome

4150
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
He is awesome

4151
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
There's this interview going around

4152
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
That's on Eurogamer

4153
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
About how he did Street Fighter 4

4154
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Because he was working on Onimusha 4

4155
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
And he kept submitting a proposal

4156
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
For a new Street Fighter

4157
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
After Street Fighter 3 did not do so well

4158
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
But apparently enough fans

4159
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Pestered Capcom

4160
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
They kind of let him do it

4161
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I don't know if you forgot

4162
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
But he had this whole thing where

4163
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
He suffered from exhaustion

4164
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Legit

4165
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion

4166
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
He was just exhausted

4167
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I don't want to say retire

4168
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
But he had to really take a step back

4169
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
For a little bit

4170
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
What's interesting

4171
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
About having come back to work

4172
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
At Capcom

4173
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Nobody told me to take a rest

4174
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
When I returned to work

4175
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Capcom didn't even acknowledge

4176
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
That I'd been in the hospital

4177
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
There was no change in my schedule

4178
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I was at home for an entire week

4179
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Before the doctors allowed me to return to work

4180
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
When I returned to my desk

4181
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
There was a ticket to Rome waiting for me

4182
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
There's no mercy

4183
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Everyone in the company says

4184
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Ono-san we've been so worried about you

4185
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
We've been overwhelmed with things to do

4186
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer

4187
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
But then again when you made Street Fighter 4

4188
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Which is kind of making Capcom

4189
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
A lot of money right now I guess you can do that

4190
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
And that is kind of messed up

4191
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I mean I don't know

4192
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Is it just here in America

4193
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
That you can kind of get that

4194
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Like if you have an incident like that

4195
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I know if somebody at my work

4196
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Had a bad incident like that

4197
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
You would get what's called the work accommodation

4198
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Where you work a limited schedule

4199
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Whatever your doctor orders

4200
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Which I still have

4201
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
For several months

4202
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I took two weeks off

4203
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
And basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to

4204
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Which

4205
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Some people might sound like

4206
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Oh what a lazy

4207
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
But no this is like a legit diagnosed thing

4208
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Your doctor said she's got to do it

4209
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
It's related to an immunodeficiency issue

4210
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And I was also lacking in B12

4211
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And vitamin D

4212
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
And it's almost

4213
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
In some cases I've seen people

4214
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Compare it to narcolepsy

4215
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Where you start finding you'll be aware

4216
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Of yourself nodding off

4217
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
It's just overwhelming

4218
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Exhaustion where you hurt

4219
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
All the time

4220
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
It's horrible

4221
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass

4222
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls

4223
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Alright anyhow

4224
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
What is this

4225
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I guess Ono

4226
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Was continuing to talk

4227
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I thought this was a crazy quote

4228
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Was this a quote from Ono? I guess it was

4229
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Capcom was very good at squeezing

4230
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
People to the last drop of their

4231
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Blood to get work done

4232
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Ouch

4233
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
You know something else though

4234
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I think it's

4235
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
So they basically bought him a ticket to Rome

4236
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
To relax

4237
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
See now that is though

4238
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I would say understanding

4239
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
What they did and saying sorry here you go

4240
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Thanks for getting the product out

4241
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I know in Denmark they get a month off

4242
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Mandatory paid vacation

4243
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Finland too

4244
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Because they're you know

4245
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
A socialist democracy and they have the highest

4246
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Highest level of

4247
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Reported public happiness in the world

4248
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Just saying

4249
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Learn from this America

4250
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Alrighty

4251
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Ah

4252
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
That's it for my story there

4253
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I guess we're about ready to open up the skype line

4254
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
How's it sound when we open up the skype line?

4255
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
1877 Game OLR

4256
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4257
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And we'll get to the twitter topics

4258
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
In just a minute as well but I want to ask Loki

4259
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Surprise him here with any last minute stories

4260
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
He might possibly have for us

4261
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Just real quick there's going to be

4262
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
A different circle pad attachment

4263
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
That's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet

4264
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
It actually kind of conforms

4265
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
To the 3DS shell

4266
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
So it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS

4267
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So cool

4268
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And that'll be coming out I guess

4269
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
For 30 bucks

4270
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Soon

4271
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
So a little bit more expensive but

4272
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Pay for quality I guess

4273
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And then there's a retro game

4274
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
That's being put out

4275
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
On PC

4276
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
By developer JoyMashers

4277
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And it's a game called Oniken

4278
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Looks pretty awesome

4279
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Supposed to be coming out on

4280
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I guess Desura

4281
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
For $4.99

4282
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
And that's out uh

4283
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
It was actually out this coming Friday

4284
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
On the 22nd

4285
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And I guess um

4286
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Mac and Linux versions are coming out

4287
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Later on

4288
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
But the game looks a lot like Strider

4289
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
So

4290
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
It could be cool

4291
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Which Strider? NES Strider?

4292
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
NES Strider? Well I mean it's an

4293
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
NES styled game

4294
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
So it's like NES Strider but

4295
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I mean it sort of resembles Strider

4296
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
But not Commando you know generic

4297
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Futuristic action game

4298
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Alright the calls are coming in

4299
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
So let's go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Taunt Radio who's this?

4300
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
It's Shane

4301
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Hi Shane how are you?

4302
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Hello

4303
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
How are you?

4304
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I'm burning up and achy

4305
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
And tired

4306
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
For those that listen to Horde House

4307
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
How are you doing after the surgery?

4308
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Well

4309
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I'm not falling asleep

4310
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
In the middle of things as much

4311
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Yeah that was a hilarious moment by the way on the show

4312
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
If you didn't hear this week's Horde House

4313
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Shane fell asleep part way through the show

4314
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
It was amazing, amazing radio

4315
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Go check it out

4316
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It's because I was on uh

4317
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
What's that thing? Percocet

4318
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I'm still on it, only to get to sleep now

4319
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Not for pain stuff

4320
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
You even have comments in the chat room

4321
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
BlackWolf says is Shane awake?

4322
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I am

4323
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Um crap

4324
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I totally had what I was gonna say

4325
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And then I forgot because you interrupted me

4326
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I'm sorry well surely it was about Mass Effect

4327
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Percocet

4328
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Surely it was about Mass Effect

4329
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I honestly don't think it was

4330
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Which might

4331
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Shock everybody

4332
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
They replaced him after the surgery

4333
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
What? Nothing

4334
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Nothing? You're not a pod person

4335
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Was it E3? Was it something we talked about?

4336
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
No I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop

4337
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
So I got that

4338
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Indie bundle that had all those really good games

4339
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
For super cheap

4340
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
The most recent one

4341
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Sorry BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep

4342
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
That was good

4343
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
That was good

4344
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Yes the Humble Bundle

4345
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
And I started playing Bastion which you know

4346
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I heard so much about

4347
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
I saw all the banners at E3 last year

4348
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I was like oh that looks stupid

4349
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
And now I'm playing it and the game

4350
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
It's okay but I want every game to be narrated

4351
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Now because that is the

4352
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Best part of the game

4353
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers

4354
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
It's the part of the game that makes

4355
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
People feel so like hipster

4356
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
And that they're playing something artistic

4357
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Is like my game has a deep

4358
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Voiced bassy narrator

4359
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I don't feel hipster but I like to

4360
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Jump off you know

4361
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Well I fell off the world once and he narrated

4362
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
That and that's where I was sold

4363
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I thought it was so awesome

4364
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice

4365
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Commercial in the style of the Old Spice Commercial

4366
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
That Mustafa guy

4367
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
That would be awesome

4368
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I want a game narrated by Gilbert

4369
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Godfried

4370
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees

4371
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
What is up with that?

4372
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
That would be terrible

4373
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Nobody wants that

4374
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
I would play that

4375
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Oh my god I think you just

4376
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Died

4377
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
You're the worst video game player ever

4378
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Have you seen the

4379
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Funny video of Gilbert Godfried doing

4380
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
The audio book for Fifty Shades of Grey

4381
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Yes

4382
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Yes I have

4383
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Oh my god it's fucking amazing

4384
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Yes I have

4385
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Fifty Shades of Grey

4386
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate

4387
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Oh my god

4388
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
So Shane

4389
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I am addicted and I blame you

4390
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And Rob

4391
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
That's fine I'll take all the blame

4392
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
For that because

4393
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Well here's the thing it's kind of like a pyramid scheme

4394
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
So now you have to go and find

4395
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them

4396
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I'm working on it I'm trying to get Dan to play it

4397
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
So that our entire house is infected

4398
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Can Shirmi play it?

4399
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
No she'll just shit

4400
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Oh that's disgusting

4401
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Well everyone poops

4402
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
That's true I know

4403
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
From my little puppy Especially your new puppy

4404
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
What did you end up naming your puppy?

4405
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Helo from Battlestar Galactica

4406
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Cool okay

4407
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Well um

4408
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Now I am completely addicted to

4409
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Including Garris and everything

4410
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Because I kind of dig my

4411
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Birdman

4412
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
He is awesome He totally is

4413
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
But I am looking forward to the

4414
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Hotness of Miranda

4415
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
But I don't know I'm not too impressed with Kaiden yet

4416
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Really cause he's just

4417
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Not doing anything he's just sort of like

4418
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
It's cause you're not taking him places

4419
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I heard earlier you're like

4420
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I don't bring him along

4421
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I'm like hi Shepard

4422
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Wink

4423
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
No the same thing I felt for Liara

4424
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I hated Liara and then I beat three and I kind of

4425
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Liked her and then I started taking her

4426
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Through my playthroughs

4427
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Well I can't say stuff

4428
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And she became my hag

4429
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
And I like Liara now

4430
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
So I have her and Kaiden all the time

4431
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Well then maybe

4432
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Maybe I'll leave Rex at home

4433
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
For a while and take Kaiden out

4434
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Yes

4435
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
That's a much better idea

4436
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Although people have been spoiling crap for me

4437
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Well you should

4438
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Unfriend them and then drive to their house

4439
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
And punch them in the throat

4440
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It's because I was looking up the stuff

4441
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
That I'm not doing in Mass Effect

4442
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Like I was reading the wiki

4443
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
And I don't want to

4444
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Shoot somebody

4445
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Oh yeah

4446
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
So

4447
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
That made me mad

4448
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
That and the triple palette swap

4449
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
That I won't go into further detail about

4450
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
We can talk

4451
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Later about that because I don't understand what that is

4452
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I'm telling her she doesn't

4453
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
That doesn't tell her the full picture

4454
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
That doesn't tell her the full

4455
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Picture I'm still going to play the whole thing

4456
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I'll find out Rob

4457
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I'm just saying

4458
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Before I hang up here

4459
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
So you don't hang up on me

4460
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Something we'll probably talk about on Horde House

4461
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
This week that I saw today

4462
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I guess it was Dad of Mine for Diablo 3

4463
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
That you'll get

4464
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Some stuff for having the collectors

4465
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Miss the Pandaria

4466
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
You'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some

4467
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Banners and stuff but there's also

4468
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Possibly these

4469
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Wings that say in the

4470
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Like the code string

4471
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
That they give you quad damage

4472
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Now how fair is that

4473
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
To get something that's actually worth

4474
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Something that's really good

4475
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
For another game but you have to buy

4476
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
A collector's edition of something you may not

4477
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Care about

4478
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
That fucking sucks actually that's pretty shitty

4479
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I gotta say

4480
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
But I'll get the collector's edition anyway cause

4481
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I want that soundtrack cause it's really good

4482
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
And actually before I let you go

4483
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
I have something I have to play

4484
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Oops not that

4485
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Was it my commercial I sent you cause that's awesome

4486
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
No

4487
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Holy fuck is this wrong

4488
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
But holy hell

4489
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Is it erotic

4490
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,000
He totally missed the part where he's actually

4491
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I can't find the actual YouTube on there

4492
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
It was apparently on College Humor

4493
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
But I searched their site and I couldn't find it

4494
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I'm sure Tiger Claw will have it in 30 seconds now

4495
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
But it's missed the boat

4496
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
It's on my Facebook page

4497
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Hurry up and end the show so we can go play Mass Effect multiplayer

4498
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Bye

4499
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
1877 game

4500
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
O-L-R username on Skype

4501
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Is Orange Lounge Radio

4502
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
If you want to give us a call

4503
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Do we have any other last minute stories

4504
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Or should I go over to Twitter

4505
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I had Twitter up on the iPad

4506
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Well there was something I was just going to mention real quick

4507
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
That was kind of interesting

4508
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Remember how well we were just talking about

4509
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Pinball game during part A

4510
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Where Twilight Zone was

4511
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
The game of the week here

4512
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently

4513
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Pinball Arcade the Twilight Zone

4514
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
It's to get the Twilight Zone I guess on consoles

4515
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Well it must have worked

4516
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Hold on let's go to the phone

4517
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
So we have another call coming in

4518
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

4519
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Oh my god is this Rob

4520
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Oh my god it is

4521
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Oh my god penis

4522
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Oh hi

4523
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Well yes I have one

4524
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Would you like to see it

4525
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
And unfortunately I've already seen it

4526
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Ah to be 20

4527
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Ah unicorns

4528
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
What is up Miss Jessica Harper

4529
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
From Understation Live Saturday nights at VOG

4530
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Not much I thought that you know

4531
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Since you've actually been

4532
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Showing support for us these past two Saturdays

4533
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
And stuff

4534
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I would actually call in

4535
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
And say hi guys

4536
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Thank you so much you know being able to check in

4537
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And get points really helps motivate me

4538
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
To show no I've

4539
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I mean obviously I do love the points

4540
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
There's no other reason aside from

4541
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Going and getting points

4542
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
No the whole reason there's two reasons

4543
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night

4544
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
And I can't honestly I won't be there next

4545
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Saturday but neither will you

4546
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Neither will I

4547
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
There's two reasons one of them is disco disco

4548
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Disco disco

4549
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And somebody was asking me when we were going to do

4550
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Disco disco on Orange Lounge Radio I said you don't understand

4551
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Travis already thinks I steal

4552
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
All the bits from Understation Live

4553
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I'm not gonna

4554
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Like further give him evidence

4555
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
So no disco there's a ban on disco

4556
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Disco the closest thing

4557
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
You can go disco disco in PlayStation Home

4558
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
That's as close as we're gonna get

4559
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
But I will say

4560
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
The second reason is recursive

4561
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Travis

4562
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Yes recursive Travis

4563
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Always makes me giggle it doesn't matter

4564
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
How pissed off I am how upset

4565
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I am recursive Travis just every

4566
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Single time I do love though

4567
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
That you guys it looks like

4568
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I gotta say props to Travis and I don't know

4569
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
If you're part of this effort as well you've gotta be cracking

4570
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
The whip or something behind the scenes because

4571
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Travis is now getting his podcast up

4572
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Same day which is amazing

4573
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
You know it's all

4574
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Because of

4575
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
The vog

4576
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Aura it's like it got into his

4577
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Veins or something and now he

4578
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
He just he's part

4579
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Of it you know he is in the

4580
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Groove and I'm waiting for it

4581
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
To start you know

4582
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Calming down like after a month or two

4583
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
But you know it's been well over a month

4584
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Now it's like been what seven shows

4585
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Now that he's been getting up there

4586
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Every single week yeah yeah for real

4587
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Yeah and um

4588
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Not only that but it looks like

4589
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Starting with this past week he now has

4590
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Saved the archives on Ustream because

4591
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
If you haven't tuned in to understation live on vog

4592
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
It actually flips

4593
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
The radio station disappears

4594
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I mean it's still there so if you want just the

4595
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Audio like if you're driving in your car or something

4596
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
You obviously can't watch understation live you can still listen

4597
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
But if you're watching on your computer it

4598
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Flips and you see the Ustream

4599
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Well Travis is now saving the Ustreams

4600
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
So if you're jvmon in our chat

4601
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Room asking what is disco disco

4602
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
You could go to Ustream

4603
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
And watch now you can

4604
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Watch and watch you can actually

4605
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Feel like you're there

4606
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Watch me disco disco last week

4607
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
With no pants yes

4608
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
And watch his you know beard

4609
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Get the dirty thoughts out of your head you didn't see anything

4610
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Below the belt except my leg

4611
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
But I have

4612
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
I've just

4613
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Seen Robin very tight

4614
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Lacy panties

4615
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Lacy silky

4616
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Is what I did you make it okay

4617
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
You need to give some background to this

4618
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy

4619
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Walking around in women's panties

4620
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Or something like that yes it was rocky

4621
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Horror there's a big difference

4622
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
There's a difference still funny to say

4623
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
There's a difference

4624
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Is there any video games you've been playing lately

4625
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Aquaticirl

4626
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Well pretty much what I play

4627
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Is over and over and over again

4628
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Is lotro I am addicted to lotro

4629
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Yeah you suck dark soccer into that whole thing

4630
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I'm trying to

4631
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
I see her over there once in a while

4632
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
And she's like oh it's so pretty I'm like

4633
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Yeah that's why I keep trying to tell you people

4634
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
It seems like it's working a little bit

4635
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I'm trying to play it at least once a week

4636
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
At least once a week

4637
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Because I don't know if you know about

4638
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
My guild druidia

4639
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I was seeing something about that yeah

4640
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
We now have an all druid guild

4641
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Called druidia

4642
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
It was either going to be that or the order of vespa

4643
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
She has to fit in her time

4644
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Between tumblr and facebook

4645
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Too I'm just

4646
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I've had design work to do

4647
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
For reals that I've been getting paid for

4648
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I'm kidding lady lighten up

4649
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
She just has such a busy gaming schedule

4650
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
She has to fit everything in

4651
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Yeah my mass effect and my fractal

4652
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
And my wows and my lotors

4653
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
And my stows

4654
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
So yeah I only have time

4655
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
In my life for one game

4656
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
That's my MMO addiction right there

4657
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Hey you know what getting addicted to an MMO

4658
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes

4659
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Well I just

4660
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
See here's how bad I am though

4661
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
When it comes to console gaming

4662
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I used to be right on top of it

4663
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
You remember how I used to be

4664
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I don't own any modern system

4665
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
The only thing I have is a PS2

4666
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
You know what though

4667
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Gaming can be an expensive hobby

4668
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
And there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer

4669
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
We have a lot of people listen to this show

4670
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
That's kind of in your boat

4671
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Where it's like you know

4672
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
I'd love to have a 360 or a Playstation 3

4673
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Or whatever but I just

4674
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I have to buy stuff at you know

4675
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Flee markets

4676
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I like paying my rent

4677
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Exactly

4678
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I've gone through a lot of life changes

4679
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Since my gaming days

4680
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I now live in a place all by myself

4681
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
And it's in downtown Sacramento

4682
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
So it's a little bit more expensive

4683
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
But you know

4684
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
You do what you have to do

4685
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
And so yeah I'm not sharing rent

4686
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
So I can't go out and buy the pretty toys

4687
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
And what have you but

4688
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
You know what we could do?

4689
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Typing of the dead

4690
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Yeah well unfortunately

4691
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
When I was going through all of my

4692
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Very very difficult times

4693
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
My Dreamcast was one of the things that went away

4694
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
You girls can borrow mine anytime

4695
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
If I can find it

4696
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
If I can find it

4697
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Yes I could

4698
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
We can type zombies to death at my house

4699
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Yeah

4700
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
And as mentioned in chat I do have Chewy

4701
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
You do have a Chewy and that's very important

4702
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well

4703
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And space

4704
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
A lot of my attention yeah a lot of my space

4705
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Alright Jessica Harper

4706
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in a couple more calls

4707

But thanks so much for calling in it's so good to hear from you

And feel free to stop by the studio anytime

4709
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000

4710
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
But if you want to squeeze in here and say hi with everybody else

4711
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
We would welcome you with open arms

4712
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Ah but next week I can't do

02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Oh duh you're going to Disneyland

4714

I will be in Disneyland

4715
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
You know what can't blame you on that

4716
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
So yeah real quick before I go

Weekday after the kids are back in school

4746
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
She's trying to convince Christopher to go with her

4747
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Oh really?

4748
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Well cause I said you know

4749
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Originally she wanted to take Josh

4750
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
And stuff I'm like that's gonna be a

4751
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Sucking pain in the ass to try to

4752
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
You know haul a little kid on a

4753
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Plane and he's not used to sleeping

4754
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Anywhere other than his crib and stuff and I'm like

4755
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Listen you should just go cause I don't ride

4756
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I used to love like okay

4757
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Like for some reason I'm terribly afraid of roller

4758
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Coasters and I don't know why cause it's weird

4759
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I am like I was

4760
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Terribly afraid of roller coasters then one time

4761
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Disneyland it was awesome and then

4762
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Alright I'm afraid again

4763
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
The only roller coaster I will real roller coaster I'll ever do

4764
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Is screaming okay Rob

4765
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
I just want to read in chat real quick though

4766
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Black Wolf is complaining

4767
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
You guys just went I haven't been in

4768
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Over a year yeah well

4769
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Still two weeks is two weeks too long

4770
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Alright caller hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

4771
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Who's this? Hey what's up this is X-Link

4772
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Hey X-Link I haven't heard from you in a while buddy

4773
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
How you doing? Good good Black Wolf don't feel too bad

4774
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
I live right around the corner from

4775
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Disney around here and I've been in here so

4776
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Don't even remotely feel bad

4777
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I haven't been able to get up there and be able to do

4778
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Stuff in quite a while so

4779
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I've been quite disappointed that they took

4780
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Tron away from it but

4781
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
You know something about that

4782
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Rob I have a question for you

4783
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
How do you feel now

4784
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
That the Steam Workshop has now

4785
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Has been available for Civ 5

4786
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I haven't really

4787
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Got to play around with it yet

4788
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
But I'm excited about the potential

4789
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
That's in there I mean there's always been some

4790
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Great mods for Civ so

4791
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
It just seems like a logical step and I'm kind of

4792
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Glad that they're kind of embracing each other

4793
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Steam and Civ I haven't

4794
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Admittedly played a lot of Sim 5

4795
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Ever since I got into the Mass Effect series

4796
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
But I definitely want to go back and revisit it

4797
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
I heard the game fell out of balance

4798
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Bad with the last patch

4799
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
That they did so my friends were like I don't really want to play

4800
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
It kind of sucks right now but I'm imagining

4801
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
They fixed it with God's I mean they had to

4802
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Have with this Gods and Kings expansion so

4803
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months

4804
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Yeah they did a lot of work on it

4805
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
From what I understood from this last patch alone

4806
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
When they were adding the Steam

4807
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
The Steam Network workshop

4808
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Onto it and then I'm hearing on top of that

4809
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
They're also going to be doing a little more odds

4810
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And ends to that when Gods and Kings does

4811
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Come out in the following week here so

4812
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Right right

4813
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Which will be very interesting because knowing

4814
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
That you can make your own religion is going to be kind of

4815
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Interesting and intriguing to see what happens

4816
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
That is a little bit scary but good

4817
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
I was going to flip this question on you what do you think

4818
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
About Steam Workshop and Civ integration

4819
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Civ 5? Hey I think it's going to be pretty interesting

4820
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
What they're going to do Sharks with lasers

4821
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Or nuclear weapons or you know

4822
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Or robotic robots you know

4823
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
I mean the sky is the limit so

4824
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
I mean it's going to be intriguing to see

4825
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
What kind of different mods and stuff

4826
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
People are going to come up with for the game so

4827
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
It really is it's like little big Civ

4828
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Pretty much yeah

4829
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Hey this actually kind of ties into this

4830
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I want to bring in this Twitter topic here real quick

4831
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Because it sort of is related here and I'm sure

4832
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
You're going to know this story when I start reading it

4833
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
From SSJ100Matt who tweeted us saying

4834
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I saw this earlier this week

4835
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Man plays same Civ 2 game

4836
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
For 10 years

4837
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Civ 2 is my favorite Civ game

4838
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
So this made me smile

4839
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
And Sid Meier even did a reaction to it

4840
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
If you haven't heard basically

4841
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And this was all over Reddit and all that stuff

4842
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
So I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this

4843
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
But this man has been playing his Civ game for 10 years

4844
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
He's now in the

4845
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I mean not obviously like straight

4846
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
He's been playing 10 years on and off

4847
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
His world is in the world

4848
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Is in the year 3991 AD

4849
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
That's a long ways into the game

4850
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Trust me

4851
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
And basically his world has

4852
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
The Celts, the Vikings and the Americans

4853
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Stuck in thermo

4854
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Sorry the Celts, the Vikings and the Americans

4855
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Stuck in thermonuclear war

4856
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
For 1700 in game years

4857
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
That's crazy

4858
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
They're saying

4859
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Is it a strange reflection

4860
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
On where society is headed

4861
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts

4862
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
This week

4863
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
No I did not actually

4864
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
It's kind of intriguing hearing about that

4865
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I'll definitely go back and reread that

4866
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
But yeah that's crazy

4867
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Though I thought they could have sworn

4868
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
They stopped it like at some point they do

4869
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Stop the game like if you get to a certain area

4870
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
It's like you can't play it after that

4871
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Unless it's Civ 3 or 4

4872
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
It must be

4873
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
It must be the later Civs

4874
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
I thought the game always ended at a certain point

4875
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
As well but maybe 2 had been left open ended

4876
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I can't remember

4877
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Maybe his game was modded somehow

4878
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
To let it go on forever

4879
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I didn't read about the details on that

4880
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
In 10 years that's a lot of time

4881
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I don't know

4882
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Maybe turn a day or something

4883
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Or turn a week

4884
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I don't know

4885
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
That's very intriguing but that's very cool

4886
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
To hear about that

4887
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Sid Meier's response was really interesting

4888
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
He said

4889
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
My first thought was wow

4890
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2

4891
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
For so long

4892
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
It's been more than 15 years since we released that game

4893
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
And I don't think any of us expected

4894
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
A decade long game would come out of it

4895
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
It would be amazing if we could come back

4896
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
In 2025 and find out if

4897
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Someone's had a 10 year game of Civ 5

4898
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Going

4899
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Well you know it's kind of like

4900
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
The way he's played and ran is kind of similar to

4901
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Monopoly really

4902
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
If you play it right

4903
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
I could see it actually going on for that long period

4904
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Of time

4905
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
It's going back and forth type of deal

4906
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
And you're not really making

4907
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Ok I'm going to build up 50 units

4908
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
And go in there and try to

4909
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Massive wipe these

4910
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Towns and cities in the short period

4911
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Of time

4912
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
If he's taking his time and just doing it

4913
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Building day by day I could actually see

4914
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Something like that happening probably

4915
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Let me read this comment from JVmon in our chatroom

4916
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Saying I know Civ 3 stops scoring

4917
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Once you hit 2050 AD

4918
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
But you can keep playing if you want

4919
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
I think that's it

4920
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
The game stops

4921
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Yeah I think that's exactly what it is

4922
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
But I will say this and I know I'm going to get shit for this

4923
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Because he just said he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time

4924
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3

4925
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
That one's the worst one in the whole series

4926
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
I kind of agree

4927
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Especially the way that it's advanced

4928
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Over time

4929
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Yeah I can actually see that

4930
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
But all the games

4931
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
If you go back you're like wow

4932
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
It's kind of cool though

4933
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
It's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play

4934
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
From the beginning and going through

4935
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And it's kind of cool like even you said yourself

4936
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
When you're playing Mass Effect

4937
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Seeing the changes that have been done from part 1 to part 2

4938
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
To part 3 to part 4

4939
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
You know so on and so forth

4940
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
It's kind of cool to see the

4941
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Transactions and seeing what happens

4942
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Throughout that time period

4943
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And to get their own

4944
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Their own thoughts and other people's thoughts

4945
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
And theories behind it and putting it to work like that

4946
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
If DarkSakura wanted to jump in here with a thought

4947
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
And then we'll wrap things up

4948
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I was just going to use one of my grandmother's favorite quotes

4949
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
To each their own said the blind woman

4950
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Said the blind woman as she kissed the cow

4951
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
That is very true

4952
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Very very true

4953
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Alright XLink I got to let you go

4954
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners

4955
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Not really that I can think of at this time

4956
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I'm probably going to go back and play some Rift now

4957
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Alright good luck have fun with Rift

4958
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Yeah thanks appreciate it

4959
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I know him talking about MMOs and obviously I used to play

4960
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
A lot of WoW with XLink

4961
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding

4962
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
But I was playing some of the beta

4963
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
This week and I got to say the beta's

4964
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Come a long way and I was doing some panda

4965
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Tanking and it was actually quite fun

4966
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call

4967
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
1877 game

4968
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
1877

4969
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
GameOLR or a username

4970
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
On Skype Orange Lounge Radio

4971
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Meanwhile I got to get through some of these tweets

4972
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon

4973
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Who said shout out, I actually retweeted it

4974
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Shout out to OLR, long time

4975
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Fan from many moons ago

4976
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Rediscovered you recently

4977
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Now listening to you live with my fiance

4978
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Well thank you for tuning in

4979
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
And I realize sometimes

4980
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
People just don't have time

4981
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
For OLR anymore or kind of fall out of

4982
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
The habit of listening you know

4983
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
It happens but it's really cool that you come back

4984
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
At least you haven't fallen

4985
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Asleep during the damn show

4986
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft

4987
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Fair enough

4988
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Jim Sally sent a tweet that said

4989
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Hey guys can you tell me how to spend

4990
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
You a tweet while you're live on air

4991
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
I wish I could figure this out

4992
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
You kids and your twittering

4993
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Well speaking of which, let's take this phone call

4994
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
And see who might be there

4995
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4996
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Hey baby

4997
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
How funny, I was just talking about you

4998
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Were your ears burning?

4999
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
What did you say?

5000
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
I was reading your tweet

5001
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I wrote a tweet to you? Oh yeah sorry about that

5002
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Or somebody hacked your account

5003
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
No that was me, I was a little bit

5004
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Funny before and I thought I would tell that joke

5005
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Did you like it?

5006
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
I did, I did

5007
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I was saying can you tell me how to spend a tweet

5008
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
While you're live on the air

5009
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
You kids and your twittering

5010
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
You pretty much got

5011
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Twitter in a nutshell right there

5012
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Bad grammar and all

5013
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
That's the Jim Salle way

5014
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
That's the Jim Salle goy

5015
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
I'm making my own English

5016
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
I was just going to say to what do we owe

5017
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
This great phone call tonight

5018
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
I got you another little present like you asked

5019
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
I'm the 500th person to like your

5020
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Facebook page

5021
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Get out, that's awesome

5022
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Thank you

5023
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I said how come I haven't done this yet

5024
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I felt a little ashamed

5025
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
So I rectified my situation

5026
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Thank you for the support

5027
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
What kind of prize should we give Jim Salle

5028
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
For being the 500th fan

5029
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
I think I should get 500

5030
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
VOG points

5031
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Jamie has a prize?

5032
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Yeah

5033
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
You got a round of applause

5034
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I was using my slow clap processor

5035
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
So I'm not going to get the 500

5036
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
VOG points

5037
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
And hearts, you get hearts

5038
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
And you have VOG points

5039
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Don't they go away at the end of the month

5040
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
I think someone told me they go away at the end of the month

5041
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Sort of, the main leaderboard

5042
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Is monthly

5043
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
But we are still going to keep track on a year

5044
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Basis, but that one is

5045
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Going to be a little more for fun

5046
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
And let me tell you the reason behind that

5047
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
We want, well just go back to the

5048
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Tweet earlier where somebody said

5049
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Hey I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while

5050
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
But I recently rediscovered you guys

5051
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Well you know if somebody kind of comes into

5052
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
VOG a little bit late

5053
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Then you know we are going to be adding more shows

5054
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
To the network soon so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out

5055
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
We don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up

5056
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Or they can't ever play the game

5057
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Because they are never going to be able to beat the score

5058
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
So that's

5059
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
We are going to reset the boards every month for that reason

5060
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
So people have a chance to win

5061
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Every month

5062
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Listen Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG network

5063
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Knows they can't keep up with Jim Sally

5064
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So you might as well just give me the 500 points

5065
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
First off, okay

5066
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Second off, it's father's day

5067
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
You're a good dad, I'm a stay at home dad

5068
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I work hard every day, keep my baby girl

5069
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Clean and pretty and nice and put her in

5070
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Dresses and stuff

5071
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
All I ask for at the end of the day is

5072
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Maybe some extra VOG points

5073
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:50,000
And a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something

5074
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Alright, Jim Sally

5075
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Just because you call in to the shows

5076
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
And you do show your support

5077
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I will see what we can do, no promises

5078
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
You're the boss, you can do it

5079
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Here's the thing

5080
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Bobby did all the coding work

5081
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
And he's very

5082
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Passionate about his game

5083
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
I'll see what we can do

5084
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Come on, Bobby

5085
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Bobby, don't be a douche

5086
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Give me my 500 points

5087
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Listen, Bobby

5088
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Douche wolf

5089
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
You're not going to win fans that way

5090
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Listen

5091
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
This is not how you do it

5092
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
You catch more flies with honey than vinegar

5093
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Listen Bobby

5094
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
I don't care about honey or vinegar

5095
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I care about my VOG points

5096
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Act deaf, this Google plus loving mother fucker is ahead of me

5097
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
And I won't have it

5098
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
And I won't have it

5099
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I'll give him something to Google plus about

5100
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Jeez, I deserve those points

5101
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I work hard

5102
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I think without me, where would I be?

5103
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
If anything

5104
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
If anything

5105
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points

5106
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG network enough

5107
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Or too much

5108
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Or too much

5109
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Fine, I award you 500 points

5110
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
For Gryffindor

5111
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
For Gryffindor

5112
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
What is it you were going to say, Rob?

5113
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
It's a bummer the points aren't compatible

5114
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
With each other

5115
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
The conversion rates

5116
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
You were looking at me funny

5117
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning

5118
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Very loudly

5119
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Oh, nothing

5120
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show

5121
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points

5122
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
No

5123
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
I'm just

5124
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now

5125
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Bobby, make it happen

5126
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Bobby, come on

5127
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
A lot of people are

5128
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Alright, take care of Jim Sally

5129
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Have a good one

5130
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Thanks for the points, Bobby

5131
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Goodnight everybody

5132
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Bye

5133
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Alright, we got to close up the Skyline

5134
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I'm so sorry, I saw other people trying to get through

5135
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
In fact, there was one caller I'd never seen before

5136
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
That I really wanted to take

5137
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
But it just didn't work out, I'm sorry

5138
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Email us, mailbagoutorangeloungeradio.com

5139
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I'm using Chigurh's suggestion

5140
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
By the way, we've actually awarded you

5141
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
The 500 points

5142
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
But we're taking it away for ranting

5143
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
No, we are doing no such thing

5144
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Bobby and I are already discussing

5145
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Something in secret

5146
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
That's all we can say, it's in secret

5147
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
A couple more tweets, I got to get some of Tigerclaw's tweets

5148
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I posted the best picture

5149
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
In chat, by the way

5150
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Tigerclaw tweets

5151
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
But I posted the best picture in chat

5152
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Of peekathulu

5153
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Tigerclaw sends us a tweet

5154
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Microsoft's first Android

5155
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Title, Connectimals

5156
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Remember Connectimals?

5157
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
They're still around

5158
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Apparently it's the first Android game

5159
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
That they've launched on Google Play's

5160
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Store, not to be confused with Google Plus

5161
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Which we were talking about earlier

5162
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
It is out now, it's also on

5163
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
iOS, just saying

5164
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
$2.99 on Google Play for Android

5165
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
A little tie-in there to the

5166
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Connect game that I know Loki's a big fan of

5167
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
He gave me a big thumb

5168
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
That was a gladiator moment

5169
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Right there with the big thumbs down

5170
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Alright, let me read

5171
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
One more tweet here from Tigerclaw

5172
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
PBS taking a look at

5173
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Modern 8-bit culture

5174
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
That's really cool

5175
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
The evolution of 8-bit art, I guess it's like a

5176
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
PBS special that's going on there

5177
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
That's talking about, I imagine it's got to be things like the

5178
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
8-bit exhibit and all that stuff

5179
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff

5180
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
That's pretty cool

5181
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Talking about some of the recent games like VVV

5182
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Mega Man 9 and some of that

5183
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Stuff that's really caught on, that's really cool

5184
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
And murals and so forth, you know what?

5185
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods

5186
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
And all that, so

5187
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
I can totally see why it's in our

5188
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Popular culture and all that

5189
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Anyway, I gotta close up the tweeters

5190
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Close up the mailbag, close up

5191
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
The phone because it is about closing

5192
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Time here at Orange Lounge

5193
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Radio, we gotta wrap up the show and say

5194
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Goodnight, I wanna check in with Loki

5195
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
One more time to see if he has any other

5196
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
Last minute stories

5197
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Alright, then we'll go around

5198
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
And get everybody's final thought and wrap

5199
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk

5200
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
About this, what is this that you brought?

5201
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
The FP

5202
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
It's basically

5203
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
A movie where there's these two post

5204
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Apocalyptic gangs that compete

5205
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
And fight each other

5206
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
By playing DDR

5207
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Wasn't that in a Madonna video?

5208
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Hated it, no

5209
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
It's really cheesy

5210
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
I don't know

5211
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
It's a screener ahead

5212
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I'll have to check that out at some point

5213
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Alright

5214
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's

5215
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Final thought

5216
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
My final thought tonight is

5217
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Dinner

5218
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

5219
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Picatulu

5220
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
And Loki

5221
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Last but not least, your final thought tonight

5222
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
My final thought is

5223
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
This mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter

5224
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Zombie Playground looks too much

5225
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Like Pedobear

5226
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
It's Pedo Raccoon

5227
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
That is

5228
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Pedo Raccoon for sure

5229
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
And Zombie Pedo Raccoon

5230
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
But that is Pedo Raccoon

5231
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Fun!

5232
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Alright, hey before we

5233
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Close up shop here

5234
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
I just want to say thank you guys very much

5235
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
For tuning into Orange Lounge Radio

5236
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Thank you for your support over the past 9 years

5237
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
And 51 weeks

5238
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
All we ask, tell a friend or two about

5239
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Orange Lounge Radio, help spread the word

5240
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Hey, we got fans 499

5241
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
And 500 tonight on Facebook

5242
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
That's exactly what we're talking about

5243
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I know 500 was Jim Sally, I don't know where 499 came from

5244
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
But thank you whoever that was

5245
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
And whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio

5246
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Help us spread the word, word of mouth

5247
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
And all that stuff especially

5248
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
And as well

5249
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
As you know from behind the scenes stuff

5250
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
There will be easier and more ways

5251
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
To spread that word soon enough

5252
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Uh huh, very true, very true

5253
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
We've seen things

5254
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
And also I want to say

5255
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Next week is

5256
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
The 10 year anniversary

5257
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000

02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Please help spread the word

5259
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while

5260
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Such as the Twitter comment I read earlier

5261
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Just I would really love to hear

5262
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
From the folks from OLR's past

5263
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
The Skype line will be open

5264
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
In about an hour after the show

5265
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
To take your calls and messages

5266
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Uh if you have anything you want to leave

5267
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
For us to play next week

5268
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I'm really looking forward to it

5269
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
And um

5270
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
I kind of can't believe it

5271
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
That's why we haven't said much about it

5272
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
We kind of can't believe it, it's been 10 years

5273
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Shit, we are old

5274
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
It's our 10th anniversary

5275
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
We'll be back next week to celebrate

5276
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
10 years of Orange Lounge Radio

5277
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Until then, don't be a dick

5278
02:58:38,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Be safe, see you next time

5279
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
See you next week

5280
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
See you next time
