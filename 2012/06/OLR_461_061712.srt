1
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 17th, 2012.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Have new details leaked out on the next Xbox?

4
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:22,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumors intensify that Star Wars The Old Republic may go free to play.

5
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:25,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And did Nintendo withhold some big games from E3?

6
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:38,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:51,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network or the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com where we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

8
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:53,907
[SPEAKER_12]: But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well.

9
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:55,588
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's okay too.

10
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:02,835
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys.

11
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,838
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:06,897
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,595
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods.

14
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:37,416
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing here?

15
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:41,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the, oh, let me, go ahead of me.

16
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:42,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the lady, I had like my salad.

17
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,539
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, why don't you check out ahead of me?

18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure?

20
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead.

21
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there's more people like that in the world.

22
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

23
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,062
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

25
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:01,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

26
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is not at Whole Foods today.

27
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,305
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

28
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:05,927
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing, Loki?

29
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:10,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I tend to like to buy my food in the whole form.

30
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that like a Costco endorsement?

31
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:14,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure.

32
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:17,717
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just saying that I don't want half foods.

33
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:18,417
[SPEAKER_12]: I see.

34
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,218
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I get it.

35
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:19,879
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a joke there.

36
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,003
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room.

37
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:27,586
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com.

38
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:31,169
[SPEAKER_12]: The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room.

39
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,332
[SPEAKER_12]: And checking the comments in our chat room.

40
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:36,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure.

41
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:36,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

42
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:39,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts.

43
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to play Binding of Isaac.

44
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:41,776
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I checked out that game this week.

45
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago.

46
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:46,778
[SPEAKER_12]: That game's messed up.

47
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

48
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:47,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

49
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,539
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a disturbing little game.

50
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:54,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy, but it's a very different kind of game.

51
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:58,703
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it, but looks can be deceiving.

52
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:02,485
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like a twin stick shooter in Zelda's kind of box.

53
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,580
[SPEAKER_12]: It may work.

55
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,361
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do like a... It tells you.

56
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:08,741
[SPEAKER_12]: It's weird.

57
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:13,344
[SPEAKER_12]: When you go into the options, it tells you, use Joy2Pad to use whatever joystick.

58
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And it even says, don't know what it is?

59
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:17,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Google it.

60
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:18,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I found funny.

61
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:19,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been using keyboard.

62
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,960
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was just, I thought it was very strange.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo, which I might find treasure in.

64
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,306
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, this is... The hell is this?

65
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:33,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him, but I won't spoil it.

66
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't spoil it.

67
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: This crazy mom.

68
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you get any of the items?

69
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Because one of the first items you get is mom's underpants.

70
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like...

71
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually didn't get too far into it.

72
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:45,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That's creeper right there.

73
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:46,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had Mass Effect.

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:48,960
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

75
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we are going to talk about our gaming weeks and all the games that we've been playing this week.

76
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:57,126
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things at the top of the show here.

77
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:04,792
[SPEAKER_12]: For one, if you were listening to Bobby, when he gave us a call there at the end of the show, he said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting.

78
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's correct.

79
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:08,314
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, next year, or next year, next week...

80
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:11,797
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

81
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:39,329
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I know why we still do this, but it's interesting because a lot of shows, you know, I'm not, I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows because you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts and all that other stuff.

82
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?

83
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:46,354
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last, heck, two or three years even.

84
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,615
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a milestone to get to one year.

85
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:55,099
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think has caused us to go for 10 whole years where other people don't make it?

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,801
[SPEAKER_12]: We've set the bar really low.

87
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:01,508
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

88
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,250
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we don't have a huge audience and that's okay.

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,271
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show.

90
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we were doing... That first show... You're doing better than 12.

91
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

92
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,533
[SPEAKER_12]: The first show was for 12 people.

93
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,694
[SPEAKER_12]: And for internet radio, that was huge.

94
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:18,517
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we were really excited to have 12 people who gave a shit enough to listen to us.

95
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:19,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the way it was for many years.

96
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:20,558
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't really until...

97
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:21,718
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

98
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:54,640
[SPEAKER_12]: and now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts all over the iTunes market so it gets a little harder to stand out if you're not IGN or 1UP or one of the big deep-pocketed producers out there.

99
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,666
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm really happy with the following that we do have and it does seem like the folks that do show up and participate with our show every week...

100
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,671
[SPEAKER_12]: are really the reason for me that kind of we keep doing this, you know?

101
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,975
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week thanks to this show.

102
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is a way for me to hang out with DarkSakura and Loki who are, you know, they're okay.

103
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:17,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, what's... Were you talking?

104
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, what's motivated you for the past 10 years?

105
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:24,530
[SPEAKER_12]: She's thinking.

106
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:27,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at my house for a while.

107
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,289
[SPEAKER_12]: For a little bit, but not in the beginning.

108
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan says he misses the show being at the house.

109
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:31,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he?

110
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,090
[SPEAKER_12]: That's actually kind of a nice compliment.

111
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:36,611
[SPEAKER_04]: My ego.

112
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:38,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Spite.

113
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show.

114
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:43,634
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not getting paid for it.

115
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch, please.

116
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:47,608
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a hobby.

117
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:48,789
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something you do for fun.

118
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: and even if they can't make it into the chat room live or catch the podcast later on, you know, I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason.

119
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it, I mean, I enjoy it.

120
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Except your ego.

121
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, except my ego, of course.

122
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Make my ego grow.

123
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:27,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I just do it because I like attention.

124
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because I like all of you.

125
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:38,972
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I kind of, I don't know, that's why, and I've talked a little bit about this, and I don't want to be very direct because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily, but I get a little...

126
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:41,586
[SPEAKER_12]: We have integrity.

127
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:42,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We really do.

128
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You ask, we deliver.

129
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:08,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're being bitches.

130
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll tell you off.

131
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Rob will have a hissy fit.

132
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:15,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

133
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's certainly... Let me tell you this.

134
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,168
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly not money that motivates us.

135
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:20,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you that much.

136
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:21,648
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.

137
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some generous people.

138
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've had good things fall into our laps.

139
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:33,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer, Ranma mostly, wasn't it?

140
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,392
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a variety of people.

141
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:44,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to give one person more credit than another, but that was a really great gesture.

142
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep.

143
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,065
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that too.

144
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi Shane!

145
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,411
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network, I was a little slow in activating the check-in.

146
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer.

147
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to put a button to do it.

148
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:05,816
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can now check into the show at live.vognetwork.com and get your points.

149
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

150
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Slacker.

151
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:08,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted you to wait for it.

152
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,959
[SPEAKER_04]: He was busy playing that game on his iPad.

153
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:12,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The pocket planes?

154
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Pocket planes.

155
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute.

156
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,641
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

157
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:17,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokey plane, pokey plane.

158
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,644
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

159
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:21,244
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll start with you.

160
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Mass Effect.

161
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played... I started a new guild.

162
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:33,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyone who plays World of Warcraft, I made an all-Druid guild, so you have to be a Druid to be in it.

163
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:36,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's called Druidia.

164
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't get the joke, then I feel very, very sorry for you and probably a little old.

165
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:58,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I was either going to name it that or Jewish Princesses or Order of Vespa so you should all get where that comes from and I played like a little Lotor but this week has really been kind of exhausting for me and next week is going to be exhausting as well

166
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:03,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had some design work come onto my plate that I'm getting a little bit for.

167
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a book cover.

168
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing more games than usual, though.

169
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:11,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played some Fractal.

170
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:13,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I love freaking Fractal.

171
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That game pisses me off and I love it for it.

172
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an abusive boyfriend.

173
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:25,037
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was right that you are going to really like Mass Effect, even though you're on the first game, but it sounds like you'll play through the series.

174
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me.

175
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,644
[SPEAKER_12]: That was messed up, what you were telling me about that.

176
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:35,050
[SPEAKER_12]: But like I was telling you in chat last night, I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in.

177
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to play it because I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head.

178
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,192
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many subplots about the various characters.

179
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:47,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Not so much in one, I hate to say it, but when you get to two, there's a lot between two and three.

180
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to Miranda.

181
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:49,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Miranda's great.

182
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Miranda's hot.

183
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that bitch is hot.

184
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Miranda's hot.

185
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

186
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:58,017
[SPEAKER_04]: If not for my overwhelming fandom of Garrus, I would totally romance that bitch.

187
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,417
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't as a femme chef.

188
00:10:59,437 --> 00:10:59,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Sucks!

189
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,779
[SPEAKER_12]: You can only les out with Liara, I think.

190
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Ashley.

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Ashley's a bitch and Liara's too skinny.

192
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,023
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you can't be lesbianic with Ashley.

193
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think.

194
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:12,344
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm pretty sure you can't.

195
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what character I'm also looking forward to?

196
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:14,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack.

197
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:16,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Jack is awesome.

198
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:17,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

199
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:18,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a great story.

200
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But she oddly made me think of my friend Gary's sister.

201
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:22,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

202
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay.

203
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,428
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, she was pretty cool.

204
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:32,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Infanel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head.

205
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:33,874
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

206
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:34,915
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what, DarkSakura?

207
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:42,461
[SPEAKER_12]: By the time you get to 3, there's going to be that extra content that's the enriched ending, which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet.

208
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles.

209
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Like pop-up video?

210
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

211
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:52,029
[SPEAKER_09]: See, this is what this meant, in case you didn't get it.

212
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:56,769
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerClaw in chat says it's all about Miranda's assets.

213
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass.

214
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,249
[SPEAKER_12]: She is a nice war asset to have.

215
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It's round.

216
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's round and plump and you just want to reach in the screen and get squished.

217
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's modeled after the voice actress.

218
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

219
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:09,711
[SPEAKER_12]: You know who I love too?

220
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk about genetic perfection.

221
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that I'm into aliens.

222
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very secure in my homosexuality.

223
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:20,153
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I were to get it on with a femme alien, Samara's kind of hot.

224
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:21,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

225
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though her children are apparently fucked up.

226
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:24,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Aha!

227
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,897
[SPEAKER_12]: You haven't even played two yet and you know this.

228
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:33,405
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki, the Mass Effect wiki, and it came up with whatever it is that they have.

229
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know one of them's like addicted to...

230
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:55,546
[SPEAKER_04]: and so I actually out of curiosity I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it with the crazy chick and of course dead so that was pretty funny and I also I've decided that if I play through it as a dude I'm totally going after Tali because she's just funny and cute

231
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you've got... There's so much I want to say, but I can't.

232
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Just keep playing.

233
00:12:59,189 --> 00:12:59,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep going.

234
00:12:59,549 --> 00:12:59,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep going.

235
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Mass Effect Lounge Radio.

236
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,434
[SPEAKER_12]: But it really... I can't believe I missed this series for so many years.

237
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,115
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so flippin' good.

238
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:07,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Ugh.

239
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:08,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

240
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, I've been averaging, like, a planet a play, if that makes sense, Rob.

241
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, I just...

242
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:18,324
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

243
00:13:38,546 --> 00:14:00,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I should at least get to where I was probably by the end of the night one night when I'm playing so because I tend to you know play and chat with people at the same time so I multitask I multitask and Acidic Vampire asked me who my favorite character is so far in the first game and I mean Shepard's actually pretty pretty badass I dig her

244
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:00,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Garry's

245
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:24,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

246
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just so... He can be a dick and you love him.

247
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like Thor, kind of, except, you know, not as thee and thou and wearing his mother's drapes.

248
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:37,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I think all boys that play Mass Effect kind of want to bromance Garrus, too.

249
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy.

250
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:41,820
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

251
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: He can be kind of a jerk, but he's a good jerk and you like him.

252
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a nice jerky kind of... He's like your husband.

253
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:50,264
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like Dan.

254
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,225
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really like Dan.

255
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just can't help but be charmed by his degrees of arrogance.

256
00:14:56,508 --> 00:15:12,179
[SPEAKER_12]: by the way I do I don't mean to veer off track too much but we are we are currently in the VOG Network clubhouse on Sony Home and if you want to log into PlayStation Home and search for VOG Network just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up VOG Network

257
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I also really like Rex Rex is cuddly

258
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just, I like the gruff sort of, you know, mercenary attitude.

259
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've always had a thing for that kind of character.

260
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,692
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm at it, okay, Liara is too talkative and she needs to shut up sometimes.

261
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:53,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's one thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they take things and run away with it.

262
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Ashley's a bitch.

263
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:57,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I would like her, but she's really just kind of a bitch ho bag.

264
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:07,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate to say it, Caden is just too Mr. Generic Pretty Guy.

265
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:08,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Get out of my house.

266
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:10,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

267
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean.

268
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,821
[SPEAKER_04]: He's... I mean, maybe he'll get better.

269
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used him that much.

270
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really think that Tali is adorable.

271
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just so cute.

272
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:20,243
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

273
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:29,466
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat, but going to some of the comments from our chat room at vognetwork.com, TigerClaw says, Garrus is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad when he does bad things.

274
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Not as much as Liara.

275
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things.

276
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:33,767
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

277
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on, anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?

278
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:48,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not have Romance Rex, I'm sorry, but that's too much like doing it with, I can't even say with, like, Jabba the Hutt, sorry.

279
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:50,477
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Loki, how is your gaming?

280
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:53,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you're not a Mass Effect addict, so you have something else going on, right?

281
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank God.

282
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:01,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's turn in like a soap opera just talking about all the people that you would have sex with in Mass Effect.

283
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:04,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many block people have you romanced in Minecraft?

284
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,462
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no block people in Minecraft.

285
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,204
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just blocks and farm animals.

286
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:15,050
[SPEAKER_12]: How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?

287
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,592
[SPEAKER_09]: None because I'm playing on peaceful.

288
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:18,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Boring.

289
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:19,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's none.

290
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things sneak up on you.

291
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:34,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I've been, uh, I tunneled from my original track, uh, that went from the one station to the next, to my volcanic lair now, and so I have that.

292
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that you have an evil underground lair.

293
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:41,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's above ground, it's, you know, the tallest mountain in the... I thought it was in the volcano.

294
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:42,591
[SPEAKER_09]: It is in the volcano.

295
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Aren't a lot of evil lairs in volcanoes?

296
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:46,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear that was in a James Bond movie, I swear.

297
00:17:46,633 --> 00:18:01,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It was also in Austin Powers That's true I was hollowing out the volcano to build more stuff Although I'm starting to wonder what the hell I'm supposed to fill this volcano with

298
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:19,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried making a library, but apparently if the book shelves are too close to lava, even though the lava could be on the other side of a wall several layers away, it'll still catch those books on fire eventually.

299
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap.

300
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I need more materials to build my library.

301
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:26,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Come back and the whole library burned down.

302
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, ah, damn it.

303
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:37,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories, but we are going to talk a little bit about some things that changed in Minecraft this week, and one of them is the removal of the duping bug.

304
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,225
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you feeling about that, Loki?

305
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't updated yet.

306
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:41,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Never.

307
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll never update.

308
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:44,028
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I will update.

309
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:45,529
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's a little annoying.

310
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:53,353
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how I built, like, a huge old storage facility now that I'm slowly filling stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring duping stuff.

311
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:57,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version, they'll have creative mode in there, which I think...

312
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:04,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're going to have create mode, but even technically that they patched out the duping, there's still ways for me to get stuff that I want.

313
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:12,786
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a save file editor that you can edit what you have in your inventory, so I can still dupe that way if I want to, but it's just a pain to pull the save off and do this.

314
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:37,454
[SPEAKER_09]: and I know they fixed the clay spawn rate and stuff so you can actually find clay now instead of it being like diamond searching for a diamond but even though diamond is a lot easier to find than this right now and you have to start a new world in order for all those update effects to take effect in your world so like if we respawn the VOG seed or whatever it would actually have different things in it

315
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,815
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're going to do the same thing again with Pistons.

316
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:47,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now I'm just going to stick with this world and I'm not going to bother starting a new one just to get more clay because I don't really want clay.

317
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,800
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I'm going to start over.

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to do some work in Peaceful.

319
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:56,645
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what was slowing me down before was that I was too... I could not get to stuff because of the stupid...

320
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:58,466
[SPEAKER_12]: and Creepers and all that stuff.

321
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:02,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And I realize that's kind of part of the fun of the game, but I would like to just do peaceful.

322
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:09,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And then once I have my underground lair built, I will turn on the monsters, make it the point to go out and destroy them all.

323
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:10,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

324
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:31,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So I played that stuff.

325
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:34,262
[SPEAKER_09]: What else did I do?

326
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:39,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 a little bit.

327
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:41,306
[SPEAKER_09]: We played a little bit of the System Link stuff.

328
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:45,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Still wish I had some more maps to play because a lot of them are really big.

329
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:53,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the first game, Modern Warfare, just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small that we could actually play on and it wasn't such a big deal.

330
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,574
[SPEAKER_09]: There was only a couple that were too big.

331
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:57,455
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's like the reverse problem.

332
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:01,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so hopefully there will be some more maps that we can check out.

333
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully for free, because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody.

334
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:13,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um, I was going to play Gravity Rush, but I... What the fuck?

335
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:14,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh...

336
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:15,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

337
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:17,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Home is interesting.

338
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,026
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I can really say.

339
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:23,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says, it gets hard.

340
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:24,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Get your minds out of the gutter.

341
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,690
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big piece of wood.

342
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,791
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not helping, am I?

343
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:30,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

344
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,852
[SPEAKER_12]: That says, it gets hard.

345
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:32,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it smooth?

346
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:35,854
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of these double entendres in Sony Home.

347
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:38,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Dirty ass people who play Home, like me.

348
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been good this weekend.

349
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:43,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not played any Minecraft this weekend.

350
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that.

351
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that.

352
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not play any Minecraft today or yesterday.

353
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:54,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else for your gaming week?

354
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

355
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:57,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a lot for me to report.

356
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects.

357
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:02,399
[SPEAKER_12]: As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer still kind of consumes.

358
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I finally got the Vortex Sentinel, who's awesome.

359
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:13,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I considered buying Mass Effect 3 on PC just so I could play with Alan, who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC.

360
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,068
[SPEAKER_12]: But now I'm not going to be able to.

361
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real.

362
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,630
[SPEAKER_12]: We think it's the power supply.

363
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:23,053
[SPEAKER_12]: He was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours yesterday.

364
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:27,056
[SPEAKER_12]: and finally there was just this loud... It was during Under Sedation Live when I was listening.

365
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:30,538
[SPEAKER_12]: There's just loud... And then... Damn it, I forgot your game.

366
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:30,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

367
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:31,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I was gonna ask about that.

368
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:32,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Just come to my house.

369
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to my house next week.

370
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:34,781
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

371
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:39,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway, so maybe... Anyway, off-air discussion.

372
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:40,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Where was I?

373
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:41,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it, you threw me off.

374
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:42,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Mass Effect.

375
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:49,674
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Alan's computer broke, so the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC, I ended up having to buy a power supply for Alan's computer.

376
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:53,217
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, maybe in the future.

377
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:58,041
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect as Renegade on Xbox 360.

378
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:03,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Other stuff I have been playing that's non-Mass Effect.

379
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:07,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I checked out a little more of Sony PlayStation Home this week thanks to the VOG Clubhouse.

380
00:23:07,784 --> 00:23:10,365
[SPEAKER_12]: It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more.

381
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,526
[SPEAKER_12]: There's positives and negatives.

382
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:16,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Positives is there's a whole lot more it seems like to do in Home now.

383
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,848
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot more of these mini games that are pretty well-rounded.

384
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:22,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house.

385
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,049
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just walk up to it and play it.

386
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,149
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Cluster Puck.

387
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:27,433
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all those double entendres again, right?

388
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:32,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is kind of a, I don't know, it's like Tetris Attack meets...

389
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:35,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

390
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:42,232
[SPEAKER_12]: There's this weird mechanic where you can actually move pieces up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling.

391
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:46,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And once you attach it to another piece, it becomes part of the big block that you're moving.

392
00:23:46,753 --> 00:23:50,715
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when they all fall down, if you have three in a row, they go away.

393
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,155
[SPEAKER_12]: It was weird, but I liked it.

394
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,036
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a pretty cool kind of different little puzzle game.

395
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,096
[SPEAKER_12]: And you unlock dumb little rewards for it.

396
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I was checking out Sony's E3 booth.

397
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:03,139
[SPEAKER_12]: I checked out some type of, what is it, Midway thing, but...

398
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:09,582
[SPEAKER_12]: They won 99 cents for 50 tickets to actually play the games, and it's all a contest.

399
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, eh, I don't think I want to do that.

400
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:15,646
[SPEAKER_12]: My only real complaint about Home is that some of it's really slow.

401
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:18,988
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer a lot.

402
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:23,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, if it's your first time in Home, you have to download everything.

403
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of takes a little while.

404
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:26,192
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like to think I have a fast connection.

405
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:31,075
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really the only thing that really bums me out, though, is that Home is kind of...

406
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:40,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something that you could launch other games from and it was going to be literally home?

407
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,301
[SPEAKER_12]: You wouldn't go into your crossbar.

408
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,622
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd go into home and kind of do everything from there.

409
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:45,723
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too slow.

410
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,184
[SPEAKER_12]: You could never do anything like that.

411
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:53,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a computer from the 1980s that takes two and a half minutes to boot sometimes.

412
00:24:54,828 --> 00:25:00,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when it loads and when you have things, you know, cached, if you've loaded all the areas or whatever, it's pretty cool.

413
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,992
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, once you get in there, like once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse and all that, it's pretty cool.

414
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:08,073
[SPEAKER_12]: But moving seamlessly is a little rough still.

415
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,154
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do like, they've really expanded.

416
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:18,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if you haven't checked out Home since it first launched three years ago, there's like a million more things in there now and tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters.

417
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:18,797
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

418
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:19,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

419
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And multiple theaters dedicated to the Twilight trailer.

420
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:25,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, really?

421
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,420
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just making shit up.

422
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home.

423
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:30,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it a Sony movie?

424
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,401
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

425
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:35,403
[SPEAKER_12]: When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out, you better believe they do stuff like that in Home.

426
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, Rob, before I forget, actually there's one more game that I'm playing.

427
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing the Mass Effect 3.

428
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,400
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like a Facebook game, yeah.

429
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm already preparing for Mass Effect 3.

430
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:53,742
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

431
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:54,342
[SPEAKER_12]: You're committed.

432
00:25:54,822 --> 00:26:02,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I've also been playing an iOS game and it's Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game from the makers of Tiny Tower where now you fly planes.

433
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?

434
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:06,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?

435
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,071
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Pocket Planes is not a rip-off of Dream Heights.

436
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though.

437
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:19,535
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, you buy airports, you buy planes, and you ship people and cargo between them.

438
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Exact same artist assets from Tiny Tower.

439
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:26,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, obviously, they had to go in and draw planes and clouds and, you know, things.

440
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,260
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's like the same style, the same universe.

441
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,341
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like that they have the two very different kind of games yet in the same universe.

442
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:35,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard from some people, though, that don't care for Pocket Planes because it's like...

443
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:39,046
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not as easy to get as Tiny Tower was.

444
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get.

445
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:49,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Pocket Planes is a little, like, because not only do you have to manage the airports, you have to manage the planes, so you're not just managing a tower, you're kind of having to juggle two things.

446
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:55,139
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot more places to sink money as well, and there's Twitter integration and all this.

447
00:26:55,499 --> 00:27:03,346
[SPEAKER_12]: The one reason why NimbleBits games do so well, though, is that you really do get the full experience for free, and it doesn't nag you ever about buying things.

448
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,126
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

449
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,761
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have a whole little flight team or was it flight squad?

450
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:27,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Flight team?

451
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:27,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like that.

452
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:39,206
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just VOG if you put in as the tag and you can see how you're doing in the world events with folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf and whoever else on the network is playing the pocket planes.

453
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, that's it for my gaming week.

454
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,767
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever.

455
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:44,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on.

456
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

457
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll quickly say housekeeping.

458
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:55,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

459
00:27:56,157 --> 00:28:05,019
[SPEAKER_12]: One more reminder, we are going to get a notice out there, so hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this, but our 10-year anniversary special is next week.

460
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know we're going to have some guests that are rarely at, we don't,

461
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,480
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

462
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,016
[SPEAKER_12]: at vognetwork.com.

463
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe there'll be some special piece of loot in it for you.

464
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't say too much, but maybe.

465
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:44,419
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be on the podcast feed, though, if you absolutely have another commitment Sunday nights.

466
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, it'll be on the podcast feed.

467
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,059
[SPEAKER_12]: We would just love to see you live.

468
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:47,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Cancel them.

469
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Cancel them for us.

470
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,221
[SPEAKER_12]: We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time, and...

471
00:28:55,921 --> 00:29:01,364
[SPEAKER_12]: After tonight's show, if you want to leave a message for the 10-year anniversary show, you can do that.

472
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:03,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can do that through Friday.

473
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:06,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll have more information up on Twitter and Facebook after the show.

474
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:07,908
[SPEAKER_12]: But that will be open.

475
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:10,989
[SPEAKER_12]: We encourage our fellow podcasters to call, our fans to call.

476
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,553
[SPEAKER_12]: My only suggestion, because we are anticipating there will be a handful, I mean, not to be all ego, but we know a lot of people have been asking.

477
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,214
[SPEAKER_12]: We are anticipating a lot.

478
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So try to keep your messages brief.

479
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,916
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ramble on for five minutes, I can't play it.

480
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to have the time next week.

481
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,279
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you make it 30 seconds, it's a lot more likely to get on air.

482
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,400
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to be taking those throughout the coming week.

483
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:34,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, more details on Twitter and Facebook after the show tonight.

484
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:37,003
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, now we can get into some gaming news.

485
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:38,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, start us off tonight, please.

486
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:44,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so there's some more details regarding the Wii U. Some of the programming stuff.

487
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:57,610
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, they have infrastructure in place to allow free-to-play games, which is kind of interesting when you think about it because they've made many comments in the past about how they didn't like the fact that some of the games on the iOS platform and stuff like that

488
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,113
[SPEAKER_09]: We're too cheap and devaluing everything else.

489
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:08,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently they said that we've designed a system from a technical standpoint to allow developers to freely take advantage of things like free-to-play and microtransactions.

490
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of nice.

491
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see some of that stuff coming that way.

492
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:15,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course they're saying, you know...

493
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:30,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, they're not actively looking to enter the free-to-play market for their first-party content, but they are making it available for anybody else that may want to make a free-to-play game.

494
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:33,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you know, Nintendo's not going to do that.

495
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:36,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there's...

496
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:39,617
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

497
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:07,988
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not saying exactly how, just saying that friends codes, they're going to be there, but not the existing friend code system.

498
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be able to identify people as friends and have a certain level of interaction versus different level of interaction for more general population.

499
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,115
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

500
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, was that like the Google Groups or something like that?

501
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:25,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you can do that with Google Plus or something?

502
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:31,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows, but it's still kind of annoying that you have to do that, but whatever.

503
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:38,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course they also said that the system will allow achievements in games, however it's not mandatory.

504
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:41,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So some games will have achievements and some may not.

505
00:31:43,034 --> 00:32:07,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I just get this feeling from reading some of this stuff that it's like Nintendo's putting a lot of this stuff that they have available for other platforms right now, like achievements or trophies and some of this other different online playstiff, and they have this available for third parties, but Nintendo themselves aren't really taking advantage of it.

506
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:07,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like...

507
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:19,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, we're just going to kind of do things the way we have been doing them and we're not really going to do a lot of this online stuff or, you know, have achievements and things like that.

508
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it'd be nice if they did, but I don't know.

509
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:26,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be kind of doing all this new fancy stuff.

510
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,694
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just going to be, you know, repeating what they've done before.

511
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:32,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Translation, we don't like to do what everybody else does.

512
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:33,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do our thing.

513
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,080
[SPEAKER_04]: If everyone jumped off the bridge with you...

514
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:38,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps.

515
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,468
[SPEAKER_12]: How high is the bridge?

516
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,131
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think, though, about that achievement part not being mandatory?

517
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:52,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I find that kind of interesting because it seems like the makers of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want.

518
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:59,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, some might kind of make it in parity with whatever's on 360 and Steam and so forth, but others may just decide not to do it.

519
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:04,860
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of reminds me of Steam, though, because Steam has that kind of thing where some games do have achievements and some don't.

520
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's necessarily a deal-breaker.

521
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:10,424
[SPEAKER_09]: It is kind of disappointing that there's not going to be achievements along there.

522
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:22,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for me, it seems like, eh, we don't really want to do that, but I know you guys want to, so we're going to go ahead and allow you to do it, but we're not going to do it.

523
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just kind of seems like they're just taking the easy way out for a lot of this stuff.

524
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:28,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Have they straight up said that Pikmin's not going to have them?

525
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:30,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird.

526
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:30,408
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too hard!

527
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:30,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know,

528
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:46,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

529
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to that later, but it's just stupid.

530
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:53,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think they could land some big free-to-play games?

531
00:33:53,775 --> 00:34:01,239
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know, thinking of Steam and so forth, like, I don't know, well, DC Universe is a Sony game, so no, but maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?

532
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:01,979
[SPEAKER_12]: You know?

533
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:29,018
[SPEAKER_09]: it's good that they have that infrastructure in place so they could possibly do that and also it'd be nice to see if they have more of an MMO type thing in place I'd imagine if it's free to play with microtransactions I wouldn't see it being too difficult for them to have microtransactions for subscription models and stuff like that but it's nice to have the options there but at the same time I just kind of wish there was a little bit of a parity between everything that they're doing

534
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:37,343
[SPEAKER_12]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says certain Nintendo things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza but suck too

535
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:41,573
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,173
[SPEAKER_12]: So, of course, Nintendo was asked to comment on this whole situation.

537
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:12,597
[SPEAKER_12]: How does Nintendo intend to differentiate between what Microsoft's doing with smart glass and what Nintendo's doing?

538
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:25,127
[SPEAKER_12]: And essentially, according to Satoru Iwata, who was interviewed here, he said that basically it boils down to the fact that the controls on the tablet devices often suck.

539
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,730
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds like a challenge.

540
00:35:55,524 --> 00:36:02,446
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't play a game in a way you can play with the Wii U. And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website.

541
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,826
[SPEAKER_12]: You can check that out in that interview.

542
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:06,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also officially full of shit.

543
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:07,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

544
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:09,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I mean, because let's see here.

545
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:21,190
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're describing is basically saying, oh, well, you know, because the Wii U tablet has, you know, the buttons and stuff like that, you can play games using that that you can't play regularly.

546
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:21,370
[SPEAKER_09]: But

547
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

548
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:42,949
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

549
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:14,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, along similar lines here, since we are talking about smart glass, I think it's worth bringing up that the official Xbox Live app on iOS was updated.

550
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, there is a Microsoft Xbox app on iOS, officially by Microsoft.

551
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,461
[SPEAKER_09]: My Xbox Live.

552
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:20,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

553
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,463
[SPEAKER_12]: It was updated this week, and it was a very big update.

554
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:26,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's starting to show little hints of smart glass features in it.

555
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:31,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this feature only works on the phone for some reason and not on the iPad, which I found a little strange.

556
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,911
[SPEAKER_12]: But what you can do with it...

557
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:33,671
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

558
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing really that great.

559
00:37:56,121 --> 00:38:00,405
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of a pain to set up because you have to do it each and every time, so it's not like a big time-saving thing.

560
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:06,149
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's certainly showing hints of what's to come, what they're trying to do with this whole second screen technology.

561
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,713
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little weird that it's not on the iPad yet, but it is available definitely on the iPhone.

562
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:12,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's up now.

563
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:13,856
[SPEAKER_09]: You can download that now.

564
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:20,221
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing you could argue, though, with Nintendo is I don't have to buy another system to be able to have this technology or whatever.

565
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:28,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet, but at the same time, like I said last week, I'm just worried we're going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff.

566
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:32,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily... First off, I literally think we're going to get DS stuff.

567
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:34,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're going to do Virtual Console with the DS.

568
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:35,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh.

569
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:37,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got the same setup.

570
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:39,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to see that eventually.

571
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally, it's just going to be using...

572
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:47,720
[SPEAKER_09]: The second screen for just crap that you would have like in a start menu or something.

573
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:54,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there was a lot of games on the DS that just necessarily didn't really need that second screen.

574
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:59,288
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was there, so they used it for like, you know, here's a map or, you know...

575
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:00,869
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

576
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:33,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's switch on to the Xbox thing.

577
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:37,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And not under the name of The Lube, unfortunately.

578
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:39,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would have been awesome.

579
00:39:40,082 --> 00:39:42,584
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a document leak about an...

580
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:43,838
[SPEAKER_12]: We're done.

581
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:12,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, there was a 56-page document that was leaked for what was listed as the Xbox 720, which I'm pretty sure that's not going to be the final name.

582
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:17,172
[SPEAKER_04]: The picture that looks kind of like a squishy Dreamcast, so I think that's funny.

583
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:25,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was talking about having new things like a Metro dashboard, Xbox TV apps, smart glass, of course.

584
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:26,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

585
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:44,594
[SPEAKER_04]: and then it was you know really do you remember Rob that E3 when they announced the 360 and all the stuff they wanted it to do and how they wanted it to be a big hub it looks like they're still trying to keep that hub thing going on with the new one

586
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:59,062
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also supposed to have Blu-ray support, native 3D output and glasses, concurrent apps, peripheral support sensors, additional sensors, sorry.

587
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:05,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And this says something about a Kinect 2, and that they're debating whether or not to use 6 or 8 ARM or the...

588
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really pretty much debating processors, debating memory, debating the cores.

589
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're basically trying to make it be the be-all, end-all of anything that you should have in your living room.

590
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:28,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They're putting a price point on it of $299 with a projected 10-year life cycle.

591
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:32,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think that they'll sell more than 100 million units.

592
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's supposed to be out in 2013.

593
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing on here that I think is kind of neat is what they're calling Project Fortaleza, I guess.

594
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:46,109
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kinect glasses, where basically it's kind of like a VR thing.

595
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:50,550
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually see all those lasers that the Kinect is actually firing out.

596
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,211
[SPEAKER_12]: If you saw some of those early videos, what was it, infrared?

597
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:57,172
[SPEAKER_12]: If you actually look at the Kinect in infrared, it's like, oh my god, my room's full of lasers.

598
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:13,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing that I think is kind of cool about this is that it's supposed to be like an in-person interactivity kind of thing, which I don't know if you've got to have like a decent living room or if it's adjustable or whatever the crap.

599
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:14,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

600
00:42:15,848 --> 00:42:21,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me think of a kind of augmented reality kind of thing, which honestly I think is fully possible.

601
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:42,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you saw, for anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr, which is, I'll post it later, but on my Tumblr I posted a link about these new lenses that are full-on display that basically will project an image directly to the retina.

602
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:52,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're using it as, oh, enhancing poor eyesight and portable television that you can watch, you know, with your eyes closed pretty much.

603
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:57,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking that if they've gone that far, that this is simple.

604
00:42:57,595 --> 00:42:59,576
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be simple technology in comparison.

605
00:43:01,658 --> 00:43:05,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the document that was leaked was removed.

606
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: um so even if they're saying oh no that's not true um it was removed at the request of Covington and Burlington LLP the international law firm that Microsoft has hired hmm the plot thickens oh and by the way those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014 Loki I know you've been following this news story as well what do you think do you think it's fanboy wank or do you think it's the real deal

607
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:36,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down, so there's something in it.

608
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:38,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it's two years old.

609
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:46,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The document is not exactly brand new, but a lot of stuff, it's interesting.

610
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:53,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much, I mean, it's all speculation and all their stuff that they're just kind of talking about and thinking about.

611
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:58,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessarily their step-by-step plan of how they're going to do everything.

612
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:23,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I did think it's interesting though that how they're talking about acquiring like on live and that one of the things that they're gonna incorporate later on like in 2015 or something after the console would launch would be you know that you would never need another console again it would just any time that you would need to upgrade the games and it can't the platform can't handle it it's just streamed I don't know if that's necessarily gonna work but

613
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,926
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, a better Kinect is something obviously that we would expect and, you know, more processing power.

614
00:44:30,506 --> 00:44:32,207
[SPEAKER_09]: The glass thing looks weird.

615
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:34,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like that project glass that Google did.

616
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't mean it's going to happen.

617
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:38,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's important to say too.

618
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:41,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because they're talking about this two years ago doesn't mean it's actually going to happen.

619
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,937
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at something like the Wii Vitality Sensor.

620
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:48,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that even came out on the E3 stage and suddenly disappeared.

621
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:51,203
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it doesn't mean the glasses thing will happen.

622
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:52,556
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, butta.

623
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:20,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, it's because one time she tried to sue a company or her lawyers sued a company that published a picture of her house.

624
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:27,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, nobody, like four people in the world saw the picture of that house, two of them being the lawyers, until she sued the company.

625
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Then millions of people saw the picture of her house.

626
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:39,656
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there's a little bit of that going on here because the Microsoft lawyers, by taking down the document, have somewhat proven that there's legitimacy to it.

627
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:39,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Because

628
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:43,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft could have come out and said, oh, that thing is a bunch of crap.

629
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:47,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe it wasn't crap, but nobody would have been any wiser.

630
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:51,225
[SPEAKER_09]: No, if they just said, oh, it's crap and then...

631
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:57,406
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I don't think it's a deep within Microsoft document.

632
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:02,367
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't look professional enough to be something that was done deep within Microsoft.

633
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:05,327
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this thing leaked out of some type of affiliate arrangement.

634
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:07,948
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a third party company put this thing together.

635
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:12,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it is like directly Microsoft necessarily.

636
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:14,989
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think where there's smoke, there's fire.

637
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:18,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's definitely some hot stuff in this document.

638
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:24,051
[SPEAKER_04]: or perhaps it was a quote leak if you know what I mean.

639
00:46:25,093 --> 00:46:31,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, get it out there long enough for the news centers to catch up on it, yank it, make it look official.

640
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

641
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:44,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that, I mean, if it was like a hype-generating stunt or something, I just don't really think it would generate... It's not really generating hype because it's just all very speculative stuff.

642
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:49,757
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a badly timed one, too, especially if Microsoft's supposed to be announcing a new tablet on Monday, as all the rumors say.

643
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:54,181
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, doing something like that between E3 and a new tablet is kind of dumb.

644
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:55,402
[SPEAKER_12]: So I...

645
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:56,643
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

646
00:46:57,343 --> 00:47:01,005
[SPEAKER_12]: There's too much coincidence in here for this to not be real.

647
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing.

648
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:07,247
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the depth of that document would have been a lot to whip up.

649
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:11,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one on the internet if that's the case.

650
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:23,253
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think there's some legitimacy to this, but I don't think everything in here should be accepted as fact because A, the age, B, ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light.

651
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:27,341
[SPEAKER_12]: That's basically what it boils down to.

652
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,382
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what good brainstorming is regardless.

653
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:29,883
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

654
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You throw out the idea, you see if it's possible.

655
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:47,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the whole thing is some dumb underground marketing ploy viral thing, then maybe Microsoft's trying to get feedback on the glasses thing, but I just think this is a dumb way to do it, if that's the case.

656
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:49,919
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put out anything, the internet will respond to it.

657
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,360
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a guarantee.

658
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:58,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's something big like Microsoft, anything attached to Microsoft, the internet is definitely going to give some feedback.

659
00:47:58,503 --> 00:47:59,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me just put it this way.

660
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:06,386
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're going to come to the table with something like that in two years' time, that's not good for Nintendo.

661
00:48:06,686 --> 00:48:09,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Nintendo, they're not bringing a whole lot to the table right now.

662
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,588
[SPEAKER_09]: They're bringing like, hey, look, we can use the tablet with our system.

663
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:14,669
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a Wii that does HD.

664
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,749
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not...

665
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:44,716
[SPEAKER_09]: this opens up a lot of possibilities of how you can make games and other applications and stuff but I don't know we'll see it's just especially since they're talking about these glasses or whatever not launching with the system I don't know probably need to see either way going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com not a whole lot of comments on this story a lot of people still commenting about DS and tech specifications and all this stuff but TigerClaw says smart glass how about dumb glass

666
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:46,371
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

667
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:12,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Very few people go that extra mile to use it.

668
00:49:12,178 --> 00:49:12,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's be real.

669
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:16,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of you do, especially for movies that you love.

670
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,061
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a given, but very few people do it.

671
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:27,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not necessarily that this is something that's not possible right now before this update because EA games have been doing this with Mass Effect and stuff.

672
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:28,845
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll have stuff that ties in with that.

673
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:31,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, you can even do with Call of Duty Elite.

674
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:38,329
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get the app for that on your Android or iOS devices and you can tweak shit on there before you play the game.

675
00:49:40,009 --> 00:50:07,857
[SPEAKER_09]: so they have this kind of stuff available already and it's not that like that doesn't sell a game tip for me I mean if you know oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet I'm not gonna go oh I gotta get Madden now I mean it doesn't seem like it's something that's really gonna sell me on games I love this DC Nate in our chat room says an alternate screen for your console Dreamcast sheds another tear it was just it further proves that thing was just ahead of its time well and

676
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo kind of already had that going on with that connection to the...

677
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Crystal Chronicles.

678
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:22,768
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just call it the Crystal Chronicles because that and Four Swords were the only games that really used it.

679
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man.

680
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,050
[SPEAKER_12]: And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific.

681
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:30,293
[SPEAKER_12]: But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals, five games used it and then it disappeared.

682
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:35,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Like their LAN adapter?

683
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,118
[SPEAKER_12]: One game used it and then it disappeared.

684
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:42,801
[SPEAKER_12]: And then a bunch of people hacked it so Mario Kart or the Warp Pipe or whatever it was.

685
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:46,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was over the internet stuff.

686
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:48,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about using the actual LAN adapter.

687
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:50,661
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter.

688
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe online, but as far as LAN system is concerned.

689
00:50:54,505 --> 00:50:55,186
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right, you're right.

690
00:50:56,027 --> 00:51:02,053
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's move on so we can get to the classic game of the week and release dates and all that good stuff.

691
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:03,255
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, some more news stories.

692
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

693
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:21,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so there's some hoo-ha, I guess, about UDRAW, and basically a Georgia law firm is investigating THQ to see if they misled their investors about the demand for the UDRAW tablet.

694
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:28,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I thought it was a really cool idea, so I could see where they could think that the demand would be really high, and then it wasn't.

695
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: um and also you know i wonder if that a lot of that kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying that i think at one time nintendo was going to make a few um games or whatever that would support it and hell let's just get on the topic of the wii u here why wasn't mario paint one of the launch titles for this system i mean that seems like a perfect title for the wii u just saying um

696
00:51:56,212 --> 00:52:03,756
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they're still checking them out and making sure that there wasn't any false and misleading statements about its progress.

697
00:52:04,516 --> 00:52:13,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say that this is not the first franchise that they were kind of supposedly misleading people on.

698
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:15,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say maybe UFC or something.

699
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:17,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

700
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:19,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

701
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:23,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I know those Udraw tablets, they still have a ton of them sitting around and they're going for dirt cheap.

702
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:30,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm, THQ's been in a company that's had some rough times lately, too.

703
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,934
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a fascinating story to me.

704
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:46,599
[SPEAKER_09]: What is, like, I mean, could it be that they just said, okay, I understand that they're saying the demand's high, and so what if they believe the demand, they literally believe that the demand is going to be high for it, and it just flops?

705
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is that misleading your investors?

706
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate with how much the demand is, but what if it's just like...

707
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,884
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

708
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:20,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it was that MMO never coming out too that really didn't do well for them.

709
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:29,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I always have a problem when you have a device that requires a special peripheral because now you're locked in the buying games that require that peripheral.

710
00:53:29,312 --> 00:53:34,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's not something that's widely used by a bunch of different companies, because it was only THQ that was putting out stuff for it.

711
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they had licenses for like SpongeBob and Disney Princess stuff and all that.

712
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:39,102
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

713
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:40,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Outro Music

714
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:04,252
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom theorizes perhaps Mario Paint's coming later.

715
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:06,354
[SPEAKER_12]: It might just be one of their apps.

716
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:06,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

717
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:09,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think Nintendo's over Mario Paint.

718
00:54:09,677 --> 00:54:12,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago.

719
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It still should.

720
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:19,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my gosh, what if I don't want to post it publicly?

721
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,427
[SPEAKER_12]: What if I just want to send her a private penis?

722
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:21,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well...

723
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:50,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Private P and I are the best I don't know how deep the moderation goes Are they that deep?

724
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:57,950
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too How long before penises are being sent all over the Wii U network?

725
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:05,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Instantly There's no doubt about it The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination?

726
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:11,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out what I do with my Wii U You're listening to Orange Penis Radio Someone will see that penis and it will be the moderator

727
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:16,463
[SPEAKER_09]: The moderator will come home after the first day like, I have seen so much penis today.

728
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:18,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I'm working in the porn industry.

729
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:21,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord, dry up this river of penis.

730
00:55:25,028 --> 00:55:25,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew you would get that one.

731
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:36,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know what's funny is that, and I don't remember if we talked about this on the show or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody after the fact, so I apologize if I'm not crediting the right person with this, but somebody was theorizing.

732
00:55:36,994 --> 00:55:38,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I think maybe it was on Facebook.

733
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:43,058
[SPEAKER_12]: that Nintendo's probably going to hire an outsource company to do all this moderation.

734
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:55,965
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're going to have this huge call center-esque thing filled with people in either the Philippines or India, and these poor people are going to see penises all day long.

735
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:03,838
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be done in Redmond.

736
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:36,065
[SPEAKER_09]: and, like, Rob keeps dying at this one spot and goes, oh, this is so hard, and I can tell him, quit whining, you fucking pansy, you know, and should be able to have that little thing pop up, you know, over World 3-1 or something like that.

737
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should that all be censored?

738
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: You're censoring my fun.

739
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,669
[SPEAKER_09]: No one wants to censor my fun.

740
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:47,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers and all of a sudden, boop, you have a message.

741
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:48,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, open up the message.

742
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:49,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Penis!

743
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:52,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god!

744
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:54,479
[SPEAKER_12]: or Tits.

745
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:01,844
[SPEAKER_12]: They should totally have it in New Super Mario Bros.

746
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:04,526
[SPEAKER_09]: U where you can draw on the background of the levels.

747
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:08,089
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to just stop and sketch something on the levels.

748
00:57:09,249 --> 00:57:14,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Alpha Cananagram in chat says, Sky, Mario Paint on the DS was Wario Do It Yourself.

749
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:37,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot about that that was Nintendo we don't want to fucking make a game you make it yourself the game or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me let's see the chat room is wondering where Pen15 is tonight this would be a perfect conversation for him but sadly not here alright anyhow anything else you want to say about Penis or I'm sorry this news story that's it

750
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:46,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U. Apparently, some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo didn't show their big game at E3.

751
00:57:46,602 --> 00:57:52,304
[SPEAKER_12]: After all, Destiny wasn't shown on the Xbox, so maybe something was held back a little bit.

752
00:57:52,765 --> 00:57:58,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is because of a tweet that game trailers editor-in-chief Shane Satterfield said.

753
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:01,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, he said before E3...

754
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:23,943
[SPEAKER_12]: That the Wii U launch lineup was looking pretty damn good Well if that's the case, and he's probably the only one that was thinking that But it came out later, he went on Twitter and said, quote Just realized that a Wii U game I knew about well before E3 was never announced at the show I know of one I'm guessing there's others to come as well Oh really?

755
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:26,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah Care to share?

756
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:27,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sure.

757
00:58:27,846 --> 00:58:28,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

758
00:58:28,347 --> 00:58:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

759
00:58:28,707 --> 00:58:39,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this got me into a topic on Twitter earlier this week that revealed to me what I believe is the actual launch date for the Wii U, which would be November 18th.

760
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:42,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to check my date.

761
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:42,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Sunday.

762
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

763
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

764
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:46,082
[SPEAKER_12]: That way you can camp out Saturday, right?

765
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:47,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sunday.

766
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays.

767
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:50,546
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why.

768
00:58:50,586 --> 00:58:52,067
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just obsessed with fucking Sundays.

769
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:54,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, November 18th.

770
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:58,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, remember before I said, well, the 13th is going to be out.

771
00:58:58,552 --> 00:59:02,615
[SPEAKER_09]: The 13th or before because there was a game that was dated for the 13th.

772
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's other games dated for the 20th.

773
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:06,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense.

774
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:09,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just like the Vita launch, there was stuff that was out the week before.

775
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:11,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Could it just be a really good guest placeholder?

776
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:18,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Because honestly, if I were to make an educated guess, the weekend before Thanksgiving, yeah, it's kind of in line with the way they usually do it.

777
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:21,143
[SPEAKER_09]: But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays.

778
00:59:22,823 --> 00:59:23,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

779
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:38,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And the game in question would be from Disney, and it's their big game, which would be Epic Mickey 2, which has not been announced yet for the Wii U, and I don't know when it will be announced, but it's coming.

780
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:44,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup that they didn't talk about at all.

781
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:53,361
[SPEAKER_12]: WhatupG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rumor has it Nintendo is going to show Retro's game, which of course still is nowhere to be seen.

782
00:59:54,102 --> 00:59:55,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it's the F-Zero game?

783
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:58,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream, dream, dream, fanboy, wank, wank, wank?

784
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:01,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be cool.

785
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... Alright.

786
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

787
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,101
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah.

788
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:08,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so... That's, you know, one.

789
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:12,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that there was one I saw for Transformers.

790
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:13,844
[SPEAKER_09]: The new Transformers Prime.

791
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:15,485
[SPEAKER_09]: People don't really care about that.

792
01:00:15,665 --> 01:00:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

793
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:16,905
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, Epic Mickey, too.

794
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:21,027
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty big fucking title not to mention at all.

795
01:00:21,387 --> 01:00:23,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, unless they're worried that it's not going to be out at launch.

796
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:23,808
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

797
01:00:26,612 --> 01:00:29,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I have things that say otherwise.

798
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:30,694
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

799
01:00:31,214 --> 01:00:38,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, right alongside that, a story came out that Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U third-party games are yet to be announced.

800
01:00:39,077 --> 01:00:43,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a quote from David Yarrington, who's the head of Nintendo's UK division.

801
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:46,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, this was in Nintendo Gamer Magazine.

802
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:54,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It said, quote, I think a lot of third-party companies are developing for Wii U, and a lot of it hasn't been announced, but we can't comment on speculation.

803
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:54,923
[SPEAKER_12]: There has been.

804
01:00:55,003 --> 01:00:57,285
[SPEAKER_12]: There are lots of things everybody wishes for.

805
01:00:57,846 --> 01:01:00,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Duty is another one that's confirmed.

806
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: But they haven't announced it yet.

807
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:07,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also haven't announced it for the Wii yet either.

808
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:09,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So that comes usually later.

809
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:09,996
[SPEAKER_12]: What does this mean?

810
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:13,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo's waiting for their Tokyo Game Show concurrent event?

811
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:16,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they don't do Tokyo Game Show, but they usually do a big event.

812
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:45,155
[SPEAKER_09]: they may be announcing more stuff there I think it's just the way that these companies are they don't announce that far out ahead sometimes like Call of Duty every year it seems to be it's always going to be Playstation 3, Xbox 360, PC announced and then later on like last year it was at their live Call of Duty event in LA that they announced the Wii version and then also DS and there was the you know the Elite stuff and the

813
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:48,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Special Editions and stuff like that.

814
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,609
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that stuff's been announced yet.

815
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:54,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Reality check, the system's out in five months.

816
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:58,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Assuming it's out in November, which is obviously a safe bet, that's five months from now.

817
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,377
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a whole lot of time to finish up the games if you don't already know you're doing it.

818
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:05,686
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting.

819
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:08,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe there'll be something closer to the end of summer.

820
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:09,749
[SPEAKER_12]: When is Tokyo Game Show, though?

821
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:10,309
[SPEAKER_12]: October?

822
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:11,070
[SPEAKER_12]: September.

823
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:12,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's September?

824
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:12,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually.

825
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:16,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe two months is enough lead time, but one month definitely isn't.

826
01:02:17,074 --> 01:02:25,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of these games, I mean, I don't see them talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo Game Show because that's not really a title skewed towards the Japanese market.

827
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,164
[SPEAKER_12]: WhatUpG in our chatroom says, EA says they will announce a couple of games at Gamescom for Wii U.

828
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:33,570
[SPEAKER_09]: FIFA, probably.

829
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:40,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about NBA Live, but FIFA, I think, is for sure on the Wii U. Which Gamescom would be the place to announce that, too.

830
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:46,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think they've already said FIFA was going to be on the Wii U. Madden is on the Wii U, I believe.

831
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:47,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's already been announced.

832
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:49,298
[SPEAKER_12]: AkumaJP is in our chat.

833
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:52,840
[SPEAKER_12]: He lives in Japan and has gone to Tokyo Game Show and confirms it's September.

834
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:53,500
[SPEAKER_12]: My bad.

835
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was October for some reason.

836
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:56,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

837
01:02:58,372 --> 01:02:59,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

838
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:03,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I definitely agree there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet.

839
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:08,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for sure, there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet.

840
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:13,431
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know everything that's not been announced.

841
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:14,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

842
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:24,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that one, and I know that has a firm date on it because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff, and there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before and the week after, so it seems to fit.

843
01:03:26,379 --> 01:03:29,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, they're delaying the game.

844
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:31,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's even made it out yet.

845
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:34,804
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is not coming out in September anymore, obviously, on all the other platforms.

846
01:03:35,304 --> 01:03:40,067
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been confirmed, I know, for Europe, but they have not announced North America yet, but that is also going to be delayed.

847
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Europe, it's coming out on the 20th.

848
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you think about it, the console is probably not going to launch.

849
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:51,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's going to launch at the same time roughly in all regions, but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday like they did with the Wii.

850
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:54,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii launched on a Sunday, I believe, if I remember correctly.

851
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:55,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it did.

852
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:02,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember we went out really late at night and we were doing the whole, we gave orange soda and donuts and coffee or something.

853
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:07,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember we were going out and Breslau was here and everything and the lesbians, we all went out.

854
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it was just me and Kristen.

855
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:13,679
[SPEAKER_12]: We were at the... Yeah, Extifer was at Target with you guys, wasn't he?

856
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Extifer.

857
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,382
[SPEAKER_04]: For a little bit.

858
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:18,123
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me.

859
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:19,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at that Target.

860
01:04:19,865 --> 01:04:22,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at the... Oh, you guys went somewhere else.

861
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:22,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Citrus Heights Target.

862
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:23,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so was Extifer.

863
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:29,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember him being there with us because we were just sitting there exchanging fanfiction and stuff.

864
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:32,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, I had a Wii the day it came out because Xtifer camped out for it.

865
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:33,234
[SPEAKER_12]: He was at that Target.

866
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:35,455
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a long time ago.

867
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:37,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't remember seeing him then.

868
01:04:37,516 --> 01:04:38,477
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a long time ago.

869
01:04:38,497 --> 01:04:40,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we would have been hanging out with him.

870
01:04:40,778 --> 01:04:44,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because remember we went to Winco, I believe, and something got orange soda.

871
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: No, all we did was go to Krispy Kreme and get donuts and coffee.

872
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:49,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I remember hearing about that.

873
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:51,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I only stayed out until about 2 a.m.

874
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:53,381
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I was like, fuck it, I'm going home.

875
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:54,262
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not staying out for that.

876
01:04:55,743 --> 01:04:58,887
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, one more story for you guys, then we're going to travel around the world and look at release dates.

877
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,488
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, Dark Sakura has a story for us.

878
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:02,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, don't I?

879
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about a game that we've brought up on the show before, Draw Something.

880
01:05:08,494 --> 01:05:08,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Over it.

881
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:10,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

882
01:05:11,476 --> 01:05:18,701
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, it's kind of funny that just as soon as Zynga purchased OMG Pop, people stopped playing it.

883
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:24,025
[SPEAKER_04]: They dropped something like 10... Never mind.

884
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:30,850
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost 10 million monthly active users in 30 days.

885
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:39,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, they might be doing a TV show with CBS that's kind of along the lines of what Win, Lose, or Draw was.

886
01:05:40,557 --> 01:05:42,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they have that host with the awesome hair.

887
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:43,199
[SPEAKER_12]: What was his name?

888
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:43,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Burt something?

889
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Not Burt Reynolds, but Burt something else.

890
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:47,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

891
01:05:47,963 --> 01:05:48,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, man.

892
01:05:50,144 --> 01:05:50,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

893
01:05:52,621 --> 01:06:15,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, while that's still in the talks, they're thinking about bringing it out in more languages, including Chinese Well, I mean, if they have a successful TV show based off of it, it would certainly justify some of that extremely high price I have decided that Draw Something would be much easier if I had an iPad

894
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:21,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh hey, this says a complete episode of Win, Lose, or Draw available here.

895
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Complete with commercials!

896
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,090
[SPEAKER_12]: I love stuff like this on YouTube.

897
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:30,871
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing.

898
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:32,812
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Coke commercial.

899
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:36,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, let me... Let me fast forward here.

900
01:06:36,675 --> 01:06:37,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

901
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:38,036
[SPEAKER_12]: There's Win, Lose, or Draw.

902
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:41,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Burt Condie!

903
01:06:41,758 --> 01:06:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they all sit on the floor and play.

904
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,520
[SPEAKER_12]: This show is awesome.

905
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, that's Alan Thicke.

906
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:56,350
[SPEAKER_01]: That hair.

907
01:06:59,574 --> 01:07:01,156
[SPEAKER_12]: What ever happened to Lonnie Anderson?

908
01:07:01,697 --> 01:07:02,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's find out.

909
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:11,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, I could do this all night, but we better not.

910
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:15,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it says right here in the description, Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds, and Alan Thicke.

911
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:21,416
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope they have awesome B-list celebrities on Draw Something TV.

912
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:22,917
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be the only reason to watch.

913
01:07:23,898 --> 01:07:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

914
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:25,479
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

915
01:07:25,979 --> 01:07:29,141
[SPEAKER_04]: She just is still kind of plasticky looking.

916
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:31,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Lonnie Anderson's got to be like 65 at least.

917
01:07:32,023 --> 01:07:32,704
[SPEAKER_04]: She was born in 45, so yeah.

918
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:42,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they'll have people drawing really elaborate pictures to something simple, like Darth Vader holding a cup and it's a cup.

919
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:46,780
[SPEAKER_12]: She's on her fourth marriage.

920
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,082
[SPEAKER_12]: A sitting vampire in our chatroom says, bring back old game shows.

921
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Supermarket sweep, please.

922
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:54,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yes.

923
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,946
[SPEAKER_04]: The last movie she was in was A Night at the Roxbury.

924
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know what they need to do.

925
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,310
[SPEAKER_12]: So here's the trick.

926
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:17,173
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to bring Supermarket Sweep back, you've got to write a new app for iOS that mimics the old game show and throwing hams into a cart and brewing the coffee for a bonus $200 and those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup that were the bonus prizes.

927
01:08:17,613 --> 01:08:20,614
[SPEAKER_12]: And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show out of your iOS game.

928
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:22,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the last two shows she was on.

929
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:22,934
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

930
01:08:23,174 --> 01:08:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Was one called The Mullets.

931
01:08:25,415 --> 01:08:25,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

932
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:26,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And then So Notorious.

933
01:08:28,044 --> 01:08:30,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh god, that was the Tori Spelling Show.

934
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, that show was really good.

935
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:35,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't judge me.

936
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:36,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Do not judge me.

937
01:08:36,827 --> 01:08:37,487
[SPEAKER_12]: You're judging me.

938
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:39,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I am judging you.

939
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:43,849
[SPEAKER_12]: You just said, I of judgment, almost.

940
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:45,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, I am judging you.

941
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Release dates.

942
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:55,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U. That statement doesn't require extra garbage to play a card game.

943
01:08:56,224 --> 01:09:02,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So coming out actually tomorrow, Pokemon Conquest on the DS.

944
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:07,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It crosses Nobunaga's Ambition and Pokemon.

945
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:10,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that really needed to be crossed.

946
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:13,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people are looking forward to it.

947
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:28,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Disney Pixar's Brave the video game on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii and DS Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii 3DS DS Vita and PC

948
01:09:30,948 --> 01:09:36,997
[SPEAKER_09]: and Steel Battalion Heavy Armor, a game that's going to really suck using the Kinect.

949
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:39,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is also coming out.

950
01:09:40,622 --> 01:09:43,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and I re-released the Quake 4 because now Bethesda is releasing it.

951
01:09:46,036 --> 01:10:05,400
[SPEAKER_12]: of course of course I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering we better not have another power outage before part A finishes here I watch way too much Supernatural I'd rather have the power outage today than next week okay yeah right don't jinx it I'm not jinxing it I don't know what we're next week we're gonna need to have like a moratorium on power in this place because I don't want to blow a fuse

952
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:15,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, going to Japan and looking at release dates over there, we have on the Nintendo 3DS, Hello Kitty!

953
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:27,226
[SPEAKER_12]: From Compile, who I am pissed Compile is around, and instead of doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making Hello Kitty games.

954
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:29,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, get with it, Compile.

955
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:31,679
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what your people want.

956
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:33,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be hilarious?

957
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:36,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Rare announces, or was it not Rare?

958
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:42,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Retro Studios announces Guardian Legend Cross F-Zero, the racing action shooter game.

959
01:10:42,911 --> 01:10:44,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I would jizz.

960
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:45,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not even going to hold back.

961
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:48,351
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what would happen.

962
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:54,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear Solid collection coming out next week in Japan.

963
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:55,456
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not this week, sorry to say.

964
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:57,037
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the PlayStation 3?

965
01:10:57,157 --> 01:11:00,038
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some stuff from Sega this week.

966
01:11:00,198 --> 01:11:00,899
[SPEAKER_12]: K-On!

967
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:03,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Hokago Live HD version.

968
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:08,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Mass Effect 2 gets a Best Hits version, and I think that's the version that comes with all the DLC.

969
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:11,585
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if that's localized with voice acting for Japan.

970
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:12,185
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

971
01:11:13,286 --> 01:11:16,008
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to play a copy of that just, you know, because it's fun and different.

972
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:28,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Sniper Ghost Warrior comes out as well, and Shutsugeki Otometachi no Senju 2 comes out from System Soft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game we have over here.

973
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:29,718
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it is.

974
01:11:30,879 --> 01:11:32,300
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not something I recognize.

975
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Lol, no.

976
01:11:35,202 --> 01:11:39,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking to see if, yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts, Japanese, I wonder if it's,

977
01:11:41,274 --> 01:11:42,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see some dialogue.

978
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:43,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not.

979
01:11:44,076 --> 01:11:45,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is kind of cool, actually.

980
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:45,898
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

981
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:47,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Something SSJ100Matt said in chat.

982
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:48,499
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

983
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release days on Sundays.

984
01:11:53,463 --> 01:11:57,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, back in the Super NES days, they would release games during the week in Japan.

985
01:11:57,686 --> 01:12:01,709
[SPEAKER_04]: When games were released during the week, people would skip work and school to buy and play games.

986
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the Japanese government requested Nintendo change their release dates to the weekend so there's no lost productivity.

987
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:09,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

988
01:12:09,836 --> 01:12:10,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

989
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:12,652
[SPEAKER_12]: And knowing is half the battle

990
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for the UK, not a whole bunch.

991
01:12:25,352 --> 01:12:26,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really short list.

992
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:32,436
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 20th, Magic the Gathering, Duel of the Planewalkers 2013.

993
01:12:33,497 --> 01:12:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 21st, Mutant Muds on 3DS.

994
01:12:37,059 --> 01:12:41,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, on the 22nd, Civ V, Gods and Kings.

995
01:12:42,762 --> 01:12:44,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And Steel Battalion, Heavy Armor.

996
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:45,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it until the 25th.

997
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:45,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So, nope.

998
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:47,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

999
01:12:49,204 --> 01:13:18,097
[SPEAKER_12]: nothing well I mean nothing I guess really good unless you're a big Civ fan I guess that would apply to you Rob but you're not in the UK so how about well the good news is it's out here and it's out next week or I think it came out this week I need to check yeah I gotta plan an epic Civ 5 night with some friends but like literally that's an all day all night event so it'll be sometime in July yep well so how about moving on to another story

1000
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:21,663
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we can do that.

1001
01:13:21,683 --> 01:13:23,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm out of stuff for the UK.

1002
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,105
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

1003
01:13:24,425 --> 01:13:34,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about Star Wars and how, you know, something that they announced during E3 that Star Wars, the older public, is going to be free to, well, not really free to play, but you can play for free up to level 15.

1004
01:13:35,696 --> 01:13:41,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, people are wondering, are they actually just testing the market with this?

1005
01:13:41,321 --> 01:13:41,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1006
01:13:42,542 --> 01:14:02,840
[SPEAKER_09]: and apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case, they're saying that because before they lost 400,000 subscribers, and it's probably going to get worse once the new World of Warcraft expansion comes out, but they're saying if it was just free-to-play games and they weren't very good, it wouldn't even be a question, but

1007
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,421
[SPEAKER_09]: There are definitely good games out there and good games coming out.

1008
01:14:06,561 --> 01:14:11,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, all of this competition impacts your plan and with what you want to do.

1009
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's interesting.

1010
01:14:15,443 --> 01:14:18,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the other interesting thing is this article got pulled as well.

1011
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:27,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe they are going to go all the way and make it free play, especially if it's just not panning out like they were hoping.

1012
01:14:28,103 --> 01:14:28,804
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1013
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:46,266
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1014
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,238
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1015
01:15:21,072 --> 01:15:21,813
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1016
01:15:40,796 --> 01:16:07,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Star Wars wasn't didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff to me I mean certainly there were some things inspired by WoW but there was a lot that kind of tied into the other Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth there was a lot it was a good single-player game that's for sure and I think that's what happened a lot of people played to 50 and then that was kind of it you know I think that ended up being part of the problem they invested so much in the single player with all the voice acting and everything but

1017
01:16:07,893 --> 01:16:10,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think that might have been one of the big mistakes.

1018
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much of the voice acting.

1019
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:19,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yes, it really adds a great deep element and immersion into the game, but I think that was a resource that could have been better spent somewhere else.

1020
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:23,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Like more servers.

1021
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:24,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not even that.

1022
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:25,974
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't need more servers.

1023
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:27,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek Online

1024
01:16:47,512 --> 01:16:48,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Zachary Quinto did some, right?

1025
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:53,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, as the EMH, the emergency medical hologram for the first mission.

1026
01:16:54,055 --> 01:16:56,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything.

1027
01:16:56,956 --> 01:17:00,558
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have people saying, hey, give me money or anything.

1028
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:03,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and WOW has very limited voice acting.

1029
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:05,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1030
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've managed to get dedicated voice actors for their main people.

1031
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

1032
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, even What's-His-Face, Metzen, does half of everybody, including Thrall.

1033
01:17:18,803 --> 01:17:23,844
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think their best voice actor, though, is the lady that does Sylvanas.

1034
01:17:24,164 --> 01:17:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, oh my god, that just chills.

1035
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:26,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1036
01:17:26,425 --> 01:17:34,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so they put the money into making sure there's one dedicated server that can handle everybody that's on it.

1037
01:17:34,548 --> 01:17:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your beta test server.

1038
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the voices go, they didn't license any music.

1039
01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:41,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really kind of limited.

1040
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:46,211
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't care once you're playing it because the game itself is in-depth.

1041
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:48,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where you're getting into the difference.

1042
01:17:49,352 --> 01:17:56,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week, and it has to do with Ubisoft, or as a lot of people have been calling them since last week, Boobisoft.

1043
01:17:57,116 --> 01:17:59,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Boobisoft is apparently talking to Warner Bros.

1044
01:17:59,337 --> 01:18:03,219
[SPEAKER_12]: and Paramount for a movie dealing with Splinter Cell.

1045
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,761
[SPEAKER_12]: This is according to a report from Deadline.

1046
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Ubisoft is in talks with Warner Bros.

1047
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:10,983
[SPEAKER_12]: and Paramount over a film tie-in.

1048
01:18:11,403 --> 01:18:13,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow.

1049
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:17,428
[SPEAKER_12]: It could also follow a new kind of story set in the same universe.

1050
01:18:18,168 --> 01:18:23,712
[SPEAKER_12]: However, it is worth pointing out there have also been in the past deals on Uncharted and Bioshock.

1051
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:25,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing's happened yet.

1052
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So just because they're talking about it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it.

1053
01:18:30,317 --> 01:18:38,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft has also registered some domains in regards to their new IP Watch Dogs.

1054
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:46,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, that was the big game they showed at the end of their press conference that made a lot of people pay attention, and some said kind of stole the show away from the big companies.

1055
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:53,737
[SPEAKER_12]: They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie, Watch Dogs The Movie, Watch-Dogs The Movie, and so forth.

1056
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:57,200
[SPEAKER_12]: This could mean that there's plans or talks about a movie

1057
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,222
[SPEAKER_12]: I also kind of think this could just be protection of the intellectual property.

1058
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:03,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to make sure.

1059
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:07,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or whatever or something.

1060
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:10,025
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe because the game looks so good, it could be a movie.

1061
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:14,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it for one when they start seeing the commercials on TV.

1062
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:19,329
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think you necessarily want to read into this that they're absolutely making a movie because of this.

1063
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:21,490
[SPEAKER_12]: This could just be trying to protect something.

1064
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:42,739
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same reason why we registered thevognetwork.com Because so many hosts were calling it the VOG Network Kind of a similar thing Alright, let's go back to a time when games were simpler And they weren't making movies out of every single stinking game In fact, the only game that got a movie was Super Mario Bros.

1065
01:19:42,859 --> 01:19:43,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sucked

1066
01:19:49,278 --> 01:19:50,278
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the classic game of the week.

1067
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:56,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And since it's not the classic video game of the week, screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game.

1068
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,120
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't say classic video game of the week.

1069
01:19:59,180 --> 01:19:59,860
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a point.

1070
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,220
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in my house, too.

1071
01:20:03,461 --> 01:20:08,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Twilight Zone that was done by Bally Midway.

1072
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Mortal Kombat.

1073
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:24,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it was designed by Pat Lawler, who is one of the all-time best pinball table designers.

1074
01:20:25,178 --> 01:20:27,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over his list just real quick.

1075
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,280
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Earthshaker and Whirlwind.

1076
01:20:30,641 --> 01:20:33,982
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Funhaus, where you got to hit that ugly guy in the head a bunch of times.

1077
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:35,823
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Addams Family.

1078
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:37,963
[SPEAKER_04]: He did Safecracker.

1079
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:45,746
[SPEAKER_04]: With Stern, he did Rollercoaster Tycoon, Ripley's Believe It or Not, NASCAR, Family Guy, CSI, and Shrek.

1080
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:50,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this guy is, he's done some of the best tables out there.

1081
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:52,889
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1082
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:14,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1083
01:21:15,323 --> 01:21:15,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1084
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:36,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew you were going to do that.

1085
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:51,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a working analog clock that has a timer for different modes, a power field, which is basically like right on top of the left hand side of the thing.

1086
01:21:51,457 --> 01:21:57,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, instead of using flippers, you're using magnets to play the ball through this little mini field.

1087
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:06,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Powerball, where you use a white ceramic ball that's lighter and it's given that it's not magnetic, it's not affected by the magnets in the table.

1088
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It also uses the original theme from the Twilight Zone.

1089
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:22,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also uses... I don't know who likes their early 80s rock, but it uses the song Twilight Zone by Golden Earring.

1090
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:30,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually has a really good vocal likeness.

1091
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim Kittrow did the voice of Rod Serling.

1092
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1093
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:42,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was supposed to be the first game to use the Williams Midway DCS sound system, but it was still being developed.

1094
01:22:43,134 --> 01:22:47,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it used the Yamaha YM2151 Harris CVSD soundboard.

1095
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:55,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it is considered right now the top rated electronic pinball table of its time.

1096
01:22:57,526 --> 01:23:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as little fun stuff that's in there, and I'm just going to read through the list on here.

1097
01:23:02,531 --> 01:23:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the door from the opening credits right in the center of the playfield.

1098
01:23:07,876 --> 01:23:11,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the mannequin, the zodiac clock from the very beginning.

1099
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:17,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It has an image of Henry Burness from the episode Time Enough At Last.

1100
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:24,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's next to the slot machine, the hitchhiker, the slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover.

1101
01:23:24,807 --> 01:23:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the most unusual camera, which is actually a pretty good episode.

1102
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:34,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The invader, static, the piano of the house has the player piano from that.

1103
01:23:35,133 --> 01:23:36,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Talky Tina from The Living Doll.

1104
01:23:37,748 --> 01:23:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your extra ball!

1105
01:23:39,489 --> 01:23:40,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's pretty cool.

1106
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:43,750
[SPEAKER_12]: They need the Tower of Terror, where your balls just drop.

1107
01:23:45,571 --> 01:24:01,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Robbie the Robot is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center at Whipple's, is on the playfield and in an animation, and different sound effects like the Serling voiceovers, and my favorite one, which we heard right at the beginning, you unlock this door with the key of imagination.

1108
01:24:02,757 --> 01:24:05,218
[SPEAKER_04]: May I present a most unusual camera.

1109
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:06,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that type of stuff.

1110
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:23,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have different door panel modes where one is like 10 million points, the light the gumball, the town square madness, fast lock, super skill shot, the super slot, the extra ball, the camera.

1111
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:26,205
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game.

1112
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:34,268
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the spiral, clock millions, battle the power, greed, which actually is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family.

1113
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Greed

1114
01:25:02,921 --> 01:25:03,522
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1115
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you light all of the door panels, you get a doorknob with a question mark.

1116
01:25:29,064 --> 01:25:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And it pops open and you have 45 seconds to make an unlimited number of shots to all the targets.

1117
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:40,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically every playable single ball mode is active during this time period.

1118
01:25:40,947 --> 01:25:43,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically 45 seconds of three for all.

1119
01:25:45,829 --> 01:25:46,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1120
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:52,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the machines, though, you have your standard multiball with three being released.

1121
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:54,976
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of custom mods that people have done.

1122
01:25:56,618 --> 01:26:01,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one person added in the Robbie the Robot toy into their machine.

1123
01:26:01,803 --> 01:26:07,148
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other design mods like the third play field magnet, the gumball flashers, the gumballs.

1124
01:26:07,188 --> 01:26:10,391
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually, I think, added an LED into ours, I want to say.

1125
01:26:13,013 --> 01:26:15,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Gumball Flasher that's an independent mod.

1126
01:26:16,915 --> 01:26:20,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Different colors, different things you can add in.

1127
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:22,779
[SPEAKER_04]: People mod their stuff all the way.

1128
01:26:22,839 --> 01:26:24,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's the cool stuff.

1129
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,822
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play Twilight Zone anytime you want to.

1130
01:26:28,602 --> 01:26:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a licensed table for the Pinball Arcade.

1131
01:26:31,224 --> 01:26:39,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out on Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3, PS Vita, and it's supposed to be out for the 3DS, Windows, and Mac OS.

1132
01:26:40,589 --> 01:27:07,767
[SPEAKER_04]: and so it kind of is a game like a like a console game well and for anyone who still uses VPN which is basically how we played it for the longest time in my house you can play it on Windows I think there's also a version of pin name and pin name for for Linux I want to say so there you go that's the game it's a Twilight Zone are you lost in the zone do you unlock this door with the key of imagination

1133
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:17,782
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is, Twilight Zone, the pinball game, but now accessible thanks to the wonders of emulation on the 360 and PlayStation Network and iPhone and all that good stuff.

1134
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:18,922
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is.

1135
01:27:20,062 --> 01:27:20,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Neat choice.

1136
01:27:21,123 --> 01:27:22,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Something a little bit outside the box.

1137
01:27:22,423 --> 01:27:22,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.

1138
01:27:23,643 --> 01:27:26,784
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we are going to take a quick break, but there's plenty more OLR to come.

1139
01:27:26,904 --> 01:27:27,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't miss it.

1140
01:27:27,524 --> 01:27:35,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the Fugle Question of the Week, some rapid-fire news coming your way, and of course, the mailbag and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1141
01:27:35,505 --> 01:27:37,746
[SPEAKER_12]: All when we come back after a quick break with more...

1142
01:27:38,266 --> 01:27:39,968
[SPEAKER_12]: of Orange Lounge Radio.

1143
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:07,426
[SPEAKER_12]: has his kid, Josh.

1144
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:11,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I see a lot of pictures that the missus has been putting up on Facebook.

1145
01:28:11,272 --> 01:28:11,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Very cute.

1146
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:13,436
[SPEAKER_12]: He was playing with another kid today, it looks like.

1147
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:14,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the other day.

1148
01:28:14,537 --> 01:28:14,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1149
01:28:14,918 --> 01:28:16,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I just saw the picture today or the video.

1150
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:17,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1151
01:28:17,903 --> 01:28:18,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Still pretty cool.

1152
01:28:18,403 --> 01:28:19,525
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the cutest hair.

1153
01:28:20,286 --> 01:28:21,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course... He has haircut.

1154
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:23,570
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:28:40,786 --> 01:28:41,327
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1156
01:28:42,388 --> 01:28:46,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Clover Nikon in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I am a gamer uncle.

1157
01:28:47,313 --> 01:28:47,713
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

1158
01:28:47,734 --> 01:28:48,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Close enough.

1159
01:28:48,955 --> 01:28:52,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I would still say that's a fatherly figure in somebody's life.

1160
01:28:52,599 --> 01:28:53,199
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

1161
01:28:53,339 --> 01:28:54,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a picture of Maruko.

1162
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:55,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post it.

1163
01:28:55,401 --> 01:28:55,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

1164
01:28:55,702 --> 01:28:56,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Over to orangelaunchradio.com.

1165
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:59,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of a squinty picture.

1166
01:28:59,284 --> 01:28:59,644
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right.

1167
01:28:59,684 --> 01:29:11,209
[SPEAKER_12]: While you're checking out the pictures of the kitties at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, don't forget to swing by VOGNetwork.com because if you are participating live with the show, you can check in and get your points and maybe, just maybe, get some loot.

1168
01:29:11,269 --> 01:29:12,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, that's VOGNetwork.com.

1169
01:29:13,029 --> 01:29:17,611
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a podcast listener, sorry, can't check into the show yet.

1170
01:29:18,551 --> 01:29:19,732
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'll say about that.

1171
01:29:20,316 --> 01:29:26,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, I think I should post a picture of the kitty cats kissing outside of your... Oh, the strays out in the neighborhood?

1172
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:27,124
[SPEAKER_04]: The strays.

1173
01:29:27,144 --> 01:29:28,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that was cute.

1174
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:29,607
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

1175
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:35,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, we are going to get back into some gaming news here with Rapid Fire News.

1176
01:29:36,094 --> 01:29:39,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to put out a last call for any tweets you guys want us to talk about tonight.

1177
01:29:40,197 --> 01:29:45,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to get to the Fugle Question of the Week in a minute here too, and I think DarkSakura is on her way to opening up the mailbag, so we don't have a lot of time left there.

1178
01:29:46,062 --> 01:29:47,283
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's do some Rapid Fire News.

1179
01:29:47,343 --> 01:29:47,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1180
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was looking up US Open results.

1181
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:53,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Since when were you a tennis fan?

1182
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:54,447
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not golf.

1183
01:29:56,448 --> 01:29:57,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stupid.

1184
01:29:58,209 --> 01:29:59,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, fair enough.

1185
01:29:59,049 --> 01:30:01,430
[SPEAKER_09]: The US Open is also tennis.

1186
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:09,974
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but my grandpa watches it a lot, and we went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue and stuff, and he was watching it.

1187
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:20,044
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this amateur 17-year-old guy who was just out shooting Tiger Woods, which I thought was hilarious, and I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods.

1188
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:26,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Woods ended up three over par for the three-day course, and I didn't see where he... I don't remember the guy's name, so... Anyways, sorry.

1189
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:27,753
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

1190
01:30:27,873 --> 01:30:28,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally derailing everything.

1191
01:30:29,114 --> 01:30:30,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk Journey.

1192
01:30:30,696 --> 01:30:31,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Journey...

1193
01:30:32,478 --> 01:30:33,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't stop.

1194
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:33,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that journey.

1195
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:34,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe.

1196
01:30:34,559 --> 01:30:34,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

1197
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,261
[SPEAKER_09]: The journey was pretty awesome.

1198
01:30:36,381 --> 01:30:43,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, the developer, that game company, is now going to go and self-publish their next game.

1199
01:30:44,526 --> 01:30:52,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've got $5.5 million of capital from Benchmark Capital's Mitch Lasky.

1200
01:30:53,852 --> 01:30:59,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to try to publish their game on multiple platforms, possibly PC.

1201
01:30:59,295 --> 01:31:00,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1202
01:31:01,932 --> 01:31:07,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess they haven't announced which platform the game is going to be on, but I'm sure it'll be awesome.

1203
01:31:08,334 --> 01:31:20,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Also should note that one thing that hasn't been mentioned yet, but I kind of hinted at it on Twitter as well, that Sony will be releasing on PlayStation 3 a Journey compilation.

1204
01:31:20,298 --> 01:31:27,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, there's only one Journey game, so it leads me to believe that it's Journey, Flower, and Flow on this.

1205
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Sadly, not the 80s game starring the Superband, although that would be awesome.

1206
01:31:32,982 --> 01:31:36,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey on top of that.

1207
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:47,287
[SPEAKER_12]: You can throw in the music in there as well, because that's both... Well, it's funny to me, though, that Flower and all that is good, but the Journey... Okay, why would you release this disc?

1208
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:50,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people can't go online to download it, or they're not connected.

1209
01:31:50,528 --> 01:31:55,850
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you play Journey without being connected, you're not really playing Journey.

1210
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:56,890
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.

1211
01:31:57,816 --> 01:31:59,417
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not taking the true Journey.

1212
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,238
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like backseat driver.

1213
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:05,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1214
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:06,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know.

1215
01:32:07,621 --> 01:32:09,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a cash grab, which is fine.

1216
01:32:09,082 --> 01:32:19,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Journey still is a fantastic game, but if you're playing it and not being online, then I think you kind of missed the point, and that's where the other games like Flower and stuff become a little better.

1217
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:23,190
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where Journey really needs to be on the Vita because that would be amazing.

1218
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:27,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best racing games I've ever played.

1219
01:32:28,493 --> 01:32:28,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about it.

1220
01:32:31,396 --> 01:32:33,579
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation Home would be interesting on the Vita as well.

1221
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:37,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd play it though, but I would probably play it more on the Vita than I would on the PS3.

1222
01:32:40,563 --> 01:32:43,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk Minecraft, because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet.

1223
01:32:44,004 --> 01:32:48,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a patch that was released earlier, well, Friday, Secret Patch Friday.

1224
01:32:50,145 --> 01:32:53,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually a bug fix patch right now.

1225
01:32:53,646 --> 01:32:57,206
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't really do a whole lot as far as any updates to the game.

1226
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes.

1227
01:32:59,887 --> 01:33:04,848
[SPEAKER_09]: They added an autosave feature so you can set it up to automatically save every 15 minutes or 2 hours.

1228
01:33:05,388 --> 01:33:05,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1229
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:09,391
[SPEAKER_09]: or, I guess, up to two hours.

1230
01:33:10,392 --> 01:33:13,234
[SPEAKER_09]: They've also added a coordinate system to the map, which is kind of good.

1231
01:33:13,735 --> 01:33:14,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

1232
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:16,717
[SPEAKER_12]: You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is.

1233
01:33:16,817 --> 01:33:17,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1234
01:33:18,499 --> 01:33:22,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they took away the dupe glitch, so you can't dupe items anymore.

1235
01:33:23,744 --> 01:33:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Some issues with clay not generating in your maps, which is a big no-no, so they finally fixed that, so you can actually craft stuff with clay.

1236
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:35,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Also some frame rate drops, stuff not spawning.

1237
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:41,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix, so I sent them a message.

1238
01:33:42,053 --> 01:33:52,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire and switch to the third-person camera that faces the front of you, you don't see the fire, but you'll see it from the back if you do that.

1239
01:33:52,456 --> 01:33:54,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one-way fire, I guess.

1240
01:33:55,657 --> 01:33:56,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I guess...

1241
01:33:59,817 --> 01:34:01,779
[SPEAKER_09]: See, here's the other thing I didn't realize too.

1242
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,563
[SPEAKER_09]: They said a fix for awaiting approval showing all the time on some signs.

1243
01:34:06,803 --> 01:34:07,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that happen.

1244
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:09,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved.

1245
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:10,326
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't.

1246
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:12,087
[SPEAKER_12]: That's weird.

1247
01:34:17,515 --> 01:34:18,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to point out some comments from chat.

1248
01:34:18,936 --> 01:34:23,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Clover Nikon is in chat saying, all the children at the school I work at play the Minecraft demo.

1249
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:24,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, well, what age?

1250
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:25,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight to ten.

1251
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Which seems kind of young, but it's cool.

1252
01:34:28,422 --> 01:34:30,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a safe game for kids.

1253
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:31,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a great game for kids.

1254
01:34:31,644 --> 01:34:32,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.

1255
01:34:33,105 --> 01:34:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like this.

1256
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:37,968
[SPEAKER_09]: The ability, they turn, or you can enable or disable the tooltips.

1257
01:34:38,328 --> 01:34:40,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time.

1258
01:34:41,089 --> 01:34:48,233
[SPEAKER_09]: If my friend's playing, and he's seen all this stuff already, and it'll be just like, hey, did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah, blah, blah?

1259
01:34:48,253 --> 01:34:48,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, yes, I know.

1260
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I built a giant volcano out of Obsidian.

1261
01:34:51,374 --> 01:34:53,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian.

1262
01:34:54,096 --> 01:34:54,416
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

1263
01:34:54,836 --> 01:35:12,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, a little annoying sometimes I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games When I was 12, or maybe 11 We used to go to the lab at the junior high No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers We would play Scorched Earth Oh, yes And it was epic Yes Scorched Earth is still epic

1264
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:13,351
[SPEAKER_12]: and what was it?

1265
01:35:13,391 --> 01:35:13,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Tank 256.

1266
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:16,674
[SPEAKER_12]: There was another one just like a Tank 256 or something like that.

1267
01:35:17,154 --> 01:35:17,895
[SPEAKER_12]: VGA Tank.

1268
01:35:17,975 --> 01:35:18,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1269
01:35:18,315 --> 01:35:19,837
[SPEAKER_12]: There was another one just like it.

1270
01:35:20,017 --> 01:35:21,599
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a game right there that needs it.

1271
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:27,504
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the perfect Facebook game if you think about it because it's not something that you take turns.

1272
01:35:27,584 --> 01:35:28,986
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game that you take turns in.

1273
01:35:29,446 --> 01:35:34,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, why not have it where you would play Scorched Earth on Facebook?

1274
01:35:34,408 --> 01:35:39,330
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am not talking about fucking worms, which clearly was inspired by Scorched Earth.

1275
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:42,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I am talking about Scorched motherfucking Earth, right?

1276
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:42,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1277
01:35:45,482 --> 01:36:04,694
[SPEAKER_09]: so that'd be pretty awesome there will be an update though for Minecraft the next update that's supposed to add pistons and that fun stuff that's sometime in July I can't wait do you realize literally in one week we're getting that Skyrim expansion may not be in Minecraft for very long

1278
01:36:05,703 --> 01:36:08,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you realize in one week it's the 10th anniversary of our show?

1279
01:36:08,626 --> 01:36:09,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but there's Skyrim.

1280
01:36:09,727 --> 01:36:11,649
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Bethesda's present to us.

1281
01:36:12,029 --> 01:36:14,371
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, that expansion's coming out on my birthday.

1282
01:36:14,711 --> 01:36:18,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So is Bethesda's present to me, the guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim?

1283
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Brain... You can never play enough Skyrim.

1284
01:36:24,942 --> 01:36:27,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally... Tank Wars.

1285
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Jim Sally.

1286
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:29,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was the one I was talking about.

1287
01:36:29,604 --> 01:36:30,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, Penny Arcade.

1288
01:36:31,045 --> 01:36:33,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Their brand new game is going to be coming out.

1289
01:36:34,406 --> 01:36:40,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on Xbox Live Arcade, but actually on PC, Mac, on Steam, and Xbox Live Indie Games.

1290
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out on June 25th.

1291
01:36:44,171 --> 01:36:47,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th, but they said wait until July seems dumb.

1292
01:36:48,713 --> 01:37:14,169
[SPEAKER_09]: which sounds great to me and the game itself looks awesome I wasn't a huge fan of the kind of adventure game style that the first one had but this one looks straight up like 2D Final Fantasy game so I may have to pick this up I just hope it doesn't require too much knowledge of the other games sorry I was queuing something up here

1293
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:16,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I zoned out when you mentioned Minecraft

1294
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:43,323
[SPEAKER_12]: 20th Anniversary is going to include... Now, this is the Wii game that's kind of like the Mario game, right?

1295
01:37:43,763 --> 01:37:46,466
[SPEAKER_12]: It was announced back in April, but now we know what's actually going to be in it.

1296
01:37:47,306 --> 01:37:56,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Dream Land 2, Kirby's Adventure, Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3, and Kirby 64 will make up the compilation.

1297
01:37:56,915 --> 01:38:00,418
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also going to be a timeline, whatever that is.

1298
01:38:00,938 --> 01:38:01,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess a poster or something.

1299
01:38:02,559 --> 01:38:03,619
[SPEAKER_12]: and a soundtrack.

1300
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It launches in Japan on July 19th.

1301
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:11,162
[SPEAKER_12]: No North American information as of yet, but I'm sure it'll be just in time for the holidays.

1302
01:38:11,662 --> 01:38:12,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think they've said September.

1303
01:38:14,223 --> 01:38:17,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game on SNES.

1304
01:38:18,979 --> 01:38:19,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Which was the best one.

1305
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:23,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Already, I'm giving this props because it's not a port of a virtual console game.

1306
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:30,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's all the 20th Anniversary Edition was, was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars ported onto the Wii.

1307
01:38:30,184 --> 01:38:34,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally, game rips of it, the disc rips, were like 30 megs.

1308
01:38:34,286 --> 01:38:37,167
[SPEAKER_09]: It was literally the ROM from Super Nintendo.

1309
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: This is at least more than one ROM.

1310
01:38:40,628 --> 01:38:42,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually have to make something...

1311
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:47,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Majesco, the makers of Zumba Fitness, which sells really well.

1312
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And NBA Baller Beats.

1313
01:38:51,013 --> 01:38:52,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Snapples.

1314
01:38:52,294 --> 01:38:53,575
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, NBA Baller Beats.

1315
01:38:53,915 --> 01:38:56,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they've got another baller franchise that they've just acquired.

1316
01:38:57,118 --> 01:38:59,481
[SPEAKER_12]: American Idol is a license they just got.

1317
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:03,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say, when American Idol first came out, Codemasters had it.

1318
01:39:03,324 --> 01:39:04,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Then Konami had it.

1319
01:39:04,365 --> 01:39:06,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the American Idol Karaoke Revolution games.

1320
01:39:06,847 --> 01:39:13,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Well now, I guess Konami lost it, or gave it up, because Majesco now has the license for American Idol.

1321
01:39:13,873 --> 01:39:15,434
[SPEAKER_12]: No idea what they're going to do with that.

1322
01:39:16,055 --> 01:39:18,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I imagine a type of karaoke game would make some sense.

1323
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:23,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you a bunch of compliments.

1324
01:39:23,561 --> 01:39:23,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1325
01:39:24,262 --> 01:39:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's kind of funny is Konami is actually getting out of the music game genre completely, aside from Joy Sound that they have coming out, which is a game that's pretty fucking old.

1326
01:39:36,161 --> 01:39:41,123
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I said for the 10th anniversary we should have a funeral for Bomani and never talk about it again, but I don't know.

1327
01:39:42,003 --> 01:39:42,504
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be sad.

1328
01:39:42,584 --> 01:39:43,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to do that.

1329
01:39:44,724 --> 01:39:46,305
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's true.

1330
01:39:46,385 --> 01:39:51,127
[SPEAKER_12]: If this was the first year, there was nothing on the floor at E3 about Bomani.

1331
01:39:51,147 --> 01:39:59,650
[SPEAKER_09]: The very least they should have done was put one of those DDRX3 versus second mix machines in the Konami booth.

1332
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:01,131
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been at least cool.

1333
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,492
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game, which looks pretty awesome.

1334
01:40:06,113 --> 01:40:12,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, lastly here for me, Mistwalker wants to make RPGs for the Wii U, but nothing planned yet.

1335
01:40:13,097 --> 01:40:18,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Mistwalker, of course, made The Last Story, which is finally coming out here in America.

1336
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:23,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the games before that they did, Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, a criminally underrated 360 game.

1337
01:40:24,003 --> 01:40:26,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play that game.

1338
01:40:26,424 --> 01:40:30,126
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey is that the 360 flop seed in Japan.

1339
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:32,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3,

1340
01:40:33,268 --> 01:40:34,169
[SPEAKER_12]: We would have had a sequel.

1341
01:40:34,789 --> 01:40:36,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate to say it, but it's so true.

1342
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:40,353
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just really unfortunate because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG.

1343
01:40:40,433 --> 01:40:40,854
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that game.

1344
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:42,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to go back and finish that game.

1345
01:40:42,195 --> 01:40:42,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1346
01:40:42,855 --> 01:40:46,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyhow, here's your quote from designer Takuya Matsumoto.

1347
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:58,246
[SPEAKER_12]: The development team and Sakaguchi-san are looking forward to making more, especially for the Wii U because it has another screen right in front of you that will add another level of strategic elements into the action RPG.

1348
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:02,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really are looking forward to it, but we really haven't planned anything.

1349
01:41:02,449 --> 01:41:04,589
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like it's something you could easily do.

1350
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:07,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Your little menus, you could even draw attack patterns.

1351
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:14,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see role-playing action games working very well with the Wii U as long as it's in capable hands.

1352
01:41:14,572 --> 01:41:17,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Mistwalker's done a lot of underrated stuff.

1353
01:41:19,053 --> 01:41:20,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Could be good if they decide to do it.

1354
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:23,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Since apparently they are kind of married to Nintendo now.

1355
01:41:23,854 --> 01:41:24,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't realize this, but...

1356
01:41:26,155 --> 01:41:29,681
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably sold more of the last story than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly.

1357
01:41:32,105 --> 01:41:33,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?

1358
01:41:34,605 --> 01:41:35,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have a few things.

1359
01:41:36,446 --> 01:41:42,987
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, first of all, the amount of money the Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at?

1360
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: 5.1 million.

1361
01:41:44,748 --> 01:41:48,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that is basically, the final amount is 5,105,196, $69.91 in two weeks.

1362
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:51,510
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically blew their previous records from 2 and 3 just out of the water.

1363
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:51,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1364
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:07,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, we had 598,794 people make purchases, with the average price being $8.53.

1365
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:12,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And it said that Linux users paid more than anyone else at $12.51 per transaction, and Windows users were paying the least at $7.97.

1366
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: They always pay the least.

1367
01:42:28,789 --> 01:42:34,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but basically most of the purchases were made on PC.

1368
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:41,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And then The Last of Us is going to not be out until 2013.

1369
01:42:41,513 --> 01:42:45,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, of course, that's when all the games are coming out now.

1370
01:42:45,674 --> 01:42:45,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1371
01:42:46,554 --> 01:42:50,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, technically it's late 2012, early 2013.

1372
01:42:52,257 --> 01:42:58,639
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what the Naughty Dog directors said on Jimmy Fallon.

1373
01:43:02,481 --> 01:43:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Dance Central 2.

1374
01:43:04,443 --> 01:43:05,904
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a June DLC.

1375
01:43:07,305 --> 01:43:11,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It is... I don't know who this person is.

1376
01:43:11,528 --> 01:43:12,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Iyaz?

1377
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:13,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Replay?

1378
01:43:14,611 --> 01:43:15,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nelly's Hot In Here?

1379
01:43:16,392 --> 01:43:17,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cat DeLuna's Wine Up?

1380
01:43:18,053 --> 01:43:21,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, these are all songs... Well, I've heard the Hot In Here song, but I think it's awful.

1381
01:43:21,676 --> 01:43:23,417
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are.

1382
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:26,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't care.

1383
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:26,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1384
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:29,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty then.

1385
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:32,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1386
01:43:39,031 --> 01:43:42,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google+.

1387
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:44,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Put it together and you get Voogle.

1388
01:43:45,957 --> 01:43:48,760
[SPEAKER_12]: This week's question has to do with the story we talked about earlier.

1389
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:55,165
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the stories we were talking about tonight was THQ being suspected of misleading investors on Udraw, which got us thinking.

1390
01:43:55,626 --> 01:44:01,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Although all of us may not be financial investors per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money into our gaming habit.

1391
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:05,695
[SPEAKER_12]: When was a time that you felt misled by a gaming company?

1392
01:44:06,555 --> 01:44:08,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We kept it a little bit vague on purpose.

1393
01:44:08,316 --> 01:44:10,717
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with.

1394
01:44:10,737 --> 01:44:12,118
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of interesting responses tonight.

1395
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:13,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start with Facebook tonight.

1396
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:20,062
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to start with Rob D. It's hard not to feel constantly misled by Capcom.

1397
01:44:20,282 --> 01:44:26,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Their works, and especially their long-running franchises, show that their developers care about their games and have passion.

1398
01:44:26,705 --> 01:44:30,347
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we're promised so much, and all we ever get is nickels and dimes.

1399
01:44:31,487 --> 01:44:33,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombie Princess says the ending of Mass Effect 3.

1400
01:44:34,628 --> 01:44:37,309
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole series makes you think your choices will make a big difference.

1401
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:39,570
[SPEAKER_12]: In actuality, it doesn't matter at all.

1402
01:44:40,791 --> 01:44:48,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Locopoco says by Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3, not Ultimate, was going to have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3.

1403
01:44:48,874 --> 01:44:51,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Then when I bought it, all I got was a bare-bones fighter.

1404
01:44:51,775 --> 01:44:54,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Sold it back to GameStop two hours later.

1405
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:56,277
[SPEAKER_12]: That's two strikes against Capcom.

1406
01:44:57,137 --> 01:45:02,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let's go to Kareem J, who says, have to agree with the above poster and Capcom.

1407
01:45:02,762 --> 01:45:08,346
[SPEAKER_12]: They hype up their franchises, then release a boatload of DLC, which should have been on the disc.

1408
01:45:08,606 --> 01:45:12,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Then to add a further kick in the balls, they release a game of the year edition.

1409
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:18,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one, but if you're really into one of their franchises, you want the game on day one.

1410
01:45:18,874 --> 01:45:20,795
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't help but feel like a sucker.

1411
01:45:21,676 --> 01:45:23,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Ouch, that's three punches for Capcom.

1412
01:45:24,939 --> 01:45:26,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Joe G says, GoldenEye reloaded.

1413
01:45:27,301 --> 01:45:34,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Frankly, I thought Activision was going to make the original GoldenEye 64 pretty with some story, a few new missions, and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan.

1414
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:35,888
[SPEAKER_12]: This isn't the case.

1415
01:45:35,948 --> 01:45:42,594
[SPEAKER_12]: They gutted the game, changed around the story to make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay, and they fucking took out the jumping mechanics.

1416
01:45:42,974 --> 01:45:46,537
[SPEAKER_12]: You can vault over objects, but it's clunky to say the least.

1417
01:45:47,518 --> 01:45:52,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Tyler M says, there's been many times, but nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore.

1418
01:45:53,227 --> 01:45:55,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I do remember being kind of let down by Spore.

1419
01:45:55,470 --> 01:46:01,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, just, Spore wasn't, I think even Will Wright kind of said it best.

1420
01:46:01,539 --> 01:46:02,961
[SPEAKER_12]: It just tried to accomplish too damn much.

1421
01:46:03,865 --> 01:46:04,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think he said it that way.

1422
01:46:04,785 --> 01:46:06,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm paraphrasing a little bit there.

1423
01:46:07,166 --> 01:46:07,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1424
01:46:08,307 --> 01:46:09,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me try to wrap some of this up here.

1425
01:46:10,128 --> 01:46:12,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Clover N says, Driver was just awfully misleading.

1426
01:46:13,149 --> 01:46:15,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank heavens EB Games has a seven-day return policy.

1427
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:16,530
[SPEAKER_12]: No questions asked.

1428
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:17,310
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Driver 3.

1429
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:18,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1430
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:20,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, it's Driver with a 3 in it.

1431
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very entertaining, though, on its own merits.

1432
01:46:23,733 --> 01:46:26,333
[SPEAKER_12]: It's lousy for about those first seven days, and then it's over.

1433
01:46:27,053 --> 01:46:28,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when you bought that.

1434
01:46:28,454 --> 01:46:30,114
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so lousy way after that.

1435
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:32,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those that you have to keep going back to after a while.

1436
01:46:33,135 --> 01:46:33,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to go back to that.

1437
01:46:34,215 --> 01:46:43,277
[SPEAKER_12]: ShatteredHawk said, Mass Effect 3, all the hours being drawn in by the story and characters only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end.

1438
01:46:43,357 --> 01:46:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you, Bioware.

1439
01:46:44,657 --> 01:46:49,159
[SPEAKER_12]: That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom and two for Mass Effect 3.

1440
01:46:49,599 --> 01:46:52,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go over to the Google+.

1441
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-oh, only one response on Google+.

1442
01:46:56,481 --> 01:46:57,902
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what that means about Google+.

1443
01:46:58,382 --> 01:46:59,082
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's on it.

1444
01:46:59,603 --> 01:47:01,043
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it's starting to look like.

1445
01:47:01,063 --> 01:47:03,864
[SPEAKER_12]: We have another little kick for Google+.

1446
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:09,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you saying that Google isn't the amazing thing that they had us believe that it was?

1447
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:10,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft.com

1448
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:38,638
[SPEAKER_12]: though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans believing that EA and Bioware have totally scammed them even if they didn't in parentheses.

1449
01:47:39,299 --> 01:47:40,360
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

1450
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:43,002
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not really a third strike against Bioware.

1451
01:47:43,022 --> 01:47:46,265
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just kind of a, you know, pointing and laughing at the other people maybe.

1452
01:47:47,186 --> 01:47:49,368
[SPEAKER_12]: So it looks like Capcom took the cake on that one.

1453
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:51,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't say I blame the listeners there.

1454
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:54,993
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom over the past couple of years.

1455
01:47:55,514 --> 01:48:00,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they'll redeem themselves if Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3 end up being really, really good.

1456
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would still like to have that Mega Man universe someday, or the Mega Man Legends.

1457
01:48:06,942 --> 01:48:09,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing anyways.

1458
01:48:09,923 --> 01:48:13,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, I don't... I mean, yes, that was terrible.

1459
01:48:14,305 --> 01:48:16,745
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I didn't buy the game, so that wouldn't have been my choice.

1460
01:48:16,805 --> 01:48:17,266
[SPEAKER_09]: My choice...

1461
01:48:18,266 --> 01:48:18,587
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

1462
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:38,127
[SPEAKER_09]: The DLC, though, on the other hand, is fucking terrible.

1463
01:48:38,567 --> 01:48:40,789
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the expansion packs that they had.

1464
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand the costumes, that's a waste of money.

1465
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:45,071
[SPEAKER_09]: But the expansion packs.

1466
01:48:46,091 --> 01:48:48,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I was smart enough not to buy the season pass.

1467
01:48:48,592 --> 01:48:53,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know well enough that, you know what, I'd rather pay extra money...

1468
01:48:54,955 --> 01:49:03,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And have each one of those expansion packs be definitely good than to just pay $20 and have them all be terrible.

1469
01:49:03,941 --> 01:49:08,464
[SPEAKER_09]: And thankfully, I paid $7, bought the first expansion, and it was fucking terrible.

1470
01:49:08,904 --> 01:49:10,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Read the reviews on the second expansion.

1471
01:49:10,786 --> 01:49:12,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Even more terrible than the first expansion.

1472
01:49:13,107 --> 01:49:17,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Third one, hey, we get Johnny Gatbat, except he's a giant mutant.

1473
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:19,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's fucking terrible.

1474
01:49:19,892 --> 01:49:20,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1475
01:49:21,707 --> 01:49:25,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not... I feel a little ripped off by them.

1476
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:31,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, all the OnDisc DLC... They have more OnDisc DLC than fucking Capcom does.

1477
01:49:31,394 --> 01:49:32,155
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

1478
01:49:32,235 --> 01:49:36,058
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still releasing stuff today that's OnDisc DLC.

1479
01:49:37,419 --> 01:49:44,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have a whole expansion that really could have been an expansion to the game, but now they're going to make its own retail release that's $30.

1480
01:49:45,024 --> 01:49:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm waiting on that one.

1481
01:49:46,466 --> 01:49:49,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to play it because I like The Matrix and I like Saints Row III, but...

1482
01:49:51,549 --> 01:50:11,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very cautious going into it a lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight Blender agrees with Loki yes Loki Saints Row the third DLC pissed me off Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says Bethesda got away with making the true ending a DLC with Fallout 3 I don't see a problem with Bioware doing it as well

1483
01:50:12,311 --> 01:50:29,288
[SPEAKER_12]: he makes a good point there about sometimes our attention spans we let one company get away with something but then don't let the other so lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com let's go back to some news I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later maybe some emails so let's go to Loki with news

1484
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:34,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about Retro and what their plans are.

1485
01:50:35,633 --> 01:50:43,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Retro Games, it's been rumored for a while, well, they've come out and said, hey, we'd love to do a Zelda game.

1486
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:48,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, people started asking them, hey, what's Retro working on?

1487
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, you're not really saying anything about them.

1488
01:50:53,703 --> 01:51:08,759
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, of course, Miyamoto basically saying, you know, in terms of them working on a Zelda game, it's not out of the question, but, you know, right now they're incredibly busy with other things.

1489
01:51:09,226 --> 01:51:15,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course they said, traditionally I think the Zelda team has always had close contact with anyone who's working on a Zelda game.

1490
01:51:16,693 --> 01:51:23,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Traditionally, except for maybe in the CDI days where they did not have close contact with people that were working on that game.

1491
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:27,222
[SPEAKER_09]: At least they probably distanced themselves.

1492
01:51:27,262 --> 01:51:32,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but ever since then, that's why Nintendo has had a close relationship with

1493
01:51:32,327 --> 01:51:39,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course they're saying, you know, Retro is too busy for that sort of thing right now.

1494
01:51:39,172 --> 01:51:42,854
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, saying that they're working on something else.

1495
01:51:43,775 --> 01:51:48,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, very busy right now, but I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is that they're working on.

1496
01:51:49,919 --> 01:51:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game.

1497
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright, but...

1498
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:58,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious to see if they are making a Zelda game.

1499
01:51:59,553 --> 01:52:01,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Could they be doing the next-gen Zelda game?

1500
01:52:01,374 --> 01:52:08,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you think about the next-gen type Zelda game for the Wii U, because Nintendo hasn't really worked in next-gen stuff.

1501
01:52:08,517 --> 01:52:11,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Retro's really gotten their feet wet with that.

1502
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:12,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1503
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1504
01:52:15,302 --> 01:52:18,164
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, I mentioned a minute ago we could come back and talk about Google+.

1505
01:52:18,424 --> 01:52:21,367
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not a good thing for the service.

1506
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:28,312
[SPEAKER_12]: PopCap and Wooga Games, they're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform.

1507
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:32,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Wooga already shut down Monster World around May 1st.

1508
01:52:33,656 --> 01:52:37,339
[SPEAKER_12]: EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz from the service this week.

1509
01:52:37,379 --> 01:52:38,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's already happened.

1510
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:43,482
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to, quote, redeploy our resources to other adaptations of Bejeweled.

1511
01:52:43,822 --> 01:52:51,945
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's their nice way of saying, fucking no one's playing it on Google+, so we'd rather do the phones and the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at.

1512
01:52:52,806 --> 01:53:03,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Wooga said, quote, they decided to, quote, decided to remove certain games from Google+, because we have had a much larger following on Facebook, and they are active users.

1513
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:06,571
[SPEAKER_12]: So goodbye, Bubble Island and Diamond Dash.

1514
01:53:06,611 --> 01:53:07,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are leaving on July 1st.

1515
01:53:08,692 --> 01:53:36,377
[SPEAKER_12]: PopCap does say Google is a valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA and will continue to develop for Google platforms that probably means Android I would think also maybe Chrome because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration with games and stuff like that Chrome has a bunch of the sort of add-ons with it too with games which is strange that you know it doesn't that that won't therefore integrate into Google Plus automatically but maybe it does I don't know

1516
01:53:37,837 --> 01:53:41,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember seeing ads for Google+, like at the movies and stuff.

1517
01:53:41,699 --> 01:53:45,800
[SPEAKER_12]: They really tried to push this, and people just aren't taking the bait.

1518
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:49,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure I totally understand why.

1519
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:50,301
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, is it the interface?

1520
01:53:50,341 --> 01:53:51,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it because maybe it's...

1521
01:53:52,162 --> 01:53:55,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe people don't like the oversimplification next to Facebook.

1522
01:53:55,464 --> 01:53:57,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I do see some dedicated Google Plus people.

1523
01:53:58,066 --> 01:54:01,528
[SPEAKER_12]: There are definitely some people I see that use Google Plus more than they use Facebook.

1524
01:54:01,828 --> 01:54:05,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to admit, I get so sick of Facebook shit.

1525
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:08,932
[SPEAKER_12]: There is so much shit on Facebook I don't need in my life.

1526
01:54:09,132 --> 01:54:09,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.

1527
01:54:10,033 --> 01:54:12,234
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a lot of toxicness there.

1528
01:54:12,594 --> 01:54:13,735
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of just...

1529
01:54:15,165 --> 01:54:16,366
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of stuff on there.

1530
01:54:16,526 --> 01:54:24,349
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying Google Plus is any better in that regard because I think if everybody was on Google Plus instead of Facebook, it would just be the same thing in reverse.

1531
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:26,710
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

1532
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:32,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just surprised more people didn't run away to Google Plus in a way.

1533
01:54:33,513 --> 01:54:34,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for a while people did.

1534
01:54:35,674 --> 01:54:38,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, oh, everyone else is still on Facebook.

1535
01:54:38,475 --> 01:54:39,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people needed attention.

1536
01:54:42,738 --> 01:54:43,318
[SPEAKER_12]: It's true.

1537
01:54:43,438 --> 01:54:44,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It is absolutely true.

1538
01:54:44,619 --> 01:54:46,940
[SPEAKER_12]: People needed attention so they went back to Facebook.

1539
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I will totally admit, in some ways, that's why I'm still posting on Facebook.

1540
01:54:51,062 --> 01:54:54,124
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a great promotional tool for the show.

1541
01:54:54,564 --> 01:54:55,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I will say this.

1542
01:54:56,445 --> 01:54:58,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a huge...

1543
01:54:59,187 --> 01:55:25,713
[SPEAKER_12]: and I hope to hell this doesn't go away because I think there's a huge potential to do something great with Google Hangout and some of the interviews and some of that and I think there's some cool untapped stuff there so I hope they don't just close Google Plus altogether and you know what I don't care if we only have like five fans on Google Plus that's five fans that we have so you know I don't want to like stop supporting Google Plus or whatever but you know it is the fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook

1544
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:28,821
[SPEAKER_09]: But Myspace, fuck them.

1545
01:55:29,641 --> 01:55:30,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Myspace.

1546
01:55:30,542 --> 01:55:31,303
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't care about that.

1547
01:55:31,343 --> 01:55:32,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, fuck Myspace.

1548
01:55:33,584 --> 01:55:35,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I still get messages on Myspace.

1549
01:55:35,365 --> 01:55:40,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I don't even know where my page is anymore, let alone all these artists.

1550
01:55:40,689 --> 01:55:42,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, listen to my shit.

1551
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:43,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, no.

1552
01:55:43,491 --> 01:55:46,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Zether in our chatroom says, RIP Google+.

1553
01:55:47,574 --> 01:55:49,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, I mean, the game's leaving.

1554
01:55:49,235 --> 01:55:50,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Bejeweled leaving.

1555
01:55:51,296 --> 01:55:55,839
[SPEAKER_12]: When your PopCap games are leaving, it's really not a good sign.

1556
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:56,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Yikes.

1557
01:55:58,485 --> 01:55:58,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1558
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:01,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

1559
01:56:02,547 --> 01:56:03,267
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

1560
01:56:03,367 --> 01:56:03,667
[SPEAKER_04]: News?

1561
01:56:03,767 --> 01:56:05,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Who pays attention to news?

1562
01:56:05,968 --> 01:56:07,468
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some stuff about StarCraft?

1563
01:56:07,489 --> 01:56:09,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would make people perk up.

1564
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft 2 Heart of the Swarm is 99% done.

1565
01:56:14,471 --> 01:56:22,254
[SPEAKER_04]: The lead designer, Dustin Browder, basically said, and this is a quote, 99% done, but that last 1% is a bitch.

1566
01:56:23,855 --> 01:56:27,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're saying, basically he says he could do a playthrough of

1567
01:56:27,614 --> 01:56:28,074
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1568
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:30,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it's not really 99% done.

1569
01:56:30,535 --> 01:56:32,135
[SPEAKER_12]: That was something he said to get quoted.

1570
01:56:32,395 --> 01:56:33,476
[SPEAKER_04]: May I finish?

1571
01:56:34,936 --> 01:56:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can do a playthrough and are like, wow, this is great.

1572
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:40,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can do a playthrough and then find more items to fix.

1573
01:56:40,938 --> 01:56:44,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically it's like they're in that last beta stage.

1574
01:56:45,339 --> 01:56:46,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I should say alpha stage.

1575
01:56:46,699 --> 01:56:48,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they're finding those little last minute things.

1576
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:50,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it's all a bunch of tweaking.

1577
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Which really is like the last little bit.

1578
01:56:54,141 --> 01:56:54,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're like 90% done.

1579
01:56:54,802 --> 01:56:54,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1580
01:56:59,614 --> 01:57:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the only thing holding it back At least they're waiting until it's done I'll give you that What exactly do they have to do?

1581
01:57:05,938 --> 01:57:09,321
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the game done They're adding an expansion pack

1582
01:57:10,439 --> 01:57:14,442
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft 2... I don't know if I want my unit right here or over here.

1583
01:57:14,462 --> 01:57:15,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you play StarCraft 2?

1584
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:17,484
[SPEAKER_12]: They are doing some more units and campaigns.

1585
01:57:17,784 --> 01:57:18,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the thing.

1586
01:57:18,725 --> 01:57:22,247
[SPEAKER_12]: StarCraft 2 has to be balanced right.

1587
01:57:22,687 --> 01:57:27,951
[SPEAKER_12]: There is so much esports and competitive gaming and things that go into something like StarCraft 2.

1588
01:57:28,391 --> 01:57:29,692
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be right.

1589
01:57:30,032 --> 01:57:37,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So I understand there's going to be some extensive testing that goes on with this because they cannot afford to have a fucked up balance in StarCraft 2.

1590
01:57:37,657 --> 01:57:37,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Literally.

1591
01:57:38,137 --> 01:57:38,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Literally.

1592
01:57:39,178 --> 01:57:40,319
[SPEAKER_12]: StarCraft 2 League of Legends

1593
01:57:59,022 --> 01:58:00,644
[SPEAKER_12]: StarCraft, Warcraft Arena League of Legends

1594
01:58:15,496 --> 01:58:18,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys in the mailbag.

1595
01:58:18,779 --> 01:58:22,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and Skype line in a little bit.

1596
01:58:22,723 --> 01:58:23,724
[SPEAKER_12]: But for first, Loki.

1597
01:58:23,824 --> 01:58:30,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, something I was talking a little bit about earlier is things that Nintendo says that they're doing and then doesn't.

1598
01:58:31,031 --> 01:58:36,636
[SPEAKER_09]: We just talked about StarCraft 2 and similar type of gameplay style on RTS, Pikmin 3.

1599
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:39,459
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not doing online multiplayer.

1600
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:53,957
[SPEAKER_09]: A brand new system that's coming out, HD, and they're not fucking doing online multiplayer because they said, well, we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around, so it would be hard for us to track all those accurately on other systems.

1601
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:56,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh...

1602
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:00,482
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that doesn't make any sense to me.

1603
01:59:00,702 --> 01:59:01,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1604
01:59:02,623 --> 01:59:07,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you think about it, there are multiplayer RTS games out there.

1605
01:59:07,586 --> 01:59:09,648
[SPEAKER_09]: There are multiplayer console RTS games out there.

1606
01:59:09,728 --> 01:59:12,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I just fucking named some in the competitive space.

1607
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:15,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, StarCraft, League of Legends.

1608
01:59:15,472 --> 01:59:25,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't fucking, I mean, don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around at one time, but dude, it's not like billions of Pikmin running around at the same time.

1609
01:59:25,338 --> 01:59:26,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Ever heard of the Zerg?

1610
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:32,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it just seems like a piss poor excuse for that.

1611
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:34,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you have a launch title.

1612
01:59:34,203 --> 01:59:36,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system.

1613
01:59:36,765 --> 01:59:38,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Your system finally gets online.

1614
01:59:38,666 --> 01:59:42,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U, Nintendo fucking gets online.

1615
01:59:42,748 --> 01:59:44,869
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, they don't fucking get online.

1616
01:59:45,209 --> 01:59:46,470
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't at all.

1617
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:48,571
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no online multiplayer.

1618
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:53,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you can share your me online and send pictures of your penis to your friends.

1619
01:59:54,494 --> 01:59:55,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1620
01:59:55,715 --> 01:59:57,256
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's co-op local multiplayer.

1621
01:59:57,336 --> 01:59:59,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again.

1622
01:59:59,637 --> 02:00:07,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just all the online functionality that they've shown right now, it's the same functionality we have with the 3DS and the Wii.

1623
02:00:08,062 --> 02:00:12,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Send messages back and forth and see what your friends are playing.

1624
02:00:16,066 --> 02:00:17,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not very functional.

1625
02:00:17,827 --> 02:00:20,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Which you can fucking do on the 3DS with Swapnote.

1626
02:00:20,629 --> 02:00:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Or on the Wii.

1627
02:00:21,249 --> 02:00:22,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii has online gameplay.

1628
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:22,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1629
02:00:23,496 --> 02:00:25,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We had online gameplay with Mario Kart.

1630
02:00:25,758 --> 02:00:28,180
[SPEAKER_09]: You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart.

1631
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:31,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you do online gameplay for Pikmin?

1632
02:00:32,143 --> 02:00:33,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't know.

1633
02:00:33,464 --> 02:00:35,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We've never coded online games before.

1634
02:00:36,127 --> 02:00:36,587
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the deal?

1635
02:00:37,248 --> 02:00:39,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but we have local multiplayer.

1636
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1637
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:01,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1638
02:01:03,182 --> 02:01:10,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And they even said, you know, one of the other things was that the Wii U, the whole idea was almost scrapped because of the price concerns.

1639
02:01:10,627 --> 02:01:16,250
[SPEAKER_09]: They were saying, you know, sometimes during a final discussion we almost gave up on the idea of additional screen.

1640
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: This was due over the concern of expected high cost.

1641
02:01:20,313 --> 02:01:26,257
[SPEAKER_09]: It may not have been feasible to create this and sell it at a reasonable price point for the consumers.

1642
02:01:27,378 --> 02:01:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1643
02:01:29,099 --> 02:01:55,195
[SPEAKER_09]: and of course they haven't said what the reasonable price point is yet maybe now it's more reasonable to pay $400 for a system because there's tablets out there that cost that much but I guess it's just gonna we're gonna have to wait and see you know how much the system's gonna cost and if it's too much it's gonna flop if it's the right price point it'll do okay but I don't know

1644
02:01:58,308 --> 02:01:59,549
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1645
02:02:24,344 --> 02:02:32,870
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not sure what this game is, it's the whole Level 5 and Studio Ghibli collaboration, which has been out in Japan already for a little bit.

1646
02:02:33,691 --> 02:02:35,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember when it's finally coming out here.

1647
02:02:35,873 --> 02:02:37,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's towards the end of the year.

1648
02:02:37,214 --> 02:02:37,654
[SPEAKER_12]: January.

1649
02:02:37,674 --> 02:02:38,475
[SPEAKER_12]: 2013, yet again.

1650
02:02:40,836 --> 02:02:42,457
[SPEAKER_12]: The reasons why they kept the name the same.

1651
02:02:42,678 --> 02:02:43,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I love this.

1652
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,240
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee.

1653
02:03:10,476 --> 02:03:13,159
[SPEAKER_12]: White Witch versus the original Japanese title.

1654
02:03:13,179 --> 02:03:13,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1655
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,761
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that means though, right?

1656
02:03:14,821 --> 02:03:15,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1657
02:03:15,161 --> 02:03:15,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Second Country.

1658
02:03:17,504 --> 02:03:17,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1659
02:03:17,965 --> 02:03:19,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Ni no Kuni, Second Country.

1660
02:03:19,747 --> 02:03:22,410
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country, you know?

1661
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:22,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1662
02:03:23,311 --> 02:03:24,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad they did keep that name.

1663
02:03:24,572 --> 02:03:31,520
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell with a title that, you know, isn't English, then why not?

1664
02:03:31,909 --> 02:03:32,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1665
02:03:33,129 --> 02:03:42,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was pissed that Dew Prism had a different name because I had been freaking looking forward to hoping that Dew Prism would be out and then I hear about Threads of Fate and I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?

1666
02:03:43,691 --> 02:03:44,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid.

1667
02:03:44,111 --> 02:03:56,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Fight Quest 6, I really do think that they should bring over Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3 which is what I would call Toe Ball 3 because they really need a Toe Ball 3 because Toe Ball 2 is awesome.

1668
02:03:57,434 --> 02:03:57,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1669
02:04:00,234 --> 02:04:01,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1670
02:04:01,935 --> 02:04:17,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst, surrounds herself in the hundreds of thousands of emails we get every week and pulls out a lucky few to read here on air.

1671
02:04:17,984 --> 02:04:19,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1672
02:04:19,865 --> 02:04:21,046
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly what happens.

1673
02:04:21,894 --> 02:04:23,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got a few.

1674
02:04:24,378 --> 02:04:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one actually that we got from Redertainment.

1675
02:04:27,242 --> 02:04:33,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to say right now, I've read it and I'm reading your thing and I'll give you feedback.

1676
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback.

1677
02:04:36,514 --> 02:04:37,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was an off-air question.

1678
02:04:37,756 --> 02:04:38,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sure.

1679
02:04:38,237 --> 02:04:38,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll peek later.

1680
02:04:40,316 --> 02:04:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, this one, Dear OLR, I first have to say that I love the show even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to.

1681
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:52,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway- Cancel your plans.

1682
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:56,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about an OR memory I have.

1683
02:04:57,443 --> 02:05:07,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The greatest memory I have, aside from getting pretty close to Dark Tetsuya, is that the day my father passed away, June 25, 2003, from cancer, you guys were there for me.

1684
02:05:07,808 --> 02:05:12,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we were holding a show that day, and I had delivered the news that he passed on.

1685
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:16,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And to help me get through it, you guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirits.

1686
02:05:17,253 --> 02:05:19,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since then you guys have been a huge part of my life.

1687
02:05:19,738 --> 02:05:22,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks OLR for the memories and keep up the good work.

1688
02:05:22,424 --> 02:05:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl

1689
02:05:24,861 --> 02:05:25,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's heavy.

1690
02:05:26,282 --> 02:05:41,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, I think we sometimes forget that, like, people have their lives and their drama and the things that they're going through, and yet OLR is kind of something that stayed constant through 10 years, and I think some people have kind of, you know... It's really weird to say.

1691
02:05:42,391 --> 02:05:46,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, not in a bad way, but to hear something like that is very powerful.

1692
02:05:47,253 --> 02:05:53,637
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when somebody's looking for normalcy, so they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights to help them get through it, like, that...

1693
02:05:55,245 --> 02:05:59,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, we don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners to feel that kind of power.

1694
02:05:59,634 --> 02:06:03,963
[SPEAKER_12]: That took one person in this case.

1695
02:06:04,985 --> 02:06:05,827
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad we could help.

1696
02:06:05,867 --> 02:06:06,789
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I can really say.

1697
02:06:14,546 --> 02:06:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Greetings, OmniBeings.

1698
02:06:17,048 --> 02:06:20,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Attached to this email is a picture I took at a Best Buy on Saturday.

1699
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It's of the PC version of Final Fantasy XIV.

1700
02:06:24,072 --> 02:06:26,213
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is drastically reduced.

1701
02:06:26,593 --> 02:06:31,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only does the price sticker read $20, the red sticker on the game means the game is reduced to $10.

1702
02:06:32,236 --> 02:06:35,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, even at $10, I questioned whether this game was worth my money.

1703
02:06:36,197 --> 02:06:39,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted this picture on Twitter asking if the game was worth my money.

1704
02:06:40,119 --> 02:06:45,681
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reply I received told me that the Wolverine movie game next to Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing.

1705
02:06:47,621 --> 02:06:59,886
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it say about Final Fantasy XIV that I, a gamer who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII, would question buying this game and when asked, people replied that I should buy a movie tie-in instead.

1706
02:07:00,886 --> 02:07:01,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay Black Entertainment.

1707
02:07:01,926 --> 02:07:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: This message has been brought to you by a locally produced microbrew beer, which is what I bought instead of a game.

1708
02:07:08,748 --> 02:07:13,349
[SPEAKER_12]: You could take a risk that the 2.0 version is going to kick a lot of ass.

1709
02:07:13,369 --> 02:07:16,850
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one thing we didn't talk about this week, there was a blog post on Sony's blog.

1710
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:20,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently it's still happening on the PlayStation 3 whenever the 2.0 version happens.

1711
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:22,411
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be a beta test later in the year.

1712
02:07:22,811 --> 02:07:24,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet.

1713
02:07:25,072 --> 02:07:29,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I just... I mean, rebooting an MMO and expecting people to care?

1714
02:07:29,673 --> 02:07:29,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

1715
02:07:31,095 --> 02:07:33,036
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big risk.

1716
02:07:34,096 --> 02:07:39,618
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you think about it, if you buy the game now for $10, you're not going to have to buy it again when the 2.0 upgrade comes out.

1717
02:07:40,459 --> 02:07:41,239
[SPEAKER_09]: At least on PC.

1718
02:07:42,419 --> 02:07:44,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope that means free to play Final Fantasy XI.

1719
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Free to play Final Fantasy XI.

1720
02:07:47,281 --> 02:07:49,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish those rumors about the Vita Final Fantasy XI were true.

1721
02:07:50,242 --> 02:07:50,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

1722
02:07:51,243 --> 02:07:52,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream on, Internet.

1723
02:07:54,909 --> 02:07:55,769
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two more actually.

1724
02:07:56,429 --> 02:07:59,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never remember saying this, so okay.

1725
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with DarkSakura 100% when she implied that Nintendo redeveloped Super Mario Bros.

1726
02:08:05,794 --> 02:08:12,557
[SPEAKER_04]: U with a Crysis or Unreal-type graphics engine and put Mario in real-world 2D side-scrolling environment.

1727
02:08:12,737 --> 02:08:14,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with real skies, trees, and weather effects.

1728
02:08:15,398 --> 02:08:17,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Real gold coins abuse the power of the Wii U.

1729
02:08:17,799 --> 02:08:26,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had said that it should be like, remember how Fantasy Zone, the Sega Ages 2500 is?

1730
02:08:26,823 --> 02:08:29,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it's all 3D, but it's side-scrolling?

1731
02:08:29,085 --> 02:08:30,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, sorta, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1732
02:08:30,865 --> 02:08:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what I had said.

1733
02:08:33,947 --> 02:08:39,309
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know that I would want it to be like Crysis or Unreal.

1734
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want it to be 2D side-scrolling.

1735
02:08:44,352 --> 02:08:45,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D.

1736
02:08:46,832 --> 02:08:52,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I think more like a game like Castlevania Symphony of the Night kind of had 2D but a little bit of 3D thrown in.

1737
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:52,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1738
02:08:53,054 --> 02:08:53,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1739
02:08:53,834 --> 02:08:55,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had one last mail that came in.

1740
02:08:55,734 --> 02:08:56,654
[SPEAKER_12]: How about Paper Mario?

1741
02:08:56,775 --> 02:08:57,675
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good example too.

1742
02:08:57,795 --> 02:08:58,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1743
02:08:58,135 --> 02:08:59,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It came in last minute.

1744
02:08:59,435 --> 02:08:59,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Last minute?

1745
02:09:00,575 --> 02:09:03,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And dear lord sir, please spell out your words.

1746
02:09:04,496 --> 02:09:06,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, sent from my iPod.

1747
02:09:06,497 --> 02:09:07,137
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's happening.

1748
02:09:07,177 --> 02:09:08,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no excuse.

1749
02:09:08,237 --> 02:09:13,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I type out all of my words fully on my iPhone so if I can do it, you can do it.

1750
02:09:13,559 --> 02:09:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm lazier.

1751
02:09:15,159 --> 02:09:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Lord of the Orange Lounge, what's your most shameful moment in video games?

1752
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:23,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about.

1753
02:09:23,842 --> 02:09:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine is Star Wars Galaxy since the hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard just so I could make hundreds of stem packs because I want to be a medic just that bad.

1754
02:09:35,186 --> 02:09:37,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That stupid game was such a letdown.

1755
02:09:37,487 --> 02:09:41,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent tons of money and time never swinging a fucking lightsaber once.

1756
02:09:42,029 --> 02:09:42,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Kisses, Jim Sally.

1757
02:09:43,948 --> 02:09:47,350
[SPEAKER_12]: I may not want my coworkers to know about my World of Warcraft podcast.

1758
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:54,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, a lot of them already do know about that and they don't get it, but they think it's interesting.

1759
02:09:55,213 --> 02:09:58,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work.

1760
02:09:59,215 --> 02:10:06,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean... You have to remember, I work primarily, not exclusively, but primarily with middle-aged women.

1761
02:10:07,638 --> 02:10:08,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I say...

1762
02:10:09,738 --> 02:10:11,339
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1763
02:10:33,624 --> 02:10:34,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say this.

1764
02:10:34,225 --> 02:10:42,391
[SPEAKER_12]: The person I work closest with at my work, who's another trainer, and her and I are the same subject matter experts, I will say this.

1765
02:10:42,671 --> 02:10:45,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I adore her very much.

1766
02:10:45,813 --> 02:10:46,834
[SPEAKER_12]: We work great together.

1767
02:10:46,854 --> 02:10:47,575
[SPEAKER_12]: We're a great team.

1768
02:10:48,275 --> 02:10:54,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do love the fact that even though she may not totally get all my game talk, she kind of is a closet nerd.

1769
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:57,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show, but it's not like you guys know her anyway.

1770
02:10:58,003 --> 02:10:59,604
[SPEAKER_12]: She's totally into comic books.

1771
02:10:59,904 --> 02:11:00,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I totally know who that is now.

1772
02:11:01,945 --> 02:11:13,070
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, she was telling me about like, oh no, before you go see the Avengers, you need to go see Captain America because there's parts of the story that are in there that you're not going to see in the Avengers.

1773
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:18,553
[SPEAKER_12]: She likes to tell me about how her and her son read comic books together.

1774
02:11:18,573 --> 02:11:19,633
[SPEAKER_12]: That used to be a bonding thing for them.

1775
02:11:19,854 --> 02:11:22,575
[SPEAKER_12]: She was talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons together with them.

1776
02:11:22,595 --> 02:11:23,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought that was just neat.

1777
02:11:24,016 --> 02:11:24,476
[SPEAKER_12]: It was neat.

1778
02:11:27,517 --> 02:11:28,698
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing to be ashamed of.

1779
02:11:29,398 --> 02:11:30,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're a DC fan.

1780
02:11:30,899 --> 02:11:38,082
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why, just to bring this back to an empowering moment, that's why I love VOG, the voice of Geeks Network.

1781
02:11:38,322 --> 02:11:40,563
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek.

1782
02:11:41,143 --> 02:11:42,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Let your voice be heard.

1783
02:11:42,904 --> 02:11:43,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1784
02:11:44,285 --> 02:11:46,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway.

1785
02:11:47,546 --> 02:11:48,366
[SPEAKER_12]: About what, VOG?

1786
02:11:48,486 --> 02:11:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: No, about people knowing what my fandoms are.

1787
02:11:51,828 --> 02:11:54,689
[SPEAKER_12]: You've made a career out of it, woman.

1788
02:11:55,009 --> 02:11:55,889
[SPEAKER_12]: At least a nighttime career.

1789
02:11:55,909 --> 02:12:00,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, but I really am completely happy.

1790
02:12:01,511 --> 02:12:04,032
[SPEAKER_04]: My nerdy stuff makes me happy.

1791
02:12:05,813 --> 02:12:09,374
[SPEAKER_04]: If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like, yeah, I play games.

1792
02:12:09,794 --> 02:12:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Mass Effect right now, yo.

1793
02:12:11,455 --> 02:12:11,695
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

1794
02:12:12,415 --> 02:12:15,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I took one of my co-workers to the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco.

1795
02:12:15,818 --> 02:12:16,218
[SPEAKER_04]: We drove over there.

1796
02:12:16,278 --> 02:12:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

1797
02:12:16,858 --> 02:12:17,459
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a blast.

1798
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:18,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1799
02:12:40,529 --> 02:12:42,430
[SPEAKER_12]: She's also a fan of this page on Facebook.

1800
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:44,452
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my coworkers, yeah.

1801
02:12:44,752 --> 02:12:46,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, be a fan of my page.

1802
02:12:47,213 --> 02:12:49,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you can go like Jamie too, but I do want to say this.

1803
02:12:49,715 --> 02:12:54,758
[SPEAKER_12]: The Orange Lounge Radio page is two people short of 500.

1804
02:12:56,119 --> 02:12:56,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it.

1805
02:12:56,459 --> 02:13:00,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think for our 10th anniversary you could get us 500 likes on Facebook?

1806
02:13:00,642 --> 02:13:03,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I could go, oh, we want 1,000 likes on Facebook and 5,000.

1807
02:13:03,864 --> 02:13:08,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course we fucking want 5,000 likes on Facebook, but I'm going to keep the goal reasonable.

1808
02:13:09,656 --> 02:13:12,837
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast next week Meanwhile, let's get angsty

1809
02:13:46,135 --> 02:13:49,578
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU, I have a few FUs, but I also have a thank you.

1810
02:13:50,398 --> 02:14:03,569
[SPEAKER_04]: My first FU goes towards this trend lately of people having like, you know, a Camry or some shit up on these huge ass wheels with like bicycle spokes in them.

1811
02:14:03,929 --> 02:14:05,070
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about, Rob?

1812
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:07,380
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1813
02:14:22,188 --> 02:14:32,939
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's like, it doesn't add any, first of all, it reduces, it decreases their gas mileage because they have higher wind resistance.

1814
02:14:33,639 --> 02:14:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It adds no grip to the ground and it's just not at all good for their suspension.

1815
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:40,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

1816
02:14:40,306 --> 02:14:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and you know what we want to know what broke my heart, Robb?

1817
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:45,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, oh no, it really broke my heart.

1818
02:14:45,452 --> 02:14:46,332
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1819
02:14:46,832 --> 02:14:51,233
[SPEAKER_04]: 1970 Dodge Challenger, which is one of my favorite muscle cars, with the fucking wheels like that.

1820
02:14:51,434 --> 02:14:52,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to kill a bitch.

1821
02:14:53,474 --> 02:14:55,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have cut them so hard.

1822
02:14:55,935 --> 02:15:00,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think that I would just fall over dead if I happened to see one of the 72 Chevelle SS.

1823
02:15:00,497 --> 02:15:01,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would murder me.

1824
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:22,280
[SPEAKER_04]: and then there were there was just the the people this is the other thing and people try to sneak around you without saying excuse me when you don't see them all you have to do is go oh excuse me may I get by please and I'm like I'll step aside and be like okay what it's California in particular where people don't do that

1825
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:29,385
[SPEAKER_04]: and like anywhere else that I've been, people will tap me on the shoulder and say, excuse me, may I move around?

1826
02:15:30,046 --> 02:15:30,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't do it here.

1827
02:15:31,126 --> 02:15:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get why.

1828
02:15:32,407 --> 02:15:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is just speak to somebody and not treat them like they're an inconvenience.

1829
02:15:37,871 --> 02:15:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my mom, but I have to direct an FU in her direction.

1830
02:15:45,409 --> 02:15:47,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, actually, I've got it in front of me on Facebook.

1831
02:15:48,773 --> 02:15:54,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going, making adjustments in my diet because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick.

1832
02:15:55,759 --> 02:16:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And my mom says, I've lost eight pounds in two weeks and I ain't no vegan, I eat meat.

1833
02:16:01,125 --> 02:16:01,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Waterweight.

1834
02:16:01,726 --> 02:16:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol?

1835
02:16:06,792 --> 02:16:08,595
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a bitch, but that's why we love you.

1836
02:16:08,815 --> 02:16:15,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I said, I also greatly appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy and eat food that's good for me and lose a little bit of my extra bulk.

1837
02:16:15,724 --> 02:16:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks mom, slash sarcasm.

1838
02:16:18,127 --> 02:16:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh so uh it's just this thing with my mom basically anything that is not in her scope of reality she sort of just rejects it and substitutes it with her own version of reality and in some uh places they call that insanity so I don't know if it's just a mom thing she just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view so I guess this isn't oh I just noticed

1839
02:16:42,637 --> 02:16:44,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, look at that, look at that.

1840
02:16:44,238 --> 02:16:45,359
[SPEAKER_12]: 500, 500 likes.

1841
02:16:45,379 --> 02:16:47,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, whoever just liked us.

1842
02:16:47,281 --> 02:16:50,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't see who it is, but... 50 for every year of the podcast.

1843
02:16:50,444 --> 02:16:51,464
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, now let's do 600.

1844
02:16:52,946 --> 02:16:55,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Well... Or no, I want 666 now.

1845
02:16:57,429 --> 02:16:58,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to continue.

1846
02:16:58,711 --> 02:16:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1847
02:16:59,811 --> 02:17:00,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that...

1848
02:17:02,073 --> 02:17:02,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I love my mom.

1849
02:17:03,014 --> 02:17:04,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly an FU.

1850
02:17:04,516 --> 02:17:06,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a, really?

1851
02:17:06,798 --> 02:17:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1852
02:17:07,839 --> 02:17:08,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you just go, really?

1853
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1854
02:17:10,201 --> 02:17:17,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that meme where the girl is looking sideways and making the face, which you can't see, so this is really good radio.

1855
02:17:17,788 --> 02:17:19,090
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a lot of FUs to give tonight.

1856
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:20,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my thank you.

1857
02:17:21,172 --> 02:17:21,912
[SPEAKER_04]: My thank you.

1858
02:17:22,633 --> 02:17:24,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods.

1859
02:17:25,509 --> 02:17:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Who let me and my small little purchase go through And said, oh no, you've only got a couple You go ahead of me, I have a bunch more than you And I was like, well thank you You have a nice day And she's like, well you too, I hope you have a great evening Bless her heart, I hope she gets some tonight Yeah But it just I'm glad that there's nice, considerate people in the world And there need to be It just takes one act of kindness To make sort of a ripple effect Because you know

1860
02:17:53,755 --> 02:18:00,858
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take that moment and make a difference in somebody else's day, then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference in somebody else's day.

1861
02:18:00,958 --> 02:18:01,739
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

1862
02:18:02,899 --> 02:18:03,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

1863
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Spent.

1864
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1865
02:18:08,382 --> 02:18:10,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh... I don't know.

1866
02:18:10,923 --> 02:18:11,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything.

1867
02:18:12,844 --> 02:18:15,285
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my throat being sore for a third week in a row.

1868
02:18:16,666 --> 02:18:19,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going away, so I guess I gotta go see the doctor now.

1869
02:18:29,559 --> 02:18:42,389
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to make mine intentionally extremely vague tonight, but F you to my fear of the uncertain and the uncomfortable, probably causing me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity.

1870
02:18:43,470 --> 02:18:44,291
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'm going to say.

1871
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:48,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, really, there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear.

1872
02:18:49,783 --> 02:18:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing wrong with changing brands.

1873
02:18:51,164 --> 02:18:53,045
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that part's fine.

1874
02:18:54,787 --> 02:18:56,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you kidding?

1875
02:18:56,288 --> 02:18:59,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they might fit a little differently than your current brand.

1876
02:18:59,690 --> 02:19:02,092
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that's the incentive to lose weight.

1877
02:19:02,192 --> 02:19:05,995
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, Rob, if you lose weight, you can go buy new underwear.

1878
02:19:06,495 --> 02:19:06,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1879
02:19:07,656 --> 02:19:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant, like, changing your brand.

1880
02:19:10,178 --> 02:19:10,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

1881
02:19:10,942 --> 02:19:12,624
[SPEAKER_04]: They may fit a little weird in some places.

1882
02:19:12,664 --> 02:19:13,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little too snug.

1883
02:19:14,705 --> 02:19:15,866
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a new opportunity.

1884
02:19:16,807 --> 02:19:19,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how comfortable... They might be cheaper and better made.

1885
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:23,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear on Orange Lounge Radio, so I think we need to move on.

1886
02:19:24,754 --> 02:19:25,555
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be a good idea.

1887
02:19:25,655 --> 02:19:28,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, please, let's move on with something else.

1888
02:19:28,257 --> 02:19:31,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about Harmonix and what they're planning on working on.

1889
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:37,884
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually have three more projects, or three or more projects, that are in the work right now.

1890
02:19:38,225 --> 02:19:41,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of them are Rock Band or Dance Central.

1891
02:19:42,948 --> 02:19:44,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty awesome.

1892
02:19:44,670 --> 02:19:52,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, they can't talk about it, but at least they're coming out with something new.

1893
02:19:53,994 --> 02:20:17,180
[SPEAKER_09]: eventually but they said yeah they'll have some crazy stuff to talk about hopefully next year hopefully soon coming soon or not someday eventually alright let's move on

1894
02:20:17,853 --> 02:20:20,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Street Fighter IV Street Fighter IV

1895
02:20:35,493 --> 02:20:36,434
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.com

1896
02:20:53,112 --> 02:20:57,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But apparently enough fans pestered Capcom, they kind of let him do it, and there we go.

1897
02:20:57,497 --> 02:21:04,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I don't know if you forgot, but he had this whole thing where he suffered from exhaustion, like legit.

1898
02:21:04,405 --> 02:21:09,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion, I'm talking about he was just exhausted, and he had to...

1899
02:21:10,612 --> 02:21:12,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Capcom didn't even acknowledge that I'd been in the hospital.

1900
02:21:12,153 --> 02:21:13,074
[SPEAKER_12]: There was no change in my schedule.

1901
02:21:13,094 --> 02:21:17,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I was at home for an entire week before the doctors allowed me to return to work.

1902
02:21:35,071 --> 02:21:38,272
[SPEAKER_12]: When I returned to my desk, there was a ticket to Rome waiting for me.

1903
02:21:38,352 --> 02:21:39,293
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no mercy.

1904
02:21:39,713 --> 02:21:42,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone in the company says, Ono-san, we've been so worried about you.

1905
02:21:43,354 --> 02:21:46,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they hand me a timetable and it's completely filled with things to do.

1906
02:21:47,496 --> 02:21:49,617
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer.

1907
02:21:49,677 --> 02:21:55,239
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, when you made Street Fighter 4, which is kind of, you know, making Capcom a lot of money right now, I guess you can do that.

1908
02:21:55,499 --> 02:21:57,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is kind of messed up.

1909
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:57,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

1910
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:24,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know is it just here in America that you can kind of get that like if you have an incident like that I know if somebody at my work had a bad incident like that you would get what's called the work accommodation where you work a limited schedule or whatever your doctor that's what happened when I had chronic fatigue yeah whatever your doctor orders which I still have for several months right well and you didn't you went back to work I took two weeks off two weeks off and basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to

1911
02:22:25,993 --> 02:22:33,317
[SPEAKER_12]: which I mean which might to some people might sound like oh what a lazy but no this is like a legit diagnosed thing your doctor said she's got to do it.

1912
02:22:33,978 --> 02:22:54,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's related to an immunodeficiency issue and I was also lacking in B12 and vitamin D and it's almost in some cases I've seen people compare it to narcolepsy where you start finding you'll be aware though of yourself nodding off you know it's just overwhelming exhaustion where you hurt all the time

1913
02:22:55,530 --> 02:23:19,493
[SPEAKER_12]: it's it's horrible and anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls all right anyhow um what is this uh I guess Ono was continuing to talk I thought this was crazy quote was this a quote from Ono I guess it was uh Capcom was very good at squeezing people to the last drop of their blood to get work done

1914
02:23:21,568 --> 02:23:21,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Ouch.

1915
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:23,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

1916
02:23:44,008 --> 02:23:44,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Finland too.

1917
02:23:44,949 --> 02:23:51,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're a socialist democracy and they have the highest level of reported public happiness in the world.

1918
02:23:52,214 --> 02:23:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1919
02:23:53,995 --> 02:23:54,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn from this America.

1920
02:23:58,359 --> 02:23:58,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty.

1921
02:24:00,784 --> 02:24:03,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, that's it for my story there.

1922
02:24:03,805 --> 02:24:05,606
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess we're about ready to open up the Skype line.

1923
02:24:06,046 --> 02:24:07,527
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it sound when we open up the Skype line?

1924
02:24:07,547 --> 02:24:09,168
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1925
02:24:09,568 --> 02:24:12,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1926
02:24:12,789 --> 02:24:19,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll get to the Twitter topics in just a minute as well, but I want to ask Loki, surprise him here with any last minute stories he might possibly have for us.

1927
02:24:19,713 --> 02:24:26,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Just real quick, there's going to be a different circle pad attachment that's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet.

1928
02:24:26,966 --> 02:24:32,075
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually kind of conforms to the 3DS shell, so it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS.

1929
02:24:34,209 --> 02:24:35,269
[SPEAKER_09]: PC, JoyMashers, Oniken

1930
02:24:56,258 --> 02:24:57,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks pretty awesome.

1931
02:24:57,138 --> 02:25:00,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Supposed to be coming out on, I guess, Dessura for $4.99.

1932
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:03,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's out.

1933
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:07,482
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually out this coming Friday on the 22nd.

1934
02:25:08,622 --> 02:25:12,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess Mac and Linux versions are coming out later on.

1935
02:25:13,523 --> 02:25:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game looks a lot like Strider, so it could be cool.

1936
02:25:20,069 --> 02:25:20,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Which Strider?

1937
02:25:20,770 --> 02:25:22,032
[SPEAKER_12]: NES Strider?

1938
02:25:23,014 --> 02:25:33,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's an NES-styled game, so yes, I like NES Strider, but I mean, it sort of resembles Strider, but not Commando, you know, generic futuristic action game.

1939
02:25:34,994 --> 02:25:36,815
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, the calls are coming in, so let's go to the phones.

1940
02:25:36,855 --> 02:25:37,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1941
02:25:37,795 --> 02:25:38,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1942
02:25:38,916 --> 02:25:39,716
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Shane.

1943
02:25:40,457 --> 02:25:41,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Shane.

1944
02:25:41,597 --> 02:25:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

1945
02:25:43,879 --> 02:25:44,419
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

1946
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm burning up and achy and tired.

1947
02:25:50,762 --> 02:25:53,744
[SPEAKER_12]: For those that listen to Horde House, how are you doing after the surgery?

1948
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:56,401
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1949
02:26:17,748 --> 02:26:19,149
[SPEAKER_12]: You even have comments in the chatroom.

1950
02:26:19,189 --> 02:26:20,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackwolf says, is Shane awake?

1951
02:26:21,872 --> 02:26:22,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

1952
02:26:22,672 --> 02:26:23,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

1953
02:26:24,774 --> 02:26:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

1954
02:26:25,915 --> 02:26:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally had what I was going to say and now I forgot because you interrupted me.

1955
02:26:30,319 --> 02:26:30,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1956
02:26:31,019 --> 02:26:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, surely it was about Mass Effect.

1957
02:26:33,902 --> 02:26:34,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Percocet.

1958
02:26:34,603 --> 02:26:35,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely it was about Mass Effect.

1959
02:26:36,664 --> 02:26:41,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't think it was, which might shock everybody.

1960
02:26:41,548 --> 02:26:43,250
[SPEAKER_04]: They replaced him after the surgery.

1961
02:26:44,372 --> 02:26:44,612
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1962
02:26:45,453 --> 02:26:45,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing.

1963
02:26:46,533 --> 02:26:46,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing?

1964
02:26:46,794 --> 02:26:47,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not a pod person.

1965
02:26:47,554 --> 02:26:48,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it E3?

1966
02:26:48,575 --> 02:26:49,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it something we talked about?

1967
02:26:49,535 --> 02:26:51,777
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop.

1968
02:26:51,897 --> 02:26:52,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1969
02:26:52,697 --> 02:26:57,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got that indie bundle that had all those really good games for super cheap.

1970
02:26:57,901 --> 02:26:58,801
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent one.

1971
02:26:59,422 --> 02:27:02,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep.

1972
02:27:03,885 --> 02:27:04,385
[SPEAKER_12]: That was good.

1973
02:27:04,405 --> 02:27:04,845
[SPEAKER_12]: That was good.

1974
02:27:05,346 --> 02:27:05,526
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1975
02:27:05,546 --> 02:27:05,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1976
02:27:06,106 --> 02:27:06,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the humble bundle.

1977
02:27:07,847 --> 02:27:35,388
[SPEAKER_02]: and I started playing Bastion which you know I heard so much about I saw all the banners at E3 last year I was like oh that looks stupid and now I'm playing it and the game it's okay but I want every game to be narrated now because that is the best part of the game it's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers it's the part of the game that makes people feel so like hipster and that they're playing something artistic is like my game has a deep voiced bassy narrator

1978
02:27:35,948 --> 02:27:43,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel hipster, but I like to jump off, you know, well, I fell off the world once and he narrated that and that's where I was sold.

1979
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:45,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was so awesome.

1980
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:50,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice commercial in the style of the Old Spice commercial.

1981
02:27:50,431 --> 02:27:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: That Mustafa guy?

1982
02:27:53,012 --> 02:27:53,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

1983
02:27:54,172 --> 02:27:56,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a game narrated by Gilbert Gottfried.

1984
02:27:57,353 --> 02:28:00,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees.

1985
02:28:00,736 --> 02:28:01,736
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with that?

1986
02:28:02,017 --> 02:28:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be terrible.

1987
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:05,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants that.

1988
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:06,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play that.

1989
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:08,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I would buy that day one.

1990
02:28:08,141 --> 02:28:10,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I think you just died.

1991
02:28:11,343 --> 02:28:13,705
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the worst video game player ever.

1992
02:28:13,865 --> 02:28:19,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen the funny video of Gilbert Godfrey doing the audiobook for Fifty Shades of Grey?

1993
02:28:19,929 --> 02:28:20,630
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1994
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:22,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes I have.

1995
02:28:23,211 --> 02:28:25,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, it's fucking amazing.

1996
02:28:25,152 --> 02:28:26,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes I have.

1997
02:28:26,292 --> 02:28:27,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's finding that.

1998
02:28:27,353 --> 02:28:28,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Fifty Shades of Grey.

1999
02:28:29,313 --> 02:28:31,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate.

2000
02:28:31,954 --> 02:28:32,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god.

2001
02:28:33,155 --> 02:28:33,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So Shane.

2002
02:28:34,375 --> 02:28:34,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2003
02:28:35,596 --> 02:28:38,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I am addicted and I blame you and Rob.

2004
02:28:39,895 --> 02:28:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

2005
02:28:40,556 --> 02:28:44,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take all the blame for that because now, well, here's the thing.

2006
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:50,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a pyramid scheme, so now you have to go and find somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them.

2007
02:28:50,362 --> 02:28:51,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on it.

2008
02:28:51,082 --> 02:28:53,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get Dan to play it so that our entire house is infected.

2009
02:28:54,965 --> 02:28:56,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Can Shermie play it?

2010
02:28:56,426 --> 02:28:57,766
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she'll just shit.

2011
02:28:58,687 --> 02:28:59,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's disgusting.

2012
02:29:01,069 --> 02:29:02,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everyone poops.

2013
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:03,450
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2014
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:04,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I know from my little puppy.

2015
02:29:04,911 --> 02:29:06,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially your new puppy.

2016
02:29:06,592 --> 02:29:07,913
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you end up naming your puppy?

2017
02:29:08,496 --> 02:29:20,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilo from Battlestar Galactica Cool, okay Now I am completely addicted to including Garrus in everything because I kind of dig my Birdman

2018
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: He is awesome.

2019
02:29:22,961 --> 02:29:23,821
[SPEAKER_04]: He totally is.

2020
02:29:23,981 --> 02:29:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am looking forward to the hotness of Miranda.

2021
02:29:27,383 --> 02:29:28,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

2022
02:29:28,403 --> 02:29:30,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too impressed with Caden yet, really.

2023
02:29:30,665 --> 02:29:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's just not doing anything.

2024
02:29:33,166 --> 02:29:35,987
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just sort of like... It's because you're not taking him places.

2025
02:29:36,148 --> 02:29:38,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard earlier, you're like, I don't bring him along.

2026
02:29:39,229 --> 02:29:41,070
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just sort of like, hi, Shepard.

2027
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:41,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Wink.

2028
02:29:42,951 --> 02:29:45,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no, the same thing I felt for Liara.

2029
02:29:45,893 --> 02:29:50,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated Liara, and then I beat 3 and I kind of liked her, and then I started taking her through my playthroughs.

2030
02:29:51,416 --> 02:29:53,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't say stuff.

2031
02:29:54,598 --> 02:29:57,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And she became my hag, and I like Liara now.

2032
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:58,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2033
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:00,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have her in Kaiden all the time.

2034
02:30:00,601 --> 02:30:05,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then maybe I'll leave Rex at home for a while and take Kaiden out.

2035
02:30:07,565 --> 02:30:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do that.

2036
02:30:08,526 --> 02:30:09,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a much better idea.

2037
02:30:09,606 --> 02:30:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, people have been spoiling crap for me.

2038
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:17,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should unfriend them and then drive to their house and punch them in the throat.

2039
02:30:17,183 --> 02:30:21,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because I was looking up the stuff that I'm not doing in Mass Effect.

2040
02:30:21,766 --> 02:30:26,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was reading the wiki and I don't want to shoot somebody.

2041
02:30:28,891 --> 02:30:29,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

2042
02:30:30,372 --> 02:30:32,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that made me mad.

2043
02:30:33,054 --> 02:30:37,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That and the triple palette swap that I won't go into further detail about.

2044
02:30:39,428 --> 02:30:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk later about that because I don't understand what that is.

2045
02:30:43,951 --> 02:30:46,013
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't tell her the full picture.

2046
02:30:46,293 --> 02:30:46,773
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2047
02:30:46,993 --> 02:30:48,574
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't tell her the full picture.

2048
02:30:48,695 --> 02:30:50,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to play the whole thing.

2049
02:30:50,156 --> 02:30:51,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find out, Rob.

2050
02:30:51,336 --> 02:30:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm just saying.

2051
02:30:53,318 --> 02:31:08,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I hang up here so you don't hang up on me, something we'll probably talk about on Horde House this week that I saw today, I guess it was data mine for Diablo 3, that you'll get some stuff for having the collectors miss the Pandaria.

2052
02:31:09,389 --> 02:31:25,527
[SPEAKER_02]: um you'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some banners and stuff but there's also possibly these wings that say in the like the code string that they give you quad damage now how fair is that to get something that's actually worth like

2053
02:31:26,428 --> 02:31:26,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy f*** is this wrong?

2054
02:31:56,343 --> 02:31:59,766
[SPEAKER_11]: But holy hell, is it erotic!

2055
02:32:20,964 --> 02:32:26,783
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2056
02:32:29,086 --> 02:32:31,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any other last minute stories or should I go over to Twitter?

2057
02:32:31,147 --> 02:32:32,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I had Twitter up on the iPad.

2058
02:32:32,848 --> 02:32:33,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Tweet it.

2059
02:32:33,589 --> 02:32:36,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there is something I was just going to mention real quick that was kind of interesting.

2060
02:32:36,770 --> 02:32:45,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember how, well, we were just talking about Pinball Game during Part A where Twilight Zone was the game of the week here.

2061
02:32:46,375 --> 02:32:48,456
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently.

2062
02:32:48,536 --> 02:32:50,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinball Arcade, the Twilight Zone.

2063
02:32:50,637 --> 02:32:54,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to get the Twilight Zone, I guess, on consoles.

2064
02:32:54,879 --> 02:32:55,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it must have worked.

2065
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:56,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's...

2066
02:32:57,020 --> 02:32:58,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Jessica Harper from Understation Live, Saturday Nights at VOG

2067
02:33:24,901 --> 02:33:25,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

2068
02:33:25,562 --> 02:33:33,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that, you know, since you've actually been showing support for us these past two Saturdays and stuff, I would actually call in.

2069
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:34,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

2070
02:33:34,711 --> 02:33:35,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And say, hi, guys.

2071
02:33:36,193 --> 02:33:36,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

2072
02:33:36,774 --> 02:33:40,457
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, being able to check in and get points really helps motivate me to show.

2073
02:33:40,498 --> 02:33:43,861
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, obviously, I do love the points.

2074
02:33:43,901 --> 02:33:46,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no other reason aside from going and getting points.

2075
02:33:46,804 --> 02:33:52,390
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the whole reason, there's two reasons I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night when I can.

2076
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:54,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, I won't be there next Saturday, but neither will you.

2077
02:33:54,972 --> 02:33:55,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're both disco.

2078
02:33:57,134 --> 02:33:57,995
[SPEAKER_12]: There's two reasons.

2079
02:33:58,175 --> 02:33:59,516
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is disco disco.

2080
02:34:00,257 --> 02:34:01,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Disco disco!

2081
02:34:01,959 --> 02:34:05,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And somebody was asking me when we were going to do disco disco on Orange Launch Radio.

2082
02:34:05,122 --> 02:34:06,123
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, you don't understand.

2083
02:34:06,603 --> 02:34:09,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Travis already thinks I steal all the bits from Understation Live.

2084
02:34:10,267 --> 02:34:10,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to...

2085
02:34:11,528 --> 02:34:15,090
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to further give him evidence.

2086
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:16,331
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a ban on Disco Disco.

2087
02:34:16,791 --> 02:34:20,113
[SPEAKER_12]: The closest thing, you can go Disco Disco in PlayStation Home.

2088
02:34:20,313 --> 02:34:21,414
[SPEAKER_12]: That's as close as we're going to get.

2089
02:34:23,355 --> 02:34:26,677
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will say the second reason is Recursive Travis.

2090
02:34:27,257 --> 02:34:27,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2091
02:34:28,998 --> 02:34:30,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Recursive Travis always makes me giggle.

2092
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:34,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter how pissed off I am, how upset I am.

2093
02:34:34,702 --> 02:34:36,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Recursive Travis just every single time.

2094
02:34:37,268 --> 02:34:43,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I do love, though, that you guys... I gotta say, props to Travis, and I don't know if you're part of this effort as well.

2095
02:34:43,472 --> 02:34:50,036
[SPEAKER_12]: You've gotta be cracking the whip or something behind the scenes, because Travis is now getting his podcast up, same day, which is amazing.

2096
02:34:50,876 --> 02:34:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's all because of the VOG aura.

2097
02:34:56,820 --> 02:34:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it got into his veins or something, and now he...

2098
02:35:00,632 --> 02:35:03,674
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2099
02:35:17,063 --> 02:35:17,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, for real.

2100
02:35:42,054 --> 02:35:44,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Travis is now saving the Ustreams.

2101
02:35:44,475 --> 02:35:48,117
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're JVmon in our chat room asking, what is Disco Disco?

2102
02:35:48,577 --> 02:35:51,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You could go to Ustream and watch.

2103
02:35:51,658 --> 02:35:53,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you can watch and watch.

2104
02:35:53,059 --> 02:35:55,159
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually feel like you're there.

2105
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:58,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch me Disco Disco last week with no pants.

2106
02:35:59,481 --> 02:36:00,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2107
02:36:00,642 --> 02:36:01,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And watch his, you know, beard.

2108
02:36:02,202 --> 02:36:03,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the dirty thoughts out of your head.

2109
02:36:03,463 --> 02:36:05,284
[SPEAKER_12]: You didn't see anything below the belt except my leg.

2110
02:36:06,448 --> 02:36:06,969
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have.

2111
02:36:09,711 --> 02:36:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just seen Robin very tight lacy panties.

2112
02:36:13,715 --> 02:36:13,975
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2113
02:36:14,315 --> 02:36:14,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Not lacy.

2114
02:36:15,376 --> 02:36:17,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Silky is what I meant.

2115
02:36:18,119 --> 02:36:24,905
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to give some background to this because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy walking around in women's panties or something like that.

2116
02:36:25,246 --> 02:36:26,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it was Rocky Horror.

2117
02:36:26,447 --> 02:36:27,488
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a big difference.

2118
02:36:28,249 --> 02:36:28,949
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a difference.

2119
02:36:28,969 --> 02:36:30,050
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still funny to say.

2120
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:30,851
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a difference.

2121
02:36:33,993 --> 02:36:36,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any video games you've been playing lately, Iguana Girl?

2122
02:36:38,356 --> 02:36:42,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, pretty much what I play over and over and over again is Lotro.

2123
02:36:42,598 --> 02:36:44,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I am addicted to Lotro.

2124
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:46,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you suck DarkSakura into that whole thing.

2125
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to.

2126
02:36:49,142 --> 02:36:51,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I see her over there once in a while and she's like, oh, it's so pretty.

2127
02:36:51,603 --> 02:36:53,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, that's why I keep trying to tell you people.

2128
02:36:54,065 --> 02:36:55,365
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like it's working a little bit.

2129
02:36:55,586 --> 02:36:58,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to play it at least once a week.

2130
02:36:58,787 --> 02:36:59,508
[SPEAKER_04]: At least once a week.

2131
02:36:59,968 --> 02:37:03,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know if you know about My Guild Druidia.

2132
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:06,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeing something about that, yeah.

2133
02:37:06,567 --> 02:37:09,074
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have an all-Druid guild called Druidia.

2134
02:37:09,536 --> 02:37:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either going to be that or the Order of Vespa.

2135
02:37:12,996 --> 02:37:16,898
[SPEAKER_12]: She has to fit in her time between Tumblr and Facebook, too.

2136
02:37:18,558 --> 02:37:21,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had design work to do for reals that I'm not even getting paid for.

2137
02:37:21,919 --> 02:37:23,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kidding, lady.

2138
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:23,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Lighten up.

2139
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:25,501
[SPEAKER_07]: She just has such a busy gaming schedule.

2140
02:37:25,521 --> 02:37:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to fit everything in.

2141
02:37:26,881 --> 02:37:27,681
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a rough life.

2142
02:37:27,701 --> 02:37:34,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my Mass Effect and my Fractal and my Wow's and my Lotor's and my Stowe's.

2143
02:37:36,664 --> 02:37:38,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I only have time in my life for one game.

2144
02:37:39,746 --> 02:37:41,587
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my MMO addiction right there.

2145
02:37:42,027 --> 02:37:42,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, you know what?

2146
02:37:42,808 --> 02:37:46,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Getting addicted to an MMO still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes.

2147
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:48,951
[SPEAKER_07]: See, here's how bad I am though.

2148
02:37:49,331 --> 02:37:51,733
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to console gaming, I used to be right on top of it.

2149
02:37:51,753 --> 02:37:52,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember how I used to be.

2150
02:37:54,418 --> 02:37:56,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't own any modern system.

2151
02:37:57,019 --> 02:37:58,539
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I have is a PS2.

2152
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,080
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, though?

2153
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:05,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Gaming can be an expensive hobby, and there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer.

2154
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:18,826
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of people listen to the show that's kind of in your boat, where it's like, you know, I'd love to have a 360 or a PlayStation 3 or whatever, but I have to buy stuff at flea markets and stuff.

2155
02:38:18,866 --> 02:38:20,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I like paying my rent.

2156
02:38:20,506 --> 02:38:21,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2157
02:38:21,126 --> 02:38:21,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps.

2158
02:38:22,167 --> 02:38:22,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know...

2159
02:38:23,887 --> 02:38:34,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gone through a lot of life changes since my gaming days I now live in a place all by myself and it's in downtown Sacramento so it's a little bit more expensive but you know

2160
02:38:35,168 --> 02:38:36,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You do what you have to do.

2161
02:38:37,509 --> 02:38:41,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sharing rent, so I can't go out and buy the pretty toys and what have you.

2162
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:43,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we could do?

2163
02:38:44,730 --> 02:38:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Typing of the dead.

2164
02:38:47,711 --> 02:38:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, when I was going through all of my very, very difficult times, my Dreamcast was one of the things that went away.

2165
02:38:56,098 --> 02:38:57,820
[SPEAKER_12]: You girls can borrow mine anytime.

2166
02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:58,821
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come to my house.

2167
02:38:59,041 --> 02:38:59,642
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can find it.

2168
02:39:00,142 --> 02:39:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I could.

2169
02:39:01,124 --> 02:39:04,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so we can type zombies to death at my house.

2170
02:39:05,248 --> 02:39:05,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2171
02:39:05,949 --> 02:39:08,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And as mentioned in chat, I do have Chewy as well.

2172
02:39:08,271 --> 02:39:09,833
[SPEAKER_12]: You do have a Chewy and that's very important.

2173
02:39:10,354 --> 02:39:12,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well.

2174
02:39:12,296 --> 02:39:12,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And space.

2175
02:39:13,557 --> 02:39:14,358
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of my attention.

2176
02:39:14,658 --> 02:39:15,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a lot of my space.

2177
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:17,401
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2178
02:39:17,502 --> 02:39:20,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Jessica Harper, I got to let you go to try squeezing a couple more calls.

2179
02:39:20,125 --> 02:39:21,127
[SPEAKER_12]: But thanks so much for calling in.

2180
02:39:21,147 --> 02:39:22,088
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so good to hear from you.

2181
02:39:22,128 --> 02:39:24,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And feel free to stop by the studio anytime.

2182
02:39:24,772 --> 02:39:30,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Next week might be a little crowded, but if you want to squeeze in here and say hi with everybody else, we would welcome you with open arms.

2183
02:39:30,996 --> 02:39:32,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but next week I can't do.

2184
02:39:32,417 --> 02:39:33,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're going to Disneyland.

2185
02:39:34,077 --> 02:39:34,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be in Disneyland.

2186
02:39:35,338 --> 02:39:35,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, I can't.

2187
02:39:36,078 --> 02:39:36,518
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2188
02:39:36,798 --> 02:39:39,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't blame you on that.

2189
02:39:39,619 --> 02:39:40,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick before I go.

2190
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:41,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2191
02:39:41,580 --> 02:39:43,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for those listeners who don't normally tune in.

2192
02:39:43,941 --> 02:39:44,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2193
02:39:44,241 --> 02:39:47,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So Saturday nights, USL also on VOG Network.

2194
02:39:47,782 --> 02:39:49,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to check it out, do so.

2195
02:39:50,423 --> 02:39:53,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very happy to be a part of this and we're super excited.

2196
02:39:54,205 --> 02:39:57,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, come hang out with us and have a good show, guys.

2197
02:39:58,186 --> 02:40:01,967
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to let people know, it's more the geek side of the Voice of Geeks Network.

2198
02:40:02,067 --> 02:40:03,207
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you know, tech chat.

2199
02:40:03,307 --> 02:40:04,348
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sci-fi chat.

2200
02:40:04,488 --> 02:40:05,068
[SPEAKER_12]: And disco.

2201
02:40:05,268 --> 02:40:06,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of Doctor Who parodies.

2202
02:40:06,888 --> 02:40:07,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And disco disco!

2203
02:40:08,189 --> 02:40:09,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And all that.

2204
02:40:09,289 --> 02:40:10,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and disco disco.

2205
02:40:10,469 --> 02:40:10,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And Heino.

2206
02:40:11,309 --> 02:40:13,030
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you should just write it as Disco Square.

2207
02:40:13,590 --> 02:40:13,930
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2208
02:40:14,790 --> 02:40:15,670
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, thanks, Jess.

2209
02:40:15,710 --> 02:40:16,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great one.

2210
02:40:16,411 --> 02:40:16,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

2211
02:40:17,091 --> 02:40:18,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Have fun at Disneyland.

2212
02:40:20,633 --> 02:40:21,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Take me with you.

2213
02:40:21,714 --> 02:40:27,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Lucky her going to Disneyland and getting to sit in that five-hour line for Radiator Springs Racers.

2214
02:40:27,536 --> 02:40:28,816
[SPEAKER_12]: My wife's going to Disneyland.

2215
02:40:29,436 --> 02:40:31,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's going to Disneyland but me.

2216
02:40:31,417 --> 02:40:32,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you can go with her.

2217
02:40:32,457 --> 02:40:33,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just there two weeks ago.

2218
02:40:34,058 --> 02:40:36,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to take one more trip in August.

2219
02:40:36,759 --> 02:40:39,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I want Alan and I to go on a weekday after the kids are back in school.

2220
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:41,501
[SPEAKER_12]: She's trying to convince Christopher to go with her.

2221
02:40:41,781 --> 02:40:42,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, really?

2222
02:40:43,035 --> 02:40:48,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because she's going, because I said, you know, originally she wanted to take Josh and stuff.

2223
02:40:48,537 --> 02:40:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, that's going to be a fucking pain in the ass to try to, you know, haul a little kid on a plane and he's not used to sleeping anywhere other than his crib.

2224
02:40:57,160 --> 02:40:59,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like, listen, you just go because I don't ride.

2225
02:40:59,901 --> 02:41:06,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to love, like, okay, like for some reason I'm terribly afraid of roller coasters and I don't know why because it's weird.

2226
02:41:06,564 --> 02:41:06,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

2227
02:41:07,124 --> 02:41:09,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I was terribly afraid of roller coasters.

2228
02:41:09,325 --> 02:41:11,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Then one time Disneyland, it was awesome and then...

2229
02:41:13,167 --> 02:41:16,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The only real rollercoaster I'll ever do is screaming.

2230
02:41:16,649 --> 02:41:16,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Rob.

2231
02:41:17,129 --> 02:41:18,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let me get to the phones here.

2232
02:41:18,290 --> 02:41:19,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to read and chat real quick, though.

2233
02:41:19,970 --> 02:41:22,872
[SPEAKER_12]: BlackWolf is complaining, You guys just went.

2234
02:41:23,272 --> 02:41:24,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't been in over a year.

2235
02:41:25,533 --> 02:41:26,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, still.

2236
02:41:26,394 --> 02:41:27,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Two weeks is two weeks too long.

2237
02:41:27,935 --> 02:41:28,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, caller.

2238
02:41:28,855 --> 02:41:29,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2239
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:30,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2240
02:41:30,696 --> 02:41:31,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up?

2241
02:41:31,217 --> 02:41:31,937
[SPEAKER_05]: This is X-Link.

2242
02:41:31,977 --> 02:41:32,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, X-Link.

2243
02:41:32,497 --> 02:41:33,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard from you in a while, buddy.

2244
02:41:33,718 --> 02:41:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

2245
02:41:34,118 --> 02:41:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing good.

2246
02:41:34,658 --> 02:41:35,859
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf, don't feel too bad.

2247
02:41:35,899 --> 02:41:37,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I live right around the corner from...

2248
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel now that the Steam Workshop has now been available for Civ 5?

2249
02:42:01,972 --> 02:42:06,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't really got to play around with it yet, but I'm excited about the potential that's in there.

2250
02:42:06,915 --> 02:42:15,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's always been some great mods for Civ, so it just seems like a logical step, and I'm kind of glad that they're kind of embracing each other, Steam and Civ.

2251
02:42:15,379 --> 02:42:22,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't admittedly played a lot of Sim 5 ever since I got into the Mass Effect series, but I definitely want to go back and revisit it.

2252
02:42:22,362 --> 02:42:28,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard the game fell out of balance bad with the last patch that they did, so my friends were like, I don't really want to play.

2253
02:42:28,246 --> 02:42:29,026
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of sucks right now.

2254
02:42:29,306 --> 02:42:33,510
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm imagining they fixed it with this Gods and Kings expansion.

2255
02:42:33,830 --> 02:42:36,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months.

2256
02:42:36,273 --> 02:42:44,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they did a lot of work on it from what I understood from this last patch alone when they were adding the Steam Network workshop onto it.

2257
02:42:44,561 --> 02:42:51,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm hearing on top of that they're also going to be doing a little more odds and ends to that when Gods and Kings does come out in the following week here.

2258
02:42:52,028 --> 02:42:52,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, right.

2259
02:42:53,369 --> 02:42:59,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will be very interesting because knowing that you can make your own religion, it's going to be kind of interesting and intriguing to see what happens.

2260
02:42:59,975 --> 02:43:01,696
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a little bit scary, but good.

2261
02:43:01,776 --> 02:43:03,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to flip this question on you.

2262
02:43:03,357 --> 02:43:06,640
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think about Steam Workshop and Civ integration, Civ V?

2263
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:08,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I think it's going to be pretty interesting what they're going to do.

2264
02:43:09,082 --> 02:43:13,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharks with lasers or nuclear weapons or, you know, or bionic robots, you know.

2265
02:43:14,006 --> 02:43:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the sky's the limit.

2266
02:43:15,808 --> 02:43:21,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it's going to be intriguing to see what kind of different mods and stuff people are going to come up with for the game, so...

2267
02:43:22,313 --> 02:43:23,414
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2268
02:43:42,777 --> 02:44:01,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Siv 2 is my favorite Siv game so this made me smile and Sid Meier even did a reaction to it if you haven't heard basically and this was all over Reddit and all that stuff so I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this but this man has been playing his Siv game for 10 years he's now in the game I mean not obviously like straight he's been playing 10 years on and off

2269
02:44:02,558 --> 02:44:07,043
[SPEAKER_12]: His world is in the year 3991 A.D.

2270
02:44:07,703 --> 02:44:09,485
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a long ways into the game, trust me.

2271
02:44:09,866 --> 02:44:17,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically his world has the Celts, the Vikings, and the Americans stuck in thermonuclear war for 1700 in-game years.

2272
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:25,841
[SPEAKER_12]: That's crazy.

2273
02:44:25,961 --> 02:44:30,143
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying, is it a strange reflection on where society is headed?

2274
02:44:30,183 --> 02:44:32,644
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts this week.

2275
02:44:32,904 --> 02:44:34,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about that, XLink?

2276
02:44:34,664 --> 02:44:35,825
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I did not, actually.

2277
02:44:35,905 --> 02:44:37,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of intriguing hearing about that.

2278
02:44:37,265 --> 02:44:39,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll definitely go back and reread that.

2279
02:44:39,947 --> 02:44:42,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, that's crazy.

2280
02:44:42,187 --> 02:44:44,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Though I thought they could have sworn they'd stop it.

2281
02:44:44,668 --> 02:44:46,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, at some point, they do stop the game.

2282
02:44:46,469 --> 02:44:49,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you get to a certain area, it's like, you can't play it after that.

2283
02:44:50,151 --> 02:44:52,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's Civ 3 or 4, I'm thinking of that.

2284
02:44:52,392 --> 02:44:53,492
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably put that on there.

2285
02:44:53,712 --> 02:44:55,413
[SPEAKER_12]: It must be the later Civs.

2286
02:44:55,613 --> 02:45:00,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought the game always ended at a certain point as well, but maybe two had been left open-ended.

2287
02:45:00,617 --> 02:45:01,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember.

2288
02:45:01,818 --> 02:45:05,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe his game was modded somehow to let it go on forever.

2289
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:07,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't read about the details on that.

2290
02:45:07,502 --> 02:45:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: In 10 years, that's a lot of time.

2291
02:45:09,503 --> 02:45:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, I don't know, we take maybe a turn a day or something, or a turn a week, or...

2292
02:45:16,286 --> 02:45:20,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's very intriguing, but that's very cool nonetheless to hear about that.

2293
02:45:22,108 --> 02:45:24,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Sid Meier's response was really interesting.

2294
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:30,272
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, quote, My first thought was, wow, I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2 for that long.

2295
02:45:30,652 --> 02:45:37,435
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been more than 15 years since we released that game, and I don't think any of us expected a decade-long game would come out of it.

2296
02:45:37,895 --> 02:45:44,298
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be amazing if we could come back in 2025 and find out if someone's had a 10-year game of Civ 5 going.

2297
02:45:45,038 --> 02:45:50,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, it's kind of like, if you look at it and the way it's played in Ran, it's kind of similar to Monopoly, really.

2298
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:56,041
[SPEAKER_05]: If you play it right, it could go on for, I could see it actually going on for that long periods of time.

2299
02:45:56,262 --> 02:46:10,486
[SPEAKER_05]: If, you know, it's going back and forth type of deal and you're not really making, okay, I'm going to build up, you know, 50 units and go in there and try to, you know, and try to massive wipe these towns and cities in the short period of time.

2300
02:46:11,198 --> 02:46:17,022
[SPEAKER_05]: If he's taking his time and just doing it, building, you know, say like day by day, I could actually see something like that happening probably.

2301
02:46:17,202 --> 02:46:26,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me read this comment from JV Mon in our chat room saying, I know Civ 3 stops scoring once you hit 2050 AD, but you can keep playing if you want past that.

2302
02:46:26,488 --> 02:46:27,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's it.

2303
02:46:27,329 --> 02:46:28,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's it.

2304
02:46:28,470 --> 02:46:29,390
[SPEAKER_00]: The game stops.

2305
02:46:29,530 --> 02:46:31,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that's exactly what it is.

2306
02:46:31,311 --> 02:46:36,175
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will say this, and I know I'm going to get shit for this because he just said that he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time.

2307
02:46:36,255 --> 02:46:38,776
[SPEAKER_12]: But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3?

2308
02:46:38,816 --> 02:46:40,718
[SPEAKER_12]: That one's the worst one in the whole series.

2309
02:46:42,922 --> 02:46:47,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of agree now, especially the way that it's advanced over time.

2310
02:46:47,413 --> 02:46:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can actually see that, but...

2311
02:46:50,653 --> 02:47:16,324
[SPEAKER_05]: you know all the games if you go back you're like wow but it's kind of cool though it's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play from the beginning and going through and it's kind of cool like even you said yourself when you're playing Mass Effect seeing the changes that's been done from part one to part two to part three part four you know so on so forth so it's kind of cool to see the transaction and seeing what happens throughout that time period and and taking uh

2312
02:47:16,914 --> 02:47:17,795
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

2313
02:47:37,065 --> 02:47:38,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, X-Link, I gotta let you go.

2314
02:47:38,626 --> 02:47:40,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

2315
02:47:40,987 --> 02:47:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really that I can think of at this time.

2316
02:47:42,748 --> 02:47:44,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably gonna go back and play some Rift now, so.

2317
02:47:45,069 --> 02:47:45,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, good luck.

2318
02:47:45,909 --> 02:47:46,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Have fun with Rift.

2319
02:47:46,829 --> 02:47:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

2320
02:47:47,490 --> 02:47:47,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

2321
02:47:49,771 --> 02:48:03,377
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, him talking about MMOs, and obviously I used to play a lot of WoW with X-Link until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding, but I was playing some of the beta this week, and I gotta say, the beta's come a long way, and I was doing some panda tanking, and it was actually quite fun.

2322
02:48:04,665 --> 02:48:06,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call.

2323
02:48:06,086 --> 02:48:13,548
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2324
02:48:13,869 --> 02:48:15,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, I got to get through some of these tweets.

2325
02:48:16,289 --> 02:48:19,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon who said, shout out.

2326
02:48:19,151 --> 02:48:20,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually retweeted it.

2327
02:48:20,391 --> 02:48:23,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to OLR, longtime fan from many moons ago.

2328
02:48:23,872 --> 02:48:25,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Rediscovered you recently.

2329
02:48:25,813 --> 02:48:27,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Now listening to you live with my fiance.

2330
02:48:28,683 --> 02:48:29,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you for tuning in.

2331
02:48:30,284 --> 02:48:37,169
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of, you know, and I realize sometimes people just don't have time for OLR anymore or kind of fall out of the habit of listening.

2332
02:48:37,209 --> 02:48:39,230
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it happens, but it's really cool.

2333
02:48:39,310 --> 02:48:39,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

2334
02:48:39,811 --> 02:48:40,972
[SPEAKER_12]: I stop listening.

2335
02:48:41,372 --> 02:48:43,813
[SPEAKER_12]: At least you haven't fallen asleep during the damn show.

2336
02:48:43,934 --> 02:48:45,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft.

2337
02:48:46,715 --> 02:48:47,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

2338
02:48:47,456 --> 02:48:53,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Jim Sally sent a tweet that said, Hey guys, can you tell me how to spend you a tweet while you're live on air?

2339
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:56,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could figure this out, you kids and your twittering.

2340
02:48:57,142 --> 02:49:00,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, speaking of which, let's take this phone call and see who might be there.

2341
02:49:00,684 --> 02:49:01,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio.

2342
02:49:01,744 --> 02:49:02,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2343
02:49:02,205 --> 02:49:05,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Chugga chugga choo choo sexies.

2344
02:49:05,687 --> 02:49:07,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Jim Sally.

2345
02:49:07,448 --> 02:49:08,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, baby.

2346
02:49:08,268 --> 02:49:08,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey.

2347
02:49:09,209 --> 02:49:09,669
[SPEAKER_12]: How funny.

2348
02:49:09,749 --> 02:49:11,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just talking about you.

2349
02:49:11,170 --> 02:49:12,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Were your ears burning?

2350
02:49:12,967 --> 02:49:14,968
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit, but I didn't... What did you say?

2351
02:49:15,108 --> 02:49:16,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I was reading your tweet.

2352
02:49:17,148 --> 02:49:18,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote a tweet to you?

2353
02:49:18,229 --> 02:49:18,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2354
02:49:18,689 --> 02:49:19,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

2355
02:49:19,289 --> 02:49:20,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Or somebody hacked your account.

2356
02:49:21,210 --> 02:49:22,190
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was me.

2357
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:26,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little bit funny before, and I thought I would tell that joke.

2358
02:49:27,372 --> 02:49:27,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you like it?

2359
02:49:28,573 --> 02:49:29,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.

2360
02:49:29,173 --> 02:49:29,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.

2361
02:49:29,633 --> 02:49:33,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I was saying, can you tell me how to spend a tweet while you're live on the air?

2362
02:49:33,994 --> 02:49:35,335
[SPEAKER_12]: You kids and your Twittering.

2363
02:49:36,895 --> 02:49:39,876
[SPEAKER_12]: You pretty much got Twitter in a nutshell right there.

2364
02:49:39,957 --> 02:49:40,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Bad grammar and all.

2365
02:49:41,847 --> 02:49:43,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Jim Sully way.

2366
02:49:43,888 --> 02:49:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Jim Sully way.

2367
02:49:45,108 --> 02:49:46,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making my own English.

2368
02:49:47,309 --> 02:49:51,170
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say, to what do we owe this great phone call tonight?

2369
02:49:51,651 --> 02:49:53,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you another little present like you asked.

2370
02:49:54,011 --> 02:49:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the 500th person to like your Facebook page.

2371
02:49:58,413 --> 02:49:59,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Get out.

2372
02:49:59,113 --> 02:49:59,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

2373
02:50:00,154 --> 02:50:00,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2374
02:50:00,694 --> 02:50:03,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought as soon as you said it, I said, how come I haven't done this yet?

2375
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:08,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt a little ashamed, so I rectified my situation.

2376
02:50:08,612 --> 02:50:09,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the support.

2377
02:50:09,933 --> 02:50:13,355
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of prize should we give Jim Sally for being the 500th fan?

2378
02:50:13,555 --> 02:50:14,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

2379
02:50:14,596 --> 02:50:16,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I should get 500 VOG points.

2380
02:50:17,778 --> 02:50:18,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie has a prize?

2381
02:50:18,758 --> 02:50:18,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2382
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:19,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2383
02:50:24,302 --> 02:50:25,522
[SPEAKER_12]: You got a round of applause.

2384
02:50:26,363 --> 02:50:27,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using my slow clap processor.

2385
02:50:31,129 --> 02:50:33,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to get the 500 VOG points.

2386
02:50:33,891 --> 02:50:34,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And hearts.

2387
02:50:34,371 --> 02:50:34,932
[SPEAKER_13]: You get hearts.

2388
02:50:35,072 --> 02:50:36,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have VOG points.

2389
02:50:39,095 --> 02:50:40,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they go away at the end of the month?

2390
02:50:40,456 --> 02:50:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone told me to go away at the end of the month.

2391
02:50:42,357 --> 02:50:42,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

2392
02:50:43,118 --> 02:50:48,562
[SPEAKER_12]: The main leaderboard is monthly, but we are still going to keep track on a year basis.

2393
02:50:49,022 --> 02:50:51,604
[SPEAKER_12]: But that one is going to be a little more for fun.

2394
02:50:51,844 --> 02:50:53,705
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me tell you the reason behind that.

2395
02:50:55,526 --> 02:51:01,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Go back to the tweet earlier where somebody said, Hey, I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while, but I recently rediscovered you guys.

2396
02:51:01,851 --> 02:51:15,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if somebody kind of comes into VOG a little bit late, and we're going to be adding more shows to the network soon, so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out, we don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up or they can't ever play the game because they're never going to be able to beat the score.

2397
02:51:16,320 --> 02:51:16,620
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

2398
02:51:17,901 --> 02:51:22,785
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to reset the boards every month for that reason so people have a chance to win every month.

2399
02:51:23,325 --> 02:51:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG Network knows they can't keep up with Jim Salley.

2400
02:51:29,309 --> 02:51:31,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might as well just give me the 500 points first off, okay?

2401
02:51:32,351 --> 02:51:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Second off, it's Father's Day and I'm a good dad.

2402
02:51:34,913 --> 02:51:35,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a stay-at-home dad.

2403
02:51:35,853 --> 02:51:40,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I work hard every day, keep my baby girl clean and pretty and nice and put her in dresses and stuff.

2404
02:51:41,277 --> 02:51:46,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I ask for at the end of the day is maybe some extra VOG points.

2405
02:51:47,020 --> 02:51:49,982
[SPEAKER_06]: and a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something.

2406
02:51:50,282 --> 02:51:57,107
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Jim Sally, just because you call in to the shows and you do show your support, I will see what we can do.

2407
02:51:57,287 --> 02:51:58,087
[SPEAKER_12]: No promises.

2408
02:51:58,527 --> 02:51:59,448
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the boss.

2409
02:51:59,468 --> 02:52:00,268
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do it.

2410
02:52:01,109 --> 02:52:07,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, here's the thing is that Bobby did all the coding work and he's very passionate about his game.

2411
02:52:07,373 --> 02:52:08,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll see what we can do.

2412
02:52:08,934 --> 02:52:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Bobby.

2413
02:52:11,215 --> 02:52:13,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, don't be a douche, okay?

2414
02:52:13,596 --> 02:52:14,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me my 500 points.

2415
02:52:15,457 --> 02:52:20,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, Bobby, douche wolf, you don't give me 500 points.

2416
02:52:20,199 --> 02:52:21,660
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to win fans that way.

2417
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:23,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You win.

2418
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2419
02:52:24,041 --> 02:52:24,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you do it?

2420
02:52:25,601 --> 02:52:27,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You catch more flies with honey than vinegar.

2421
02:52:29,183 --> 02:52:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, Bobby, I don't care about honey or vinegar.

2422
02:52:31,284 --> 02:52:32,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I care about my VOG points.

2423
02:52:32,865 --> 02:52:36,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, this fucking Google Plus loving motherfucker, he's ahead of me.

2424
02:52:36,026 --> 02:52:37,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't have it.

2425
02:52:37,447 --> 02:52:38,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't have it.

2426
02:52:39,810 --> 02:52:41,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give him something to Google Plus about.

2427
02:52:42,275 --> 02:52:43,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

2428
02:52:43,517 --> 02:52:44,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I deserve those points.

2429
02:52:44,599 --> 02:52:45,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I work hard.

2430
02:52:45,641 --> 02:52:47,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I think without me, where would I be?

2431
02:52:48,764 --> 02:52:59,871
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything, if anything, okay, listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points, then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG Network enough, or too much.

2432
02:53:00,032 --> 02:53:04,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, I award you 500 points for Gryffindor!

2433
02:53:04,835 --> 02:53:05,875
[SPEAKER_09]: For Gryffindor!

2434
02:53:07,156 --> 02:53:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it you were going to say, Rob?

2435
02:53:08,717 --> 02:53:11,319
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a bummer the points aren't compatible with each other.

2436
02:53:11,339 --> 02:53:13,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the conversion rates.

2437
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:15,682
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that you were looking at me funny?

2438
02:53:16,124 --> 02:53:19,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning very loudly.

2439
02:53:19,565 --> 02:53:20,786
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was nothing.

2440
02:53:20,966 --> 02:53:21,286
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2441
02:53:21,566 --> 02:53:23,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Jim, Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2442
02:53:23,927 --> 02:53:26,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points?

2443
02:53:29,568 --> 02:53:29,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2444
02:53:30,289 --> 02:53:33,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now.

2445
02:53:33,630 --> 02:53:34,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Bobby, make it happen, Bobby.

2446
02:53:34,910 --> 02:53:35,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

2447
02:53:35,850 --> 02:53:36,931
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people are.

2448
02:53:37,031 --> 02:53:37,371
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2449
02:53:38,191 --> 02:53:38,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

2450
02:53:38,991 --> 02:53:40,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, Jim, Sally.

2451
02:53:40,072 --> 02:53:40,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one.

2452
02:53:41,704 --> 02:53:42,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for the points, Bobby.

2453
02:53:43,005 --> 02:53:43,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Good night, everybody.

2454
02:54:08,334 --> 02:54:09,774
[SPEAKER_12]: We are doing no such thing.

2455
02:54:10,034 --> 02:54:13,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Bobby and I are already discussing something in secret.

2456
02:54:14,035 --> 02:54:14,755
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all we can say.

2457
02:54:14,795 --> 02:54:15,416
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in secret.

2458
02:54:16,456 --> 02:54:17,156
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple more tweets.

2459
02:54:17,176 --> 02:54:18,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta get some of Tigerclaw's tweets.

2460
02:54:18,456 --> 02:54:20,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted the best picture in chat, by the way.

2461
02:54:21,077 --> 02:54:22,937
[SPEAKER_12]: This whole page, Tigerclaw tweets.

2462
02:54:23,037 --> 02:54:25,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but I posted the best picture in chat.

2463
02:54:25,638 --> 02:54:25,818
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2464
02:54:25,938 --> 02:54:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Of Peek-a-thoo-loo.

2465
02:54:27,918 --> 02:54:29,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Tigerclaw sends us a tweet.

2466
02:54:29,079 --> 02:54:30,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Tigerclaw305 on Twitter.

2467
02:54:30,739 --> 02:54:34,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft's first Android title, Connectimals.

2468
02:54:35,239 --> 02:54:36,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember Connectimals?

2469
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:37,220
[SPEAKER_12]: They're still around.

2470
02:54:37,921 --> 02:54:44,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently it's the first Android game that they've launched on Google Play's store, not to be confused with Google+, which we were talking about earlier.

2471
02:54:45,926 --> 02:54:47,027
[SPEAKER_12]: It is out now.

2472
02:54:47,147 --> 02:54:55,953
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also on iOS, just saying, but you can get it $2.99 on Google Play for Android, a little tie-in there to the Kinect game that I know Loki's a big fan of.

2473
02:54:57,934 --> 02:54:58,955
[SPEAKER_12]: He gave me a big thumb.

2474
02:54:59,135 --> 02:55:01,737
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a gladiator moment right there with a big thumbs down.

2475
02:55:03,391 --> 02:55:05,953
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let me read one more tweet here from Tiger Claw.

2476
02:55:06,673 --> 02:55:09,895
[SPEAKER_12]: PBS taking a look at modern 8-bit culture.

2477
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:11,076
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really cool.

2478
02:55:11,756 --> 02:55:13,237
[SPEAKER_12]: The evolution of 8-bit art.

2479
02:55:13,317 --> 02:55:20,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's like a PBS special that's going on there that's talking about, I imagine it's gotta be things like the 8-bit exhibit and all that stuff.

2480
02:55:20,621 --> 02:55:22,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff.

2481
02:55:22,162 --> 02:55:22,903
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

2482
02:55:23,644 --> 02:55:29,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Talking about some of the recent games like VVV, Mega Man 9, and some of that stuff that's really caught on.

2483
02:55:29,231 --> 02:55:29,852
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really cool.

2484
02:55:30,413 --> 02:55:31,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And murals and so forth.

2485
02:55:31,594 --> 02:55:31,995
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2486
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:34,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods and all that.

2487
02:55:34,859 --> 02:55:39,305
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can totally see why it's in our popular culture and all that.

2488
02:55:39,785 --> 02:55:48,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I got to close up the tweeters, close up the mailbag, close up the phone because it is about closing time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2489
02:55:48,630 --> 02:55:50,411
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to wrap up the show and say goodnight.

2490
02:55:50,751 --> 02:55:54,654
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to check in with Loki one more time to see if he has any other last minute stories.

2491
02:55:55,734 --> 02:56:03,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope Alright, then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk about this What is this that you brought?

2492
02:56:03,636 --> 02:56:17,320
[SPEAKER_09]: The FP It's basically a movie where there's these two post-apocalyptic gangs that compete and fight each other by playing DDR Wasn't that in a Madonna video?

2493
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Hated it It's really cheesy I don't know It's a screener I had

2494
02:56:25,475 --> 02:56:26,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to check that out at some point.

2495
02:56:28,037 --> 02:56:28,357
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2496
02:56:29,678 --> 02:56:33,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2497
02:56:33,661 --> 02:56:37,603
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought tonight is dinner.

2498
02:56:38,504 --> 02:56:39,925
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2499
02:56:42,146 --> 02:56:42,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Peek-a-thoo-loo.

2500
02:56:43,687 --> 02:56:45,809
[SPEAKER_12]: And Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2501
02:56:46,930 --> 02:56:52,854
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is this mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter, Zombie Playground, looks too much like Pedo Bear.

2502
02:56:53,494 --> 02:56:54,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pedo Raccoon.

2503
02:56:58,038 --> 02:56:59,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That is Pedo Raccoon for sure.

2504
02:57:00,461 --> 02:57:02,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zombie Pedo Raccoon.

2505
02:57:02,483 --> 02:57:03,604
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is Pedo Raccoon.

2506
02:57:03,985 --> 02:57:04,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun!

2507
02:57:05,486 --> 02:57:05,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

2508
02:57:06,539 --> 02:57:06,899
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2509
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:13,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, before we close up shop here, I just want to say thank you guys very much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

2510
02:57:13,764 --> 02:57:16,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for your support over the past nine years and 51 weeks.

2511
02:57:17,166 --> 02:57:20,308
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, all we ask, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.

2512
02:57:20,368 --> 02:57:21,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Help spread the word.

2513
02:57:21,829 --> 02:57:25,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we got fans 499 and 500 tonight on Facebook.

2514
02:57:25,692 --> 02:57:26,873
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly what we're talking about.

2515
02:57:27,233 --> 02:57:28,694
[SPEAKER_12]: I know 500 was Jim Sally.

2516
02:57:28,714 --> 02:57:33,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know where 499 came from, but thank you, whoever that was and whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio.

2517
02:57:34,177 --> 02:57:36,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Help us spread the word, word of mouth and all that.

2518
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:46,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you know from behind the scenes stuff, there will be easier and more ways to spread that word soon enough.

2519
02:57:46,486 --> 02:57:46,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-huh.

2520
02:57:47,027 --> 02:57:47,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Very true.

2521
02:57:47,707 --> 02:57:48,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Very true.

2522
02:57:48,187 --> 02:57:48,848
[SPEAKER_12]: We've seen things.

2523
02:57:49,789 --> 02:57:57,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I want to say, next week is the 10-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

2524
02:57:57,937 --> 02:58:04,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Please help spread the word, especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while, such as the Twitter comment I read earlier.

2525
02:58:05,044 --> 02:58:08,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I would really love to hear from the folks from OLR's past.

2526
02:58:08,587 --> 02:58:14,453
[SPEAKER_12]: The Skype line will be open in about an hour after the show to take your calls and messages.

2527
02:58:15,173 --> 02:58:18,555
[SPEAKER_12]: if you have anything you want to leave for us to play next week.

2528
02:58:18,715 --> 02:58:23,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really looking forward to it and I kind of can't believe it.

2529
02:58:23,377 --> 02:58:25,338
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we haven't said much about it.

2530
02:58:25,378 --> 02:58:26,699
[SPEAKER_12]: We kind of can't believe it.

2531
02:58:26,739 --> 02:58:27,760
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been 10 years.

2532
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:29,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit, we are old.

2533
02:58:30,201 --> 02:58:31,161
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our 10-iversary.

2534
02:58:31,922 --> 02:58:36,064
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be back next week to celebrate 10 years of Orange Lounge Radio.

2535
02:58:36,164 --> 02:58:38,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Until then, don't be a dick.

2536
02:58:38,385 --> 02:58:38,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Be safe.

2537
02:58:39,306 --> 02:58:39,906
[SPEAKER_12]: See you next time.

2538
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:43,782
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2539
02:58:44,403 --> 02:58:48,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2540
02:58:49,226 --> 02:58:58,112
