You're listening to the VOG Network Up next, the show where every gamer has a voice Orange Lounge Radio, live The following program is intended for mature audiences
Good evening everyone, Picaruno here from the UK.
I just wanted to congratulate all of you at Orange Lounge Radio for your Tin Jubilee.
Over the past 10 years, you have provided top-notch video game news in a passionate, entertaining, but most of all, refined way.
Even though I have not been the most regular of listeners, it is obvious to me just how much you care about both your hobby and your dedicated fans.
To Sky, DarkSakura, Loki, and all of your guests and listeners, congratulations once again, and long may you broadcast over us.
Hi guys, it's your friendly Jessica Harper from Understation Live, just wishing you guys a happy 10 years.
and looking forward to many more with you guys.
Love the connection that we have between the shows and definitely looking forward to sharing more in the future.
Happy anniversary.
Bye.
Hey, what's up?
This is Tire Claw.
I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy 10th anniversary.
I've been listening to the radio show for many, many years now and I really hope you guys continue doing this for 10 more years.
Have a great show and take care.
Hey, it's Oscar calling in to wish you guys a happy 10-year anniversary.
and why stop there?
Just continue for like another 100 years because you guys are going to live forever, right?
Right?
Right?
I want you old and wrinkly in wheelchairs and doing this show while playing DDR with your wheels or something.
Okay, I'm done.
Bye.
Hey guys, it's Sterlok here and I can't believe you guys have been doing this thing for 10 years.
That is awesome.
and I think I've been listening for about 5 of those years and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to and you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and BlackWolf
and my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the Vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago and that was a lot of fun so have an awesome 10iversary and hey maybe you guys will make it to another 10 years that would be awesome anyway stay black
Hey, OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, a.k.a.
YYR.
Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.
I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR Dream Game Bungie Ferritossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it.
I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.
I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.
I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives.
Thank you, slaves.
But I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.
Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last 10 years.
So Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.
What's up, OLR?
It's Zeether.
I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say that you're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to because you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts.
I like that.
I love the Classic Game of the Week segment.
It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for 10 years.
Starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining too.
So yeah, congrats guys, congrats on the 10 years.
Hopefully you can do 10 more of this, maybe?
I don't know.
Congrats.
Hey, Orange Violence Radio, this is Bajazan here, wishing you the best for 10 years.
10 years, that's pretty long for the radio that started off as, you know, doing DJ Ranma Mani and then morphing into video games.
But still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.
Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years.
And for that, I tip my hat to you.
And no, I'm not drunk or high.
Have a good one.
Hey, DJ Ranma S here from Anime Jam Session.
I've been a listener of Orange Dogs Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.
The OLR community is not just friends.
This has become a massive, wonderful family.
And as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that.
They all talk about video games, the game of culture, and the game of lifestyle.
But there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us.
And we have to sit there and discuss, which I think is great.
OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose.
When you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.
It's like you got different rankings of it.
And that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years.
As for me, I admire them and I totally respect them for what they do.
And my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match.
and from that point on, I said, you know, I wanna do something like this.
And because of what they do, is now what I do with Anime Jam Session with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting like our own family thing.
And if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.
So I am eternally thankful
for their contribution.
And in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people.
So to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you.
Congratulations on 10 years.
And I will be around for another 10 more.
Take care.
Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio.
The show where every gamer has a voice.
Established 2002.
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-host.
Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.
It took me about 7 to get it right.
Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.
There's been some bad ones in the past.
Are you going to make me go back into the archive?
No, I'm not.
Do I have to go back into the archive?
I think you're making me go back into the archive.
But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.
You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you?
It's disturbing me a little bit.
But Garris.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts DarkSakura and Sky where we'll talk about all things Bomani.
There you go.
In the meantime, enjoy.
That was episode one right there.
Episode one.
That was the little promo cut from episode one.
By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.
It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.
Has your opinion changed after 10 years?
Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.
And now I'm happy being the aunt because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.
TechMasterLoki
I have a headache.
All this time later and now you have a headache.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it, but caffeine will work.
Nah, probably not, but we'll try.
And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the 10th anniversary of OLR.
McDonald's because I'm late.
And that's really the only reason why.
I was sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something and I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.
I need to stop what I'm doing, need to leave now.
And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.
Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.
If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network, where we tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show, www.vognetwork.com.
I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com.
And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,
It kind of outgrew that time frame.
If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast, the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.
The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20-minute show.
Yeah, that didn't work out so well.
SSJ100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.
Arigato.
All right.
You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.
I'm getting better.
You're getting better.
A little better.
A little bit.
It's only taking me 10 years.
All right.
Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.
We've filled things up here in the OLR studios tonight.
We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show, and I want to say hello to them for a little bit.
Up first.
Rob, is your guy doing the cabbage patch?
Yes, I am on a DDR machine nonetheless.
DarkSakura is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse, which I think I'm the only one in right now.
And he's doing the freaking cabbage patch.
On a DDR machine.
How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?
Am I doing a dance from the 80s?
I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.
We turn in 10.
We turn in 10.
Thank God this is radio.
Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.
And it's radio.
You'll never get to see it.
But these guys just saw that.
Say hello.
Joining us all the way from St.
Louis, Missouri.
Say hello to Misty.
Because I know you're wondering between delays, layovers, and actual travel time, it took about three days to get here.
Now that's because you don't fly.
Exactly.
But you're like a huge train fan.
You're a train fanatic.
You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.
Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.
Yet I never rode on trains.
It was this really weird thing.
You are so fired.
I guess not.
Alright, anyhow.
Well, hello to you and how are you today, I guess?
Very good.
What made you want to be here for tonight's show?
G, I wonder G, I wonder
Yeah, I guess that's true.
Where in the city are you exactly?
I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.
Okay.
Oh, so you're in... Okay.
I can never remember.
It's a big city.
It's a big place.
And it's far away.
I went once.
Yeah?
Once.
Once?
What did you do in New York City?
Oh, nothing.
Just played at Carnegie Hall.
Oh, okay.
Hey, just a little something-something.
Band trip.
What brings you to California?
You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?
That and my sister also.
Yes.
Just for that.
Nothing else.
No.
My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.
Mm-hmm.
and I've just been here for like the past week and I was like, oh, my vacation coincides with the 10th anniversary.
Might as well make a visit.
What a nice convenience.
I'm sorry that the drive was all traffic-y, you trying to get here today.
No, yeah.
Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.
Well, Picaruno says, my fellow Eurobeat nerd.
Yes.
And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.
My name does come from Digimon, yes.
V-Mon was my favorite Digimon growing up.
Yes.
I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.
Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?
I think DarkSakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
That's in another 10 years.
The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.
You do the math.
We feel young and that's the important thing.
Now get off my lawn.
What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?
Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?
No.
Is the Metreon even still open?
It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.
I haven't been to the Metreon since 2004.
Metron was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago like there was an epic you know one where they gave away a DDR machine and then they had that epic arcade and they had all the crane machines and they had the oops cat what the hell oops I went to hell store what was her name that mascot I used to love those shirts somebody in shall think of it and then there's the official Sony store was there as well and now they're talking about putting a target in there
And look, I love Target, but... You know they have like the Gamer Walk of Fame?
Oh yeah.
That little catwalk thing?
They do, that's right, that is there.
But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it and so half of it was like white and the other half of it was like, you know, DDR machine and even the screen was faded.
It was awful to play on.
But Garrus...
So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?
Since it's my first vacation in like four years and my first time out here in like eight, I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.
Touristy stuff?
I've been, you know, pretty much at all the tourist traps.
You went to Pier 39 and Alcatraz and Napa.
I went to Sonoma, not Napa.
Oh, well, excuse me, princess.
I got myself lots and lots of wine.
I was very happy.
Good times.
But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became.
I saw the Riptide Arcade was gone.
I cried a little bit.
I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.
We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.
That was actually, I got to say, that was one of our earliest achievements, really, as a station, was that we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments.
And we did the Sacramento ones, of course.
We broadcasted.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.
Let's not talk about that on air.
Maybe after the show.
Whoops.
You heard nothing.
I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.
And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.
Maybe later, if you're good.
Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.
That's right.
Of course.
We're going to have a poetry slam.
In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR.
Like by pure coincidence.
We didn't plan it that way.
But my birthday is Tuesday.
So, you know, yay, I'm old.
All right.
Also joining us tonight.
Now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.
He's the one person I know was here for episode one.
Dark Tetsuya Dark Tetsuya
Good, good.
So, what's new?
Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.
Not us.
Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one, and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.
What's changed in 10 years?
Well, DDR kinda died.
DarkSakura
I know, and old.
Oh, man.
Put me on the spot here.
I don't know, man.
Just...
Be prepared for anything.
Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.
Absolutely.
It's live and uncensored.
And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.
Say hello, final guest tonight.
That's right.
The OLR ferret is in the house.
Actually, this is the OLR Ferret's cousin, because we don't know where the original OLR Ferret is, but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.
Thanks to the Magicka Radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.
There you go.
OLR Ferret.
They're in the house.
Well, there we are.
Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.
You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.
We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.
And, you know, the scene...
DarkSakura.com
Why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?
Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.
And that's kind of what happened.
Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Anytime.
And here we are 10 years later.
And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.
We went from being two hours to three hours.
Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.
and then you know we've we've been on three different networks now and it's just it's been a crazy ride but but here we are some things stay the same and here we are after 10 years and I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it whether you started listening last week or this week or your Dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for DarkSakura and Loki I'll let them speak in a
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This is a lot of work.
How have you done this for the past 10 years?
And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody's listening.
And by somebody, I mean one person listening is an amazing accomplishment.
I mean, it really is.
And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.
It is a true community that we've built here.
I mean, it's a small community.
We're not IGN.
We're not one of the top...
We're probably not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.
We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.
And it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.
Because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.
Once in a while we might and then get in big trouble for it.
But it's awesome that you guys tune in to hear our opinions and we're so thankful.
DarkSakura, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
Oh my god, actually.
I just got a link from...
One of our listeners who played a happy birthday song for us on ukulele on YouTube.
I'm going to send this to you.
Really?
He used to work with Dan.
Oh, yeah?
Is it safe to play on air?
I can't hear it on here, so I guess that's the only way we'll find out.
All right, I'll cue it up, but in the meantime.
My motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.
And Garris.
Garris is the reason for life.
Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
I'm motivated?
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Every other week.
I started a job.
Actually, you did.
Well, okay.
The chatter's thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?
Yeah.
That's true.
And actually, I was doing the show when I had the plague.
That's true.
See?
I said being sick.
I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.
So, but the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot.
Anyway, we will By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.
Just saying.
That's not good for anybody involved.
Look, I just want to plug this too as well.
Vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network, as you know, our third network where we've done OLR.
It's
Thanks for watching!
yet in that regard but I do want you to know we are working on podcast listeners being rewarded as well keep in mind the site is only a month old and we have one guy Bobby Blackwolf he's the man building it all so do you know we we want to be fair for everybody and let the podcast folks have their say too but uh we just need a little more time to get all that programmed so uh bear with us
Anyhow, let's move on.
Am I going to play this?
Am I going to play the birthday song here?
This is a birthday song from... What's the name he goes by now?
Shesro?
Is his name online, I think?
Here we go.
I'm going to play this YouTube here.
Hey, what's up, guys?
It's your boy, Scarzo.
Just want to give a quick birthday shout-out to the one and only OLR, a.k.a.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Man, 10 freaking years.
10 years running strong, making a kick-ass live show and a wonderful podcast.
I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart.
I mean heart, yeah.
So anyway, before this video gets- Did he say the bottom of his fart?
Is that what Sully was about to say?
Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.
His fucking heart.
Yeah.
But he censored himself, and then it made it sound like he said fart.
Camp I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts, and when I think about you, you make me wanna- Too long and I take too much of your time.
I'm just going to play a song for you real quick.
Check it out.
Thanks for watching!
Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Niles Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.
DarkSakura, starting us off tonight
Garrus.
Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for $11 with the first one... Thank you, Shane.
I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.
And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.
She is amazing.
I love her so much.
You'll love her.
But it came with the... Whatever.
Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.
Aw.
So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.
I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.
Well, that's why it makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.
and Grunt kind of is weird but yeah so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garrus again because I was happy and I've so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I and I was already a little sick and I got so motion sick playing it doing the the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.
OMG spoilers in those first five minutes of the game.
So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about ten minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5 a.m.
Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wild this morning.
Girlgasms for Garrus and I'm a boy
Okay, see?
See?
Anyway, so I did actually play some World of Warcraft because we have the druid guild, Druidia.
So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge, we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.
Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids.
Don't you think so?
And Rob's got one in there.
Miss Nomi Malone.
I do, I have Nomi Malone.
I'm a dancer, not a stripper.
Yeah.
So I did a little bit of that.
And I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.
Which, I mean, because like six hours I check it, do more missions, turn it off, check it another six hours, you know, because that's how long it takes.
Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.
Awesome.
I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one.
Right?
Garrus!
Like, it's not that the first one's a bad game.
Bitch needs to give me his mission!
He will soon.
He needs to give you more than that, I imagine.
Some bird love.
Alright, anyhow.
Anything else in your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?
Mario Marathon Mario Marathon
I deeply appreciate it.
I almost feel bad because that's a charity event, but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating, and I figure if you're watching them for 72 hours, you can spare one for us.
And since we aren't asking for donations tonight, we will say go donate to a great charity, Child's Play, through Mario Marathon.
Well, Dan and I donated, and if you look at when they hit level 7-2, you will see Dan and Jamie, parentheses, O-L-R.
oh nice so that's our donation put them to level 7 too very cool so go look at their page and give them some money after the show awesome let's move on and Techmaster Loki how was your gaming week?
I played Minecraft more Minecraft I've been working on the minecart track entrance to my giant volcano thing how are you dealing with Friday's Patch?
Oh, it's just fine.
There's still Way the Doop in it, so it doesn't matter.
Of course!
Of course, where there's a will, there's a way.
And then, what else?
Oh, I played Lollipop Chainsaw, and I'm disappointed.
I mean, how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and...
You know, over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.
How is that possible?
I mean, you just can't.
But yet they found a way to do it.
And yes, it is an incredibly boring game.
That I literally said, I'm not playing this anymore.
That's really disappointing.
Yeah, it is.
I want to play it.
I know, I still want to play it.
It's my friend's copy.
Don't.
Anything else?
A little bit of Modern Warfare 2, or Modern Warfare 3.
And, yeah, that was it.
So, I didn't play a lot of new games this week, but I think I might have a problem.
Because, here's the thing.
So, I have Mass Effect on Xbox, right?
And DarkSakura... Oh, shoot!
I know, right?
I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.
That's alright, no, because wait until I'm going to say next.
But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC.
And then Alan plays it on PC as well.
And he's like, oh, the graphics are better and da-da-da-da-da.
Which is true.
Your video card will look so nice.
And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.
So I was like, all right, I'll buy it.
I'll buy it.
So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again.
And this time I'm playing as a renegade and da-da-da.
And then...
Then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99 So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC That's right, I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long When I haven't been doing stuff for the show I don't feel bad anymore
like it is it is addicting and I gotta say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war there's advantages to both there really are I do miss playing on my TV I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller but I gotta say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse and that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with a controller but Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and
I am so much better with it.
And like, I am kicking ass with my engineers, which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.
My little combat drones and setting people on fire.
It's amazing.
I'm playing an adept.
So, but I have literally bought the same game.
Same three games.
Twice.
On two different systems.
I have a problem.
Loki, do I have a problem?
He's nodding.
Yes, I have a problem.
You know what, Rob?
Don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.
Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.
All right.
Otherwise, that was pretty much it as far as my gaming week.
I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing, things on the iPhone and so forth, but not a lot of new stuff.
So that's really it for my gaming week.
And yeah, this is the really sad part.
You ready?
Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Alinko.
Says, Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.
uh Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding Sky but I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week this whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with a keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking oh my god maybe I should like get into first person shooters
What is happening to me?
Well, you know how I got into PC gaming, right?
What?
My hand.
Oh, yeah, because when your hand was not as well.
And I'm doing all this with a trackball, so.
But, like, I literally sat there today.
Like, seriously, you guys have listened to this show a long time, many of you.
You guys on the couch, you've all been listening for a long time.
I sat there looking at the PC going, maybe I should give Battlefield a try.
Yeah.
Something's happening to me and I don't like it.
Suddenly I want to play first person shooters.
Are you feeling not so fresh?
This is so weird.
Like, am I going to want Madden next?
Rob needs a gaming douche.
Oh my God.
Anyhow.
I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.
I'm going to ask chat.
Chatters, what first person shooter should I play next?
If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer, what first person shooter should I play next?
I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.
Misty, how was your gaming week?
It was actually more existent than I anticipated.
And even for being on a train, Step Mania I believe works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.
Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.
Dabbled at pocket planes a bit.
Seems to be it.
All right, playing games on the train, going faster than the speed of light.
Not really, but going to our chat room, I want to see some of the comments here.
Let's see, Jim Sally says, Battlefield on PC.
Nietzsche says, Battlefield 3.
Actdeft says, screw that, get Team Fortress 2.
I do like Team Fortress.
I have played a little Team Fortress.
That is kind of fun, actually, because I like playing a healer in that and using the little bandaging gun.
That's actually kind of fun.
It's like the opposite of other first-person shooters where you're not shooting things.
Dark Knight says, Monday Night Combat.
I've heard that one's pretty good.
Drew Nami says, Gears of War.
I see a lot of people seeing Halo.
See, I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.
You guys keep shouting Halo 4.
I can't play a game that's not out yet.
I was not in love with Halo 3 I gotta say Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny I agree with that one You know what, I do have that on Steam and I tried to play that for a little bit so maybe I should go back and do that Zether says Quake Live I do love Quake Quake is real good So thank you for the suggestion I second Borderlands because you like loot, right?
You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?
I like loot at vognetwork.com Well, I'm just saying that you can also, I mean, that's basically, it's a first-person shooter with a lot of loot.
That's cool.
You get, like, tons of weapons.
I like shinies.
And it's funny.
Alright, I think Borderlands might be a winner.
I'll have to check that out.
4Player Co-op
Fuck that Best Buy front-end program that I had to use to download it because once I downloaded it, Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.
Thank God it took my key.
I had to re-download.
I had to download 10 gigs twice because that stupid Best Buy front-end program can't talk to Origin.
And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.
I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.
I mean, it's fucking better when it's all your games, right?
But
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.
Nice!
I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.
It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Don't worry Rob, everyone's allowed to be wrong.
That's right, you are allowed to be wrong.
I'm just saying Civ 5 is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like three days later I'll probably check out Civ 5 once my boyfriend gets a better PC because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization okay that's cool yeah I think like Civilization 3 is like the most recent one he can run on his computer
Oh, I see.
It's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old, for lack of a better term.
Yeah.
All right.
DarkTetsuya, what have you been playing this week in gaming?
Not too much.
I mean, a little dusted off the 2DX controller.
I played a little bit of that.
We can barely hear you, so I'm going to have you switch mics.
Dusted off the 2DX controller.
I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.
Other than that, let's see, a little bit of Stepmania.
I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play until I drop.
That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Bros.
Wii, trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.
And a little bit of Mario Kart.
I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but that's whatever.
You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.
We went on an adventure to break the law.
No.
We thought about it, but we went to Roseville Golf Land, which, you know, we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.
It is the place we all met, right?
Milpitas.
That's true.
It was actually Milpitas.
Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land, it gets sadder and sadder.
So Misty and I went this weekend.
It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.
Easy.
And let me put it this way.
The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like, oh my god, they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.
I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.
So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the mechs too.
Didn't even touch the Disney mechs.
I play doubles on Disney Mix I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I play doubles on Disney Mix because I'm hardcore
Anyhow.
All right.
That's enough for our gaming weeks.
Let's move on, folks.
We got to get into the news tonight.
A little bit of housekeeping.
We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.
Part B, there's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.
Just you guys, emails, tweets, and phone calls.
So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.
or get the phone number down, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.
But for now, let's get to tonight's news.
And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.
Yes, let's talk about... It's kind of a duh, because we knew that there was a new system coming, just we thought there'd be a little something-something extra on there.
But it's not...
So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.
The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS, no duh.
And it doesn't have another circle pad.
It only has one circle pad.
What are they doing?
So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the Circle Pad Pro and other accessories like the... Circle Pad Pro attachment?
Like the Circle Pad Pro attachment, yeah.
So Nintendo really just fucked that thing, didn't they?
Yeah, it's hilarious, too, because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the Circle Pad, except I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now?
No, there probably was supposed to be a Circle Pad there, but they didn't want to admit failure, so they just said, we'll just put it out larger.
Is it possible that they might release a Circle Pad Pro XL and, in a smart move this time, not make it exclusive to one store so that maybe I'll get one?
So how wide is this thing going to be?
I mean, seriously, if it's larger as it is, I got to add something on top of that?
It's going to be like four feet long.
I mean, it's ridiculous.
Why would we... I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.
I'm a little...
Not that I would necessarily have to buy the Circle Pad Pro, because I'm not playing any games that would utilize it, like Resident Evil, which was apparently not very great.
The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.
If you're a lefty, you get a lot of use out of it, especially in Kid Icarus and some of that.
Well, you would if you can hold on to... If you can actually hold the thing, yeah.
I, I, there's a lot I like about the XL.
I mean, obviously, if you've played a DSi XL, those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen, you know, it's really cool.
So I like the idea that there's going to be a 3DS that's huge like that.
I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.
I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.
But yeah, I mean, the bigness is going to be nice.
It's going to make the games look even better, which is exciting.
But then the realist in me is like, dude, you already have a 3DS.
You don't need another one.
I mean, yeah, it has better battery life, whatever.
There's really no must-have thing.
If you need more battery life, you can buy an extra battery for like another $30 instead of buying a new system for another $200.
Yeah, if I didn't have a 3DS, I'd buy this.
But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.
He's going to be like, Rob, I want that for Christmas.
The new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.
And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to, or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.
and apparently, I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff, it's actual size for the regular DS, which would be nice, because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS, although I didn't play that many DS games, so who knows and of course, yeah, priced $199 so, hmm
All righty, and that's the same day that that... I know this isn't coming up on our show roll, so we can mention here that Mario... New Super Mario Bros.
2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game with the whole DLC.
Now Nintendo is like, all right, I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.
I guess it's kind of where things are going.
But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video...
This is a full featured game out of the box.
The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.
And why should I buy the DLC?
I mean...
I don't know.
They're just experimenting.
Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.
They have never been online before.
What, a decade into the internet?
Two decades into the internet.
And this is their first time getting online.
It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.
You know, some things never change.
Why is it talking to me? !
It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.
Some things have to stay the same.
They need to grow up though.
Going to some comments in our chat room.
I almost said the old one there.
Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.
Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen so it's less pixel depth.
I'm still getting one.
YYR says, I mean, it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.
And I guess that's... Oh, the whole fact about the DSi XL.
What the hell's going to happen to that?
That's a good question.
Will that go down in price?
I imagine they've got to phase out the old DSs soon.
They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May, so...
I might have to drop it again.
He makes a point there.
Only $30 difference?
That's going to really kill the DSi XL.
Need to put that out for $99.
TigerClaw in chat asks a Nintendo-related question.
Says, Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC, are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?
Um...
It depends what new awesome thing they're gonna put on it.
You're also assuming I'm gonna buy a Wii U. I may not at this point.
It really depends on how great those games are.
So we'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.
Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.
That's interesting.
Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.
And for the haters, I just want to remind you, the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega, we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.
So, but then I think, alright, but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.
The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M. I didn't dislike it as much as other people did, but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M. So what do you guys think?
Namco Bandai is involved now.
I think that means it's pretty obvious we're going to see some Namco characters show up now as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake and all those characters before.
We're going to get what?
We'll have Pac-Man.
What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari Damacy, although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?
or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?
There was supposed to be a DS version but I don't think they ever made it.
So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.
What?
Maybe from the Tales games?
I don't know.
I might be stretching here but what?
They can still do the Prince.
Pac-Man's gonna eat him up yum yum.
That's true.
Mr. Driller Mitsurugi
Vandy in our chatroom suggests his pole position.
Loco Poco suggests Klonoa.
That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?
And they'll have HuPow.
Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube, or excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least.
And the Wii.
And the Wii?
Yeah.
I guess that could happen.
There you go.
But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie from that game that never came out in the U.S.?
What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Bros.
being developed by Namco in part?
JV Mon, aren't you a Smash Bros.
fan?
Yeah, but it's not going to come out for another five years, so it's no point getting excited for it now.
Good point.
Let's move on.
DarkSakura.
Garrus.
I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.
The extended cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360 on June 26th and on the 4th of July which means it's already out for those two platforms and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.
By the way, just tangent.
It's not already out because that's my birthday.
My birthday's Tuesday.
Sorry, brain.
I'm a week ahead, Rob.
I'm a week ahead.
That's all right.
Additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.
and there's another quote on here on how to access it.
To experience the extended cut, load a saved game from before the attack on the Cerberus base and play through to the end of the game.
I had to do my... Sorry.
Welcome to... No.
Welcome to the Citadel.
Stop.
Sorry.
No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the consort.
She just sounded so perky.
You know what's interesting to me though, Jamie, is that you're a new Mass Effect fan, kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.
Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending, so my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first, or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your endings?
and see if I'm still pissed off and then go back and watch the other one.
I can always just YouTube the other endings.
And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently nobody else liked, the one where everyone gets all mixed up.
Black Lab is in chat.
Puppy!
Yeah, I saw him earlier.
Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.
We gotta fix that.
Yeah, what's up with that, dude?
Lost Puppy.
Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well... But we'll see.
To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.
The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.
So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.
Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.
No, there's no way it's going to be that.
I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.
The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.
So that means there's like 20% of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.
So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.
it kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned and rushed the ending because I've been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing
I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody, which I kind of believe... I mean, I don't know what to believe.
There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.
You know, I just...
I'm hopeful for the DLC.
I did not hate the ending as is.
I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole... I mean, the letdown for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.
Maybe you get a two second scene.
A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.
I mean, it's very little.
That's the part that got me.
I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.
I understand that there's some things they want to close up.
That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.
I understand that.
I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.
And I think there's some people that are mad about that.
They want...
My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.
What are all those people going to eat?
You can't eat Earth food.
Each other.
I mean... Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.
No.
I'm just thinking of all... They're going to have a long road home.
And then all the other people who can't get home.
That's just very sad.
All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending, let's move on.
That's all I left it at, Rob.
Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.
All right.
So this is... I'm kind of surprised by this.
You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games, plus they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.
Well, interesting enough...
The game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.
It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.
And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.
So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.
But that would be the case.
So I don't know.
Very interesting.
But that is coming out later on this fall.
That is interesting.
Especially if the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.
My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii DS and 3DS versions right now, and then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version, and then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.
That makes way too much sense.
Well, they definitely won't be doing that.
How dare you bring logic into this show?
Damn it!
How dare you?
It's very possible that they may not.
I mean, like Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July, and they cut out the PS3.
So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.
YYR in chat says Activision would release on every platform if possible there must be some sort of deal well just like I said no I don't think so so because if they think that's only going to reach the you know kind of children demographic then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions all right let's talk about a remake
There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.
This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.
It's Okami HD.
Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.
I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling.
How do we please them?
They're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.
It's full 1080p HD.
It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.
It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced, on Twitter, and of course on YouTube.
It is going to be launching.
This is the really interesting part.
It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen.
That's about 50 bucks.
In the U.S., Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.
Ha ha, we get a deal.
Sorry, Japan.
But that is awesome.
Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.
Yeah, you never know.
The one in Japan might come with, like, I don't know, stickers, box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark, maybe a soundtrack or something extra.
Now, now, now, it was only... Oh, that was the Wii version.
I thought it was the... There was something with the DS Okamiden, I think, that had something funky with that, too.
Maybe the box art?
I don't know.
It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30.
That was a Bubble Bobble game.
So, but that, you know what, what's funny, this is one of those games I never really got around to playing.
I missed it.
Like, I, you know, played a demo.
That was about it.
But I really wanted to try this out, and I think the price of $20 download online is a great place to see this.
And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer, and it looks great.
Like, when they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.
Like, there's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in studio, and then it goes,
Oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color.
It's great.
So yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.
And trophies for your EPing.
Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates and just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which yes, of course, we have one tonight.
DarkSakura, first up with some news.
Diablo 3 Patch 1.0.3
so they're trying to make it more secure and the quote here says for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete before they can access certain game features
So basically it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.
So here's the official list.
No public game access for unverified digital purchasers.
No auction house access real money or gold for unverified digital purchasers.
Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.
Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.
Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests, but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.
Global Play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.
but they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and level 13 so well I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house especially when real money's at stake but that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online and it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3 and then, you know, they're doing that but I don't know.
God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.
I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.
But yet, Diablo 3 is a huge game.
Huge, huge game.
Go figure.
SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.
So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming it sounds like.
Hmm.
Interesting.
DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.
I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.
Is it really a damning number or no?
Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?
So you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360 And that's it
I hope that amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.
The game looks pretty good though.
Really?
The game is done by, was it Beenox?
I think they're the guys that did the last two games and it's open world and it looks pretty awesome.
The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.
I was watching the YouTube interview with him.
I was just like, what the fuck is that?
It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.
Hey, you're the creator of the game.
Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man.
Okay.
He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.
I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.
Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.
Hurry before he dies.
Seriously.
Let's be real.
The celebrities we love, they're getting older.
Him and Morgan Freeman, man.
Keep the old people.
Get them acting more.
They should do a buddy comedy.
Morgan Freeman?
And Adam West.
I don't know.
Maybe.
It's just cool old bastards.
Cool old bastards.
You know what?
Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold, and apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.
Nice.
All right.
Let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.
On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners... Cricket, cricket.
Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction, but a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.
I've never heard of that company, but that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.
This looks like it's another... I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.
What the hell?
Wait a minute.
It's like...
Yay, little girls are happy and da-da-da-da-da and she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on and then robots!
So Neon Genesis?
I don't know what the hell that is.
What is that that it comes with?
Look at that.
Is that a microphone?
Cosplay pieces.
How did partner?
Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together in our school uniforms.
What the fuck is this?
Pointing!
Giant Mecha Rancher.
DarkSakura.com
Let's see.
Okay, Zether in chat explains Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.
Oh, well that explains everything.
I'm so fucking angry.
I've heard Steins Gate.
Oh, you have?
Yeah.
Explain it to me.
I just heard of it.
I don't know what the hell it is.
I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.
There is a book report due Sunday.
This is why I love having a chat room.
They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection, Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well, Atelier Aisha, Kokan no Daichi no Rikenjutsu in regular and premium flavors, and I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3, but .hack//.
Sekai no Muko ni vs. Hybrid Pack
That would be very meta.
Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2, though.
Have they done one on PlayStation 3?
I don't think they have.
This is the closest we get.
It's a fighting game.
All right, well.
Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then... I guess anything's possible.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, I love this game.
I'm importing it.
I didn't even know it was coming out.
Did you know they have one on the 360?
Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.
Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.
Uh-oh, Rob's going to get it.
Okay, so the count is a two.
Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.
Two people in the world own Cold Step Saga on the Xbox 360.
Well, there you go.
Now you have a friend to play with.
I do!
Yay!
We're friends!
Yay!
Are you my Xbox 360 friend?
Friends!
Yes.
Friends.
Aww.
That's so sweet.
They still haven't removed that 100 person limit even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago so they could do that?
Yeah.
Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?
How about the Wii?
Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?
Yes.
People still do the Wii.
One game.
And it's called Zero.
Shinku no Chou comes out this week.
And it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly.
And it's like a ghost scary game.
Oh, this is a scary game.
Wait, crimson butterfly?
That sounds familiar.
Was that a...
DarkSakura DarkSakura
Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.
It's part of the Fatal Frame series.
Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.
Okay.
On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.
You know what that means?
Droh.
27th we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD collection on PS3 and the Darkside Chronicles HD for PS3 the 29th Harvest Moon the Tale of Two Towns because we can't have enough sheep and cows Mini Ninja I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it when that is totally incorrect so I am not going to say it the way it is on the box it's Mini Ninja Adventures
Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection, Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir, Spec Ops The Line, and The Amazing Spider-Man.
Spider-Man!
Alright.
A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
And I've been assured that DarkSakura has picked a special game for the classic game of the week this week.
But first, Loki.
So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.
Good for him.
Get off that sinking ship.
Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday.
And basically just, you know,
I don't know, just moving on to better things.
He said, both as individuals and as a group, you've taught me more than I could have ever thought possible, and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.
That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.
Okay, maybe I made up that last part.
Could this be a very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?
Yes.
I don't know.
I mean, honestly, I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games, but it's a team that puts that stuff together.
It's not just one dude, so...
That's true, and he's not the only guy, too.
We just had a story last week about other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.
I didn't want to be worked to death, so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.
Did he say where he went?
No.
It could be interesting to see where he ends up.
That's the part of the story I want to know.
Did he leave for another opportunity, or did he leave because he would rather go work at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?
I'd be very curious to know that.
That's at least as old as you are.
One of the best...
Well, technically that's true.
It is true.
It's from the 80s.
It's not... Hi.
It's older than the show.
Hi.
Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.
Alright, moving on.
What?
I got ferreted.
I felt good after 10 years.
All right.
So the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court against a clone game.
And, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these, and it's out of control because Apple doesn't – the people that are screening the games don't necessarily know what intellectual property is what, although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out.
Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or –
Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was like the number one thing and all it was was an app that was like pictures of Pokemon or something?
It was bad.
Pokemon and the gold is going in my pocket.
That's right.
Pokemon, give me your money.
Anyhow, Zio Interactive made this game called Mino and they said it was inspired by Tetris.
But when the Tetris company found the game, they sued Zio for copyright infringement in New Jersey.
And during the legal fight,
Zio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.
Rules cannot be covered by copyright.
Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets so this game infringed on the copyrights.
Which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris.
And we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs.
But the difference is Zio was like a fucking copy, right?
So in the ruling, the judge basically says, here's what is and what isn't copyright.
The judge says the basic rule sets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.
He says the basic rule set of Tetris is not copyrightable as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board is not an idea you can copyright.
Hence, Dr. Mario.
You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier, but I am now since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.
Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?
It would be interesting to... Well, according to some law or some court cases against two competing games that are very similar like that... It was settled.
It never went to court, did it?
I believe it was settled.
So anyway, I'm just curious.
Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I'm just curious.
But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.
And I'm sure all of us go, okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously.
Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing.
But it's not Tetris.
Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but, you know, I digress.
Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?
It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's...
Anyway, but Zio, according to the judge, copied more than this.
They copied the exact dimensions of the play area, the shape, the color of the pieces, and other mechanics.
Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.
The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games that showed that they were identical.
They said that Zio altered enough of the game... Oh, I'm sorry.
The judge said that if Zio had altered enough of the game, like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior, it would have avoided.
So what does this mean?
And again, going off the article at GamePolitics.com, they say not much.
The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.
So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.
This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court, which means it could change.
But let's imagine, according to GamePolitics here, that it did have bearing across the U.S.,
DarkSakura.com
Nope.
Radical Fishing vs. Ninja Fishing?
Nope.
Even though some of us sit here and go, Zynga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to Tiny Tower.
But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.
Well, Zynga's smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties, and they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this, and you're gold.
GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.
Oh, that is a good thing.
YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days, including the color of each piece.
I never realized that.
Crazy.
Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating, especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network, you know, the store and all that.
So, yeah, there you go.
We'll see what happens in the future.
I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.
But, of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.
Speaking of years and years and years and years...
every week here on the show DarkSakura likes to spotlight the classic game of the week all of which I'm older than a game from the archives that DarkSakura says hey
You should be respecting this game and you should play this game.
And for the 10th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm sure DarkSakura has picked something very special tonight.
DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
Pong!
No.
Could have been.
Pong would have been a good choice.
No, it wouldn't.
Boop.
Boop.
Boop.
Boop.
No.
Beatmania 2DX.
A good choice.
And I had to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.
I started with a little game called BM98, which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.
So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.
It's a Beatmania 2DX song.
Heck yeah.
Heck yeah.
This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.
So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.
And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.
And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.
So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.
If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?
But you have two extra keys than the original five-key Beatmania, and your turntable is on the opposite side, depending on what side you're playing on.
So this has started Right Side Pride and Left Side Pride, where a lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.
Ooh, good for you.
I play right side.
Left Side Pride, weakling.
Right.
And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.
But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.
Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.
Or me.
Girl.
D'Artistio over there says Lisu.
Yeah.
I don't remember him.
Yeah.
So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.
There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time, and a backspin scratch.
So you have to scratch directionally.
For difficulty, you go from 1 to 7.
And then in 5th style, you had a flashing 7 that was the highest difficulty.
With 10th style, you actually had level 8.
And then an 8 plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.
With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.
So it's getting way past me.
I think the last one that...
I was really into was 8th Style, which I think was the last one I bought.
Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.
Ooh.
Ooh.
and also 7th style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song and then 13 distorted had multiple extra stage songs gold had two different ones the 1ES and the 1MES so yeah it was really getting crazy there like where else can they go with it
As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.
It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller.
and the effectors so basically you could control what it sounded like.
Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?
Yeah, to make it really noisy.
So you could hear it over every freaking thing else?
Can I admit something here real quick?
I mean, not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.
You have to find the song that got me into your beat What song is that?
Ultra High Heels Oh really?
Yeah I can do that
I beat the hell out of that song because I freaking loved it.
But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.
Also, the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs so you can see the song information and titles while you played.
Yeah, turn this up.
This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.
For me, I mean, even if a lot of people are like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they're just songs that were fun.
So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.
As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever.
A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.
Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.
You also had the, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.
and all kinds of really, really good artists.
Not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.
Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.
There were the...
They put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.
As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play it.
There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller and it would not work.
They wouldn't take my credit card.
I tried.
I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan.
He was going to ship it to me.
Didn't work.
One time I got Dan to agree to this.
Oh, I was so pissed.
But there are aftermarket arcade-style controllers that you can get.
And tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.
For all the different music, we just heard some Eurobeat, we had different types of dance, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions, I'd like to say.
Some rap songs in the earlier version too.
As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced Dingle, I guess?
600 songs.
Dingle.
Dingle.
Dongle.
Maybe a 2DX19 Dongle edition.
Awesome.
I support that.
Basically, the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD.
So for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit.
Like I said, hard drive.
So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tran, who is the little alien chick with white hair.
We have Yamato Tora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.
I'll try saying that three times fast.
I mean, just basically a lot of cool characters.
And you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like, who did the DJs.
Like, Etiquette, Q-Jack, Mix, all of them.
And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.
uh in fact I've actually got a um issue of Cosmode that has it's all 2DX cosplay so uh Celica all of that so anyway there you go Beatmania 2DX if you don't know what it is after listening to this show climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears there it is uh my man I love you Taku
This song was so much fun to play.
I wanted to have lots of Tran babies with you.
Not really.
A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Lingerie.
Beatmania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.
Just kidding.
Dongle style.
Dongle style.
2DX dongle style.
Alright, that does it for part A of our show.
But don't go anywhere, guys.
We have part B coming up.
And guess what?
No news.
Part B is all about you guys tonight.
That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundry is with you guys.
We'll friend your butt.
Of course.
Alright.
But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news.
We do have some news standing by if we need to.
Otherwise, Loki, you'll just run through it quick.
It's a last minute thing.
But we're hoping to get some calls here in Part B. But first, a break.
Don't go anywhere.
We've got to save Part A, you know, in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.
So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th Style.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Otherwise, this shit is old.
And it starts with a clip from episode number one.
And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed in its entirety on this show.
Oh yes, here we go.
We'll be back after this.
I hate you.
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Here we are live on our very first broadcast.
How's it feel, Jamie?
It feels like burning.
My thoughts exactly.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.
So we thought we'd take the show a little early.
So it's actually Wednesday night.
We're at Golf Land.
But we are taping live.
No do-overs.
It's just like it was a live show.
So what do we want to do?
We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land?
I don't want to do anybody publicly.
I'm holding a bench of stuff.
Who wants to hold my wood?
Thank you for volunteering for that, Ted.
We just got a funny... Hi.
Oh, we're doing a school project.
Yeah.
For Oakmont High.
No, we're doing an online radio program.
We have an internet radio show.
Would you like to say some words for our listeners?
Um, actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.
Oh.
We're just recording ourselves.
Goddammit, Rob, these things burning a thousand degrees, I feel like burning heat.
While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot.
I'm going to do my next shot here.
Hot damn.
Some hot damn.
So, cheers.
I'm going to toast Loki's water here.
Oh, wait.
It looks like Walt Husson.
Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.
Oh, wow.
He sounds like a woman.
Shut up.
Oh, God.
It tastes like 20 Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.
Cute.
Contestants, here we go.
Snub's got to catch up, and here's his answer.
Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.
Good answer.
Okay.
Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her.
Skyline says... Oh, he changed his answer.
I think his first answer was better.
He said Orange Bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it.
His new answer is Boomstick.
So we have Remote, Collar, Exploder, Dealey, and Boomstick.
Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?
Orange Bat.
Orange Bat!
I knew it, too.
That's right, you're already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it.
Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.
Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team, Magus and Angel.
Big Black Cock.
Her big black cock!
Dun dun dun!
Sorry, that's not a match.
But funny.
Puppy.
The ferret!
The ferret!
Good answer, but not a match.
Uh, Loki.
Her secret weapon was her... Iraqi?
Suicide babies.
Iraqi suicide babies.
Jamie, is this true?
I admit it.
I've been exporting them.
I keep them in my trunk.
Alright, in your trunks.
Dear God, what about the children?
Alright, moving on.
Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.
It sucked ass, kinda.
It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.
Never rent whatever the hell that movie was.
It was bad.
Envy of the dot dot dot.
The film that we watched was called Envy.
Actually, it says Envy on the box.
It's actual full title is called Penis Envy.
It's a story about these two drifting chicks.
They're walking through the desert.
They go to this bar and they get really drunk.
And, I mean, this is talking about, like, white trash America.
They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.
And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?
And so they walk around and, lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen.
Hey, Loki?
Was it Mr. Spanky?
And then they start, like, you know, screwing this one chick, and then this other thing, they screw this other guy, and then eventually they get tired of having a penis, and so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A.
where she's at a gay bar, and then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis, but the one chick likes the penis so much, and then she ends up getting killed in the end.
That was beautiful, thank you.
Xtifer, what were you doing on my computer last night?
Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.
I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago.
You remember how messy my desktop used to be, like it was just icons everywhere, right?
And you couldn't even see my background.
Now you have balls on it.
I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?
Now, Xtifer went in, and last night, while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop, and now I have folders that say, Big Boobies Number One.
Big Boobies No.
2, Big Boobies with Cocks in Them, Blood Spattered Boobies, Boobies and Sunflowers, Boobies for Milkin, Boobies in Pee, Mastectomy Leftover Boobies, Hot Hairy Saggy Man Boobies, and then my last, my favorite here, Women in Roller Skates Peeing in Glass Bowls.
What the hell?
Why did you do that?
I'm not gonna, you know, if you're gonna download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.
Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.
By the way, um... Did they use something other than bleach?
Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?
No.
Oh, well, you know how you have, like...
What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?
I'm disgusted.
I am so disgusted.
Girls, just want to have a... Alright, I'm coming out.
I'm coming out.
Here it is.
Loki's singing, I'm coming out.
At the county fair with Teninga.
Here we go.
Remember, it goes, I'm coming out.
You know?
You know how it goes?
You know how this one goes?
Okay, here we go.
Stand in.
Stand in.

God, this is long.
It just doesn't fucking end.
It just keeps on going on.
I'm gonna kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.
You're gonna so die.
I know where you live.
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
A score of 6,964 points for Loki.
Not even a gold record.
There is no justice in this world.
Okay.
Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.
Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.
I laughed so hard my head scared.
I laughed so hard I peed, okay?
I peed a little.
I peed a little bit.
I can't with my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight, huh Rob?
Oh, that hurt so bad.
Oh, my God.
Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.
I did want to play something, and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro, because I was actually trying to make a new intro, but then I didn't do that, and then I did something else, and it's cheesy, but it's funny, and it's fun with text-to-speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.
Here we go.
Well this is a surprise.
I figured after 10 years of constant testing you would quit, or even better, would be dead.
I guess we should celebrate with some cake.
It's right behind that door.
Why would I lie to you?
Well here's a fun fact.
Today is cake day.
Do you know how they celebrate it?
If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.
This next test is very dangerous.
To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death, Smooth Jazz will be deployed in 3... 2... 1... Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
That was cute.
I like that.
Good job.
Thank you.
All right.
Let's get back into the show, guys.
Welcome back, everybody.
You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
You done.
Here we go.
Orange Lounge Radio June 23, 2002
Having live radio fail Mike sneezes And the games we don't love so much sometimes too Alright, anyhow Let's get into part B tonight And here's the thing We didn't really pull any stories for this Because we're going to open up the skyline here real soon We do want to do the mailbag first though We got some emails So while you load that though We do have the Fugle Question of the Week We still did that this week So I'm going to go ahead and load that up Here it is, the Fugle Question of the Week
As a reminder, the Foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.
Put them together and you get Foogle.
Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+, it really should be like Gacebook or something.
Sadly, you're not a lot of Google users, but we do have some.
And we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+.
And we did get some answers to our question of the week.
Here it is.
It is a little self-serving this week.
Considering the occasion, deal with it.
We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts or a friend told you about it.
What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?
So going to Google+, here are the answers.
We have 13xForever says, Oh, and Ferret.
Even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization, or at least it looks like it.
Tony M replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.
The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games, no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase... Oops.
Oh, crap.
I almost closed the window on accident.
Jeez, Rob.
Fail.
It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.
Perfect.
I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase your own games.
And this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.
The show's coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.
Technist says,
Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news, but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.
Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic, us fanboys?
Never.
I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.
Finally, I will end with this.
OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.
As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think, I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.
That's really nice.
Thank you.
All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.
Let's see, we got 20 answers.
Do you think I can read them all?
Oh, go for it.
This chick named Nelly replied and said, Spousal pressure.
What's up with that?
Let's see, Picaruno said...
Seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining, and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the hosts in such a familiar way is something you don't really get anywhere else.
Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005, and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.
Stay independent.
Ranma says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.
I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.
Who said we were good friends?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Girl.
RedTheHaze says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.
A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006 when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.
It's okay to say all games interactive, by the way.
It was a great show.
It was.
It's really a bummer it's not on anymore.
I then decided to check out the podcast and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast and just how really nice people y'all are.
The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.
More power to you guys and gals and may you have another 10 years of awesome.
P.S.
Again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.
The Stupor Bowl?
Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head.
And then the announcer voice says, blah, blah.
Makes me laugh.
Let's see.
Deakman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lounge Radio to go.
You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.
After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.
Fabrice A says, the chemistry between three good friends.
Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.
Thank you for noticing that because we really do.
Terry J says, I've been listening since late 2005.
I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.
To put it simple, you guys know your shit and your presentation proves it.
Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.
Don't tell Loki he knows this shit.
It'll only increase his ego.
I'm just kidding.
That's why my head hurts.
It can't fit.
Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy.
is why he's listened twice.
Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.
I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.
Benny L says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.
Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.
A local.
Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.
Dan M, don't inflate his ego again.
What did I tell you?
Dan M says, I kept listening because it was relatable.
The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.
I was also told there would be cake.
We have cookies.
It's behind the other door.
It's cake day, you know.
Yeah.
I prefer pie.
There's a joke there.
Clover N says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.
Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.
What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.
Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.
Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.
That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.
That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.
Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.
From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.
2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.
Wow, he had a reputation?
I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.
There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.
I really enjoyed the segments such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.
I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.
This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.
Flo Walker, Mel B, says, I was down with OLR since day one.
It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.
Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.
Well, that helps.
I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.
Still do.
Mel B was one of the freestyle kings when the show first started.
He brought his cred to OLR very early on.
They were on episode 6 or something like that, Mel and Mel.
We're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.
I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.
Just another good friend I made because of DDR.
Believe it or not.
Let's see.
Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.
You know what?
It's a special show.
I'm reading them all.
I don't care.
Chiggers says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.
The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.
Always a witty comment from DarkSakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.
I love you guys so much.
Add the extra O. So much.
I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.
Keep it up and here's to another 10 years.
Dave Falcon says, I was in college.
I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.
Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints and cheats on the internet.
Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?
OLR came up in the search.
So I checked it out.
Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
Gee, however did discussion on the Sims trigger our show, DarkSakura?
Shut up.
I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways.
Hush.
Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.
Garrus.
All right.
Let's see.
Oops, I lost my place here.
Oh, yes.
So I checked it out, listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
Fast forward to 2012.
I'm living in Washington, D.C.
since 2007, working in social media and got engaged in December 2011.
P.S.
My fiance is a huge video game lover.
Well, you lucked out.
I saw Sky's post on DDRfreak.com back when those forums were still popular I thought I'd check out the show and admittedly I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly Bomani to video games in general but it turned out to be a really entertaining show I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view which are all pretty different and unique I was hooked and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on
Alright, last comment.
You ready?
Last one.
Orange Right says, The first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.
I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.
I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much, and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.
Stay gold.
great feedback guys thank you I apologize if you thought that went on a little long but you know what I really enjoyed reading all that stuff so I have fuzzies now thank you very much
All right.
They're kind of warm.
AkumaJP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems.
So he sent me a private message.
So why not?
Why not?
Do it.
The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.
That's pretty powerful, actually.
Yeah.
And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.
But, you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.
Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now, like, you're working in the game industry.
And, you know, I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.
I mean, I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do Umlaut, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.
I got to do the design for Umlaut last year.
Exactly.
We've had a great experience through him.
And, you know, I have other friends that probably would appreciate it.
I don't name them.
but I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.
Really appreciate it.
All right.
That's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
What do we do next?
How about the mailbag?
I think the mailbag's up next.
Does that sound good?
Oh, good lord.
All right.
So we got some emails tonight?
A few.
A few?
I'm going to read them all.
All right.
I read them all.
Go ahead.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
This is actually from DarkTensia, but there's a lot of pictures.
Why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?
I will see what I can do.
Oh, Joe.
Hi, Joe.
So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.
That's right.
But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio battle royale thing, which, interestingly enough, DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day.
Was that the paper plate battle royale?
Oh, lord.
I remember because I won.
They can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.
Oh, hey.
Here, use this one.
She's in chat right now.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
So yeah, these will have to go on the forum.
Okay.
Okay, so next up.
Oh, it's from Robert Kidman.
Send me some biscuits.
Thank you for 10 wonderful years and your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.
Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays, finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.
If it weren't for OLR, there would be no Geek Life.
Tiara and I wouldn't have met and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.
Strange how these things happen.
Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.
So yeah, thank you.
Long may it continue.
And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.
That's Rob from Geek Life.
by the way huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well and I love Geek Life I'm going to be doing a guest column for them Tiara received an opportunity and she didn't think of the other Rob she didn't think of Dan she didn't think of Jamie she thought of me and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed and I'm so excited
Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.
I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.
Okay.
I make this promise from here out.
I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week because I still have to finish part two of Tabletop Gaming.
There you go.
Okay.
Due Monday.
I'm kidding.
Wednesday.
It's due before Wednesday, Rob.
Hey OLR and OLR me.
I wanted to give a shout out and congratulate you on 10 years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.
It's quite a feat.
I remember when I first met Rob, it was New Year's 2008 slash 9.
He was sick and quiet on the couch.
We got to chatting and he mentioned he was a gamer, G-A-Y-M-E-R.
I knew then he'd be a good friend and then he told me about his podcast.
I figured, man, why not?
I'll download it.
I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.
For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.
Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.
It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.
Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.
Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.
I've seen your last two to three studios and I know you're on a shoestring budget.
So as DarkSakura is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
Wait, what?
This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.
Let me finish reading it, Rob.
Okay.
So take note of the time and count them up.
Let me know what the total is and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.
I believe in the work that you do.
Please keep it up.
Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.
I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.
Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft.
Matt.
P.S.
You guys are old as fuck.
Did I just hear that somebody is donating $10 for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?
Donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?
In the chat room?
Yeah.
How many people?
It's 79 people in chat right now.
And I got a print screen right there.
79 people in the chat room.
We love you, Matt!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Wow, that's super cool.
I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.
Okay.
Oh, it's three bots, 76.
Okay.
76.
All right, this is from... The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.
It's a link on here about fall unlocking those Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.
God, I hope so, because I'm not buying those things.
You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.
But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.
Remember 1 vs. 100?
Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes so they must have felt it was too much like money.
So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.
Strangely, we can have a skee-ball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.
And that's from blah blah blah blah blah.
Moving forward.
um hey OLR hi it's the one and only Degenerate Johnny five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program it might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants my personal favorite was the one about the wee peripherals or as Loki put it $20 pieces of awkward shit Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with okay wow
regardless of doing this show for 10 consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of with that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters myself included congratulations for reaching the 10 year mark here's to another 10 years of successful podcasting your faithful listener Degenerate Johnny
P.S.
I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.
What selection would you suggest for a first comer?
Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.
You know who should be giving us money per each listener?
Pinkberry!
It's Pinkberry.
My personal favorite is the chocolate.
However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.
Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.
Moving forward, thank you, Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
Howdy, OLR.
Howdy, partner.
I just wanted to say congrats on 10 years of doing the show.
It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.
You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.
We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and Gal to look up to.
Here is to 10 more years of OLR, Brad.
It's from Brad at PodCulture.
We love PodCulture.
Mondays on VOG.
I still need to get you your missing stuff.
Sorry.
Is it premiering this week?
A premiere episode of PodCulture?
Yeah.
I believe it is this week, yes.
Okay.
Yay!
Alright, Dear OLR, I was hoping to write a long rambling email in honor of your 10th birthday on how this show has kept my attention for 7 years, longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.
By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.
use, use an honor I can recognize on how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out and overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show but unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the 20th anniversary instead cheers for everything Sky's Elliot B
Elliot is from the UK he's one of the VOG contributors he is from the UK and thank you I'm just me and I like video games and I have a boyfriend it is what it is and I thank you guys for just you know not giving a shit which people shouldn't be happy that people are in love that's what it's all about and Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection
I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but all right.
I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
This one has a title in Spanish, and he actually corrected me about El Telefonos en Fuego.
That's not how it's actually supposed to be said, but I don't know anything about Spanish grammar, so my bad.
Yo no se So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja Naranja, or is that it?
I guess that's orange Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?
and I'll see you next time.
I still remember the live 365 days.
So do we.
I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.
Hey, I got speakers.
You did?
I did.
At least we got something.
We didn't get a trophy, but we got speakers.
I played bingo and won speakers.
Thank you for watching!
There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff, but it also helps to show how great the community can be.
Always supportive to the show in good times and especially bad times.
You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.
We have also learned a lot from you guys.
Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong, and to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.
Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad, to not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.
Okay.
and Loki have taught us to question everything not to accept anything as it is and that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions
I laughed love it you're an inspiration for all of us listening whether it's been 10 years 5 years or even just a few months we are forever grateful for making every week a blast you may not have many awards or recognition but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet you know the one award we have is sitting on my mantle and it's not moving it was a good award it was the first podcast award for gaming yeah
Congrats, Orange Zones Radio.
Congrats for 10 fabulous years.
I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and well, anything that OLR has given me all these years.
And while you may act like a 10-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person 100 years old.
I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of 100 years old, however.
Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.
So here's for another 10 whole years of Raises Glass Toast.
Speaking of toast.
Speaking of toast.
French toast.
Wait, what?
I love French toast.
French toast is amazing.
There is a place.
Okay, I'm going on the food tangent.
There's a place in Sacramento.
Okay.
Okay.
that has French toast made out of challah.
What's challah?
Challah.
It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.
That does sound delicious.
And it makes the best French toast.
Challah French toast.
Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.
So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.
And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.
So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.
And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, 10 more years, what do you say?
To our 40s?
To our 40s!
I'm trying not to spill.
We had clingies.
Clingies.
Okay.
Now, everyone get drunk.
As I spill it on my shirt.
That's some good wine.
I'm going to get water intoxicated.
It's making my headache feel a lot better.
That's good.
I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake.
It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey, I'm going to do this real quick.
And then my brain's like, no.
By the way, I have a follow-up.
I kind of didn't react because I kind of did this double take, like, what, what?
But I'm text messaging Grandpa right now, and I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said, it says this number, but it's 76 when you subtract the bots.
And I said, I won't hold you to that.
You really don't have to.
He replied back, I'm of my word.
$760 for VOG right there.
Sweet.
So that's...
I'll throw in another 40 just to round it up to 80.
What the hell?
What?
Really?
Yeah.
I like round numbers.
And you know what, Rob?
What?
What I will do, because you know I had that account open.
How about we go take it and convert it to a business account?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
BlackWolf and I have probably paid about that much out of pocket like I can't speak to what BlackWolf has spent but I know I've spent enough let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running and I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much if not about twice as much from his end of the things because he bought software and designs for the site so just to like get that money for the next year is a great great burden off our shoulders actually
Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working on it.
And, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone who's been listening, too.
But there'll be more coming up about the book because I'm designing it beginning to end.
So.
As soon as people send me old logos.
Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say how you don't make any money on the show.
Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.
We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would be nice.
The money's gonna go right back into the show.
I can tell you, I came this close, this close to dropping $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise for the show.
And the only, because I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like, oh my God,
And don't forget my husband works at Radio Shack
so all right um thank you guys so much we will have as soon as good wine as soon as Jamie has the account set up we will tell you guys how you can donate we have to we have to tread carefully here though because I'm really worried about tax stuff I don't know that stuff at all so I need tax help if anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us that's what I could really use well I mean I think it's actually and I'm not gonna say any more about this but maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license
We had one.
We did.
Yeah, we let it lapse.
Yeah.
Anyway, we won't talk about that on air.
Okay.
All right.
We have four emails left.
Yes.
Dear Orange Launch Radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday.
In an attempt to keep this email short and to the point, let me say thank you.
I started listening to the podcast back on March... What?
I heard snorting.
Just chat.
Okay.
I started listening to the podcast back in March 2010 after I bought my first iPod Touch.
Wow.
From that point on, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki have become an important part of my life.
Do we touch you?
Okay, anyway.
I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life, and I fully agree with the listeners.
Through bad relationships, major family issues, and a brief period of unemployment, OLR has been a constant positive in my life.
With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room and fellow listeners have become my second family.
Once again, thank you, Orange Lounge Radio, for running strong for 10 years.
You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak, and you have definitely been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.
Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to be there, just like how OLR has been there for me.
Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.
Happy birthday.
And that's from Sherzo, a.k.a.
Gion.
And I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.
I'm feeling verklempt.
Here's a topic, talk amongst yourselves.
Sorry, no.
Okay.
Three more to go.
Holy moly.
To Rob, Loki, and DarkSakura.
As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you have done over the past 10 years in an effort to entertain your listeners.
I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.
Ah, who cares?
They sucked anyway.
Bite me.
And then, that was just on behalf of them.
We had good years on Life 365.
They took care of us for a little while.
We did.
We did.
Betty was nice.
Betty was nice.
And then becoming a member of the All Games community and finally joining you on your very own network, VOG.
I have met each of you at least once, although I'm fairly certain it is more than that, whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.
The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meet up at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.
I remember listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed the whole group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.
I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.
Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.
I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.
Congratulations on this incredible milestone, and I look forward to seeing everyone again at future events.
And that's from Shadow Next Gen.
I agree.
That was a great memory, and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that, because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.
This one isn't an anniversary memory, it's actually news.
Alright, fair enough.
There's gaming news this week?
Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic, and this is Turrican, sorry, will be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra November 10th in Cologne, Germany.
Have a good one, guys.
That comes from RDG.
I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turricans.
It's a link from Kickstarter.
Very cool.
Oh, dude, we got another email in, too.
Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?
This one comes from Dan Shadow.
Congratulations on 10 years, guys.
I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two parts, and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.
I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.
Since this show, I lost my virginity.
Me too.
No, just kidding.
Graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie, ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.
Feel old yet?
Phoenix Force 5 for the win.
Thanks, guys.
I'm Batman.
That's... Okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.
All right, yeah.
And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.
He'd talk like that, so he's Batman.
No, I am Batman And then this one, okay Dear OLR, I love the podcast, however there is one thing I must say Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having at the moment Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite Okay
You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.
We had pizza because we were playing Catan.
What does that have to do with pizza?
Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.
I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.
Bacon and garlic pizza.
That actually sounds pretty epic.
I also have never had Pinkberry and hope to try it someday.
What flavor should I get?
Chocolate?
Strawberry?
I seriously want Pinkberry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.
I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.
We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.
I want blood orange lounge radio.
Yes.
Thanks to Keep Up the Great Work, Randy.
You know what?
That is two emails on our 10th anniversary going, congrats, tell me more about Pinkberry.
Randy Peters Are you feeling Randy?
Starring Randy Peters.
Yeah, I could see that.
That would be the best male porn name ever.
It sounds like a British male porn name.
Or Sir John Thomas.
Alright, is that it for emails?
That is it.
I closed it.
Well, you know what comes after the emails?
Ten years of pent-up angst.
Here's your mama.
F you to me, because I missed Girls Gone Wild today, and I was so excited about it.
But I was like, I was dreaming about the show.
I texted Rob in my sleep.
Okay?
And Garrus.
I blame Garrus for this, too.
And I blame Shane for me blaming Garrus.
Because, fuck Mass Effect.
I've played over, since yesterday, I've played 20-something hours of Mass Effect.
I do not know what's wrong with me.
I never even did that on WoW.
So, the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy VI.
When I was in high school.
Just saying.
Just saying.
I'm done.
Loki.
Loki.
I fuck you to my headache because I hate getting these... I think it's a sinus headache because, you know, it's been a little windy today.
And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post, you know, a blog about this show having a 10 year anniversary.
Because, you know, they can have wonderful, you know...
topics like woman hit by ball sues little leaguer or work in progress zombie survival short story or you know hey is this person on the forum gay you know they can have those you know posts on there oh but I post about something and they're just like yeah no we need to remove that post that is kind of stupid
Eh, whatever.
They're kids.
Why am I on a forum about... Fuck kids!
Why am I on a modding forum with all fucking... Seriously, it's all kids.
I mean, not really.
I mean... I'm not like that guy at Penn State.
I talk to these people online, and then I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about modding and stuff, and they're like teenagers.
I mean, I feel so old.
I'm like, yeah, I'm like 30-something, and you're 16, 17?
I don't know.
BlackWolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.
We never made the front page, but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.
Probably helped that we asked pretty please onto Facebook and so forth.
But anyway.
My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.
Moving on.
Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.
The stuff that I brought is wheat-free.
Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.
Gamer Girl has this FU to, she has this, what is that, carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.
So FU to that.
F you to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today and he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza so F you to Loki Misty I will go ahead and second that F you to carpal tunnel I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist
Other than that, yeah, again, not winning the lottery.
Because when I win the lottery, once I get all the tech shit dealt with, I will supply money for the fort.
Awesome.
F you to not having a fort.
I think that's what it comes down to.
Thanks, you guys.
All right, that does it for the FUs of the week.
Let's see.
So we did FUs, check.
We did mailbag, check.
Fugle, check.
Hey, I think it's time to open up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is now open for your calls on this very special 10th anniversary.
Whatever you want to talk about.
If you want to talk about...
you know the 10th anniversary cool you want to talk about something going on in gaming awesome they're taking bets on who the first person is it's going to be through right now we'll see what happens meanwhile I could go to Twitter I want to read some of the comments from Twitter actually because we got some really nice 10th anniversary oh I guess not because the Skype line is fired up so let's go to the Skype line and take some calls hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
So I'll second JV, man.
Well, that's not all I have to say, but that was the most important thing in the last five minutes, that's for sure.
It's always important to turn to Loki and say, hey, buddy, F you.
Oh, it is.
Oh, it is.
Time and time again.
Oh, I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 2002.
I know I was still in high school, so that puts it in 2003.
I remember my group of friends that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani discussion that we all know and love.
And obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less than that.
I have no idea why I just said that.
Obviously, it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.
Hopefully, in a good way.
Oh, absolutely.
Well, thank you.
Numerous events of live coverage and yeah, definitely, hopefully, that all starts coming back.
Yeah, and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.
No shit No shit
July, August, November, January, and then at the very least continuing perpetual August and January after that seems kind of definitive.
you let me whenever you want Jason just let us know when because you know we'll have your sexy radio voice on anytime oh yeah my microphone and tone if you need any suggestions if you go after some more microphones let's talk because please you know I brought mine we're kind of I'm kind of up on the lingo of microphones lately you yes I would love I want my voice to be sexy like yours how do I make that happen
Pay way too much money, unfortunately, is the answer to that question.
Hooray.
And next time, warn me so we can crash it together.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Amtrak buddies for life.
Who needs planes?
Who needs planes?
All right, Jason, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
But thanks again for all you do.
Good night, guys.
Congratulations.
Take care.
Thanks.
Couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks.
Later.
1-877-GAME-OLR or the calls keep on coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
It's Shane.
It's Shane.
What's up?
Well, I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world.
Can you guess them?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
You're talking to me.
Talking about Mass Effect with me.
None of those are the right answer.
I am playing Mass Effect.
I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.
So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.
Thank you.
Appreciate your paying attention.
Yes.
And I wanted to say that for me, without this show, I never would have worked at Konami.
And that's a major thing for me.
So I have to thank the show for that.
I'm kind of sorry about that, too, at the same time.
No, I'm kidding.
Nowadays, yeah.
You had some great memories at Konami, though, right?
Yes.
Like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.
That was one of my best memories Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?
Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?
No What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR that you can talk about?
I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR, but I would say one of the more scandalous things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one, we had no females work there anymore, so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.
I mean, he still had underwear on, but he decided that since there were no females, there was no reason for pants.
Hey, Shane.
Yes?
Last week I went to work with no pants.
What was that?
Last week I went to work with no pants.
Maybe you were wearing a skirt.
This is true.
He was not wearing a skirt.
Wait, let me... This is really important, Shane.
This is the most important question.
Was it boxers or briefs?
It was boxers.
Okay, because boxers...
That's kind of like swimwear.
That's not that bad.
That's exciting.
But still going with no pants.
That is true.
That is true.
Now, boxer briefs are fairly exciting.
They're kind of in the middle.
Because then you get the grippy with the... All right, look.
That's not what we're here to talk about tonight.
I don't know what show you're listening to.
I could wear lounge or radio.
This sounds about par for the course.
Not what you're talking about.
And Garrus.
That's a great story about Konami.
Some of the games were designed with no pants.
You'd think they would have come out better.
No, just kidding.
The Ultramix games were the best in the series.
You know I've always said that, and it's not just because you guys were working on them.
Pantsless Rage But think about this you guys If it weren't for this show Then Shane would have ended up at Konami In a way, this show impacted the game we made this show about
It's true.
And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusive reveals because I was the one that brought those songs to you.
That's true.
You brought the first couple.
And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.
And unfortunately, we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
His lack of impact, not being at Konami anymore, has greatly been felt.
This is true.
As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.
That's true, but as I was, I think, talking to him one night about... I go back and look at my old stuff, and some of it's garbage.
Yeah.
Really, really, truly garbage, and I wish I could get a do-over.
It's kind of funny, too, because you got me into Echo Image, which is one of my favorite bands ever now because of DDR.
And maybe I'm not supposed to say this, but oh shit, oh well, it's been seven years.
You told me about that song long before the game was out.
Because it was amazing.
And played the CD for me.
What?
Thanks for watching!
That's right, it was.
And then, so, God, I've probably known you at least nine years, because I remember you came to the show, like, during its first year and all that.
But, yeah, you told me about Skulk and all that, and then we found the CD somewhere, and I fell in love with that CD.
And that's one of my favorite bands ever now, even though they only ever did one stinking album.
Yes, because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.
Which is, you know, the same thing.
They're just high.
Shane, I gotta let you go to get more calls.
Anything else you want to say, especially about us?
No, why would I want to talk about you?
I don't know.
Because we're awesome.
Because of Garrus.
I thought it was but Garrus, not because of Garrus.
Everything is Garrus.
Without us, Shane, you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.
That's a lie.
It's the reverse.
Alright, bye.
Bye.
Oh, okay.
I don't know why I'm hearing myself, but go ahead and say what you want to say.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got to... Yeah.
I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years while off and on, and I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.
Yay.
Give me a second.
Dang it.
I wanted to say that I enjoy listening to you guys.
When I came back from Rhode Island and I was starting to get into Dance Dance Revolution, I found you guys on Live 365 and I started listening and I met a lot of good friends like Richie, which is...
I forget his name on here.
I've met Junami, and I just stayed for a long time.
And if you guys weren't here, I wouldn't have started, had the inspiration to start Disingenious Radio, which is still going, by the way.
Congratulations on that.
I actually was... I mean, this is going to sound terrible, but I knew you guys had started the show, or the station.
I knew it was kind of like a spin-off of what had been going on at OLR, but I actually thought it stopped during the time we were doing all games, but apparently it hadn't.
It's still going.
Yep, we're still doing it.
Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of like took over from there and created like a solid stream and everything.
I ask him every now and then if I can start my own stream, you know, stream on the station.
And he lets me every now and then, but I haven't gotten in contact with him for like a few months, but I do.
I think one of the best comments we ever get on the show about doing the show is that you know you guys because of you guys I kind of figured out how to do my own podcast or I learned that any idiot can podcast because you guys do it so I started my own show and believe it or not that's actually like you know what they say imitation is the finest form or is the finest form of flattery not to say that everybody's copying us because I don't think they are but just the fact that we're empowering people to let their own voices be heard
means a lot, and it's a great compliment.
It really is.
Yeah.
Thank you for being around.
If you weren't around, I would never have any friends from the DDR universe.
I've been friends with Junami for over seven years.
Wow.
Well, congrats, and thank you for listening and being here with the show.
Do you have anything else you want to share tonight?
I love you guys!
Heart, heart, heart, heart.
Hold on, hold on.
Somebody else wants to send kisses.
Here he is.
There you go.
Alright.
Have a great night, Uni.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't even have to give the number.
The calls just keep coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
I was trying to do the math on how long I've been actually listening and I came up with
2004, I started listening to the show.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
And thank you for the holiday news.
And you know, the funny thing is, I didn't start listening to it all at first.
I think I told you this guy several times, that I started listening to a show that you would have on Wednesday nights on Life's 365, Outside the Box.
Which is kind of the prerequisite to the video game show that this became.
In a way, yeah.
I never really thought about it that way, which I know sounds weird, but you're right.
Like, we kind of started doing the general gaming chat there.
I think I kind of always had the fire in me to do, like, a general gaming show.
And, like, I think maybe subconsciously I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.
So that's why we had Outside the Box.
I think, you know, back then it was you, DDR Angel, and Wanky Style.
Yes.
Kind of thing.
Mm-hmm.
That's when I started listening.
I was originally introduced to the show by Sephora 1216, who caught on to it from DDR Freak rebroadcasting the show.
Oh yeah, DDR4 Yeah, they rebroadcast us And then I caught on to the other shows With that So
It is Wednesday night.
You are tuned in to Outside the Box, live on Orange Lounge Radio.
Outside the Box is a show dedicated to video game news, reviews, and all the other randomness you might discover outside the box.
To interact live with our show, check out our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com Check out the chat room and interact with us links.
And now, here are your hosts, Sky, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style.
I remember one of the ones, because I used to play Final Fantasy XI right next to you guys when you were doing that.
Yeah.
And it was Final Fantasy VII where you guys were playing One Winged Angel or whatever.
Murder!
Yeah, that was a good murder.
You know, you bring up a good point.
That really was.
I mean, especially as you listen to the intro.
It's about video games and all the randomness outside the box.
That's kind of this fucking show now.
Yeah.
So, in a way, Outside the Box took over.
You make a damn good point.
Yeah.
You know, most of all, you know, all of that has always been about the community, the fans and everything.
And I think over the past 10 years, we've kind of grown to a really nice community.
We've gotten friends involved in the show.
I mean, I've got high... I've told a couple people, and now you guys...
with Wally R. You guys are going to have a dream game about you guys coming out.
So, you know, Rob always says, you know, tell a friend.
And it's true.
You tell a friend and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.
That's right.
And then it funds my future trips to New York, which I'm trying to get back to.
But $800 will go a long way and get me back to New York.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
But I will be trying to get back to New York with my own money very soon.
So that would be awesome.
I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations and next time I see any of you guys I buy you a beer or probably in your case Red Mango or Pinkberry I'll take free beer and free yogurt and I will always exchange holiday cards with you
That's true.
That's true.
Absolutely.
Yep.
I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show and I see YYR's in chat so he can confirm or deny this YYR of course is making the first OLR dream game a reality Bunget Ferret Tossing which I guess he's in like push push push mode with it right now and it sounds like it's gonna be a big game like it's gonna be one that people are talking about outside this show that is awesome it's gonna be awesome
We're going to do all we can to make Bungie Ferret Tossing a success.
You know what?
I actually have to thank SSJ100Matt for having a hand in helping me with my conversion.
Oh, that's true.
There we go.
That's the big thing you went through personally on this show.
Well, I did get married.
Oh yeah, there's that too.
Eh, that's no big deal.
I'm just kidding.
Alright, um... I mean, I got married too.
I'm not making a big deal out of it.
I got... I had like four boyfriends.
Alright, let's... But this one's the best one, obviously.
I agree.
Me too.
Alright, let's move on.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi.
This is Rama from Indonesia.
Whoa, we got a call from Indonesia tonight?
Yes.
I recognize your name from Twitter.
I'm happy you're listening live.
What's up, buddy?
Yeah, it's fun.
It's nice to talk to you finally because I've been here since 2006, I guess.
Oh my gosh.
Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
Yeah, so I just want to say that maybe I'm the father's caller.
I did enjoy everything.
Even though I'm a blind person, I can enjoy everything that you've done.
Especially Loki and
All of that kind of jokes.
It's nice.
Unfortunately, because of the distance, you're breaking up really bad, and we're having a hard time hearing you.
But I think I heard something about, and I know this is true about you from Twitter and everything, that you are a blind gamer.
And you know what's funny is that we've had a couple.
You're not the only one, which is funny.
We've had a couple blind gamers that I've heard from from Twitter, and we've gotten emails as well.
And it's really...
It's really humbling in a way because sometimes we take things for granted, like sight, that not everybody has.
And I'm so happy that we get to kind of deliver something that you don't need that for to be able to participate in this program.
It's just a...
It's a really humbling how big am I in this universe type of feeling.
I can't explain it, but it's amazing.
And thank you for that and for sharing that with us.
Absolutely.
Just would like to say happy birthday and enjoy the life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my gosh.
And please keep sending us more videos of you playing Chrono Trigger songs because that was great.
Absolutely.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
See you, guys.
Give everyone in Indonesia hugs for us.
The whole country.
Get started.
Yeah, what time is it over there right now?
That's what I'd like to know.
All right, we got another call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, guys.
Can you hear me?
Hello, we can hear you.
Hi, who's this?
Wow, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
DDR Dollar Bill.
What is up, buddy?
Hey, not much.
Just first off, I want to wish you guys a happy 10-year anniversary since you're one of the few podcasts I know has been around for 10 years.
We are finally snatching the crown of we are the longest running video game podcast on the internet.
We've done some heavy research and we don't think anybody has been around right now anyway as long as we have.
You know, it's a nice feather to put in our hat but what we don't want to do is we don't want to be all like
Well, we're the best because we've been around that long because that's not the impression we want to give.
There's a lot of great, great shows out there.
And, you know, just the other day I was kind of talking on Twitter with Video Game Outsiders.
I brought them up on the show plenty of times.
I think they're a great show.
They have a very similar chemistry to what we have here except they kind of like whereas our foundation is DDR, they were an adult gaming community that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter games.
So obviously a very different type of thing.
But they were talking about like, wow, we've been around for seven years But I guess they had to correct somebody like, oh yeah, OLR's been around longer But I'm like, dude, don't sell yourself short What you guys have accomplished in seven years is amazing Most shows don't get to six months or one year True And, you know, to have your own community and all that It's just, it's an amazing feeling, it really is So, anyway That's exactly the reason why I try to listen to you guys as much as I can
because it's mostly the community that actually has me hooked on it.
I've met a lot of great people on there, some in real life and some I wish I could meet in real life one day.
You know, I've met some, I know I knew DJ Ranma from a while back from some of the conventions.
I finally got to meet, you know, I actually got to hang out with Misty a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic.
I got to meet some of the other people like the Effective Candy way back in the day and Gamer Girl is one of my closest friends now and
and even Jamie.
As much as I don't talk to her, I still consider her really cool and one of the people I admire the most.
Aww.
Now I'm gonna cry.
Uh-oh, someone's chopping onions in the OLR studios.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, just wait till October, dude.
Wait, what's in October?
Oh yeah, there's a train gathering.
I'm hanging out with Misty for that one in Philly.
That's awesome.
Just to know that this show made people want to hang out is so cool.
We really need to make an effort to get to more conventions and do these, especially PAX, because that's one that all the fans want to get to.
And just try to get people together and just like, hey, let's go do what this show was.
Think about it.
This show is because we used to go to the arcades and play video games and talk shit.
So let's get together, IRL, play video games and talk shit.
Exactly.
Oh my god, did you see that guy Rob holding onto the bar?
What you did this week, I forgot, I mentioned, well, I didn't play it, but I installed Step Mania on my laptop, mainly because I was looking for sound files from Fourth Mix, but I couldn't find them.
But, uh, yeah.
Oh.
I have to admit, when I was playing DDR this week, because I did play Max 2 and I played Disney Rave once each, and I have to admit, there was a part of me that even though that dance pad was ass, because it was from a golf land, and one of the buttons didn't even work, there was a part of me that went, I kind of miss this.
Yeah, well, I was watching, was it 4th Mix Plus and 4th Mix videos and stuff like that?
I'm like, damn, I miss them.
That machine was awesome.
Even just 4th Mix and stuff, and Max and Max 2 were pretty sweet.
And I kind of wish we had, like, some of the... Because, like, I was even looking at some of the... Because I never really got into Supernova and Supernova 2, and, like, I don't even know what the hell they have now.
It's, like, that versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff.
And there's, like, you know...
Fuck em!
Amen.
I did the same exact thing.
When I was at Anime Central this year, they had a 4th Mix Plus machine.
And I got on and I started doing tech and then I think through the second song I said, ah, fuck this, I'm not a techie.
So I freestyled the rest of the damn stages.
Nice.
That is awesome.
And also, in over New Jersey, down the Jersey Shore, there is an older but still workable
and 7th Mix.
1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome We would love that It's finally starting to quiet down a little bit on Skype I think a lot of the people that were wanting to get through Oh shit, there it goes again Spoke too soon Let's pick up the phone Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey, it's Blender.
Blender!
What is on your mind, my friend?
Are you making a smoothie?
Nothing.
I don't think he's a blender.
He's a blender.
Congratulations, you guys.
Thank you.
You know, the only reason I found you guys was through Bobby Blackwolf's show because I was a big fan of his on Friday Night Gaming.
And I believe that the partnership that you guys have got together now is going to bring you to a much better future.
and I'm so glad to be around seeing this, you know?
Well, you know, Bobby and us, you know, are very kind of like-minded.
I mean, Bobby was a big music game fan as well.
If you kind of look at our classic game of the week, Beatmania 2DX, Bobby will admit that's one of his favorite games.
He even said in chat he would have that game in his basement.
So there's a lot that Bobby and us have in common, yet we're different enough where that our shows kind of are different.
You know, he's the very NPR show.
We're the very Morning Room, Waka Waka Waka type of show.
Yeah.
We do need a Waka Waka Waka soundboard.
But, you know, the two of us actually complement each other very well.
And I think kind of professionally, there's a lot we look at too.
And, you know, especially, you know, obviously it's no secret there's been some big changes in the past year.
And there was a lot that we were looking at going, what could we be doing better?
We kind of feel like right now we're kind of riding a stationary bike right now.
We're doing our things.
We're burning calories.
We ain't going anywhere.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Mm-hmm.
And I wouldn't have been listening to your show without him, and I'm so glad that I stumbled upon it.
Unfortunately, due to my current situation at the time,
I still have an open invitation for you guys if you ever pass through Napa I have a wine
a tour for you set up to where I'm going to point out the places for you guys to go and you guys are all going to have a good time.
Well, I bet JV Mon wishes he'd known that the other day when he went out there testing.
I'd be down for that as long as someone will carry me by the time we're done.
Yeah, I would have to get a DD, but if we can figure that out.
I'm not a fan of wine.
Jamie, trust me, I know the bus schedule, so you'll be all right.
Well, we might have to take you up on that someday because you know what I love more than video games?
Booze!
Drink responsibly.
All right, well, congratulations.
Here's to another 10 years.
You guys take care.
All right, and game good.
All right, we're going to do our best, buddy.
Thanks so much.
And thanks again for the VOG Network Clubhouse.
That shit is epic.
You know what, Rob?
Go ahead, DarkSakura first.
Okay, well, in the article that Tara wrote on Geek Life, there's actually a link to the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio back in the day that talked about our first few shows.
So I relinked that in the chat room.
Nice.
Very cool.
Loki, where were you?
Speaking of the Clubhouse, I was trying to visit the Clubhouse yesterday.
I'm so glad I've never come back to home because I downloaded the new client, which I'm pissed off because it didn't fucking save my crazy hobo Santa, which is weird.
So I had a new character.
So I was like, okay, I'm going to check out the clothes in there.
Crash.
Okay, fine.
I'm not going to check out the clothes.
Relaunch the whole thing again.
I'm going to try altering my appearance.
Crash again.
So I'm like, fuck this.
I'm not coming back to home.
We got another call coming in I want to get to, but let me just say this.
I think home would benefit greatly if they would just force you to do a 2 gig download up front.
I mean, there's just so much buffering and loading.
That's the one drawback.
It's not as...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Friends rock.
Friends give you money when you're poor.
Friendship is magic.
Don't forget.
Die.
But I have here three drinks.
I have a Loki, I have a Jamie, and I have a Rob.
Now...
The first drink I dedicate to Loki is a shot of very strong honey mead.
Because he is straightforward to the point.
Will say what he has to say.
And in the end, honey badger doesn't give a fuck.
And it burns a little going down, doesn't it?
Let's just walk away from that comment.
Ew, he's eating that snake.
That's disgusting.
Ow.
Next up I have for Jamie.
Now for Christmas I got this nice bottle of rum.
It's very potent, very powerful, and I only open it for special occasions and close friends.
And Jamie is my darling Oog-Chan, so I toast this glass to her.
Thank you, Ran-Chan.
Think it might have onions in it.
Think it might have a little onion in it.
I'm going to have a beer for you when I get home.
Make sure it's a Guinness.
I'm not a Guinness, but it's a Killian's.
I remember Captain Fabulous.
And it is fabulous!
Oh, definitely.
Do you remember the drink we invented at Faname?
Oh, God.
When all we had was a bottle of Pineapple Malibu, so we paid five bucks for a 20-ounce of 7-Up.
That was epic.
That was so epic.
We made that 7-Up last, and we were playing Apples to Apples.
Oh, hell yes.
Drunk on Pineapple Malibu and 7-Up.
Uh-oh, Sean, you are the party girl.
And you saw me through my horrible cosplay.
There's no such thing as horrible cosplay.
Get over that.
Come on now.
I'm kind of disappointed that we didn't get to go to, uh, you know, Fanime to do, like, because that was one of the plans was, well, we're gonna do something at Fanime for our 10 year anniversary or whatever.
I still have my costume from Halloween in my car.
Hmm.
I was waiting to use that again Oh my god, that's awesome Alright, well, Ranma, I gotta let you go to try and squeeze in a few more calls I didn't even take the drink yet Oh, drink it!
Drink it!
Chug, chug, chug, chug Here's to you, here's to me The best of friends we'll ever be If we should ever happen to disagree Well, fuck you, and here's to me And it's going down So I have to show you the other toast Here's to us Who's like us?
Damn few And they're all dead
Work's gonna be fun tomorrow.
Have a DD if you need it.
Alright, Ranma.
You better sleep fabulous, homegirl.
I will.
Happy Pride, Ranma.
Right back at you.
Later.
Stay Luigi.
Will do.
1877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio it was gay pride this weekend by the way in San Francisco and that brought up the conversation in the chat room what if OLR had a pride parade what would be the first float and I said of course the opening float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float followed immediately by dykes on bikes because you can't have a parade without dykes on bikes I'm sorry that's what the people are coming out to see
Did you?
Yes.
There was a few naked dykes on bikes at the parade today, too.
That's because you're in San Francisco, home of the finest.
All right, let's take some more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Tawns Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Actdeft.
Hey, Actdeft, what's up?
Hi, Actdeft.
Well, first of all, I want to, again, congratulate you for 10 years of magnificent online radio.
Thank you very much, and thank you for being a part of it.
I'll actually say my words in Spanish, even though you probably won't understand it, but you know the message, you know the feeling.
Estas son las mañanitas que cantaba el rey David.
A los muchachos y las muchachas bonitas que las cantaban así.
Despierta, ola, despierta, mira que ya amaneció.
That was very nice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's humbling to know that it's a worldwide show.
And we've even been complimented before.
And I take great pride in this.
Speaking of, well, our pride.
I take great pride in the fact that we do try to remember that we do have a worldwide audience out there.
That we're not, you know, the show from the Americas.
You know, there is a whole world out there.
Thank you for doing a bumper for us.
Yeah, for VOG.
Yeah, no problem.
And again, thanks for being, well, who you are and bringing us every week a very good show.
Even though we have had some problems from your side and even on my side, it's still a pleasure and still pretty enjoying to listen to you every week.
Damn, I'm...
I'm kind of nervous because I'm excited let me put it this way if friends agreed on every single solitary thing they'd be really boring that's true so we'll end on that note Actdeft thank you so much and enjoy that Kirby collection coming out later this year yeah I will I thought of you when I saw that alright later buddy later
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio We have one or two more calls coming in I hope we get through them all It's already after nine That's alright, we can go a little long tonight It doesn't need a little long tonight I gotta let the rest of that wine burn off So I can take It's already gone I had to put mine in the fridge, I didn't want to finish it off Because I don't want to drive drunk, that's irresponsible So
Alright, oh, there it goes, lighten up again.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hello, this is George Takei.
Oh my.
Oh my.
What's up, Georgie?
Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you on your teniversary.
Pretty soon this show will be older than you, George.
I know, I'm looking forward to it.
Haha.
George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?
That's what I want to know Oh, I don't know, I guess it's just my natural charm
No, it's Sterlok.
Hi, how's it going?
Oh, it's good, it's good.
No, that was a good impression, I gotta say.
Oh my.
Oh my.
What's on your mind, Sterlok?
Besides apparently George Takei.
No, I don't know.
I've always wanted to do that, just, I don't know, a long time ago, like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned...
Something about George Takei and... He needs to be my gay daddy.
Well, I thought about calling in to the voicemail or something and just leaving a message as George Takei, saying like, oh, I heard your comments and I just wanted to say thank you.
But anyway...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You forget, when you hear George Takei's voice, you kind of forget that he's 78 and you still want to sleep with it, you know?
I know, you cannot tell by his voice that he's that old.
He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know?
He just always had that deep and melodious theatrical voice.
Fifth dream in our chatroom says, I'm having Seaman flashbacks.
NBA star Tim Hardaway is having a very rough week.
He put out a statement apologizing for saying he hates gay people today, or at least his lawyer put it out.
and needless to say this rant, this crazy rant has upset a lot of people including the NBA which banned him from all future league related events and there was also reaction today from a prominent member of the gay community including this celebrity who went so far as to tape a PSA.
Hello, I'm George Takei.
Recently I've been troubled to hear comments made by former NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway who said
I hate gay people.
Let it be known, I don't like gay people.
I'm homophobic.
As a gay man and a human being, I was shocked and saddened.
But I want you to know, Tim, on behalf of gay people everywhere, that despite your ugly words, we don't hate you.
As a matter of fact, we like you.
We like you very much.
We particularly like your large, powerful hands.
Your smooth, chocolatey head.
Raged in man sweat.
I'll keep my eyes on you and let it be known, one day,
When you least expect it, I will have sex with you I love sweaty basketball players
Alright, I'm sorry that was quiet, but unfortunately that was at max volume, because YouTubes aren't standardized, unfortunately.
I hadn't heard that, actually.
That was awesome.
Oh, it's freaking amazing.
I love George Takei.
Anyway.
But anyway, I wanted to talk about how I discovered OLR.
Oh, please!
Kind of an interesting... I came in at a weird time.
I came in sometime in 07, back when... It was in that weird point where...
You guys were being syndicated on All Games but not broadcasting from there.
Oh, right.
Yeah, we were the first affiliate show on All Games Radio.
And, yeah, again, Bobby was the station manager at All Games at the time.
And, you know, because he liked OLR and he knew we were doing the syndication with DDR Freak Radio for a time, he offered it up to us.
And we were like, heck, yeah, more people to hear our show?
Of course.
Why not?
Yeah.
So, yeah, that was a great thing for us.
So I remember when the whole Live 365 crap went down when they were raising their prices and you guys weren't sure what you were going to do for a while.
That's very true.
But yeah, I've been, I don't know, I forget what my first exact episode was.
It was like, I don't know, in the 150s I want to say, or maybe 250s.
Yeah.
But I don't know, there was just something about the chemistry there with the three guys and it was just a lot of fun to listen to and very funny and entertaining and I was just kind of hooked.
Well, thank you for getting hooked on whatever crack cocaine we must be offering because people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough.
I just got to go back and get another hit.
Now it's just like I can't imagine not listening to it on Sunday nights.
It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like, well, shit, what am I going to do for three hours?
It's a nice sentiment, but it's also a little bit scary, I gotta admit.
Because, you know, as they say, all good things must come to an end.
There will be a time when OLR will end.
I'm not saying it's happening now, or that it's even planned.
But, you know, shit happens.
And we've had our scares.
We have had many scares here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still here.
But there is going to come a time where we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending.
And that's the impact that's going to have on some people.
I'm always like, well, thank God we have an archive of 400 plus episodes that people could always go back and listen to.
When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode that I have and just marathon it.
I have a new friend.
I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well.
You know this girl, right?
And she loves Beverly Hills 90210.
And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended.
Not the new one.
We don't count it.
She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended.
So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD.
Aww.
it's just like with the new Thundercats where it's just I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon but it's like like most things that are remade it's just pales in comparison to the classic 80s cartoon the same mutual friend introduced me to a site a while back that's actually gone now that's called Elijah Wood is very very very very very very gay and it was all kind of fuchsia colored
Nice.
I saw her the other day.
I know.
She told me about it.
Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that because there's something else involving her that's happening next week that I want you to be a part of.
All right.
And you're going to tell me no.
Anyway, Osfer in chat says, don't ever end.
I will cry so hard.
Not half as hard as we probably will.
Except for Loki.
He doesn't cry.
All right.
He'll cry a single man tear.
Let's not talk about that.
Ten more years, right, kids?
Yes.
is that DDR Angel?
Hi!
It is so good to hear from you.
The brain's behind the EcoMaker.
I know.
Isn't it great?
Yes.
Well, okay.
Website.
Yeah, only brain.
Exactly, website.
No, I'm not plugging it.
That's your job, because you're going to bring back the other thing.
You can plug the website all you want, but I'm... I can't do that.
It has nothing to do with gaming.
You're done.
That's the future.
I want to talk about the past.
But, Garrus... Okay, look, shut up.
Okay.
Um, DDR Angel, you were here for many of the early episodes.
I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning, but pretty fucking- No, I wasn't.
Pretty fucking close, all things considered.
I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39.
Okay.
Or episode 39, rather.
In the scope of 462 episodes, 39 is pretty much the beginning.
Yeah, well.
But, uh, Angel, I-
Shit, I don't even know what to say.
Thank you for being a big part of those first few episodes.
I know, I think of you in many ways as one of the first really hardcore, passionate people about this show.
I still love it.
You know, every Sunday.
Even though I might not be in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always paying attention to tweets and everything else too.
I'm pretty much just like Joe sitting on the couch over there.
I just want you to know we really appreciate it, because that type of enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like Joe, Misty, JV, you know, we have lots of people that are so enthusiastic and everything, and I just remember you were one of the first, and I always thank you for that.
I have to personally thank you guys also, because not only for 10 years of friendship, thank you, but if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have met and married my husband and all that other stuff, and...
It's been a crazy 10 years, and I'm just looking forward to 10 more plus.
The crazy thing about what you just said is that you're the second person to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle your story because it's amazing, but Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook, that inadvertently, because of OLR, there was Geek Life, and because of Geek Life, there was Dan.
So kind of the same thing happened for her, in a way.
She has a Dan.
I have a Dan.
It's so...
Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way.
It blows my mind.
And in some ways, I mean, I didn't meet Alan through OLR, but Alan and I probably got a lot closer because of it.
So even my own life, this show has had an impact on in that kind of way.
It's crazy.
It's very crazy.
But great and humbling.
But maybe we can get together and see if you guys can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show.
I'm sure we can arrange that.
Let's work out the beats.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier.
I'm not going to be very interesting tonight.
Big hugs for you and the hubby and thanks for being a part of OLR's history.
Hugs to you guys too.
Take care.
Happy 10 years again.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
I should have asked her when the last time she played DDR was.
Maybe she's just Angel now.
I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what.
Ranma wants to know where is Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up.
Alan is working tonight.
He couldn't make the show because he's working.
Well, you know what?
In this economy, I am fucking thrilled.
He's working tonight.
Don't get me wrong.
But I'm sure he would be here to say hello and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight.
I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in because I saw a couple.
But we are getting towards the end of the show, I think.
How's your headache doing?
You feeling better?
I feel bad.
I still got pressure in my head.
I want to say thanks as well to JV Mon, because I didn't get to say this on air because you did it during break, but you got us presents.
And there's nothing I love more in the world than presents.
and I got brought Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, which you can't buy in California.
That's awesome.
The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines.
Yeah, I know.
And I love... We have the old school Keurig machine, which we don't use anymore because it sucks.
But the new one's pretty awesome.
But yeah.
They need to bring a Dunkin' Donuts over here because we don't have a fucking... Well, we have a Krispy Kreme, but it's all in Roseville.
I did drive there one time when I woke up for work at 5 in the morning because I'm like, I can't go back to sleep.
I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville or wherever.
I want a donut.
All right, let's go back to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, choo-choo, it's Jim Sally.
What is up, Jim Sally?
Not much, everybody.
Happy anniversary, everybody, on the show.
Thank you.
What'd you buy me?
Well, I'll tell you what.
In honor of the donations, I will donate $1...
for every minute that this call goes on for.
How's that sound?
Pay my hold!
Please hold.
Alright, seriously, I'm not going to be looking at the time, but that's hilarious.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Not much, man.
I wanted to call in and share some of my Orange Lounge radio stories.
Please.
I used to always listen to you guys.
I'll listen to The Bobby Show.
Everyone knows about The Bobby Show.
It's a great show.
He's the man.
He is the man.
I wish Bobby lived close to me.
I would just idolize him all day long.
But anyway, I listen to the Bobby show.
Then I would listen to a little OLR on live, right?
Because I have to always work early in the morning and maybe get like an hour into it.
This sounds bad.
Don't take this the wrong way, guys.
I love you guys.
Don't take this the wrong way, okay?
Listen.
I would go to bed listening to you and I'd fall asleep listening to you every night.
I know that sounds horrible.
It's just because I was really tired and I had to go to bed.
I listen to you while I sleep.
It actually sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear at night is my voice.
I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes.
I don't want to say it.
And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like, God damn it!
Yeah.
I was a champion wrestler in high school, man.
I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen, buddy.
Come on, have a snuggle.
As a caller three calls or so ago would say, oh my.
Oh, that guy was awesome, man.
But you know what?
No, wait a minute, guys.
You know what's nice, though?
I had a baby about a year ago.
Mm-hmm.
So I've been having to stay home, so my baby would always be, like, shitty at nighttime.
How'd you accomplish that?
I thought you were ill-equipped.
No!
No, yeah, yeah.
Jim Sally can do anything, baby.
This train is fully equipped.
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Let's not go into details.
You know what I'm saying?
But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you guys.
And then I'd listen until midnight.
I'd sit in the rocking chair with my baby beside me and the iPod on the table and me and my baby.
For the last ten and a half months that she's been on, we listen every week.
I don't know if I want to influence a baby because that could be bad.
I totally want to influence a baby.
I already know how that turns out.
It's nice having a baby.
It's like a little Padawan learner teaching her so much shit.
She chokes the shit out of the cat right now, man.
She's gonna be ready when she gets... Fuck that dark side, man, all the way.
Fuck them light side bitches, man.
That's what I tell my baby every night.
Oh my god, your baby is gonna grow up to be an ultimate fighter.
I hope so.
Oh my god, if my little girl was an ultimate fighter, I would... Oh my Jesus.
Can you imagine?
She's
There's only two things now.
There used to be one thing I wanted from my little girl.
But now there's two things I want from my little girl.
Number one, please become an MMA fighter.
The best MMA fighter in the world.
Pencil hold motherfuckers to death.
Oh, I'd love her.
Number two, I pray to Jesus every day she's a lesbian.
Every day I pray.
Oh my god, I say Jesus.
I think of myself when I was a little boy.
When I was like a 15-year-old kid, I was a pig.
I don't want no pig boys hanging around my girl.
Fuck that shit.
I want her to just be a nice lesbian, find a nice girl, get married, and then when they want to have kids, I got two ovens to be baking babies in.
Double that bacon up, baby bacon ovens, baby.
Double them up.
Most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear you've given this some detailed thought.
Rob, I'm telling you right now, if there was, like, you know how you can pay for procedures and stuff, like do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever?
If you could pay to turn the gay switch on, I would turn it on.
That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy.
That's when you've got to sync those genetics in there.
I would have done it a long time ago, man.
I've thought about this myself, because, you know, Dan and I were trying, and I wanted to have a lesbian.
and I'll tell you why I'll tell you why okay I don't have to pay for a bris and number two I think of all the money I would save if I had a really dykey baby
Well, you also gotta think about this, too, because you're a chick, right?
If you had a ducky baby and she was more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe.
All of a sudden, you're wearing the best clothes ever, right?
Your kids buy them.
You just steal her from her closet.
Oh, man.
I gotta say, one of the perks about being gay is that, like, if I have no clean shirts... Oh, Alan has a clean shirt.
I'll steal that.
Like, it works out really well.
You know you have to take Alan's shirts, man.
Jeez, did you go to any Pride weekend this weekend, guy?
No, because, you know, I usually don't because Sundays are the show.
And I know this.
I swear I'm not saying this to get pity.
I'm really not.
The show kind of comes first before that.
I haven't gone.
I've gone to some Prides, but I usually have to, like, run home in time for the show.
And I want to say once or twice in the 10 years I did cancel out on the show that week so I could, you know, do stuff in the city.
But...
I don't know.
I don't get us all... It's too many people for me.
I get gay pride.
In the 60s when it was not okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk about and you had to hide it from the world and cops tried to arrest you because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and deal with it.
What can you expect sometimes, right?
They're pretty old school over there, I guess.
It's dumb though, right?
It's totally dumb.
I'm straight, but I go to Pride every year and I make a t-shirt every year.
Last year I had, I'm straight 364 days a year and on the back it said, today's your lucky day.
That was a funny shirt, right?
Like, why not?
This year I had, can a straight guy get some lovin'?
And I just walked around with my arms out and I just got hugs from dudes, right?
Just get some hugs.
He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens to our brothers, man.
Gentlemen, straight boys, I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again.
The more gay dudes there are in the world, the more boobies there are for us.
Okay?
So help them out.
Let them have the pride.
Give them the pride week.
You know what I mean?
Put on this shirt and just go out and have a good time.
You can bring your girl.
No one's going to hit on her.
So why wouldn't you bring your girl with you?
It's the best.
I remember the first time I went to gay days at Disneyland.
And there were two brothers and one of them says, I'm not, but he is on his shirt.
And the other one says, I am, but he's not.
I've been to Disneyland.
I think every day might be gays day at Disneyland.
I don't know.
This is when everybody's walking around in red shirts.
You either think it's a bunch of death waiting to happen if you're a Star Trek fan.
Thanks guys, I'm just going to go to bed now
I'm going to try to snuggle with Loki and go to sleep.
Good night.
Good night, Jim.
No, I wonder, can Loki say it?
He went to the bathroom.
He went to pee.
Your call made him pee.
I scared the piss out of him, eh?
All right, Jim.
Take care, buddy.
Take care.
Later.
Bye.
Oh, my gosh.
All right.
I got to try one more call, maybe.
We're going to have to say no more at some point.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Did I hit the call?
Oh, I missed it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawns Radio.
Caller, we can't hear you.
Caller, we can't hear you.
Can you hear us?
Could I just make up whatever you're saying right now?
Try again later.
Echo 1-2-3, kids.
Echo 1-2-3.
All right.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Nothing much, just having some internet issues at home, trying to put out fires.
But yeah, happy 10th.
Really?
Nothing much.
I mean, well, aside from you celebrating 10 years,
Kind of a milestone in the sense that you walk from one niche genre of video games to encompass just about every genre.
And I guess part of it was also evolving.
You had to adapt to the fact that you couldn't just keep shoveling Vamadi for affinity.
And at some point you had to become a bit more mainstream.
At some point we had to go from Charmander to Charizard.
That had to happen.
That is true, that is true.
That's the whole point of evolving and the fact that you adapted, you won podcast awards left and right, or you were at least nominated for them.
Zaku, we just wanted to be the very best that no one ever was.
And also, everyone thinks you should be pounding on your keyboard while you're talking.
I'm not.
I'm on my phone right now.
I'm still trying to set up a new router that I had to put out fires with.
Don't pound the phone.
But yeah, I mean, that's
You were pretty much my routine for the past eight years.
Like, almost on a consecutive basis.
Except for the night that you were off.
Obviously, that breaks the streak, but you get the idea.
It was pretty much consistent.
Like, almost Sunday night, starting from 2004 onwards, was just listening to you guys.
Pretty much, that was it.
Just going there, listening to all our... And that's become almost a routine.
It is like
Go ahead.
As you were saying.
No, go ahead.
I mean, it is kind of life-changing that, you know, you have something that you, you know, that you just listen to that you try to, like, you know, out of curiosity and all of a sudden it just, like, sticks to you in a good way.
Well, Zaku, after all these years, what would you say would be your favorite memory involving you and OLR?
Because I know that I have my favorite memory involving you and OLR.
Oh.
Me and Kat?
Really?
Really?
Well... It's got an in and out, but yeah, I get the whole point.
I'm trying to remember right now.
Jeez, um...
Alright, Zaku.
No matter what I tell the other callers, you're my favorite.
Yeah, I'm right.
Alright, take care, Zaku.
Have a good night.
yeah definitely once again enjoy your 10th and may 10 more years bless upon you we will try our best we'll need lots of booze to get there hope to see you when I come to New York next thank you hopefully you make it out there like soon date TBD the date TBD alright later buddy alright alright let's go to more calls
Nobody has to work tomorrow, right?
Hi, hola.
Oh, it's the intern.
Who let you on?
Hi, Drew.
It's the one who forgets to choose his audio input before calling.
Yes, Echo123 intern, after all these years.
Fired!
It's been a while.
It's been a while.
Can I be unfired yet?
If you write on the blackboard 100 times.
I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Nogahide.
I burned it.
I burned all of them.
All of the books.
So what is on your mind, Drew?
I just wanted to congratulate you guys.
I know I've been with you guys since episode two, and it's been a long, crazy-ass ride.
I wasn't even there.
Joe has you beat by one show.
How does that make you feel?
I know.
I know there can be only one, so I'm going to have to take his head off one of these days.
What was your favorite memory of OLR?
Because I know I have mine involving you, and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table.
God damn it, man.
Um...
I'm just, I'm just giving you shit, Drew.
Karaoke Revolution, anything involving Karaoke Revolution, especially, uh, god, what was it?
Episode 69, we decided to prank you with jelly beans and the milkshakes.
And you took a sip on air.
Yeah.
The reaction was golden.
Absolutely priceless.
You'll have to go find that in the OL archive.
Jeez, Drew, it's been 10 years.
You've been listening to this show for 10 years.
Well, on and off, I imagine.
What kind of impact has this show had for you?
Well, for one, it gives me something interesting to talk about at conventions, but aside from that, you know, because I'm a really boring guy otherwise.
And you did transform from being our young Republican to being a long-haired hippie.
Sorry, I'm recovering.
That's true.
He really did go through a very psychological shift at one point, too.
It's...
We all grow up.
Y'all do whatever politics you want.
I don't care.
This is a diverse place.
I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360.
Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person go through that type of change, for sure.
360?
I don't own one of those.
Better than the Xbox Lube.
Alright, Drew, any final thoughts before we let you go?
I'm hoping for many more years to come, and I'm really appreciating the way Orange Launch Radio is going with Voice of Geeks, and hopefully everything turns out well.
I'll still keep listening, I'll still keep phoning in, and I'll be a big part of the community.
I mean, come on, it's been 10 years.
I grew up with you guys.
You did, quite literally.
That's a powerful thing to say, but yeah, in a way.
And you went to school with me.
Yes, I did.
We would often run into each other on the lawn at ARC.
The grassy knoll, which no shots were fired at.
Which is actually now sort of off-limits since they're building the new student center.
Yeah, which I will never get to see.
Aww.
You can always go back and visit.
Oh, wait, I graduated.
Never mind.
Well, Drew, thank you so much for being a part of the show for ten years, and we'll see you next week.
Definitely.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Have a good one.
Bye.
I think with that, I'm going to finally close the Skype line.
I am so sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B in addition to an hour and a half for Part A. Guys, it's okay because of Garrus.
Yeah, and the fact that DarkSakura and Loki do have to work tomorrow.
I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV.
Yay.
Which is even worse.
For a month
with episode 463.
All right.
We got to go around and wrap up the show tonight.
Quickly, last-minute stories.
Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list, and then you can add whatever you want to it.
Just real quickly, some last-minute stories that we didn't get to tonight.
Super Mario Bros.
Crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it.
There's a Kickstarter going on about that.
And he's local.
That's kind of funny.
And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him and see if he wants to come on to OLR to promote that.
I haven't done that yet, but we will.
or being violated by the copyright holders.
Valve and Adult Swim for Team Fortress.
Jamie, this was one of your stories.
I don't remember what this was about.
Yeah, I already forgot what it was about.
They're doing some sort of crossover content thing or something.
They didn't really say what yet.
Yeah, it was like a quickie.
I can only hope it's a TV series because that would be awesome based on like, you know, the meet the whomever.
Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on Xbox.com so that's likely to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon.
DarkSakura, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?
Not really.
Nothing was as good as the first one.
I mean, I'm serious.
We tried Sonic Adventure 2, was not as good as the first one.
But there are some fans that will be very happy about that, I'm sure.
And they're wrong.
Jay's raising his hand over there.
Jay, you a big Sonic Adventure 2 fan?
Yeah, if Xbox Live could take pre-orders, I'd pre-order it right now.
Awesome.
DreamWorks and EA are going to make a Need for Speed movie.
because Fast and the Furious just wasn't enough.
I'll be hiding in a cave.
Very interesting.
Capcom plans to make some Mega Man 25th anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath over Mega Man Universe or whatever.
Maybe announce the soundtrack that's in it.
Exactly.
More downloads of the old stuff will be coming to your way.
Looking quickly at the Twitter real quick, TigerClaw had sent us a couple stories.
Marvel vs. Capcom, The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming history, coming soon.
Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix.
Yikes.
Actdeft says, OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio.
Virtual Phil, who was on Horde House this week, says, if you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?
Pro tip, not Silent Hill.
If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life.
I would live in the Pokemon universe, because let's be real, Pokemon are adorable, and you could teach them to do your killing.
I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet where that is like low on the list of harvesting.
Where you could cuddle with Garrus?
Yeah, I would live on Palavan.
Loki?
You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third, but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.
Good answer.
Anybody on the couch?
What game world would you want to live in most of all?
Animal Crossing Animal Crossing says Dark Tetsuya Jay?
Infamous because coal's kind of hot Good answers, good answers Misty, did you have one?
Yeah, I agree with Pokemans because, fuck, I picked my nickname from it Ah, there you go, that's true, Misty You know what just occurred to me that would actually be really good?
The Doctor Who games
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Can I bug you for a minute?
Alright.
Okay, well, if Alan is home from work, that means we really gotta wrap it up and get on out of here.
Loki, any last-minute stories you wanted to add?
Final Fantasy XI is getting another expansion.
Why?
Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting a new class Geomancer.
Geomancer's are cool I said a long time ago it should have got Geomancer so I'm excited they're actually getting it so they're doing that and that's just kind of crazy because I guess it's also been around for a long time and then Skylanders are getting some sidekick characters and exclusive Frito-Lay things yay so you're gonna get those in bags of Frito-Lays and you get little characters that I think are compatible with the game maybe
I don't know if it's a hint or if it's sort of a tease or something, but apparently there was an image tweeted by the creator of Seaman that is a Santa Seaman.
Perhaps hinting that there may be an announcement or a game release regarding Seaman?
Maybe?
That's been teased for a while, I think, so that could be very interesting.
Yeah.
And I guess a guy, Kim.com's launching a new Mega Upload site called Megabox.
So it'll be interesting to see what happens there.
Megabox.
Yeah, Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy XI again, to play Geomancer with him.
And you know Shane is really good at peer pressure, right, Jamie?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, free to play and my life is over.
I know, I know.
Is it going free to play?
I wish.
It should.
Because, man, I already started playing Lord of the Rings and then... I think by the time Final Fantasy XIV comes out, it probably would.
All right.
We really have to bring this show to a close and say goodnight.
First off, over the past 10 years, you guys have tuned in and supported our show, and we just want to say thank you.
And you know we never ask for your money, although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts want to help pay to keep it going.
And trust me, we really, really appreciate it.
But all we ask most of all...
Tell a friend or 20 about the show and help spread the word.
Give us a nice five-star review on iTunes or whatever pod-catching site you use.
Stitcher Radio, you can give us thumbs-ups and stars on.
We appreciate that.
And just whatever to help spread the word of our show.
Before we go, though, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.
I want to thank everybody for being here in studio tonight.
Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight.
Oh, man, I don't even know.
Speak up.
Man, I don't even know.
Ten years, you know?
I did have a request, though.
Sure!
Can you find the DJ Melvis' promo?
I think so.
Yes, I can do that.
I did an interview with him and he mentioned it.
On OrangeLaunchRadio.com you can see Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now.
And I will play that by request.
It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long.
They're talking about Seaman in chat and Alpha Cananagram said Searyman.
That might almost work.
You know, there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles.
There's people requesting a Siri versus GLaDOS.
And the guys there are seriously considering it.
All right.
To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, here's his final thought.
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
The best things in life are free.
Of course, anytime, buddy.
JV Mon, thank you so much for coming out here all the way from the Bronx.
You're very welcome.
I hope you had a great time in San Francisco and all that, too.
I did, and I had a great time here tonight.
I'm sorry the traffic sucked.
And thank you once again for the coffee.
You're welcome.
My favorite thing in the world.
You squeed a little bit.
I did, in my pants.
I think it was... You had to go change your pants.
I did, I did.
Rob had special feelings in the pantal region.
Do you have a final thought tonight, Jay?
Um...
Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't.
You're going to have to come back to me on that one.
Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show to give that final thought later on.
So how do you like that?
I will return.
There you go.
There you go.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
All right.
Misty, thank you for getting on a train all the way out here.
I hope you had fun in Saka Tomato.
What's your final thought tonight?
To confirm your theory, out of 50ml bottles of UV cake, 4 out of the 6 that I packed, plus the glass of wine, yes, I am drunk by my usual standards.
Woo!
Party!
Good times, good times.
Where to start?
Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is next week's going to be interesting because apparently 12 a.m.
Eastern Time on July 1st which happens to be in the middle of our show is when the Jade Gate opens and you know I gotta play that.
Oh lord.
Alright.
I was ranked 159 last time.
I'm going to try better.
Go for 158.
Yes.
Alright.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
um I have to drive home and I have to go to work tomorrow but this is gonna be a very I'm gonna be dreaming in orange I'm gonna be dreaming and by the way reject false icons why not my final thought tonight is thank you for giving a shit I really mean that and 10 more years my friends oh Rob what Garris
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
For all of us here in studio, we will see you again next week.
That's not the outro.
Who did that?
Who did that when I wasn't looking?
Who did that?
Somebody switched or rude that on me when I wasn't looking.
Bastards.
Alright, here it is for real.
Good night, everybody.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
To join us for a live show, tune in to VOGnetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
See you next week!
Alright, if you really don't want to call it a night just yet, one more round, one more round.
Here it is.
Oh, and God, I'm just really not prepared tonight.
I was going to say, here it is, your Forge of Cookie message of the day, but I didn't have it up.
Fail.
I'm a failure, what can I say?
Alright, let me get to the show roll.
I even forgot what it was.
What do you want to do next week?
Let's go to Pinkberry.
I'm telling you.
They should be matching Grandpa's contribution.
Here it is, your fortune cookie message of the day.
Here's a lovely song about my favorite food.
Lima, Lanto, Zoey, and Pinto, Navy, Northern, and Garbanzo, Kidneys, and Frijoles, Negros.
I love beans.
I love beans.
Woo, woo, woo.
I love beans.
How about you?
High in fiber, low in fat.
Yeah, but you didn't know that.
When I eat beans, I say it in my own little cloud.
Nobody comes to visit me in my little cloud.
I don't know why.
Maybe because I'm cutting muffins.
Because I love beans.
Hey, hey, hey.
I love beans every day.
Beans are an excellent source of protein.
I love beans.
And thus concludes another broadcast day at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network.
From Bobby Blackwolf, who started it off tonight with a great interview with the folks behind Resonance, to us and our 10th anniversary show, let's make next week and the week after and the week after just as epic.
Have a wonderful, wonderful week.
We'll see you next time.
The next show that is up on deck, Pod Culture, with a premiere episode tomorrow night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
Be here or suck.
