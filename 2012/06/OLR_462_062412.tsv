0	5000	You're listening to The Bog Network. Up next, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5000	7000	Orange Lounge Radio, live.
20000	24000	Good evening, everyone. Pekaruno here from the UK.
24000	34000	I just wanted to congratulate all of you at Orange Lounge Radio for your tin jubilee.
34000	44000	Over the past ten years, you have provided top-notch video game news in a passionate, entertaining, but most of all, refined way.
44000	54000	Even though I have not been the most regular of listeners, it is obvious to me just how much you care about both your hobby and your dedicated fans.
54000	64000	To Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and all of your guests and listeners, congratulations once again, and long may you broadcast over us.
64000	77000	Hi guys, it's your friendly Jessica Harper from Under Station Wives, just wishing you guys a happy ten years, and looking forward to many more with you guys.
77000	84000	Love the connection that we have between the shows, and definitely looking forward to sharing more in the future.
84000	86000	Happy anniversary. Bye.
86000	92000	Hey, what's up? This is Tigerclaw. I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy tenth anniversary.
92000	98000	I've been listening to the radio show for many, many years now, and I really hope you guys continue doing this for ten more years.
98000	100000	Have a great show, and take care.
100000	107000	Hey, it's Oscar calling in to wish you guys a happy ten year anniversary, and why stop there?
107000	112000	Just continue for like another hundred years, because you guys are going to live forever, right? Right? Right?
112000	122000	I want you old and wrinkly in wheelchairs and doing this show while playing DDR with your wheels or something. Okay, I'm done. Bye.
122000	131000	Hey guys, it's Sturlok here, and I can't believe you guys have been doing this thing for ten years. That is awesome.
131000	143000	And I think I've been listening for about five of those years, and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to.
143000	150000	And you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and Black Wolf.
150000	167000	And my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago, and that was a lot of fun.
167000	177000	So have an awesome teniversary, and hey, maybe you guys will make it to another ten years. That would be awesome.
177000	179000	Anyway, stay black.
179000	193000	Hey OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, aka YYR. Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.
193000	203000	I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR dream game Bungie Farah Tossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it. I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.
203000	209000	I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.
209000	219000	I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives, thank you slaves, but I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.
219000	228000	Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last ten years, so Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.
228000	247000	What's up, OLR? It's Zether. I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say they're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to, because if you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts, I like that.
247000	263000	I love the Classic Game of the Week segment. It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for ten years, starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining, too.
263000	272000	So, yeah, congrats, guys. Congrats on the ten years. Hopefully, you can do ten more of this, maybe. I don't know. Congrats.
272000	291000	Hey, Orange Balance Radio. This is Bletch N'Zoth. We're wishing you the best. Ten years. Ten years. That's pretty long for a radio that started off as doing D.J. Armbarmani and then morphing into video games, but still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.
291000	305000	Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years, and for that, I tip my hat to you, and no, I'm not drunk or hot. Have a good one.
305000	326000	Hey, D.J. Armbarmanis here from Anime Jam Session. I've been a listener of Orange Balance Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.
326000	351000	The OLR community is not just friends. It's become a massive, wonderful family, and as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that. They all talk about video games, a game of culture, and a game of lifestyle, but there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us, and we have to sit and discuss, which I think is great.
351000	365000	OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose, but when you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.
365000	376000	It's like you got different rankings of it, and that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years. As for me, I admire them, and I totally respect them for what they do,
376000	391000	and my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match, and from that point on, I said, you know, I want to do something like this,
391000	412000	and because of what they do, and what I do with Anime Jam Session, with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting our own family thing, and if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.
412000	433000	So I am eternally thankful for their contribution, and in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people, so to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you, congratulations on 10 years, and I will be around for another 10 more. Take care.
442000	452000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki!
452000	465000	Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.
465000	470000	Orange Lounge Radio
470000	484000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. Established 2002.
484000	494000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-hosts. Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
494000	497000	Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.
497000	500000	It took me about 7 to get it right.
500000	503000	Sakura!
503000	505000	Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.
505000	506000	Sakura!
506000	507000	There's been some bad ones in the past.
507000	508000	There have been.
508000	510000	Are you gonna make me go back into the archive?
510000	511000	No I'm not, no I'm not.
511000	515000	Do I have to go back into the archive?
515000	516000	I think you're making me go back into the archive.
516000	521000	But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.
521000	525000	You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you? It's disturbing me a little bit.
525000	528000	But Garris.
528000	531000	Alright, hold on, hold on. What do I have here? We have, uh.
531000	534000	I was still tempted to go after Thame, but Garris.
534000	536000	But Garris, let's see.
536000	539000	That's the answer to everything from here out, but Garris.
539000	544000	Let me dip back into the archives here since DarkSakura made me do it.
544000	545000	Make you do shit.
545000	547000	Let's see how I pronounce her name.
547000	551000	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
551000	555000	Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.
555000	556000	Any arcade.
556000	559000	Because Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.
559000	560000	Oh yeah.
560000	561000	And so many different arcades.
561000	562000	She gets around.
562000	566000	If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.
566000	568000	Yes, I will spank your child.
568000	570000	If you're not gonna do your job, god damn it, I will.
570000	578000	Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.
578000	584000	With your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani.
584000	585000	There you go.
585000	586000	In the meantime, enjoy.
586000	589000	That was episode one right there. Episode one.
589000	592000	That was the little promo cut from episode one.
592000	596000	By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.
596000	599000	It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.
599000	601000	Has your opinion changed after ten years?
601000	609000	Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.
609000	611000	And now I'm happy being the aunt.
611000	616000	Because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.
616000	618000	That's a great arrangement.
618000	620000	Yes, it's perfect.
620000	626000	Let me go also, of course, to the man who wasn't even supposed to be here today in the beginning.
626000	630000	But we just, he loved the show so much we made him a third co-host.
630000	634000	And it's honestly, he retroactively is a host from episode zero through twenty.
634000	637000	Because how could he not be a full-time host orange entree.
637000	638000	The show would not be the same without him.
638000	639000	Techmaster Loki.
639000	640000	Hi.
640000	641000	How are you, Loki?
641000	642000	I have a headache.
642000	643000	Aww.
643000	645000	All this time later and now you have a headache.
645000	646000	I'm sorry.
646000	647000	I'm sorry.
647000	650000	I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it.
650000	652000	But caffeine will work.
652000	654000	Nah, probably not. But we'll try.
654000	659000	And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the tenth anniversary of OLR.
659000	662000	Um, McDonald's because it was very late.
662000	664000	And that's really the only reason why.
664000	670000	It's because I had to get some, I was like, sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something.
670000	673000	And I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.
673000	675000	I need to just stop what I'm doing.
675000	676000	I need to leave now.
676000	679000	And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.
679000	682000	Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.
682000	687000	If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VoG Network.
687000	691000	The Voice of Geeks Network where we tape live six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
691000	694000	every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
694000	696000	www.vognetwork.com
696000	699000	I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com
699000	703000	And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,
703000	706000	OLR was two hours?
706000	707000	It kind of outgrew that time frame.
707000	712000	If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast,
712000	716000	the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.
716000	719000	The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20 minute show.
719000	723000	Yeah, that didn't work out so well.
723000	729000	SSG100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.
729000	731000	Arigato.
731000	732000	All right.
732000	734000	You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.
734000	735000	I'm getting better.
735000	736000	You're getting better.
736000	737000	A little better, a little bit.
737000	738000	It's only taken me 10 years.
738000	739000	All right.
739000	742000	Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.
742000	744000	We've filled things up here in the OLR studio tonight.
744000	748000	We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show.
748000	749000	And I want to say hello to them for a little bit.
749000	750000	Up first.
750000	752000	Rob, is your guy doing the Cabbage Patch?
752000	753000	Yes, I am in the-
753000	754000	Lord.
754000	756000	On a DDR machine nonetheless.
756000	762000	Dark Soccer is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse,
762000	764000	which I think I'm the only one in right now.
764000	766000	And he's doing the freaking Cabbage Patch.
766000	768000	On a DDR machine.
768000	771000	How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?
771000	773000	By doing a dance from the 80s.
773000	775000	I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.
775000	777000	We turning 10.
777000	779000	We turning 10.
779000	782000	Thank God this is radio.
782000	785000	Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.
785000	786000	Huh.
786000	787000	And it's radio.
787000	788000	You'll never get to see it.
788000	790000	But these guys just saw that.
790000	791000	Say hello.
791000	793000	Joining us all the way from St. Louis, Missouri.
793000	795000	Say hello to Misty.
795000	800000	Because I know you're wondering, between delays, layovers, and actual travel time,
800000	802000	it took about three days to get here.
802000	804000	Now that's because you don't fly.
804000	805000	Exactly.
805000	806000	But you took the train.
806000	808000	But you're like a huge train fan.
808000	809000	You're a train fanatic.
809000	811000	You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.
811000	817000	Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.
817000	819000	Yet I never rode on trains.
819000	820000	It was this really weird thing.
820000	821000	You are so fired.
821000	822000	I guess not.
822000	823000	So.
823000	825000	Alright, anyhow.
825000	827000	Well, hello to you.
827000	829000	How are you today, I guess?
829000	830000	Very good.
830000	832000	What made you want to be here for tonight's show?
832000	834000	Gee, I wonder.
834000	835000	Gee.
835000	837000	It is kind of a big deal.
837000	838000	Alright, say hello as well.
838000	841000	Joining us from, I don't remember exactly what suburb.
841000	842000	I just say New York City.
842000	845000	It's kind of like, we're in the Bay Area, although not really.
845000	847000	This next guest is from New York City.
847000	849000	Say hello to JV Mon.
849000	850000	Hello, everybody.
850000	851000	How are you doing?
851000	852000	Good, and you?
852000	853000	Good.
853000	854000	Your first time on OLR.
854000	855000	First time in person, yeah.
855000	858000	Well, it's kind of hard to be on the show when you're 3,000 miles away.
858000	860000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
860000	862000	Where in the city are you exactly?
862000	864000	I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.
864000	865000	Okay.
865000	866000	Oh, so you're in, okay.
866000	867000	I can never remember.
867000	868000	It's a big city.
868000	869000	It's a big place.
869000	870000	And it's far away.
870000	871000	I went once.
871000	872000	Yeah?
872000	873000	Once.
873000	874000	Once?
874000	875000	What did you do in New York City?
875000	876000	Oh, nothing.
876000	877000	Just played at Carnegie Hall.
877000	878000	Oh, okay.
878000	879000	Just a little something something.
879000	880000	Band trip.
880000	882000	What brings you to California?
882000	885000	You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?
885000	888000	That and my sister also, yes, just for that.
888000	889000	Nothing else, no.
889000	893000	My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.
893000	895000	And I've just been here for like the past week.
895000	899000	And I was like, oh, my vacation comes inside with the 10th anniversary.
899000	900000	Might as well make a visit.
900000	902000	What a nice convenience.
902000	904000	I'm sorry that the drive was all trafficy.
904000	905000	You're trying to get here today.
905000	906000	No, yeah.
906000	909000	Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.
909000	913000	Well, Pecorino says, my fellow, you're a beat nerd.
913000	914000	Yes.
914000	917000	And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.
917000	918000	Am I?
918000	919000	My name does come from Digimon, yes.
919000	921000	Bimon was my favorite Digimon growing up.
921000	922000	Yes.
922000	923000	Growing up.
923000	925000	I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.
925000	927000	Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?
927000	932000	I think Dar Sakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.
932000	933000	Thank you very much.
933000	934000	Thank you very much.
934000	936000	The show we started in our...
936000	938000	That's in another 10 years.
938000	940000	The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.
940000	943000	You do the math.
943000	945000	That's okay.
945000	947000	We feel young, and that's the important thing.
947000	949000	Now get off my lawn.
949000	952000	What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?
952000	954000	Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?
954000	955000	No.
955000	956000	Is the Metreon even still open?
956000	959000	It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.
959000	962000	I haven't been to the Metreon since like 2004.
962000	963000	Okay.
963000	966000	Metreon was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago.
966000	970000	Like there was an epic, you know, one where they gave away a DDR machine,
970000	973000	and then they had that epic arcade, and they had all the crane machines,
973000	975000	and they had the oops cat.
975000	976000	What the hell?
976000	978000	Oops, I went to hell store.
978000	979000	What was her name?
979000	980000	That mascot.
980000	981000	I used to love those shirts.
981000	983000	Somebody in chow will think of it.
983000	986000	And then there's the official Sony store was there as well.
986000	989000	And now they're talking about putting a Target in there.
989000	991000	The fuck?
991000	993000	And look, I love Target, but...
993000	995000	You know they have like the gamer walk of fame?
995000	996000	Oh yeah.
996000	997000	That little catwalk thing?
997000	998000	They do. That's right. That is there.
998000	1002000	But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it,
1002000	1007000	and so half of it was like white, and the other half of it was like DDR machine,
1007000	1009000	and even the screen was faded.
1009000	1011000	It was awful to play on.
1011000	1013000	But Garris.
1013000	1016000	So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?
1016000	1020000	Since it's my first vacation in like four years, and my first time out here in like eight,
1020000	1023000	I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.
1023000	1024000	Touristy stuff?
1024000	1026000	I've been pretty much at all the tourist tracks.
1026000	1030000	You went to Pier 39, and Alcatraz, and Napa.
1030000	1032000	I went to Sonoma, not Napa.
1032000	1035000	Oh, excuse me, princess!
1037000	1039000	It's all booze.
1039000	1043000	I got myself lots and lots of wine. I was very happy.
1043000	1044000	Good times.
1044000	1048000	But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became. I saw the Riptire arcade was gone.
1048000	1049000	Yep, that we...
1049000	1052000	I cried a little bit. I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.
1052000	1057000	We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.
1057000	1062000	That was actually, I gotta say, that was one of our earliest achievements really as a station,
1062000	1065000	was that we did, we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments,
1065000	1068000	and we did the Sacramento ones, of course, we broadcast.
1068000	1071000	Not that very first one in Folsom, because we didn't really have the ability to do it,
1071000	1073000	but I know we did a couple from Scandia,
1073000	1077000	and then we took our rig all the way to the Bay Area and broadcast live from that.
1077000	1080000	I think the tournament was called B3, and it was a great time.
1080000	1086000	Because that was when me and Megumi decided we were going to just leave the second day.
1086000	1090000	Awesome. So, yeah, good times.
1090000	1093000	Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay, and when do you leave?
1093000	1098000	I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.
1098000	1101000	Let's not talk about that on air. Maybe after the show.
1101000	1102000	Whoops.
1102000	1103000	All right.
1103000	1108000	You heard nothing.
1108000	1113000	I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.
1113000	1117000	And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.
1117000	1118000	Maybe later, if you're good.
1118000	1120000	Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.
1120000	1122000	That's right. Of course.
1122000	1125000	We're going to have a poetry slam.
1125000	1129000	In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR, like by pure coincidence.
1129000	1133000	We implanted that way, but my birthday is Tuesday, so, you know, yay, I'm old.
1133000	1134000	All right.
1134000	1141000	Also joining us tonight, now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.
1141000	1148000	He's the one person I know was here for episode one that has been here for pretty much every single episode since.
1148000	1150000	I mean, give or take a couple.
1150000	1153000	He probably tuned into it on the podcast at some point.
1153000	1157000	Ladies and gentlemen, here in the studio tonight, OLR's oldest listener.
1157000	1161000	You know, not like actual age, but like how long he's been listening.
1161000	1162000	Say hello to Dark Tetsuya.
1162000	1163000	Hey, guys.
1163000	1165000	How you doing, Dark Tetsuya? You might want to talk to this mic.
1165000	1167000	Oh, good, good.
1167000	1169000	So, what's new?
1169000	1172000	Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.
1172000	1173000	Not us.
1173000	1177000	Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one,
1177000	1182000	and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.
1182000	1184000	What's changed in 10 years?
1184000	1189000	Well, well, DDR kind of died.
1189000	1193000	If you were in PlayStation Home right now, it would look like it's still – look at that.
1193000	1196000	Tiger Claw got up on the machine with me, and now we're both dancing.
1196000	1200000	You would think DDR is all the rage if you were in the VOG Clubhouse right now on Home.
1200000	1202000	So, it's still the rage.
1202000	1206000	What has kept you motivated to listen to this show over the past 10 years?
1206000	1211000	I don't know, just, you know, being able to hang out with you guys all this time.
1211000	1214000	Did you hear that, Dark Sakura? We're awesome.
1214000	1216000	I know, and old.
1216000	1220000	Dark Tetsuya, if this happens to be somebody's first week listening to OLR,
1220000	1224000	what piece of advice would you give them about the show?
1224000	1228000	Oh, man, I – put me on the spot here.
1228000	1233000	I don't know, man, just –
1233000	1234000	Be prepared for anything.
1234000	1238000	Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.
1238000	1240000	Absolutely. It's live and uncensored.
1240000	1245000	And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.
1245000	1249000	Say hello, final guest tonight.
1249000	1254000	That's right, the OLR ferret is in the house.
1254000	1259000	Actually, this is the OLR ferret's cousin because we don't know where the original OLR ferret is,
1259000	1261000	but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.
1261000	1265000	Thanks to the magic of radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.
1265000	1268000	There you go, OLR ferret there in the house.
1268000	1270000	Well, there we are.
1270000	1276000	Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.
1276000	1278000	You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.
1278000	1284000	We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.
1284000	1288000	And, you know, the scene was really hopping then.
1288000	1293000	There was tournaments and, you know, all these things that would go on, a huge website, DDR Freak, that everybody posted on.
1293000	1295000	It was a really big community.
1295000	1304000	And because I was co-participating in a show about another community, a Rocky Horror Picture Show show called Under Sedation Live,
1304000	1308000	that was born of that community, I kind of had that seed planted in my head.
1308000	1311000	And Dark Sakura did as well, having guessed it on that show so many times.
1311000	1315000	Hey, why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?
1315000	1320000	Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.
1320000	1321000	And that's kind of what happened.
1321000	1323000	Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob. Thank you.
1323000	1325000	You're welcome. Anytime.
1325000	1328000	So, and here we are 10 years later.
1328000	1330000	And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.
1330000	1332000	We went from being two hours to three hours.
1332000	1339000	Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.
1339000	1342000	And then, you know, we've been on three different networks now.
1342000	1345000	And it's just it's been a crazy ride.
1345000	1347000	But here we are. Some things stay the same.
1347000	1349000	And here we are after 10 years.
1349000	1351000	And I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it.
1351000	1357000	Whether you started listening last week or this week or your dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between.
1357000	1361000	I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for Dark Soccer and Loki.
1361000	1363000	I'll let them speak in a minute here.
1363000	1370000	But if you ask me what kind of motivates me over the past 10 years to continue to do this show and I get asked this quite often by other podcasters.
1370000	1375000	You know, there's a lot of great people that have achieved a lot of great things out in podcasting.
1375000	1379000	But occasionally I get asked from a podcaster who's been doing it for six months.
1379000	1383000	This is a lot of work. How have you done this for the past 10 years?
1383000	1388000	And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody is listening.
1388000	1394000	And by somebody, I mean one person listening is is an amazing accomplishment.
1394000	1400000	I mean, it really is. And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.
1400000	1403000	It is it is a true community that we've built here.
1403000	1406000	I mean, it's a small community. We're not IGN.
1406000	1411000	We're not one of the top shit. We're not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.
1411000	1418000	We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.
1418000	1426000	And, you know, it's it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.
1426000	1429000	You know, because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.
1429000	1432000	Once in a while, we might then get in big trouble for it.
1432000	1437000	But it's it's awesome that, you know, you guys turn it tune in to hear our opinions.
1437000	1440000	And we're so thankful. Dark Soccer, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
1440000	1447000	Oh, my God. Actually, I just got a link from one of our listeners who wrote us,
1447000	1451000	who played a happy birthday song for us on Ukulele on YouTube.
1451000	1454000	I'm going to send this to you. Really? He used to work with Dan.
1454000	1458000	Oh, yeah. Well, is it safe to play on air?
1458000	1461000	I can't hear it on here. So I guess that's the only way we'll find out.
1461000	1463000	All right. I'll cue it up. But in the meantime.
1463000	1468000	But my motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.
1468000	1471000	And Garris.
1471000	1473000	Garris is the reason for life.
1473000	1479000	No, it's pretty much what you said. That and, you know, needing my ego.
1479000	1482000	To be petted like it's a fine Persian cat.
1482000	1485000	You want your E-peen to be huge.
1485000	1489000	No, I want my E-vage to be tight.
1489000	1491000	Wow.
1491000	1493000	I've been waiting to say that for a while.
1493000	1499000	Wow. That's one to send to Travis. All right.
1499000	1501000	Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
1501000	1505000	I'm motivated. It's news to me.
1505000	1507000	Bacon. Bacon has kept you motivated.
1507000	1510000	I don't know. I just come here every week.
1510000	1515000	Well, you know, I you and I personally went through some really big changes.
1515000	1517000	I'm sure Dark Sakura too. But I'm thinking of, you know,
1517000	1520000	you had a big personal life thing happen during the show.
1520000	1525000	I had a big personal life thing happen during the show where I was very sick and I damn near died.
1525000	1529000	And I think you heard Rama say it there in the little piece of the opening there.
1529000	1533000	Like sometimes we kind of get into these things about our lives that really have nothing to do with gaming.
1533000	1537000	But the fact that you guys still like care like means a lot.
1537000	1540000	And, you know, I know there was a lot of people thinking of me when that was going on,
1540000	1545000	thinking of you when you had your crisis going on, thinking of Dark Sakura.
1545000	1548000	I don't know when she gets sick every week. No, I'm sure Dark Sakura had something.
1548000	1550000	I don't get sick every week.
1550000	1551000	Every other week.
1551000	1552000	I started a job.
1552000	1554000	Actually, you did. Well, you. Well, OK.
1554000	1557000	The chatters thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?
1557000	1561000	Yeah. And I actually I was doing the show when I had the plague.
1561000	1562000	That's true.
1562000	1567000	I remember when I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.
1567000	1574000	So. But the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot anyway.
1574000	1577000	By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.
1577000	1580000	Just saying. All right. That's not good for anybody involved.
1580000	1583000	Look, I just want to plug this to as well.
1583000	1585000	Vogue network dot com. The voice of Geeks Network.
1585000	1588000	As you know, our third network where we've done O.L.R., it's new.
1588000	1590000	It's still kind of got the new paint smell.
1590000	1592000	There's lots of exciting things that are happening at Vogue Network.
1592000	1595000	Our forums just got a facelift this week. They look great.
1595000	1598000	I do want to plug as well. Make sure you check into tonight's show.
1598000	1603000	If you're listening live, you get a special piece of one time loop for listening.
1603000	1607000	Podcast listeners, I'm so sorry we don't have anything for you yet in that regard.
1607000	1612000	But I do want you to know we are working on podcast listeners being rewarded as well.
1612000	1617000	Keep in mind the site is only a month old and we have one guy, Bobby Black Wolf.
1617000	1618000	He's the man building it all.
1618000	1623000	So do you know, we want to be fair for everybody and let the podcast folks have their say too.
1623000	1626000	But we just need a little more time to get all that program.
1626000	1628000	So bear with us.
1628000	1632000	Anyhow, let's move on.
1632000	1634000	So am I going to play this? Am I going to play the birthday song here?
1634000	1638000	This is a birthday song from, what's the name he goes by now?
1638000	1641000	Shezro? Is his name online I think?
1641000	1644000	Here we go. I'm going to play this YouTube here.
1644000	1647000	Hey, what's up guys? It's your boy, Scarzo.
1647000	1652000	Just want to give a quick birthday shout out to the one and only OLR aka Orange Lounge Radio.
1652000	1659000	Man, ten freaking years. Ten years running strong, making a kick ass live show and a wonderful podcast.
1659000	1663000	I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart, I mean heart, yeah.
1663000	1665000	So anyway, before this video gets...
1665000	1668000	Did he say the bottom of his fart?
1668000	1670000	Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.
1670000	1672000	His fucking heart.
1672000	1677000	But he censored himself and then it made it sound like he said fart.
1677000	1680000	Camp, I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts.
1680000	1683000	And when I think about you, you make me wanna...
1683000	1685000	Too long, I take too much of your time.
1685000	1689000	I'm just going to play a song for you real quick. Check it out.
1715000	1733000	Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Lounge Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.
1733000	1739000	The show rocks. Like who else is going to get serenaded by a ukulele?
1739000	1740000	That's awesome.
1740000	1742000	That's so awesome. Thank you so much for that.
1742000	1747000	I'm dying to know what this related video here is on the side that says Asian Giggles.
1747000	1750000	But I guess I'll have to find out another time.
1750000	1756000	Because we have to get into our gaming weeks and the type of stuff that you have been playing this week, your gaming week.
1756000	1760000	How was it? Dark Soccer, starting us off tonight.
1760000	1762000	Garris.
1762000	1776000	Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because I, when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for 11 bucks with the first one, thank you Shane.
1776000	1783000	I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.
1783000	1795000	And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.
1795000	1799000	She is amazing. I love her so much. You'll love her.
1799000	1807000	But it came with the, whatever. Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.
1807000	1817000	So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.
1817000	1820000	I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.
1820000	1824000	Well that's why he makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.
1824000	1837000	And Grunt kind of is weird but yeah, so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garris again because I was happy.
1837000	1843000	And I've, so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I, and I was already a little sick.
1843000	1850000	And I got so motion sick playing it doing the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.
1850000	1854000	OMG spoilers in those first five minutes. Whatever.
1854000	1864000	So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about 10 minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5am.
1864000	1868000	Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wow this morning.
1868000	1876000	How is Sil gonna feel that too much Mass Effect made you miss Girls Gone Wow Wednesdays on VOG?
1876000	1879000	That I was also like really not feeling well. Oh I'm sorry.
1879000	1884000	I missed seeing Brave this morning too because Dan was going to take me to see Brave and I was like I didn't sleep.
1884000	1886000	And then I apparently texted you in my sleep.
1886000	1894000	Well you're not alone in your love for Garris by the way we have Fifth Dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I have girlgasms for Garris and I'm a boy.
1894000	1911000	Okay see see. Anyway so I did actually play some World of Warcraft like for because we have the Druid Guild, Druidia. So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.
1911000	1917000	Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids. Don't you think so?
1917000	1924000	And Rob's got one in there. Miss Nomi Malone. I do I have Nomi Malone. I'm a dancer not a stripper. Yeah.
1924000	1931000	So I did a little bit of that and I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.
1931000	1939000	Which I mean because like six hours I check it do more missions turn it off check it another six hours you know because that's how long it takes.
1939000	1944000	Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.
1944000	1950000	Awesome. I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one. Right?
1950000	1955000	Garris. Like it's not that the first one's a bad game. Bitch needs to give me his mission.
1955000	1961000	He will soon. He needs to give you more than that I imagine. Some bird love.
1961000	1965000	Alright anyhow anything else in your gaming week DarkSira? Mario Marathon.
1965000	1975000	Oh yes this is the weekend for them. That was sort of part of my gaming week because we watched people in odd Mario costumes with a neat looking game room play Mario.
1975000	1977000	They were on 64 when I stopped watching.
1977000	1984000	I almost feel bad because we have some people that have been tweeting us and so forth saying that they stopped watching Mario Marathon to come you know to our 10th anniversary show.
1984000	1994000	Which I deeply appreciate I almost feel bad because that's a charity event but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating and I figure you know if you're watching them for 72 hours you can spare one for us.
1994000	2000000	And since we aren't asking for donations tonight we will say go donate to a great charity child's play through Mario Marathon.
2000000	2010000	Well Dan and I donated and if you look at when they hit level 72 you will see Dan and Jamie parentheses OLR.
2010000	2011000	Oh nice.
2011000	2015000	So that's our donation put them to level 72.
2015000	2016000	Very cool.
2016000	2021000	So go look at their page and give them some money after the show.
2021000	2026000	Awesome. Let's move on and Tech Master Loki how was your gaming week?
2026000	2037000	I played Minecraft. More Minecraft. I've been working on the mine cart track entrance to my giant volcano thing.
2037000	2039000	How are you dealing with Friday's patch?
2039000	2042000	Oh it's just fine. There's still way to do pin it so it doesn't matter.
2042000	2045000	Of course. Of course where there's a will there's a way.
2045000	2054000	And then what else. Oh I played Lollipop Chainsaw and I'm disappointed.
2054000	2070000	I mean how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and you know over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.
2070000	2071000	How is that possible?
2071000	2075000	I mean you just can't but yet they found a way to do it.
2075000	2080000	And yes it is an incredibly boring game that I literally said I'm not playing the same word.
2080000	2082000	That's really disappointing.
2082000	2083000	Yeah.
2083000	2084000	I want to play it.
2084000	2085000	I know I still want to play it.
2085000	2086000	It's my friend's copy.
2086000	2087000	Oh.
2087000	2090000	Don't.
2090000	2091000	Anything else?
2091000	2097000	A little bit Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3 and yeah that was it.
2097000	2103000	So I didn't play a lot of new games this week but I think I might have a problem.
2103000	2105000	Because here's the thing.
2105000	2108000	So I have Mass Effect on Xbox right?
2108000	2109000	And Dark Soccer.
2109000	2110000	Oh shoot.
2110000	2115000	I know right. I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.
2115000	2118000	That's all right. No because wait till what I'm going to say next.
2118000	2126000	But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC and then Alan plays it on PC as well and he's like oh the graphics are better and da da da da da.
2126000	2127000	Which is true.
2127000	2128000	Your video card will look so nice.
2128000	2129000	Da da da.
2129000	2134000	And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.
2134000	2136000	So I was like ah all right I'll buy it.
2136000	2137000	I'll buy it.
2137000	2141000	So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again and this time I'm playing as her Renegade and da da da.
2141000	2147000	And then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99.
2147000	2150000	So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC.
2150000	2151000	That's right.
2151000	2157000	I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now.
2157000	2163000	And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long when I haven't been doing stuff for the show.
2163000	2166000	I don't feel bad anymore.
2166000	2168000	Like it is addicting.
2168000	2171000	And I got to say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war.
2171000	2172000	There's advantages to both.
2172000	2173000	There really are.
2173000	2174000	I do miss playing on my TV.
2174000	2177000	I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller.
2177000	2181000	But I got to say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse.
2181000	2187000	And that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with the controller.
2187000	2191000	But Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and mouse.
2191000	2193000	I'm so much better with it.
2193000	2199000	And like I am kicking ass with my engineers which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.
2199000	2202000	My little combat drones and setting people on fire.
2202000	2203000	It's amazing.
2203000	2204000	I'm playing in Adept.
2204000	2208000	So but I have literally bought the same game.
2208000	2210000	Same three games.
2210000	2211000	Twice.
2211000	2213000	On two different systems.
2213000	2214000	I have a problem.
2214000	2216000	Loki do I have a problem?
2216000	2218000	He's nodding yes I have a problem.
2218000	2224000	You know what Rob don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.
2224000	2231000	Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.
2231000	2233000	Alright.
2233000	2235000	Otherwise that was pretty much it as far as like making.
2235000	2240000	I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing things on the iPhone and so forth.
2240000	2241000	But not a lot of new stuff.
2241000	2243000	So that's really it for my gaming week.
2243000	2244000	Let's all and yeah.
2244000	2246000	This is the really sad part.
2246000	2247000	You ready?
2247000	2253000	Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Olenko says Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.
2253000	2256000	Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding sky.
2256000	2259000	But I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots.
2259000	2263000	Actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week.
2263000	2268000	This whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with the keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking.
2268000	2273000	Oh my God maybe I should like get into first person shooters.
2273000	2276000	What is happening to me?
2276000	2278000	Well you know how I got into PC gaming right?
2278000	2279000	What?
2279000	2280000	My hand.
2280000	2283000	Oh yeah because when your hand was was not as well.
2283000	2285000	And I'm doing all this with a trackball.
2285000	2286000	So.
2286000	2291000	But like I literally sat there today like seriously you guys have listened to the show a long time.
2291000	2292000	Many of you.
2292000	2295000	You guys on the couch you've all been listening for a long time.
2295000	2298000	I sat there looking at the PC going.
2298000	2303000	Maybe I should give battlefield a try.
2303000	2307000	Something's happening to me and I don't like it.
2307000	2309000	Suddenly I want to play first person shooter.
2309000	2311000	Are you feeling not so fresh?
2311000	2312000	This is so weird.
2312000	2315000	Like am I going to want Madden next?
2315000	2317000	Rob needs a gaming douche.
2317000	2319000	Oh my God.
2319000	2321000	Anyhow.
2321000	2322000	I think I may have to try.
2322000	2324000	I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.
2324000	2325000	Chat.
2325000	2326000	I'm going to ask chat.
2326000	2327000	Chatters.
2327000	2330000	What first person shooter should I play next?
2330000	2332000	If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer.
2332000	2334000	What first person shooter should I play next?
2334000	2338000	I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch.
2338000	2340000	Guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.
2340000	2342000	Misty how was your gaming week?
2342000	2347000	More than, it was actually more existent than I anticipated.
2347000	2350000	And even for being on a train.
2350000	2359000	StepMania oddly works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.
2359000	2365000	Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.
2365000	2369000	Dabbled at Pocket Planes a bit.
2369000	2372000	That seems to be it.
2372000	2373000	Alright.
2373000	2374000	Playing games on the train.
2374000	2376000	Going faster than the speed of light.
2376000	2377000	Not really but.
2377000	2378000	Going to our chat room.
2378000	2380000	I want to see some of the comments here.
2380000	2381000	Let's see.
2381000	2384000	Jim Sally says Battlefield on PC.
2384000	2387000	Nietzsche says Battlefield 3.
2387000	2389000	Act Def says screw that get Team Fortress 2.
2389000	2391000	I do like Team Fortress.
2391000	2392000	I have played a little Team Fortress.
2392000	2394000	That is kind of fun actually.
2394000	2397000	Because I like playing a healer in that and using the little like bandaging gun.
2397000	2398000	That's actually kind of fun.
2398000	2402000	It's like the opposite of other first person shooters where you're not shooting things.
2402000	2406000	You're like shooting them with life.
2406000	2408000	Dark Knight says Monday Night Combat.
2408000	2409000	I've heard that one's pretty good.
2409000	2411000	Drunami says Gears of War.
2411000	2413000	I see a lot of people seeing Halo.
2413000	2416000	See I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.
2416000	2418000	You guys keep shouting Halo 4.
2418000	2420000	I can't play a game that's not out yet.
2420000	2424000	I was not in love with Halo 3 I got to say.
2424000	2427000	Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny.
2427000	2429000	I do have that on Steam.
2429000	2431000	And I tried to play that for a little bit.
2431000	2432000	So maybe I should go back and do that.
2432000	2433000	Zether says Quake Live.
2433000	2435000	I do love Quake.
2435000	2436000	Quake is real good.
2436000	2438000	So thank you for the suggestion.
2438000	2441000	I second Borderlands because you like loot right?
2441000	2444000	You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?
2444000	2446000	I like loot at vognetwork.com.
2446000	2448000	Well I'm just saying that you can also.
2448000	2451000	That's basically a first person shooter with a lot of loot.
2451000	2452000	That's cool.
2452000	2453000	You like tons of weapons.
2453000	2454000	I like shinies.
2454000	2455000	It's funny.
2455000	2456000	Alright I think Borderlands might be a winner.
2456000	2457000	I'll have to check that out.
2457000	2459000	Is there multiplayer in Borderlands?
2459000	2460000	4 player co-op.
2460000	2461000	Oh sweet.
2461000	2462000	Kind of like Mass Effect.
2462000	2464000	I like co-op shooters because people are nicer on that.
2464000	2467000	Like I have yet to meet jerks on Mass Effect.
2467000	2470000	One thing that really annoyed me about Mass Effect though.
2470000	2471000	I forgot to say this.
2471000	2473000	Okay buying it on Best Buy.
2473000	2477000	Fuck that Best Buy front end program that I had to use to download it.
2477000	2479000	Because once I downloaded it.
2479000	2481000	Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.
2481000	2483000	Thank God it took my key.
2483000	2484000	I had to re-download.
2484000	2487000	I had to download 10 gigs twice.
2487000	2491000	Because that stupid Best Buy front end program can't talk to Origin.
2491000	2494000	And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.
2494000	2498000	I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.
2498000	2502000	I mean it's fucking better when it's all your games right?
2502000	2503000	But.
2503000	2507000	Yeah I was really pissed at having to download 10 gigs of stuff twice.
2507000	2508000	Anyway.
2508000	2509000	Hi JV Mon.
2509000	2510000	Sorry.
2510000	2511000	Hello.
2511000	2512000	How was your gaming week?
2512000	2513000	Pretty good.
2513000	2515000	I've been playing Vita and 3DS.
2515000	2516000	Yeah?
2516000	2517000	Yeah.
2517000	2519000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2519000	2521000	Luminous Electronic Symphony.
2521000	2524000	Pokemon Black.
2524000	2528000	And at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.
2528000	2530000	Nice.
2530000	2535000	I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.
2535000	2541000	It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.
2541000	2544000	Well I reserved a copy of Gravity Rush at work.
2544000	2548000	But the shipment never came in before I left for work the day before I flew out here.
2548000	2553000	So I'm kind of sad I didn't get to play that because the demo was so good.
2553000	2555000	You know what I need to get the demo for since you brought up 3DS.
2555000	2557000	That Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance demo.
2557000	2558000	Yes.
2558000	2559000	Yeah I want to check that out.
2559000	2560000	Bobby's talking about tonight.
2560000	2561000	I just played that too.
2561000	2562000	That was pretty good.
2562000	2563000	Nice.
2563000	2564000	Nice.
2564000	2565000	And what else have I been playing?
2565000	2568000	Civilization III even though you'd think it's terrible.
2568000	2570000	Worst one in the series but okay whatever.
2570000	2574000	Don't worry Rob everyone's allowed to be wrong.
2574000	2578000	That's right you are allowed to be wrong.
2578000	2585000	I'm just saying Civ V is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week.
2585000	2591000	Which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like 3 days later.
2591000	2594000	I'll probably check out Civ V once my boyfriend gets a better PC.
2594000	2599000	Because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization.
2599000	2600000	Okay that's cool.
2600000	2605000	Yeah I think Civilization III is like the most recent one he can run on his computer.
2605000	2613000	Oh I see it's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old for lack of a better term.
2613000	2615000	Yeah.
2615000	2616000	Alright.
2616000	2620000	Dark Tetsuya what have you been playing this week in gaming?
2620000	2625000	Not too much I mean a little dusted off the 2DS controller played a little bit of that.
2625000	2627000	We can barely hear you so I'm going to have you switch mics.
2627000	2629000	Dusted off the 2DS controller.
2629000	2633000	I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.
2633000	2636000	Let's see a little bit of StepMania.
2636000	2644000	I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play till I drop.
2644000	2653000	That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers Wii trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.
2653000	2656000	And a little bit of Mario Kart.
2656000	2662000	I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but hey that's whatever.
2662000	2667000	You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about.
2667000	2669000	Is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.
2669000	2672000	We went on an adventure to break the law.
2672000	2675000	No we thought about it but we went to Roseville Golf Land.
2675000	2679000	Which you know we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.
2679000	2682000	It is the place we all met right?
2682000	2684000	Milpitas.
2684000	2689000	Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land it gets sadder and sadder.
2689000	2692000	So Misty and I went this weekend.
2692000	2694000	It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.
2694000	2695000	Easy.
2695000	2697000	And let me put it this way.
2697000	2702000	The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like.
2702000	2710000	Oh my God they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.
2710000	2717000	I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.
2717000	2721000	So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the next two.
2721000	2723000	Didn't even touch the Disney Mix.
2723000	2725000	I played doubles on Disney Mix.
2725000	2731000	I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I played doubles on Disney Mix.
2731000	2733000	Because I'm hardcore.
2733000	2734000	Anyhow.
2734000	2735000	Alright.
2735000	2737000	That's enough for our gaming weeks.
2737000	2738000	Let's move on folks.
2738000	2740000	We got to get into the news tonight.
2740000	2741000	A little bit of housekeeping.
2741000	2745000	We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.
2745000	2748000	Part B. There's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.
2748000	2749000	Just you guys.
2749000	2751000	Emails, tweets and phone calls.
2751000	2754000	So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.
2754000	2757000	Or get the phone number down.
2757000	2759000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
2759000	2761000	We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.
2761000	2765000	But for now let's get to tonight's news.
2765000	2767000	And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.
2767000	2768000	Yes.
2768000	2769000	Let's talk about...
2769000	2771000	It's kind of a duh.
2771000	2774000	Because we knew that there was a new system coming.
2774000	2775000	Just...
2775000	2779000	We thought that would be a little something something extra on there.
2779000	2781000	But it's not.
2781000	2783000	So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.
2783000	2787000	The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS.
2787000	2788000	No duh.
2788000	2791000	And it doesn't have another circle pad.
2791000	2793000	It only has one circle pad.
2793000	2795000	What are they doing?
2795000	2800000	So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the circle pad pro and other accessories.
2800000	2801000	Like the...
2801000	2802000	I don't think it works with the...
2802000	2804000	Circle pad pro attachment?
2804000	2806000	Like the circle pad pro attachment.
2806000	2807000	Yeah.
2807000	2810000	So Nintendo really just fucked that thing didn't they?
2810000	2811000	Yeah.
2811000	2816000	It's hilarious too because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the circle pad.
2816000	2818000	Except um...
2818000	2821000	I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now.
2821000	2822000	Well...
2822000	2825000	No there probably was supposed to be a circle pad there but they didn't want to like...
2825000	2828000	Admit failure so they just said...
2828000	2830000	We'll just put it out larger.
2830000	2837000	Is it possible that they might release a circle pad pro XL and in a smart move this time not make it exclusive to one store?
2837000	2839000	So that maybe I'll get one?
2839000	2841000	So how wide is this thing gonna be?
2841000	2845000	I mean seriously if it's larger as it is I gotta add something on top of that?
2845000	2847000	It's gonna be like 4 feet long.
2847000	2848000	I mean...
2848000	2849000	It's ridiculous.
2849000	2850000	Why would we...
2850000	2854000	I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.
2854000	2860000	Well not that I would necessarily have to buy the circle pad pro because I'm not playing any games that would...
2860000	2864000	Utilize it like Resident Evil which was apparently not very great.
2864000	2866000	The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.
2866000	2871000	If you're a lefty you get a lot of use out of it especially in like Kid Icarus and some of that.
2871000	2872000	Um...
2872000	2874000	Well...
2874000	2876000	You would if you know...
2876000	2877000	You can hold on to...
2877000	2879000	Yeah if you can actually hold the thing yeah.
2879000	2880000	I...
2880000	2882000	There's a lot I like about the XL.
2882000	2889000	I mean obviously if you've played a DSi XL those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen.
2889000	2890000	You know it's really cool.
2890000	2895000	So I like the idea that there's gonna be a 3DS that's huge like that.
2895000	2899000	I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.
2899000	2903000	I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.
2903000	2904000	Um...
2904000	2909000	But yeah I mean the bigness is gonna be nice it's gonna make the games look even better.
2909000	2911000	Which is exciting but then I...
2911000	2915000	The realist in me is like dude you already have a 3DS you don't need another one.
2915000	2917000	I mean yeah it has better battery life.
2917000	2919000	Whatever there's no...
2919000	2920000	There's really no must have thing.
2920000	2927000	If you need more battery life you can buy an extra battery for like another 30 bucks instead of buying a new system for another $200.
2927000	2928000	If I...
2928000	2931000	Yeah if I didn't have a 3DS I'd buy this.
2931000	2934000	But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.
2934000	2939000	He's gonna be like Rob I want that for Christmas.
2939000	2945000	Anyways yeah the new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.
2945000	2949000	And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to...
2949000	2952000	Or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.
2952000	2960000	And apparently I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff it's actual size for you know the regular DS.
2960000	2964000	Which would be nice because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS.
2964000	2967000	Although I didn't play that many DS games so who knows.
2967000	2970000	And of course yeah price $1.99.
2970000	2974000	So August 19th.
2974000	2976000	Alrighty and that's the same day that that...
2976000	2980000	I know this isn't coming up on our show roll so we can mention here that Mario...
2980000	2986000	New Super Mario Brothers 2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game.
2986000	2988000	With the whole DLC.
2988000	2995000	Now Nintendo is like alright I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.
2995000	2997000	I guess that's kind of where things are going.
2997000	3004000	But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video this is a full featured game out of the box.
3004000	3009000	The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.
3009000	3011000	And why should I buy the DLC?
3011000	3015000	I mean I don't know they're just experimenting.
3015000	3017000	Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.
3017000	3019000	They have never been online before.
3019000	3023000	What a decade into the internet or two decades into the internet.
3023000	3026000	And this is their first time getting online.
3026000	3032000	It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.
3032000	3034000	You know some things never change.
3034000	3036000	Why is it talking to me?
3036000	3041000	It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.
3041000	3043000	Some things have to stay the same.
3043000	3046000	They need to grow up though.
3046000	3048000	Going to some comments in our chat room.
3048000	3050000	I almost said the old one there.
3050000	3053000	Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.
3053000	3060000	Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen.
3060000	3062000	So it's less pixel depth.
3062000	3064000	I'm still getting one.
3064000	3070000	YYR says I mean it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.
3070000	3077000	And I guess that's oh the whole fact about the DSi XL. What the hell is going to happen to that?
3077000	3079000	That's a good question.
3079000	3081000	Will that go down in price?
3081000	3083000	I imagine they've got to phase out the old DS.
3083000	3085000	They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May.
3085000	3088000	Might have to drop it again.
3088000	3090000	He makes a point there.
3090000	3092000	Only $30 difference.
3092000	3094000	That's going to really kill the DSi XL.
3094000	3097000	They need to put that out for $99.
3097000	3101000	Tigerclaw in chat asks a Nintendo related question.
3101000	3106000	Says Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC,
3106000	3109000	are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?
3109000	3114000	It depends what new awesome thing they're going to put on it.
3114000	3116000	You're also assuming I'm going to buy a Wii U.
3116000	3118000	I may not at this point.
3118000	3121000	It really depends on how great those games are.
3121000	3123000	So we'll see.
3123000	3127000	Let's move on to some more news. This is Nintendo related.
3127000	3132000	It's about a highly anticipated Nintendo game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
3132000	3134000	We knew that Nintendo was working on this game,
3134000	3137000	but what we didn't know that was announced this past week,
3137000	3142000	Namco Bandai is involved, and Bandai Namco both ways.
3142000	3145000	Both those studios are helping on the game.
3145000	3149000	Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.
3149000	3155000	Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.
3155000	3157000	That's interesting.
3157000	3160000	Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.
3160000	3163000	And for the haters, I just want to remind you,
3163000	3166000	the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega,
3166000	3171000	we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.
3171000	3175000	So, but then I think, all right,
3175000	3178000	but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.
3178000	3180000	The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M.
3180000	3183000	I didn't dislike it as much as other people did,
3183000	3186000	but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M.
3186000	3189000	So what do you guys think? Namco Bandai is involved now.
3189000	3191000	I think that means it's pretty obvious.
3191000	3194000	We're going to see some Namco characters show up now
3194000	3199000	as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake
3199000	3201000	and all those characters before.
3201000	3203000	We're going to get what? We'll have Pac-Man.
3203000	3206000	What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari to Mashi,
3206000	3209000	although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?
3209000	3212000	Or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?
3212000	3215000	There was supposed to be a DS version, but I don't think they ever made it.
3215000	3217000	So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.
3217000	3219000	What? Maybe from the Tales games? I don't know.
3219000	3221000	I might be stretching here, but what?
3221000	3222000	They could still do the Prince.
3222000	3224000	Pac-Man's going to eat him up, yum, yum.
3224000	3225000	That's true.
3225000	3229000	Just because, you know, they could do this stuff from the old school Namco games.
3229000	3232000	Mm-hmm. Like really old school games?
3232000	3233000	Like Dig Dug.
3233000	3236000	Yeah, Dig Dug. The Digger? Actually, that could be really bad
3236000	3238000	if they have a character in the game called Digger.
3238000	3240000	That could be very bad.
3240000	3241000	Mr. Driller.
3241000	3243000	Oh, Mr. Driller. That's even better.
3243000	3244000	Mm-hmm.
3244000	3247000	Or maybe Mitsurugi.
3247000	3249000	Vandy in our chat room suggests his pole position.
3249000	3252000	LocoPoco suggests Klonoa.
3252000	3253000	Yes!
3253000	3254000	That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?
3254000	3255000	And they'll have Hupal.
3255000	3257000	Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube.
3257000	3259000	Or, excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least, had one game.
3259000	3260000	And the Wii.
3260000	3261000	And the Wii?
3261000	3262000	Yeah.
3262000	3263000	I guess that could happen. There you go.
3263000	3267000	But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie?
3267000	3268000	Mm.
3268000	3271000	From that game that never came out in the U.S.
3271000	3277000	What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Brothers being developed by Namco, in part?
3277000	3280000	JVMon, aren't you a Smash Brothers fan?
3280000	3284000	Yeah, but it's not gonna come out for, like, another five years,
3284000	3286000	so it's no point getting excited for it now.
3286000	3288000	Good point. Let's move on.
3288000	3290000	Darth Zakra.
3290000	3294000	Garris. I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.
3294000	3300000	The Extended Cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360, on June 26th,
3300000	3306000	and on the 4th of July, which means it's already out for those two platforms,
3306000	3308000	and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.
3308000	3309000	By the way, just tangent.
3309000	3312000	Actually, it's not already out, because that's my birthday.
3312000	3313000	My birthday's Tuesday.
3313000	3316000	Sorry, brain. I'm a week ahead, Rob. I'm a week ahead.
3316000	3317000	That's all right.
3317000	3320000	But, by the time some of these people download it, you know.
3320000	3321000	That's true.
3321000	3326000	But, by the way, what the hell, 4th of July on a Wednesday, anyway.
3326000	3334000	So, it's going to expand on the events at the end of Mass Effect 3 through, quote,
3334000	3338000	additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.
3338000	3342000	And there's another quote on here on how to access it.
3342000	3347000	To experience the Extended Cut, load a save game from before the attack on the Cerberus base,
3347000	3349000	and play through to the end of the game.
3349000	3352000	I had to do my, uh, sorry.
3352000	3354000	Welcome to, no.
3354000	3355000	Welcome to the Citadel.
3355000	3356000	Stop.
3356000	3357000	Sorry.
3357000	3361000	No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the Consort.
3361000	3363000	She just sounded so perky.
3363000	3365000	You know what's interesting to me, though, Jamie, is that, you know,
3365000	3366000	you're a new Mass Effect fan.
3366000	3370000	Kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough
3370000	3374000	where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.
3374000	3378000	Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending.
3378000	3382000	So, my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first,
3382000	3385000	or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your ending?
3385000	3390000	I think I want to go into the Extended Cut just because of how much of the original was spoiled for me.
3390000	3395000	And it's partly my fault because I watched the damn video, you know, the music video,
3395000	3397000	which I don't even remember which one it was now.
3397000	3403000	But I think that I would like to go through and see it, have that be my experience,
3403000	3409000	and see if I'm still pissed off, and then go back and watch the other one.
3409000	3411000	Because I can always YouTube the other endings.
3411000	3416000	And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently like nobody else,
3416000	3420000	like the one where everyone gets all mixed up.
3420000	3422000	Black Lab is in chat. Puppy.
3422000	3423000	Puppy.
3423000	3424000	Yeah, I saw him earlier.
3424000	3425000	Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.
3425000	3426000	We got to fix that.
3426000	3428000	Yeah, what's up with that, dude?
3428000	3430000	Lost Puppy.
3430000	3438000	Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.
3438000	3440000	Well, didn't you hear? It's my birthday.
3440000	3446000	And it's all the game companies rewarding me for talking grand about all three of these games on Orange Laundry.
3446000	3449000	No, I don't know what it is. It is a crazy day for DLC.
3449000	3454000	I know Alan is really torn because he's both a Skyrim and a Mass Effect 3 fan.
3454000	3458000	I think he'll go for Mass Effect 3 first because that's the one he doesn't have to pay for.
3458000	3460000	Well.
3460000	3461000	We'll see.
3461000	3464000	To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.
3464000	3469000	The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.
3469000	3477000	So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.
3477000	3481000	Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.
3481000	3484000	No. There's no way it's going to be that.
3484000	3487000	I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.
3487000	3494000	The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.
3494000	3501000	So that means there's like 20% what of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.
3501000	3505000	So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.
3505000	3510000	It kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned.
3510000	3513000	And rushed the ending.
3513000	3522000	Because I had been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing.
3522000	3529000	I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody.
3529000	3532000	Which I kind of believe, I mean, I don't know what to believe.
3532000	3539000	There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.
3539000	3542000	You know, I just, I'm hopeful for the DLC.
3542000	3545000	I did not hate the ending as is.
3545000	3556000	I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole, I mean, the let down for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.
3556000	3558000	Maybe you get a two second scene.
3558000	3561000	A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.
3561000	3563000	I mean, it's very little.
3563000	3565000	That's the part that got me.
3565000	3568000	I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.
3568000	3573000	I understand that there's some things they want to close up.
3573000	3577000	That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.
3577000	3578000	I understand that.
3578000	3582000	I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.
3582000	3586000	I just, you know, and I think there's some people that are mad about that.
3586000	3589000	They want the same universe to continue and so forth.
3589000	3592000	My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.
3592000	3595000	What are all those people going to eat?
3595000	3596000	You can't eat Earth food.
3596000	3598000	Each other.
3598000	3599000	I mean.
3599000	3602000	Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.
3602000	3603000	No.
3603000	3607000	I'm just thinking of all, they're going to have a long road home.
3607000	3609000	And then all the other people who can't get home.
3609000	3611000	That's just very sad.
3611000	3614000	All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending.
3614000	3616000	That's all I left it at, Rob.
3616000	3619000	Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.
3619000	3620000	All right.
3620000	3623000	So this is, I'm kind of surprised by this.
3623000	3629000	You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney.
3629000	3634000	Later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games.
3634000	3639000	Plus, they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.
3639000	3644000	Well, interesting enough, the game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.
3644000	3649000	It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.
3649000	3651000	And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.
3651000	3654000	So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.
3654000	3658000	But that would be the case, so I don't know.
3658000	3662000	Very interesting. But that is coming out later on this fall.
3662000	3665000	That is interesting.
3665000	3672000	Especially if, you know, the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.
3672000	3679000	My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii, like, DS and 3DS versions right now.
3679000	3685000	And then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version.
3685000	3687000	Then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.
3687000	3690000	That makes way too much sense.
3690000	3693000	Well, they definitely won't be doing that.
3693000	3697000	How dare you bring logic into this show!
3697000	3699000	How dare you.
3699000	3701000	It's very possible that they may not.
3701000	3705000	I mean, like, Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July and they cut out the PS3.
3705000	3709000	So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.
3709000	3714000	YYR in chat says, Activision would release on every platform if possible. There must be some sort of deal.
3714000	3717000	Well, just like I said, no. I don't think so.
3717000	3725000	Because if they think that it's only going to reach the kind of children demographic, then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.
3725000	3729000	Alright, let's talk about a remake.
3729000	3732000	There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.
3732000	3735000	This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.
3735000	3737000	It's Okami HD.
3737000	3741000	Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.
3741000	3745000	I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling. How do we please them?
3745000	3749000	So they're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.
3749000	3751000	It's full 1080p HD.
3751000	3755000	It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.
3755000	3761000	It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced on Twitter and of course on YouTube.
3761000	3764000	It is going to be launching. This is the really interesting part.
3764000	3770000	It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen. That's about 50 bucks.
3770000	3777000	In the US, Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.
3777000	3782000	Haha, we get a deal. Sorry, Japan.
3782000	3784000	But that is awesome.
3784000	3787000	Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.
3787000	3792000	Yeah, you never know. The one in Japan might come with like, I don't know, stickers.
3792000	3795000	Box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark.
3795000	3798000	Maybe a soundtrack or something extra.
3798000	3800000	Now, now, now. It was only...
3800000	3802000	Oh, that was the Wii version.
3802000	3804000	I thought it was the...
3804000	3810000	There was something with the DS Okami-din, I think, that had some funky with that too.
3810000	3812000	Maybe the box art. I don't know.
3812000	3816000	It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30. That was a Bubble Bobble game.
3816000	3821000	You know what's funny? This is one of those games I never really got around to playing.
3821000	3824000	I missed it. I played a demo. That was about it.
3824000	3826000	But I really wanted to try this out.
3826000	3830000	And I think the price of 20 bucks, download online, is a great place to see this.
3830000	3834000	And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons
3834000	3838000	between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer.
3838000	3843000	And it looks great. When they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.
3843000	3846000	There's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in the studio.
3846000	3852000	And then it goes, oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color. It's great.
3852000	3856000	So, yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.
3856000	3859000	And trophies for your E-peen.
3859000	3863000	Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates.
3863000	3867000	And just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which, yes, of course, we have one tonight.
3867000	3869000	Dark Sakura, first up with some news.
3869000	3871000	How about some Blizzard stuff?
3871000	3876000	This actually, they're clarifying the restrictions on the Diablo 3 players.
3876000	3886000	Basically, patch 1.0.3 has new measures in it to make sure that players have to wait up to 72 hours
3886000	3889000	before they can access the whole game.
3889000	3892000	So they're trying to make it more secure.
3892000	3897000	And the quote here says, for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service,
3897000	3903000	players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete
3903000	3906000	before they can access certain game features.
3906000	3911000	So basically, it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW,
3911000	3918000	where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.
3918000	3921000	So here's the official list.
3921000	3926000	No public game access for unverified digiter, digital purchasers.
3926000	3931000	No auction house access, real money, or gold for unverified digital purchasers.
3931000	3935000	Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.
3935000	3940000	Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.
3940000	3943000	Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests,
3943000	3947000	but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.
3947000	3951000	Global play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.
3951000	3962000	But they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and Level 13.
3962000	3972000	Well, I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house, especially when real money's at stake.
3972000	3977000	But that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online.
3977000	3981000	And it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way.
3981000	3985000	But my god, this real money auction house is really a lot of hassle.
3985000	3989000	You know, that auction house has really fucked this game up.
3989000	3993000	I mean, it's the reason why we have to be connected all the time, even in single player,
3993000	3995000	and why all those launch problems happen,
3995000	4000000	and now it's the reason why you can't even truly buy the game online unless there's a wait period.
4000000	4004000	And granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it,
4004000	4009000	because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3,
4009000	4011000	and then, you know, they're doing that.
4011000	4015000	But I don't know. God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.
4015000	4017000	I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.
4017000	4022000	But yet Diablo 3 is a huge game. Huge, huge game. Go figure.
4022000	4025000	SHJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
4025000	4029000	Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.
4029000	4033000	So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming, it sounds like.
4033000	4037000	Hmm. Interesting.
4037000	4041000	DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.
4041000	4046000	I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans,
4046000	4049000	and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.
4049000	4052000	Is it really a damning number or no?
4052000	4056000	Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?
4056000	4062000	So, you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.
4062000	4065000	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates
4065000	4069000	and some things that are coming to a game store near you.
4069000	4071000	This week we've got a few things.
4071000	4075000	Starting off with Spec Ops The Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4075000	4079000	London 2012 Olympics on PS3 and 360.
4079000	4085000	Also, Dead Island Game of the Year edition on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4085000	4091000	The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS.
4091000	4094000	Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360.
4094000	4097000	And... that's it.
4097000	4103000	I hope that Amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.
4103000	4104000	The game looks pretty good though.
4104000	4105000	Really?
4105000	4109000	The game is done by, was it Benox? I think they're the guys that did the last two games.
4109000	4112000	It's open world and it looks pretty awesome.
4112000	4116000	The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.
4116000	4120000	I was watching the YouTube interview with him.
4120000	4123000	I was just like, what the fuck is that?
4123000	4125000	It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.
4125000	4127000	Yeah, you're the creator of the game.
4127000	4130000	Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man. Okay.
4130000	4132000	He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.
4132000	4136000	I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.
4136000	4139000	Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.
4139000	4141000	Hurry before he dies.
4141000	4142000	Seriously?
4142000	4146000	Let's be real, the celebrities we love, they're getting older.
4146000	4151000	Him and Morgan Freeman, man. They just keep the old people and get them acting more.
4151000	4153000	They should do a buddy comedy.
4153000	4154000	Morgan Freeman.
4154000	4156000	And Adam West.
4156000	4158000	I don't know. Maybe.
4158000	4160000	It's just cool old bastards.
4160000	4161000	Cool old bastards.
4161000	4166000	You know what? Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold.
4166000	4170000	And apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.
4170000	4174000	Nice.
4174000	4178000	Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.
4178000	4182000	On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners.
4182000	4184000	Cricket, cricket.
4184000	4187000	Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction.
4187000	4191000	But a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.
4191000	4192000	I've never heard of that company.
4192000	4194000	But that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
4194000	4196000	I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.
4196000	4200000	This looks like it's another, I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.
4200000	4205000	What the hell? Wait a minute. It's like, yay, little girls are happy and dah dah dah dah dah.
4205000	4210000	And she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on.
4210000	4212000	And then, robots!
4212000	4214000	So Neon Genesis.
4214000	4216000	I don't know what the hell that is.
4216000	4219000	What is that that it comes with? Look at that.
4219000	4220000	It's a microphone.
4220000	4221000	Cosplay pieces.
4221000	4223000	Howdy partner.
4223000	4226000	Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together.
4226000	4228000	In our school uniforms.
4228000	4229000	What the fuck is this?
4229000	4231000	Pointing!
4231000	4233000	Giant mecha rancher.
4233000	4235000	Look at my finger.
4235000	4237000	I don't understand.
4237000	4241000	That one she's pointing and the look on everybody's face is like, oh my god.
4241000	4243000	It's like she's saying, who wants to smell my finger?
4243000	4244000	Are you sure that's a chick?
4244000	4249000	Yes, but if she had yellow ribbon in her hair I'd be like, is Haruhi?
4249000	4251000	I don't know.
4251000	4252000	Let's see.
4252000	4259000	Zether in chat explains, Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.
4259000	4262000	Oh, well that explains everything. I'm so fucking angry.
4262000	4263000	Have you ever heard of Steins Gate?
4263000	4264000	Oh, you have?
4264000	4265000	Yeah.
4265000	4266000	Explain it to me.
4266000	4268000	I just heard of it. I don't know what the hell it is.
4268000	4270000	I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.
4270000	4273000	There is a book report due Sunday.
4275000	4277000	This is why I love having a chat room.
4277000	4280000	They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.
4280000	4286000	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection.
4286000	4289000	Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well.
4289000	4291000	Atlier Aisha.
4291000	4296000	Kokon no Daichi no Rekonjutsu in regular and premium flavors.
4296000	4300000	And I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3.
4300000	4302000	But Dot Hack.
4302000	4306000	Sekai no Mukoni plus versus hybrid pack.
4306000	4307000	What is this?
4307000	4310000	Is this like the whole... Oh, it's a movie.
4310000	4311000	Oh, okay. I get it.
4311000	4314000	It's the movie and the fighting game.
4314000	4315000	That's what this is.
4315000	4317000	It's a bundle pack there.
4317000	4321000	Wouldn't it be weird if they did Dot Hack MMO?
4321000	4323000	That would be very good.
4326000	4328000	Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2 though.
4328000	4330000	Have they done one on PlayStation 3?
4330000	4331000	I don't think they have.
4331000	4333000	This is the closest we get is a fighting game.
4333000	4334000	Alright, well.
4334000	4337000	Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then...
4337000	4339000	I guess anything's possible.
4339000	4341000	Taking a look quickly at the PlayStation Vita,
4341000	4343000	Metal Gear Solid HD Edition comes out in Japan this week.
4343000	4345000	I know that's one people will be looking forward to.
4345000	4348000	And there will be a crystal white PlayStation Vita.
4348000	4351000	Because, you know, who doesn't love more colors for their handhelds?
4351000	4354000	Speaking of companies that love colors for their handhelds,
4354000	4356000	on the Nintendo 3DS this week,
4356000	4358000	Cult Sept comes out in Japan.
4358000	4360000	I love this series.
4360000	4362000	And it's like a cult series.
4362000	4364000	A lot of people don't play it here, but Cult Sept is like,
4364000	4366000	it's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
4366000	4368000	Yeah, you know this series?
4368000	4370000	Yes, I love this game. I'm importing it.
4370000	4372000	I didn't even know it was coming out.
4372000	4374000	Did you know they have one on the 360?
4374000	4378000	Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.
4378000	4380000	Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.
4380000	4383000	Uh oh, Rob's going to get it.
4386000	4388000	Uh oh.
4388000	4392000	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
4392000	4395000	Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.
4395000	4399000	Two people in the world, old Cult Sept saga on the Xbox 360.
4399000	4401000	Well, they're you and I have a friend to play with.
4401000	4404000	I do, yay, we're friends, yay.
4406000	4408000	Are you my Xbox 360 friend?
4408000	4410000	Friends.
4410000	4412000	Friends.
4412000	4414000	Aww, that's so sweet.
4414000	4416000	They still haven't removed that 100 person limit,
4416000	4421000	even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago,
4421000	4423000	so they could do that. Yeah.
4423000	4427000	Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?
4427000	4429000	How about the Wii? Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?
4429000	4430000	Yes.
4430000	4431000	People still do the Wii.
4431000	4434000	One game, and it's called Zero.
4434000	4437000	Shinku no Chul comes out this week,
4437000	4441000	and it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly,
4441000	4443000	and it's like a ghost scary game.
4443000	4444000	Oh, this is a scary game.
4444000	4447000	Wait, crimson butterfly, that sounds familiar.
4447000	4449000	Was that a...
4449000	4450000	That's a Wii game?
4450000	4452000	Those graphics are pretty good for a Wii game,
4452000	4454000	unless that's a cutscene.
4454000	4456000	Crimson butterfly, that sounds awfully familiar.
4456000	4457000	Yeah, it does.
4457000	4459000	Fatal frame? Oh, is this a fatal...
4459000	4460000	Oh.
4460000	4462000	No, there was one, it was a PS...
4462000	4464000	I'm thinking maybe it was a PS3 game,
4464000	4468000	it was a PlayStation Network download thing, I don't know.
4468000	4471000	Well, regardless, that is out on the Wii this week, so there you go.
4471000	4474000	Let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.
4474000	4476000	But I want biscuits.
4476000	4479000	Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.
4479000	4481000	It's part of the Fatal Frame series.
4481000	4484000	Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.
4484000	4485000	Okay.
4485000	4489000	On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.
4489000	4492000	You know, that means dro.
4492000	4498000	27th, we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD Collection on PS3,
4498000	4501000	and the Dark Side Chronicles HD for PS3.
4501000	4504000	The 29th, Harvest Moon, The Tale of Two Towns,
4504000	4506000	because we can't have enough sheep and cows.
4506000	4508000	Mini Ninja...
4508000	4512000	I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it
4512000	4514000	when that is totally incorrect.
4514000	4516000	So I am not going to say it the way it is on the box,
4516000	4519000	it's Mini Ninja Adventures.
4519000	4524000	Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection,
4524000	4526000	Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir,
4526000	4528000	Spec Ops The Line,
4528000	4530000	and The Amazing Spider-Man.
4530000	4532000	Spider-Man!
4532000	4534000	Alright.
4534000	4537000	A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week,
4537000	4540000	and I've been assured that Dark Sakura has picked a special game
4540000	4542000	for the classic game of the week this week.
4542000	4544000	But first, Loki!
4544000	4548000	So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.
4548000	4550000	Good for him!
4550000	4552000	Get off that sinking ship.
4552000	4557000	Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday,
4557000	4562000	and basically just, you know,
4562000	4566000	I don't know, just moving on to better things.
4566000	4568000	And, you know, he said,
4568000	4570000	both as individuals and as a group,
4570000	4574000	you know, you have taught me more than I could have ever thought possible,
4574000	4578000	and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.
4578000	4583000	That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.
4583000	4586000	Okay, maybe I made it up to the last part.
4586000	4594000	Could this be the very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?
4594000	4596000	I don't know.
4596000	4598000	Yes!
4598000	4600000	I don't know. I mean, honestly,
4600000	4603000	I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games,
4603000	4605000	but it's a team that puts that stuff together.
4605000	4607000	It's not just one dude, so...
4607000	4609000	He's not the only guy, too.
4609000	4611000	We just had a story last week about, you know,
4611000	4613000	other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.
4613000	4615000	Yeah, I probably saw that and didn't want to be worked to death,
4615000	4618000	so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.
4618000	4619000	Did he say where he went?
4619000	4620000	No.
4620000	4622000	It could be interesting to see where he ends up.
4622000	4624000	That's the part of the story I want to know.
4624000	4627000	What did he leave for another opportunity,
4627000	4631000	or did he leave because he would rather go work,
4631000	4635000	like, at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?
4635000	4637000	I'd be very curious to know that.
4637000	4642000	He's going to work on the Phantom where he never has to touch video games again.
4642000	4644000	All right.
4644000	4647000	This is one of those stories that I think slipped under the radar
4647000	4650000	for a lot of people, but I think this is actually a huge deal.
4650000	4652000	So I want to talk about this a little bit,
4652000	4654000	and this is a story that was on Game Politics,
4654000	4656000	but, you know, it probably was on some other websites, too,
4656000	4658000	and it's about Tetris.
4658000	4660000	That's right, a game that is...
4660000	4662000	How many years old is Tetris now? It was done in the 80s or so,
4662000	4664000	so it's a very old game, but...
4664000	4666000	At least as old as you are.
4666000	4668000	One of the best...
4668000	4670000	Well, technically, that's true.
4670000	4672000	This is true.
4672000	4674000	It's not...
4674000	4676000	Hi!
4676000	4678000	It's older than the show.
4678000	4680000	Hi!
4680000	4682000	Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.
4682000	4684000	All right, moving on.
4684000	4690000	I got ferreted.
4690000	4692000	That felt good after ten years.
4692000	4697000	All right, so the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court
4697000	4699000	against a clone game,
4699000	4702000	and, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these,
4702000	4704000	and it's out of control,
4704000	4706000	because Apple doesn't...
4706000	4708000	The people that are screening the games don't necessarily know
4708000	4710000	what intellectual property is what,
4710000	4713000	although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out,
4713000	4714000	but, you know, what stuff...
4714000	4717000	Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or...
4717000	4720000	Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was, like, the number one thing,
4720000	4724000	and all it was was an app that was, like, pictures of Pokemon or something?
4724000	4727000	Pokemon, and the gold is going in my pocket.
4727000	4729000	That's right. Pokemon, give me your money.
4729000	4733000	Anyhow, Xio Interactive made this game called Mino,
4733000	4736000	and they said it was inspired by Tetris,
4736000	4738000	but when the Tetris company found the game,
4738000	4742000	they sued Xio for copyright infringement in New Jersey,
4742000	4744000	and during the legal fight...
4744000	4746000	Xio, Xio? I don't know. I'll say Xio.
4746000	4749000	Xio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.
4749000	4752000	Rules cannot be covered by copyright.
4752000	4756000	Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets,
4756000	4759000	so this game infringed on the copyrights,
4759000	4764000	which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris,
4764000	4766000	and we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs,
4766000	4771000	but the difference is Xio was, like, a fucking copy, right?
4771000	4776000	So in the ruling, the judge basically says,
4776000	4780000	here's what is and what isn't copyright.
4780000	4785000	The judge says the basic rulesets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.
4785000	4789000	He says the basic ruleset of Tetris is not copyrightable,
4789000	4793000	as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen
4793000	4795000	and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board
4795000	4801000	is not an idea you can copyright, hence Dr. Mario.
4801000	4803000	You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier,
4803000	4806000	but I am now, since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.
4806000	4810000	Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen
4810000	4815000	that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?
4815000	4817000	It would be interesting to te- I mean, now-
4817000	4821000	Well, according to some court cases against two competing games,
4821000	4823000	they were very similar like that.
4823000	4825000	It was settled. It never went to court, did it?
4825000	4827000	I believe it was settled.
4827000	4829000	So anyway, I'm just curious.
4829000	4830000	The world will never know.
4830000	4832000	Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I-
4832000	4834000	Does that mean it's old?
4834000	4837000	But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario,
4837000	4840000	as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.
4840000	4841000	And I'm sure all of us go,
4841000	4845000	okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously,
4845000	4849000	Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing,
4849000	4850000	but it's not Tetris.
4850000	4853000	Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but you know, I digress.
4853000	4856000	Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?
4856000	4859000	It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's-
4859000	4864000	Yeah, anyway, but Xayo, according to the judge, copied more than this.
4864000	4867000	They copied the exact dimensions of the play area,
4867000	4869000	the shape, the color of the pieces,
4869000	4873000	I didn't even know that was a thing that was consistent in Tetris,
4873000	4875000	and other mechanics.
4875000	4878000	Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.
4878000	4881000	The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games
4881000	4884000	that showed that they were identical.
4884000	4887000	They said that Xayo altered enough of the game,
4887000	4890000	oh, I'm sorry, the judge said that if Xayo had altered enough of the game,
4890000	4895000	like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior,
4895000	4899000	it would have avoided this whole mess in the first place.
4899000	4901000	So what does this mean?
4901000	4903000	And again, going off the article at gamepolitics.com,
4903000	4905000	they say, not much.
4905000	4910000	The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.
4910000	4913000	So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.
4913000	4916000	This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court,
4916000	4918000	which means it could change.
4918000	4921000	But let's imagine, according to game politics here,
4921000	4923000	that it did have varying across the U.S.
4923000	4926000	Would it help people against the fight for other clone games?
4926000	4929000	It says not likely because the ruling is narrow in scope.
4929000	4933000	It's a win for Tetris, but it's a win for outright clones
4933000	4936000	as opposed to heavy inspiration clones.
4936000	4941000	And they go on to say, tiny tower versus dream heights? Nope.
4941000	4944000	Radical fishing versus ninja fishing? Nope.
4944000	4946000	Even though some of us sit here and go,
4946000	4949000	Zinga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to tiny tower.
4949000	4956000	But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.
4956000	4962000	Well, Zinga is smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties.
4962000	4966000	And they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this.
4966000	4969000	And you're gold.
4969000	4972000	And Game Guru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
4972000	4976000	it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.
4976000	4979000	No, that is a good thing.
4979000	4981000	YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says,
4981000	4984000	the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days,
4984000	4986000	including the color of each piece.
4986000	4989000	I never realized that. Crazy.
4989000	4991000	Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating,
4991000	4997000	especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network,
4997000	4999000	you know, the store and all that.
4999000	5002000	So, yeah, there you go. We'll see what happens in the future.
5002000	5006000	I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.
5006000	5012000	But of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.
5012000	5017000	Speaking of years and years and years and years,
5017000	5023000	every week here on the show, Dark Soccer likes to spotlight the classic game of the week.
5023000	5025000	All of which I'm older than.
5025000	5029000	A game from the archives that Dark Soccer says,
5029000	5033000	hey, you should be respecting this game and you should play this game.
5033000	5036000	And for the tenth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio,
5036000	5040000	I'm sure Dark Soccer has picked something very special tonight.
5040000	5043000	Dark Soccer, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
5043000	5046000	Pong. No.
5046000	5048000	Could have been. Pong would have been a good choice.
5048000	5049000	No, it wouldn't.
5049000	5051000	All right.
5051000	5055000	Boop. No. Beatmania 2DX.
5055000	5056000	A good choice.
5056000	5063000	Because with as crazy about DDR as we were, Beatmania was really our thing, don't you think?
5063000	5067000	Beatmania 2DX was the one that would give you a boner, yeah.
5067000	5071000	And I have to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.
5071000	5074000	I started with a little game called BM98,
5074000	5083000	which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.
5083000	5087000	So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.
5087000	5089000	Pollock.
5089000	5091000	It's a Beatmania 2DX song.
5091000	5093000	Heck yeah. Heck yeah.
5093000	5096000	This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.
5096000	5103000	So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.
5103000	5109000	And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.
5109000	5113000	And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.
5113000	5116000	So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.
5116000	5119000	If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?
5119000	5125000	But you have two extra keys than the original five key Beatmania.
5125000	5132000	And your turntable is on the opposite side depending on what side you're playing on.
5132000	5135000	So this has started right side pride and left side pride.
5135000	5138000	A lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.
5138000	5140000	Ooh, good for you. I play right side.
5140000	5143000	Left side pride, weakling.
5143000	5149000	And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.
5149000	5157000	But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.
5157000	5163000	Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.
5163000	5165000	Or me.
5165000	5167000	Lisa.
5167000	5169000	You're a girl.
5169000	5171000	D'Artessio over there says Lisu.
5171000	5173000	I don't remember him. Yeah.
5173000	5182000	So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.
5182000	5187000	There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time and a backspin scratch.
5187000	5191000	So you have to scratch directionally.
5191000	5194000	For difficulty, you go from one to seven.
5194000	5198000	And then in fifth style, you had a flashing seven that was the highest difficulty.
5198000	5202000	With 10 style, you actually had level eight.
5202000	5206000	And then an eight plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.
5206000	5210000	With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.
5210000	5213000	So it's getting way past me.
5213000	5217000	I think the last one that I was really into was eight style.
5217000	5220000	Which I think was the last one I bought.
5220000	5222000	Which we're looking at right now.
5222000	5224000	Yeah.
5224000	5234000	Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.
5234000	5236000	Ooh.
5236000	5243000	And also seventh style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage.
5243000	5247000	Which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song.
5247000	5252000	And then 13 Distorted had multiple extra stage songs.
5252000	5258000	Gold had two different ones. The 1ES and the 1OMES.
5258000	5260000	So yeah, it was really getting crazy there.
5260000	5262000	Like where else can I go with it?
5262000	5266000	As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.
5266000	5277000	It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller, and the effector.
5277000	5280000	So basically you could control what it sounded like.
5280000	5284000	Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?
5284000	5286000	Yeah, to make it really noisy.
5286000	5288000	So you could hear it over every freaking thing else.
5288000	5292000	Can I admit something here real quick? Not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.
5292000	5295000	Watching this video is making me very nostalgic, I have to admit.
5295000	5300000	No, it really does. I really miss playing this game, especially in the arcades and stuff.
5300000	5304000	I mean, yeah, I could try to go dig up my own version, but shit, my controller probably wouldn't even work anymore.
5304000	5307000	I don't even know if my Japanese PlayStation 2 works.
5307000	5311000	You have problems trying to hook them up to newer HDTVs anyway.
5311000	5314000	You have to find the song that got me into your beat.
5314000	5315000	What song is that?
5315000	5316000	Ultra High Heels.
5316000	5317000	Oh really?
5317000	5318000	I can do that.
5318000	5322000	I beat the hell out of that song, because I freaking loved it.
5322000	5325000	But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.
5325000	5333000	Also the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs, so you could see the song information and titles while you played.
5333000	5335000	Yeah, turn this up.
5341000	5344000	This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.
5344000	5347000	It's just for me, I mean, even if...
5347000	5351000	A lot of people were like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they were just songs that were fun.
5351000	5359000	So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.
5359000	5371000	As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever, A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.
5371000	5381000	Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.
5381000	5393000	You also had, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.
5393000	5407000	All kinds of really, really good artists, not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.
5407000	5415000	Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.
5415000	5426000	There were, they put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.
5426000	5436000	As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller, so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play.
5436000	5444000	There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller, and it would not work. They wouldn't take my credit card.
5444000	5449000	I tried. I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan who was going to ship it to me. It didn't work.
5449000	5452000	One time I got Dan to agree to this. Oh, I was so pissed.
5452000	5459000	But there are aftermarket arcade style controllers that you can get, and tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.
5459000	5472000	For all the different music, I mean you had it from, we just heard some Eurobeat, we have different types of dance, we had, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions I'd like to say.
5472000	5476000	Some crap songs in the earlier version too.
5476000	5486000	As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced lingle? I guess. 600 songs.
5486000	5487000	Dingle.
5487000	5488000	Dingle.
5488000	5492000	Dongle. Maybe a 2DX19 dongle edition.
5492000	5494000	Awesome. I support that.
5494000	5506000	Basically the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD, so for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit. Like I said, hard drive.
5506000	5528000	So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tram, who is the little alien chick with white hair, we have Yamatotora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.
5528000	5530000	Try saying that a few times fast.
5530000	5540000	I mean, there's basically a lot of cool characters, and you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like who did the DJs.
5540000	5547000	Like Eriki, QJack, Nix, all of them. I freaking...
5547000	5551000	And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.
5551000	5561000	In fact, I've actually got an issue of Cosmode that has its all 2DX cosplay. So Celica, all of that.
5561000	5569000	So anyway, there you go. You may need a 2DX. If you don't know what it is after listening to this show, climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears.
5569000	5571000	There it is.
5571000	5575000	My man. I love you, Taku.
5575000	5577000	This song was so much fun to play.
5577000	5579000	I want to have lots of Tran babies with you.
5579000	5581000	That is a...
5581000	5582000	Not really.
5582000	5589000	A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Laundrio. BeatMania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.
5589000	5590000	Yeah.
5590000	5591000	Just kidding.
5591000	5592000	Dongle style.
5592000	5594000	Dongle style. 2DX dongle style.
5594000	5600000	Alright, that does it for part A of our show. But don't go anywhere, guys. We have part B coming up.
5600000	5604000	And guess what? No news. Part B is all about you guys tonight.
5604000	5608000	That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundrio is with you guys.
5608000	5610000	We'll friend your butt.
5610000	5612000	Alright.
5612000	5617000	But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news. We do have some news standing by if we need to.
5617000	5620000	Otherwise, Loke, you'll just run through it quick. It's a last minute thing.
5620000	5623000	But we're hoping to get some calls here in part B.
5623000	5629000	But first, a break. Don't go anywhere. We got to save part A in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.
5629000	5639000	So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th style.
5639000	5643000	And for those of you guys listening live tonight, I'm very sorry we don't have a music break tonight.
5643000	5649000	But we do have clip show. That's right. Ten minutes worth of clips here during our break tonight.
5649000	5654000	And I want to thank Dark Tetsuya for scouring the internet and finding some of these clips from the OLR archive.
5654000	5656000	I want to tell you guys, a lot of this shit is fucking old.
5656000	5661000	Like most of this, I think the newest clip in here is from episode 148.
5661000	5667000	Otherwise, this shit is old. And it starts with a clip from episode number one.
5667000	5673000	And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed.
5673000	5675000	And it's a parody on this show.
5675000	5678000	Oh, yes. Here we go. We'll be back after this.
5678000	5679000	I hate you.
5679000	5684000	That's right. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are live on our very first broadcast.
5684000	5685000	How's it feel, Jamie?
5685000	5688000	It feels like burning.
5688000	5689000	My thoughts exactly.
5689000	5696000	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.
5696000	5701000	So we thought we'd tape the show a little early. So it's actually Wednesday night. We're at Golf Land.
5701000	5705000	But we are taping live. No do-overs. It's just like it was a live show.
5705000	5708000	So what do we want to do? We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land.
5708000	5710000	I don't want to do anybody publicly.
5710000	5711000	Do you want to?
5711000	5715000	I'm holding adventure stuff. Who wants to hold my wood?
5715000	5720000	Thank you for volunteering for that. We just got a funny. Hi.
5720000	5724000	Oh, we're doing a school project. Yeah.
5724000	5729000	For.
5729000	5733000	No, we're doing an online radio program. So we have an Internet radio show.
5733000	5736000	Would you like to say some words for our listeners?
5736000	5743000	Actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.
5743000	5745000	Oh, we're just recording ourselves.
5745000	5749000	God damn it, Rob. These things burn at a thousand degrees. I feel like burning heat.
5749000	5754000	While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot. I'm going to do my next shot here. This is some hot damn.
5754000	5757000	So cheers. I'm going to toast Loki's water here.
5757000	5765000	Well. Oh, wait. It looks like a wall tussin.
5765000	5768000	Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.
5768000	5773000	Oh, wow. He sounds like a woman. Shut up.
5773000	5775000	Oh, God.
5775000	5781000	It tastes like it tastes like 20 like Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.
5781000	5784000	Contestants, here we go. Snubs got to catch up. And here's his answer.
5784000	5792000	Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.
5792000	5795000	Good answer. Okay.
5795000	5801000	Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her.
5801000	5807000	Skyline says, oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better.
5807000	5816000	He said orange bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick.
5816000	5820000	So we have remote collar exploder dealie and boom stick.
5820000	5822000	Alright. Jamie, what's your answer?
5822000	5823000	Orange bat.
5823000	5830000	Orange bat. I knew it, too. That's right. You're already in the lead, Skyline. You don't need it.
5830000	5833000	Alright. As Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.
5833000	5836000	Okay. Our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel.
5836000	5838000	Big black cock.
5838000	5842000	Her big black cock.
5842000	5846000	Sorry, that's not a match. But funny. Puppy.
5846000	5848000	The ferret.
5848000	5855000	The ferret. Good answer, but not a match.
5855000	5866000	Loki. Her secret weapon was her Iraqi suicide babies. Iraqi suicide babies.
5866000	5869000	Jamie, is this true?
5869000	5875000	I admit it. I've been exporting them. I keep them in my trunk.
5875000	5879000	Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.
5879000	5881000	Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.
5881000	5888000	It sucked ass, kinda. It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.
5888000	5893000	Never read whatever the hell that movie was. It was bad.
5893000	5897000	Envy of the dot dot dot.
5897000	5905000	The film that we watched was called Envy. Actually, it says Envy on the box. It's actual full title. It's called Penis Envy.
5905000	5911000	It's a story about these two drifting chicks. They're walking through the desert and they go to this bar and they get really drunk.
5911000	5916000	And I mean, this is talking about like white trash America. They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.
5916000	5919000	And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?
5919000	5928000	And so they walk around and lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen guy.
5928000	5935000	And then they go and ask the penis fairy for a penis and they get a penis and with the penis comes great responsibility.
5935000	5940000	And they have, you know, mustaches and body hair and tattoos and they start acting like guys.
5940000	5944000	Hey, Loki? Was it Mr. Spanky?
5944000	5951000	And then they start like, you know, screwing this one chick and then this other guy.
5951000	5958000	And then eventually they get tired of having a penis. And so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A. where she's at a gay bar.
5958000	5961000	And then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis.
5961000	5969000	But the one chick likes the penis so much and then she ends up getting killed in the end.
5969000	5971000	That was beautiful. Thank you.
5971000	5975000	Extrovert, what were you doing on my computer last night? Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.
5975000	5980000	I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago. You remember how messy my desktop used to be?
5980000	5983000	Like it was just icons everywhere, right? And you couldn't even see my background.
5983000	5984000	Now you have balls on it.
5984000	5987000	I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?
5987000	5993000	Okay. Now, Extrovert went in and last night while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop.
5993000	6005000	And now I have folders that say big boobies number one, big boobies number two, big boobies with cocks in them, blood spattered boobies,
6005000	6016000	boobies and sunflowers, boobies for milking, boobies in pee, mastectomy leftover boobies, hot hairy saggy man boobies.
6016000	6023000	And then my last, my favorite here, women in roller skates peeing in glass bowls.
6023000	6026000	What the hell? Why did you do that?
6026000	6031000	I'm not going to, you know, if you're going to download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.
6031000	6036000	Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.
6036000	6038000	By the way...
6038000	6039000	Did they use something other than bleach?
6039000	6042000	Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?
6042000	6043000	No.
6043000	6045000	Oh, well, you know how you have like...
6045000	6046000	Crest white strips?
6046000	6049000	Yes, it's like crest white strips only put on your asshole.
6049000	6053000	You leave it for, you leave them for like a few minutes and then you just strip them off and hey...
6053000	6057000	What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?
6057000	6061000	I'm disgusted. I am so disgusted.
6061000	6065000	Girls just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out, I'm coming out, here it is.
6065000	6070000	Loki singing I'm coming out at the county fair with Teninga.
6070000	6072000	Here we go.
6072000	6076000	Remember, he goes, I'm coming out, you know, you know how it goes, you know how this one goes?
6076000	6084000	Okay, here we go.
6084000	6093000	JNN.
6093000	6102000	I'm singing and I'm okay.
6102000	6110000	I'm singing, I'm happy with women.
6110000	6119000	I'm singing, I want the world to know, I'm happy with pussies.
6119000	6128000	I'm singing, I want the world to know, got them ready to show.
6128000	6133000	There's a new me singing and I'm just happy.
6133000	6135000	He's laughing.
6135000	6138000	I'm gonna be happy, I'll be happy.
6138000	6141000	Stop making me laugh, damn it.
6141000	6146000	Like you never knew it, I'll make it through.
6146000	6150000	The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.
6150000	6157000	I have to shout that I'm staying in, I'm staying in.
6157000	6163000	I want the world to know, I'm happy with the pussy.
6163000	6172000	I'm staying in, I want the world to know, I shop on the same sad street.
6172000	6176000	I got to show the world, yeah, I wanna see.
6176000	6180000	All my abilities, there's so much for me.
6180000	6185000	Somehow I have to make them, just understand.
6185000	6190000	I've got it all in hand, oh how I've got it planned.
6190000	6194000	I'm spreading the love, there's more for me to fear.
6194000	6201000	And I just feel so good every time I hear, I'm staying in.
6201000	6207000	I'm happy with the females, gotta let it show.
6207000	6218000	I'm actually passing this song, that's pretty amazing I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.
6218000	6221000	Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.
6221000	6226000	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
6226000	6234000	Yeah, work in the crowd.
6234000	6243000	Yeah, yeah, there's my pictures in the crowd, fuck yeah.
6243000	6251000	I'm coming in, I want the world to know, let it show.
6251000	6260000	I'm staying in, I'm happy with hetero, just want everyone to know.
6260000	6268000	I'm staying in, I want the world to know, women are my thing.
6268000	6277000	I'm staying in, I'm sick of this song, you're gonna really die.
6277000	6286000	God, this is long, it just doesn't fucking end, just keeps on going on.
6286000	6290000	I'm gonna kill anyone in the chatroom that has a recording of this, you're gonna so die.
6290000	6292000	I know where you live.
6292000	6298000	As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
6298000	6307000	A score of 6,964 points for Loki, not even a gold record, there is no justice in this world, okay.
6307000	6311000	Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now, oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.
6311000	6319000	I laughed so hard, I peed, okay, I peed a little, I peed a little bit.
6319000	6326000	I can't lose my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight huh Rob?
6326000	6330000	Oh, that hurt so bad, oh my god.
6330000	6335000	Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.
6335000	6341000	I did want to play something and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro
6341000	6346000	because I was actually trying to make a new intro but then I didn't do that and then I did something else and
6346000	6355000	it's cheesy but it's funny and it's fun with text to speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.
6355000	6357000	Here we go.
6385000	6391000	Do you know how they celebrate it? If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.
6402000	6408000	This next test is very dangerous. To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death,
6408000	6415000	smooth jazz will be deployed in 3, 2, 1.
6415000	6434000	Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.
6446000	6453000	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.
6453000	6455000	That was cute, I like that, good job.
6455000	6456000	Thank you.
6456000	6459000	Alright, let's get back into the show guys.
6464000	6466000	Welcome back everybody to-
6466000	6473000	Technical failure. You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.
6476000	6480000	You done. Here we go.
6480000	6496000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June 24th of 2012 with the 462nd episode of our show,
6496000	6503000	the 10th anniversary special. That's right, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.
6503000	6512000	And here we are 10 years later, getting older, but still talking about the games we love, having live radio fail,
6512000	6516000	Mike sneezes, and the games we don't love so much sometimes too.
6516000	6523000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into part B tonight, and here's the thing, we didn't really pull any stories for this,
6523000	6527000	because we're going to open up the Skype line here real soon. We do want to do the mailbag first though,
6527000	6528000	we got some emails.
6528000	6529000	Yeah, I gotta load that.
6529000	6533000	While you load that though, we do have the foogle question of the week. We still did that this week,
6533000	6536000	so I'm going to go ahead and load that up. Here it is, the foogle question of the week.
6544000	6548000	As a reminder, the foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.
6548000	6555000	Put them together and you get foogle. Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+,
6555000	6561000	it really should be like Gacebook or something, because sadly you're not a lot of Google Plus users.
6561000	6566000	But we do have some, and we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+,
6566000	6569000	and we did get some answers to our question of the week. Here it is.
6569000	6574000	It is a little self-serving this week. Considering the occasion, deal with it.
6574000	6580000	We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts,
6580000	6587000	or a friend told you about it. What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?
6587000	6590000	So going to Google+, here are the answers.
6590000	6596000	We have 13xforever says, personally, I've tried a lot of other shows at the time,
6596000	6601000	but yours has a strong personality to which makes it rather enjoyable to listen to every week.
6601000	6605000	Besides, your general views on gaming as a whole are quite close to mine,
6605000	6608000	and it's useful to have a second opinion on some games that I plan to buy and whatnot.
6608000	6617000	Oh, and Ferret, even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization,
6617000	6620000	or at least it looks like it.
6620000	6623000	Tony M. replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.
6623000	6627000	The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games,
6627000	6631000	no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them,
6631000	6637000	because you're real people who have to purchase, oops, oh, crap, I almost closed the window on accident.
6637000	6639000	Jeez, Rob.
6639000	6641000	Fail.
6641000	6647000	It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.
6647000	6652000	Perfect. I can relate to you all better than them, because you're real people who have to purchase your own games,
6652000	6655000	and this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.
6655000	6658000	The shows coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either,
6658000	6663000	as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.
6663000	6667000	Technist says, at the beginning, when OLR was a Bamani-focused show,
6667000	6672000	it was due to that you were really one of the few shows that actually talked about the games and the culture around them.
6672000	6675000	As I listen more and more to later episodes in the early years,
6675000	6678000	you all have just a great chemistry that's just infectious.
6678000	6682000	I've been kicking myself because I missed a great chunk of your episodes before coming back
6682000	6684000	just right around when you started the To Go podcast.
6684000	6690000	Even when the format changes, station changes, site changes, I still have stuck with you for gaming news.
6690000	6693000	Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news,
6693000	6696000	but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.
6696000	6701000	Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic,
6701000	6708000	I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.
6708000	6709000	Finally, I will end with this.
6709000	6712000	OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.
6712000	6715000	As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think,
6715000	6718000	I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.
6718000	6720000	That's really nice. Thank you.
6720000	6727000	All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.
6727000	6730000	Let's see, we've got 20 answers. Do you think I can read them all?
6730000	6731000	Oh, go for it.
6731000	6737000	This chick named Nelly replied and said, spousal pressure.
6737000	6739000	What's up with that?
6739000	6743000	Let's see, Picaruno said, seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining,
6743000	6747000	and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the host
6747000	6751000	in such a familiar way as something you don't really get anywhere else.
6751000	6754000	Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005,
6754000	6758000	and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.
6758000	6760000	Stay independent.
6760000	6762000	Rama says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.
6762000	6767000	I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.
6767000	6772000	Who said we were good friends? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Girl.
6772000	6776000	Red The Hayes says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.
6776000	6781000	A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006
6781000	6785000	when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.
6785000	6789000	It's okay to say All Games Interactive, by the way. It was a great show. It was.
6789000	6791000	It's really a bummer. It's not on anymore.
6791000	6796000	I then decided to check out the podcast, and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast
6796000	6798000	and just how really nice people y'all are.
6798000	6802000	The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.
6802000	6805000	More power to you guys and gals, and may you have another ten years of awesome.
6805000	6810000	P.S., again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.
6810000	6817000	The Super Bowl? Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head,
6817000	6822000	and then the announcer voice says, blah, blah. Makes me laugh.
6822000	6828000	Let's see. Dekeman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lawns Radio to go.
6828000	6831000	You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.
6831000	6835000	After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.
6835000	6841000	Fabrice A. says, the chemistry between three good friends. Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.
6841000	6844000	Thank you for noticing that, because we really do.
6844000	6848000	Terry J. says, I've been listening since late 2005.
6848000	6852000	I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.
6852000	6856000	To put it simple, you guys know your shit, and your presentation proves it.
6856000	6858000	Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.
6858000	6862000	Don't tell Loki he knows this shit. It only increases ego. I'm just kidding.
6862000	6865000	It's why my head hurts. It can't fit.
6865000	6871000	Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy is why he's listened twice.
6871000	6876000	Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.
6876000	6880000	I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.
6880000	6884000	Benny L. says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.
6884000	6888000	Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.
6888000	6894000	A Local Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.
6894000	6900000	Dan M. says, I kept listening because it was relatable.
6900000	6903000	The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.
6903000	6906000	I was also told there would be cake.
6906000	6908000	We have cookies.
6908000	6910000	It's behind the other door. It's cake day, you know.
6910000	6914000	I prefer pie. There's a joke there.
6914000	6919000	Clover N. says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole
6919000	6924000	three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.
6924000	6930000	Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.
6930000	6936000	What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.
6936000	6940000	Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.
6940000	6946000	Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco
6946000	6950000	Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.
6950000	6953000	That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.
6953000	6956000	That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.
6956000	6960000	Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.
6960000	6964000	From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast
6964000	6966000	that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.
6966000	6972000	2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.
6972000	6976000	Wow, he had a reputation? I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.
6976000	6980000	There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.
6980000	6985000	I really enjoyed the segments, such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.
6985000	6988000	I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.
6988000	6993000	This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.
6993000	6997000	Flow Walker, Mel B says, I was down with OLR since day one.
6997000	7004000	It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.
7004000	7008000	Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.
7008000	7009000	Well, that helps.
7009000	7013000	I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.
7013000	7014000	Still do.
7014000	7023000	And you know, Mel B was like one of the freestyle kings when the show first started, and he brought his cred to OLR very early on.
7023000	7026000	They were on like episode six or something like that, Mel and Mel.
7026000	7029000	And you know, we're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.
7029000	7034000	And I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.
7034000	7039000	Just another good friend I made because of DDR, believe it or not.
7039000	7040000	Let's see.
7040000	7042000	Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.
7042000	7043000	You know what? It's a special show.
7043000	7044000	I'm reading them all.
7044000	7045000	I don't care.
7045000	7049000	Chigger says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.
7049000	7051000	The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.
7051000	7057000	Always a witty comment from Dark Sakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki, and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.
7057000	7059000	I love you guys so much.
7059000	7060000	Add the extra O.
7060000	7061000	So much.
7061000	7067000	I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.
7067000	7069000	Keep it up, and here's to another 10 years.
7069000	7071000	Dave Falcon says, I was in college.
7071000	7075000	I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.
7075000	7081000	Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC, and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints, and cheats on the internet.
7081000	7085000	Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?
7085000	7088000	OLR came up in the search, so I checked it out.
7088000	7091000	Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
7091000	7097000	Gee, however did discussion on The Sims trigger our show, Dark Sakura?
7097000	7099000	Shut up.
7099000	7103000	I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways. Hush.
7103000	7105000	Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.
7105000	7107000	Garris.
7107000	7109000	Alright, let's see.
7109000	7111000	Oops, I lost my place here.
7111000	7113000	Oh yes, so I checked it out.
7113000	7115000	Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
7115000	7117000	Fast forward to 2012.
7117000	7123000	I'm living in Washington, D.C. since 2007, working in social media, and got engaged in December 2011.
7123000	7125000	P.S., my fiancé is a huge video game lover.
7125000	7127000	Well, you lucked out.
7127000	7133000	Ospher says, I saw Sky's post on ddrfreak.com back when those forums were still popular.
7133000	7139000	I thought I'd check out the show, and admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly bimani to video games in general,
7139000	7141000	but it turned out to be a really entertaining show.
7141000	7145000	I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view, which are all pretty different and unique.
7145000	7148000	I was hooked, and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on.
7148000	7150000	Alright, last comment. You ready? Last one.
7150000	7151000	Dun-dun-dun.
7151000	7156000	Orange Right says, the first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.
7156000	7159000	I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.
7159000	7166000	I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much,
7166000	7170000	and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.
7170000	7172000	Stay gold.
7172000	7174000	Great feedback, guys. Thank you.
7174000	7177000	I apologize if you thought that went on a little long, but you know what?
7177000	7179000	I really enjoyed reading all that stuff, so thank you very much.
7179000	7181000	I have fuzzies now.
7181000	7183000	Alright.
7183000	7185000	They're kind of warm.
7185000	7190000	Tuma JP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems, so he sent me a private message, so why not?
7190000	7191000	Do it.
7191000	7200000	The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants, and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.
7200000	7202000	That's pretty powerful, actually.
7202000	7208000	And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.
7208000	7212000	But you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.
7212000	7216000	Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now you're working in the game industry.
7216000	7220000	I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.
7220000	7226000	I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do UmLoud, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.
7226000	7228000	I got to do the design for UmLoud last year.
7228000	7230000	Exactly. We've had a great experience through him.
7230000	7233000	I have other friends that probably would appreciate it. I don't name them.
7233000	7240000	But I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.
7240000	7247000	Really appreciate it. All right. That's it for the FUGL Question of the Week.
7247000	7252000	What do we do next? How about the mailbag? I think the mailbag's up next. Does that sound good?
7252000	7253000	Oh, good Lord.
7253000	7255000	All right. So we got some emails tonight?
7255000	7256000	A few.
7256000	7257000	A few.
7257000	7258000	I'm going to read them all.
7258000	7262000	All right. I read them all. Go ahead.
7262000	7265000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
7265000	7270000	All right. This is actually from Darktensia. But there's, like, a lot of pictures.
7270000	7278000	So, uh, I actually, um, this, why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?
7278000	7282000	I will see what I can do. Oh, oh, Joe. Oh, yeah, Joseph here. Hi, Joe.
7282000	7286000	So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.
7286000	7287000	That's right.
7287000	7295000	But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio Battle Royale thing, which, interestingly enough,
7295000	7299000	DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day. Was that the Paper Plate Battle Royale?
7299000	7303000	Oh, Lord. I remember because I won.
7303000	7305000	Um, they can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.
7305000	7306000	Oh, hey.
7306000	7308000	Oh, here. Use this one.
7308000	7309000	She's in chat right now.
7309000	7310000	Yeah.
7310000	7311000	Sorry.
7311000	7314000	So, yeah, these will have to go on, uh, on the forum.
7314000	7319000	Okay. Um, okay, so next up, oh, it's from Robert Kidman.
7319000	7321000	Send me some biscuits.
7321000	7326000	Um, evening all and happy birth-a-versary.
7326000	7328000	I just wanted to say quite simply thank you.
7328000	7334000	Thank you for 10 wonderful years in your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.
7334000	7340000	Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays,
7340000	7347000	finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.
7347000	7350000	If it weren't for OLR, there would be no geek life.
7350000	7355000	Tiara and I wouldn't have met, and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.
7355000	7357000	Strange how these things happen.
7357000	7363000	Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.
7363000	7366000	So, yeah, thank you. Long may it continue.
7366000	7369000	And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.
7369000	7371000	That's Rob from Geek Life.
7371000	7376000	By the way, huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well.
7376000	7381000	And I love Geek Life. I'm going to be doing a guest column for them.
7381000	7385000	Tiara received an opportunity, and she didn't think of the other Rob.
7385000	7387000	She didn't think of Dan. She didn't think of Jamie.
7387000	7393000	She thought of me, and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed, and I'm so excited.
7393000	7398000	Cool. Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.
7398000	7402000	I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.
7402000	7408000	Okay. I make this promise from here out. I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week.
7408000	7411000	Because I still have to finish part two of TableTop Gaming.
7411000	7412000	There you go.
7412000	7413000	Okay.
7413000	7415000	Due Monday. Just kidding. I'm kidding.
7415000	7417000	Wednesday. It's due before Wednesday, Rob.
7417000	7425000	Hey, OLR and OLR me. I wanted to give a shout-out and congratulate you on ten years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.
7425000	7427000	It's quite a feat.
7427000	7431000	I remember when I first met Rob. It was New Year's 2008 slash 9.
7431000	7434000	He was sick and quiet on the couch.
7434000	7436000	We got to chatting, and he mentioned he was a gamer.
7436000	7438000	G-A-Y-M-E-R.
7438000	7442000	I knew then he'd be a good friend, and then he told me about his podcast.
7442000	7444000	I figured, man, why not? I'll download it.
7444000	7446000	I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.
7446000	7451000	For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.
7451000	7455000	Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.
7455000	7458000	It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.
7458000	7460000	Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.
7460000	7466000	Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.
7466000	7471000	I've seen your last two to three studios, and I know you're on a shoestring budget.
7471000	7478000	So as Dark Soccer is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
7478000	7483000	Wait, what?
7483000	7486000	This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.
7486000	7487000	Let me finish reading it, Rob.
7487000	7488000	Okay.
7488000	7493000	So take note of the time and count them up. Let me know what the total is, and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.
7493000	7496000	I believe in the work that you do. Please keep it up.
7496000	7503000	Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.
7503000	7508000	I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.
7508000	7510000	Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft Matt.
7510000	7514000	DS, you guys are old as fuck.
7514000	7521000	Did I just hear that somebody is donating ten dollars for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?
7521000	7522000	So our chat-
7522000	7526000	For every- donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
7526000	7529000	Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?
7529000	7530000	In the chat room?
7530000	7531000	Yeah.
7531000	7532000	How many people?
7532000	7539000	It's seventy-nine people in chat right now, and I got a print screen right there. Seventy-nine people in the chat room.
7539000	7541000	We love you Matt!
7541000	7552000	Honestly, that's a huge gesture. I'm not gonna hold him to it if he didn't realize what a big commitment he's making.
7552000	7557000	He's allowed to put a cap on that for sure, even if that cap is ten dollars, it's fine.
7557000	7567000	But I will say this, that would go a long way in funding this station for a year because the money so far has come out of our pockets.
7567000	7576000	Especially mine, especially Bobby's in getting this station running, so I would say that would be a hugely appreciated gesture, and thank you.
7576000	7578000	Well two of them are bots according to Bobby.
7578000	7580000	Oh, so I'm sorry, seventy-seven.
7580000	7582000	Seventy-seven real people in chat.
7582000	7584000	There you go.
7584000	7588000	Wow, that's super full.
7588000	7592000	I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.
7592000	7593000	Okay.
7593000	7595000	Well it's three bots, seventy-six.
7595000	7596000	Okay.
7596000	7599000	Alright, this is from Robobobobobobob.
7599000	7605000	The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.
7605000	7611000	It's a link on here about fall unlocking this Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.
7611000	7615000	God, I hope so because I'm not buying those things.
7615000	7622000	You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.
7622000	7627000	But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.
7627000	7636000	Remember one versus one hundred Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes, so they must have felt it was too much like money.
7636000	7639000	So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.
7639000	7644000	Strangely, we can have a skeeball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.
7644000	7646000	And that's from Robobobobob.
7646000	7647000	Okay.
7647000	7650000	Moving forward.
7650000	7652000	Hey, OLR.
7652000	7654000	Hi.
7654000	7656000	It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.
7656000	7659000	Five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since.
7659000	7662000	I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program.
7662000	7665000	It might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants.
7665000	7668000	My personal favorite was the one about the Wii peripherals.
7668000	7672000	Or, as Loki put it, $20 pieces of awkward shit.
7672000	7677000	Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with.
7677000	7679000	Okay, wow.
7679000	7688000	Regardless, doing this show for ten consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of.
7688000	7694000	With that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters, myself included.
7694000	7696000	Congratulations for reaching the ten-year mark.
7696000	7699000	Here's to another ten years of successful podcasting.
7699000	7701000	Your faithful listener, Degenerate Johnny.
7701000	7707000	P.S. I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.
7707000	7709000	What selection would you suggest for a first comer?
7709000	7712000	Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.
7712000	7715000	You know who should be giving us money per each listener?
7715000	7716000	Pinkberry!
7716000	7717000	It's Pinkberry.
7717000	7721000	Um, my personal favorite is the chocolate.
7721000	7724000	However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.
7724000	7726000	Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.
7728000	7729000	Moving forward.
7729000	7731000	Thank you, Johnny.
7731000	7732000	Thank you, Johnny.
7732000	7733000	Howdy, O.L.R.
7733000	7735000	Howdy, partner.
7735000	7738000	I just wanted to say congrats on ten years of doing the show.
7738000	7746000	It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.
7746000	7749000	You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.
7749000	7753000	We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and gal to look up to.
7753000	7755000	Here is to ten more years of O.L.R., Brad.
7755000	7758000	It's from Brad at Pod Culture.
7758000	7760000	We love Pod Culture. Mondays on vlog.
7760000	7763000	I still need to get you your missing stuff. Sorry.
7763000	7765000	Is it premiering this week?
7765000	7767000	Uh, a premier episode of Pod Culture?
7767000	7768000	Yeah.
7768000	7769000	I believe it is this week, yes.
7769000	7770000	Okay.
7770000	7771000	Yay!
7771000	7772000	Alright.
7772000	7780000	Dear O.L.R., I was hoping to write a long, rambling email in honor of your tenth birthday on how this show has kept my attention for seven years.
7780000	7784000	Longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.
7784000	7788000	By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.
7788000	7790000	Use. Use an honor.
7790000	7792000	I can recognize it.
7792000	7798000	On how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out.
7798000	7802000	And overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show.
7802000	7807000	But unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the twentieth anniversary instead.
7807000	7810000	Cheers for everything, guys. Elliot B.
7810000	7813000	Elliot is from the UK. He's one of the vlog contributors.
7813000	7814000	He is from the UK.
7814000	7815000	Yep.
7815000	7819000	And thank you. I, you know, I'm just me.
7819000	7821000	And I like video games.
7821000	7822000	And...
7822000	7823000	And I have a boyfriend.
7823000	7825000	It is what it is.
7825000	7829000	And I thank you guys for just, you know, not giving a shit.
7829000	7831000	Which people shouldn't.
7831000	7834000	Be happy that people are in love.
7834000	7835000	That's what it's all about.
7835000	7837000	And Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection.
7837000	7841000	I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but alright.
7841000	7843000	I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.
7843000	7844000	Oh, okay.
7844000	7852000	Okay. This one has a title in Spanish and he actually corrected me about el telefono es en fuego.
7852000	7854000	That's not how it's actually supposed to be said.
7854000	7857000	But I don't know anything about Spanish grammar so my bad.
7857000	7859000	Yo no se.
7859000	7861000	So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right.
7861000	7864000	Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja.
7864000	7866000	Naranja. Or is that it?
7866000	7868000	I guess that's orange.
7868000	7871000	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deaf.
7871000	7875000	It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag.
7875000	7878000	But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?
7878000	7883000	I've been listening to you guys since around 2005-2006, right after I graduated from university.
7883000	7888000	I discovered you guys from the old DDR Freak forums back when Bimani and DDR were still relevant to our lives.
7888000	7892000	And it still kinda is, just not as important as it was before.
7892000	7900000	I didn't start to listen religiously until late 2006 when you got some Bimani exclusive for a DDR game back then, probably UltraMix 4.
7900000	7903000	And while I came in for DDR, I stayed for the show.
7903000	7908000	I wasn't a fan of internet radio talk shows or podcasting back then, but you guys really got me into it.
7908000	7912000	I still remember the live 365 days, so do we.
7912000	7917000	I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.
7917000	7918000	Hey, I got speakers.
7918000	7919000	You did.
7919000	7920000	I did.
7920000	7922000	At least we got something. We didn't get a trophy but we got speakers.
7922000	7924000	I played bingo and won speakers.
7924000	7930000	Though it was unexpected to hear that you were leaving them, but not surprising after hearing the reasons why you left that service.
7930000	7932000	But then came the All Games era.
7932000	7935000	The show didn't change that much, it was pretty much the same.
7935000	7942000	And so I discovered the Bobby Black Wolf show, met really great people over at the All Games chat room, and made some new friends over the years.
7942000	7948000	There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff.
7948000	7951000	But it also helps to show how great the community can be.
7951000	7955000	Always supportive to the show, in good times and especially bad times.
7955000	7960000	You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.
7960000	7962000	I'm scrolling up.
7962000	7964000	We have also learned a lot from you guys.
7964000	7968000	Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong.
7968000	7973000	And to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.
7973000	7977000	Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad.
7977000	7981000	To not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.
7981000	7982000	Okay.
7982000	7986000	And Loki, you've taught us to question everything, not to accept anything as it is.
7986000	7994000	And that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions.
7994000	7995000	I laughed.
7995000	7996000	Love it.
7996000	8001000	You're an inspiration for all of us listening, whether it's been ten years, five years, or even just a few months.
8001000	8004000	We are forever grateful for making every week a blast.
8004000	8010000	You may not have many awards or recognition, but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet.
8010000	8013000	You know, the one award we have is Sitting on My Mantle.
8013000	8015000	And it's not moving.
8015000	8017000	It was a good award. It was the first podcast award for gaming.
8017000	8019000	Yeah.
8019000	8022000	Congrats Orange Lounge Radio. Congrats for ten fabulous years.
8022000	8029000	I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and while anything the OLR has given me all these years.
8029000	8035000	And while you may act like a ten-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person a hundred years old.
8035000	8039000	I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of a hundred years old, however.
8039000	8044000	Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.
8044000	8046000	So here's for another ten whole years.
8046000	8047000	Raises glass.
8047000	8048000	Toast!
8048000	8049000	Thanks for everything.
8049000	8051000	Speaking of toast.
8051000	8052000	Speaking of toast.
8052000	8053000	Yay!
8053000	8055000	French toast!
8055000	8056000	Wait, what?
8056000	8057000	Ew, hello not French toast.
8057000	8058000	I love French toast!
8058000	8060000	French toast is amazing.
8060000	8063000	There is a place, okay, I'm going on the food tangent.
8063000	8072000	There's a place in Sacramento that has French toast made out of challah.
8072000	8074000	What's challah?
8074000	8075000	Challah!
8075000	8076000	Challah?
8076000	8085000	It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.
8085000	8087000	That does sound delicious.
8087000	8089000	This is the best French toast.
8089000	8091000	Challah French toast.
8091000	8095000	Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.
8095000	8100000	So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.
8100000	8102000	And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.
8102000	8106000	So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.
8106000	8112000	And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, ten more years.
8112000	8113000	What do you say?
8113000	8115000	To our 40s?
8115000	8117000	I'm trying not to spill.
8117000	8119000	We had clingies.
8119000	8120000	Cling.
8120000	8121000	Okay.
8121000	8123000	Misty, Misty, Misty.
8123000	8125000	And now everyone get drunk.
8125000	8127000	As I spill it on my shirt.
8127000	8128000	That's some good wine.
8128000	8130000	I'm gonna get water intoxicated.
8130000	8132000	It's making my headache feel a lot better, so.
8132000	8133000	That's good.
8133000	8135000	I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake, but.
8135000	8140000	It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey,
8140000	8141000	I'm gonna do this real quick.
8141000	8143000	And then my brain's like, no.
8143000	8146000	By the way, I have a follow up.
8146000	8152000	And I kind of didn't react because I kind of did like this double take, like what, what?
8152000	8155000	But I'm text messaging grandpa right now.
8155000	8160000	And I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said it says this number, but it's 76 when you
8160000	8161000	subtract the bots.
8161000	8164000	And I said, I won't hold you to that.
8164000	8165000	You really don't have to.
8165000	8168000	He replied back, I'm of my word.
8168000	8170000	760 bucks for VOG right there.
8170000	8171000	Sweet.
8171000	8176000	So that's, um, I'll throw in another 40 just around that up to 80.
8176000	8177000	What?
8177000	8178000	Really?
8178000	8179000	Yeah.
8179000	8180000	And then there's listening.
8180000	8181000	I like round numbers.
8181000	8182000	Well there.
8182000	8183000	And you know what, Rob?
8183000	8184000	What?
8184000	8187000	What I will do, cause you know, I had that account open.
8187000	8191000	Um, how about we go take it and convert it to a business account.
8191000	8192000	Sounds great.
8192000	8193000	We'll get started on that.
8193000	8194000	We have plenty.
8194000	8196000	We have at least two or three people in chat.
8196000	8197000	They want to donate.
8197000	8202000	There's like five bucks left in it right now because I started putting my design money
8202000	8203000	in it.
8203000	8206000	Um, it may not be much in the scope of things.
8206000	8211000	I mean, let's be real, you know, for a business, but I, uh, you considering black Wolf and
8211000	8214000	I have probably paid about that much out of pocket.
8214000	8218000	Like I can't speak to a black Wolf has spent, but I know I've spent enough.
8218000	8222000	Let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running.
8222000	8224000	And I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much.
8224000	8228000	If not about twice as much from his end of the things, cause he bought software and designs
8228000	8229000	for the site.
8229000	8238000	So just to like get that money to for the next year is, is a great, great burden off
8238000	8239000	our shoulders actually.
8239000	8243000	Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to
8243000	8246000	have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working
8246000	8247000	on it.
8247000	8252000	And, um, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone here.
8252000	8255000	Who's been listening to, but, um, you know, there'll be more coming up about the book
8255000	8257000	cause I'm, I'm designing it beginning to end.
8257000	8264000	So, um, as soon as people send me old logos, Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say
8264000	8266000	how you don't make any money on the show.
8266000	8268000	Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.
8268000	8272000	We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would
8272000	8273000	be nice.
8273000	8275000	Uh, the money's going to go right back into the show.
8275000	8280000	I can tell you, I came this close, this close to drop in threes.
8280000	8286000	This close to drop in $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise
8286000	8287000	for the show.
8287000	8291000	And the only, cause I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like,
8291000	8292000	Oh my God.
8292000	8295000	But the only thing that stopped me is that we would have to have three mic stands.
8295000	8298000	And in my little bitty apartment that ain't going to fly.
8298000	8300000	Unless we get rock bandstands.
8300000	8301000	Maybe.
8301000	8302000	We'll see.
8302000	8303000	We'll see.
8303000	8304000	You can also get the ones that are there on the swing arm things.
8304000	8309000	Like they have the little, they look like, yeah, so desk lamps or you can use a desk
8309000	8310000	lamp.
8310000	8312000	So all the money is going right back into the show.
8312000	8315000	And don't forget my husband works at radio shack.
8315000	8316000	So, all right.
8316000	8317000	Um, thank you guys so much.
8317000	8322000	We will have, as soon as, as soon as Jamie has the account set up, we will tell you guys
8322000	8323000	how you can donate.
8323000	8327000	We have to, we have to tread carefully here though, because I'm really worried about tax
8327000	8328000	stuff.
8328000	8330000	I don't know that stuff at all.
8330000	8331000	So I need tax help.
8331000	8335000	If anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us, I, that's what
8335000	8336000	I could really use.
8336000	8339000	Well, I mean, I think it's actually, and I'm not going to say any more about this, but
8339000	8342000	maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license.
8342000	8343000	We had one.
8343000	8344000	We did.
8344000	8345000	Yeah, we let it lapse.
8345000	8346000	Yeah.
8346000	8348000	Anyway, we won't talk about that on there.
8348000	8349000	Okay.
8349000	8350000	All right.
8350000	8351000	We have four emails left.
8351000	8352000	Yes.
8352000	8356000	Dear orange launch radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday
8356000	8358000	and an attempt to keep this email short and to the point.
8358000	8359000	Let me say thank you.
8359000	8362000	I started listening to the podcast back on March.
8362000	8363000	What?
8363000	8365000	I heard snorting.
8365000	8366000	Just chat.
8366000	8367000	Okay.
8367000	8371000	I started listening to the podcast back in March, 2010 after I bought my first iPod touch.
8371000	8372000	Wow.
8372000	8376000	From that point on, sky, dark soccer and lucky have become an important part of my life.
8376000	8377000	Do we touch you?
8377000	8378000	Okay.
8378000	8379000	Anyway.
8379000	8383000	Sundays became orange launch radio nights instead of moaning and groaning for the upcoming
8383000	8384000	workweek.
8384000	8388000	I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life and I
8388000	8389000	fully agree with the listeners.
8389000	8393000	Through bad relationships, major family issues and a brief period of unemployment.
8393000	8396000	OLR has been a constant positive in my life.
8396000	8400000	With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room
8400000	8402000	and fellow listeners have become my second family.
8402000	8406000	Once again, thank you orange launch radio for running strong for 10 years.
8406000	8410000	You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak and you have definitely
8410000	8413000	been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.
8413000	8417000	Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to
8417000	8420000	be there just like how OLR has been there for me.
8420000	8424000	Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.
8424000	8425000	Happy birthday.
8425000	8427000	And that's from Sherzo, AKA Gion.
8427000	8431000	And you're, I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.
8431000	8433000	I'm feeling verklempt.
8433000	8434000	Here's a topic.
8434000	8436000	Talk amongst yourselves.
8436000	8437000	Sorry.
8437000	8438000	No.
8438000	8439000	Okay.
8439000	8441000	Three more to go.
8441000	8442000	Holy moly.
8442000	8445000	To Rob, Loki and Dark Sakura.
8445000	8448000	As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you
8448000	8451000	have done over the past 10 years in that effort to entertain your listeners.
8451000	8456000	I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.
8456000	8457000	Live 365.
8457000	8458000	Ah, who cares?
8458000	8459000	They sucked anyway.
8459000	8460000	Bite me.
8460000	8461000	And then that was just on behalf of them.
8461000	8463000	We had good years on Live 365.
8463000	8464000	They took care of us for a little while.
8464000	8465000	We did.
8465000	8466000	We did.
8466000	8467000	Betty was nice.
8467000	8468000	Betty was nice.
8468000	8471000	And then becoming a member of the all games community and finally joining you on your
8471000	8473000	very own network vlog.
8473000	8477000	I have met each of you at least once, although I am fairly certain it is more than that.
8477000	8481000	Whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.
8481000	8485000	The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meetup
8485000	8487000	at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.
8487000	8491000	I remembered listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed, the whole
8491000	8495000	group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.
8495000	8499000	I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble
8499000	8502000	finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.
8502000	8506000	Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face
8506000	8509000	with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.
8509000	8513000	I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.
8513000	8517000	Congratulations on this incredible milestone and I look forward to seeing everyone again
8517000	8518000	at future events.
8518000	8520000	And that's from ShadowNextGen.
8520000	8521000	I agree.
8521000	8528000	That was a great memory and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that
8528000	8533000	because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.
8533000	8536000	Yeah.
8536000	8539000	Well, this one isn't an anniversary memory.
8539000	8540000	It's actually news.
8540000	8541000	Alright, fair enough.
8541000	8542000	The next one.
8542000	8543000	What do you mean?
8543000	8545000	There's gaming news this week?
8545000	8549000	Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic.
8549000	8552000	And this is Turrican, sorry.
8552000	8555000	We'll be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra
8555000	8557000	November 10th in Cologne, Germany.
8557000	8558000	Have a good one, guys.
8558000	8559000	Wow.
8559000	8560000	That comes from RDG.
8560000	8562000	I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turrican soundtrack.
8562000	8564000	It's a link from Kickstarter.
8564000	8565000	Very cool.
8565000	8566000	Okay.
8566000	8568000	Oh, dude, we got another email in too.
8568000	8572000	Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?
8572000	8574000	This one comes from Dan Shadow.
8574000	8576000	Congratulations on 10 years, guys.
8576000	8579000	I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two
8579000	8582000	parts and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.
8582000	8585000	I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.
8585000	8589000	Since the show, I, uh oh, lost my virginity.
8589000	8590000	Me too.
8590000	8591000	No, just kidding.
8591000	8595000	He graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie,
8595000	8598000	ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.
8598000	8599000	Feel old yet?
8599000	8601000	Phoenix Force 5 for the win.
8601000	8602000	Thanks, guys.
8602000	8603000	I'm Batman.
8603000	8610000	That's, okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.
8610000	8611000	Alright, yeah.
8611000	8614000	And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.
8614000	8618000	He didn't talk like that, so he's Batman.
8618000	8620000	No, I am Batman.
8620000	8623000	And then this one, okay.
8623000	8625000	Dear OLR, I love the podcast.
8625000	8627000	However, there is one thing I must say.
8627000	8631000	Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having
8631000	8632000	at the moment.
8632000	8635000	Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry.
8635000	8639000	So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening.
8639000	8641000	Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite.
8641000	8645000	You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.
8645000	8648000	We had pizza because we were playing Catan.
8648000	8651000	What does that have to do with pizza?
8651000	8654000	Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.
8654000	8656000	I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.
8656000	8657000	Bacon and garlic pizza.
8657000	8659000	That actually sounds pretty epic.
8659000	8664000	I also have never had Pink Berry and hope to try it someday.
8664000	8665000	What flavor should I get?
8665000	8667000	Chocolate? Strawberry?
8667000	8674000	I seriously want Pink Berry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.
8674000	8679000	I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.
8679000	8684000	We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.
8684000	8686000	I want blood orange lounge radio.
8686000	8689000	Yes.
8689000	8692000	Thanks and keep up the great work, Randy.
8692000	8694000	You know what?
8694000	8700000	That is two emails on our 10th anniversary going, congrats, tell me more about Pink Berry.
8700000	8701000	You know what, Rob?
8701000	8706000	The name Randy always makes me laugh because of a catering place that's near my house called Randy Peters.
8706000	8710000	And that really makes me laugh because Randy.
8710000	8715000	And the name Peter is also a nickname for certain parts of the male genitalia.
8715000	8717000	The penis.
8717000	8719000	Yes, Loki. The penis.
8719000	8722000	So Randy Peters.
8722000	8724000	Are you feeling Randy?
8724000	8726000	Starring Randy Peters. Yeah, I can see that.
8726000	8729000	That would be the best male porn name ever.
8729000	8732000	That sounds like a British male porn name.
8732000	8735000	Or Sir John Thomas.
8735000	8738000	All right. Is that it for emails?
8738000	8739000	That is it. I closed it.
8739000	8742000	Well, you know what comes after the emails.
8742000	8744000	Ten years of pent up angst.
8744000	8760000	Here's your mama.
8760000	8765000	F you to me because I missed Girls Gone Wild today and I was so excited about it.
8765000	8767000	But I was like I was dreaming about the show.
8767000	8770000	I texted Rob in my sleep.
8770000	8774000	Okay. And and Garris.
8774000	8777000	I blame Garris for this, too.
8777000	8782000	And I blame Shane for me blaming Garris because about Mass Effect.
8782000	8785000	I have played over since yesterday.
8785000	8788000	I played 20 something hours of Mass Effect.
8788000	8790000	I do not know what's wrong with me.
8790000	8801000	I never even did that on WoW. So the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy 6 when I was in high school.
8801000	8803000	Just saying. Just saying.
8803000	8805000	I'm done.
8805000	8809000	Fuck you to my headache because I hate games.
8809000	8813000	I think it's a sinus headache because it's been a little windy today.
8813000	8820000	And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post a vlog about this show having a ten year anniversary.
8820000	8826000	Because they can have wonderful topics like,
8826000	8828000	Woman hit by balls sues little leaguer.
8828000	8832000	Or work in progress zombie survival short story.
8832000	8836000	Or hey is this person on the forum gay?
8836000	8843000	You know they can have those posts on there. Oh but I post about something and they're just like eh no.
8843000	8845000	We need to remove that post.
8845000	8847000	That is kind of stupid.
8847000	8849000	Eh whatever. They're kids.
8849000	8851000	Why am I on a forum about.
8851000	8852000	Fuck kids.
8852000	8856000	Why am I a modding forum with all fuck me. Seriously it's all kids.
8856000	8857000	I mean not really.
8857000	8858000	I mean.
8858000	8861000	I'm not like that guy at Penn State.
8861000	8868000	I talk to these people online and then like I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about like modding and stuff and they're like teenagers.
8868000	8870000	I mean I feel so old.
8870000	8876000	I'm like yeah I'm like thirty something and you're sixteen seventeen.
8876000	8877000	I don't know.
8877000	8880000	Black Wolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.
8880000	8886000	We never made the front page but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.
8886000	8890000	Probably helped that we asked pretty please on Facebook and so forth but anyway.
8890000	8897000	My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.
8897000	8898000	Moving on.
8898000	8900000	Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.
8900000	8902000	The stuff that I brought is wheat free.
8902000	8905000	Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.
8905000	8907000	Gamer girl has this FU too.
8907000	8913000	She has this what is that carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.
8913000	8917000	So FU to that.
8917000	8922000	FU to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today.
8922000	8927000	And he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza.
8927000	8929000	So FU to Loki.
8929000	8930000	Misty.
8930000	8933000	I will go ahead and second that FU to carpal tunnel.
8933000	8937000	I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist.
8937000	8939000	Other than that.
8939000	8942000	Yeah again not winning the lottery.
8942000	8948000	Because when I win the lottery once I get all the tech shit dealt with I will supply money for the fort.
8948000	8951000	Awesome FU to not having a fort.
8951000	8953000	I think that's what it comes down to.
8953000	8954000	Thanks you guys.
8954000	8956000	Alright that does it for the FUs of the week.
8956000	8957000	Let's see.
8957000	8958000	So we did FUs.
8958000	8959000	Check.
8959000	8960000	We did mailbag.
8960000	8961000	Check.
8961000	8962000	Fugal.
8962000	8963000	Check.
8963000	8964000	Hey I think it's time to open up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.
8964000	8966000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8966000	8969000	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8969000	8973000	The Skype line is now open for your calls on this very special 10th anniversary.
8973000	8975000	Whatever you want to talk about.
8975000	8977000	If you want to talk about you know the 10th anniversary.
8977000	8978000	Cool.
8978000	8980000	You want to talk about something going on in gaming.
8980000	8983000	Awesome.
8983000	8986000	They're taking bets on who the first person is that's going to be through right now.
8986000	8988000	We'll see what happens.
8988000	8990000	Meanwhile I could go to Twitter.
8990000	8992000	I want to read some of the comments from Twitter actually.
8992000	8995000	Because we got some really nice 10th anniversary.
8995000	8999000	I guess not because the Skype line is fired up.
8999000	9001000	So let's go to the Skype line and take some calls.
9001000	9003000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9003000	9006000	Who's this?
9006000	9007000	Hola.
9007000	9008000	Bienvenidos.
9008000	9009000	OrangeLoungeRadio.
9009000	9010000	Hello.
9010000	9011000	Hello?
9011000	9013000	Caller we can't hear you.
9013000	9014000	Hi.
9014000	9016000	Who's this?
9016000	9022000	This would be wonderful if Skype would actually decide to work with me tonight.
9022000	9023000	Who is this?
9023000	9024000	This is Jason.
9024000	9025000	Hi Jason.
9025000	9026000	What's on your mind buddy?
9026000	9027000	Jason of the awesome.
9027000	9030000	F you to Loki because I'm really hungry.
9030000	9033000	So I'll second JV Mon.
9033000	9037000	Well that's not all I have to say but that was the most important thing in the last five
9037000	9038000	minutes that's for sure.
9038000	9042000	It's always important to turn to Loki and say hey buddy F you.
9042000	9044000	Oh it is.
9044000	9045000	Oh it is.
9045000	9046000	Time and time again.
9046000	9051000	Oh I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show
9051000	9056000	that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 02.
9056000	9061000	I know I was still in high school so that puts it in 03 I remember my group of friends
9061000	9066000	that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani
9066000	9071000	discussion that we all know and love and obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less
9071000	9072000	than that.
9072000	9073000	A lot less.
9073000	9074000	I have no idea why I just said that.
9074000	9079000	Obviously it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.
9079000	9082000	Hopefully in a good way.
9082000	9083000	Oh absolutely.
9083000	9085000	Well thank you.
9085000	9090000	Numerous events of live coverage and yeah definitely hopefully that all starts coming back.
9090000	9094000	And thank you it's very important to also say thank you as well to Jason because Jason
9094000	9100000	if people don't know this Jason pretty much is the guy behind the website and the fact
9100000	9106000	that we have a space to post or to post our podcast is thanks to Jason without him we
9106000	9110000	may not have a place or we would have to dip into having ads in order to be able to host
9110000	9114000	it or something but Jason made that happen for us so we really appreciate that.
9114000	9117000	Yeah and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.
9117000	9118000	Thank you so much.
9118000	9123000	Unless you guys want to that's all your choice of course.
9123000	9126000	Outside of the vlog stuff no not really.
9126000	9130000	We still have a place to host our show so.
9130000	9134000	Shit anything else you want to say?
9134000	9137000	I want to be back on the show but that's for the future.
9137000	9141000	Come visit get on a train you might cross paths with Misty.
9141000	9148000	July, August, November, January and then at the very least continuing perpetual August
9148000	9151000	and January after that seems kind of definitive.
9151000	9154000	Let me whenever you want Jason just let us know when because you know we'll have your
9154000	9156000	sexy radio voice on anytime.
9156000	9158000	Hell yeah my microphone and tone.
9158000	9162000	If you're needing these suggestions if you go after some more microphones let's talk
9162000	9167000	because you know I brought mine and we're kind of I'm kind of up on the lingo of microphones
9167000	9168000	lately.
9168000	9172000	Yes I would love I want my voice to be sexy like yours how do I make that happen?
9172000	9176000	Pay way too much money unfortunately is the answer to that question.
9176000	9177000	Hooray.
9177000	9179000	And next time warn me so we can crash it together.
9179000	9181000	Yeah yeah absolutely.
9181000	9183000	Amtrak buddies for life.
9183000	9184000	Who needs planes?
9184000	9185000	Who needs planes?
9185000	9187000	All right Jason I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls but thanks again for
9187000	9188000	all you do.
9188000	9189000	Good night guys congratulations.
9189000	9190000	Take care thanks.
9190000	9191000	Couldn't have done it without you.
9191000	9192000	Later.
9192000	9195000	1877 game OLR or the calls keep on coming in.
9195000	9197000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9197000	9198000	It's Shane.
9198000	9200000	It's Shane what's up?
9200000	9204000	Well I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world can you guess them?
9204000	9212000	You're listening to Orange Launch Radio you're talking to me and talking about Mass Effect
9212000	9213000	with me.
9213000	9215000	Talking about none of those are the right answer.
9215000	9220000	I am playing Mass Effect I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.
9220000	9227000	So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.
9227000	9231000	Thank you appreciate your paying attention yes.
9231000	9237000	And I wanted to say that for me without this show I never would have worked at Konami and
9237000	9242000	that's a major thing for me so I have to thank the show for that.
9242000	9245000	I'm kind of sorry about that too at the same time.
9245000	9246000	No I'm kidding.
9246000	9249000	You had some great memories at Konami though right?
9249000	9253000	Yes like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.
9253000	9256000	That was one of my best memories.
9256000	9259000	Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?
9259000	9263000	Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?
9263000	9264000	No.
9264000	9269000	What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR
9269000	9270000	that you can talk about?
9270000	9275000	I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR but I would say one of the more scandalous
9275000	9281000	things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one.
9281000	9291000	We had no females work there anymore so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.
9291000	9295000	I mean he still had underwear on but he decided that since there were no females there was
9295000	9296000	no reason for pants.
9296000	9300000	Hey Shane last week I went to work with no pants.
9300000	9301000	What was that?
9301000	9303000	Last week I went to work with no pants.
9303000	9304000	Maybe you were wearing a skirt.
9304000	9305000	This is true.
9305000	9308000	He was not wearing a skirt.
9308000	9310000	This is really important Shane this is the most important question.
9310000	9311000	You tell a kilt.
9311000	9313000	Was it boxers or briefs?
9313000	9314000	It was boxers.
9314000	9317000	Okay because boxers that's kind of like swimwear.
9317000	9318000	That's not that bad.
9318000	9321000	That's still going with no pants.
9321000	9322000	That is true.
9322000	9324000	Now boxer briefs are fairly exciting.
9324000	9326000	They're kind of in the middle.
9326000	9328000	Because then you get the grippy with the.
9328000	9332000	Alright look that's not what we're here to talk about tonight.
9332000	9333000	I don't know what show you're listening to.
9333000	9335000	Underwear lounge radio.
9335000	9337000	This sounds about par for the course.
9337000	9339000	That's what you're talking about.
9339000	9341000	And Garris.
9341000	9343000	That's a great story about Konami.
9343000	9346000	Some of the games were designed with no pants.
9346000	9348000	You think they would have come out better.
9348000	9351000	No just kidding the Ultra Mix games were the best in the series.
9351000	9354000	You know I've always said that and it's not just because you guys were working on them.
9354000	9355000	Pantsless rage.
9355000	9357000	But think about this you guys.
9357000	9362000	If it weren't for this show then Shane would have ended up at Konami.
9362000	9368000	In a way this show impacted the game we made this show about.
9368000	9369000	It's true.
9369000	9373000	And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusives reveals.
9373000	9376000	Because I was the one that brought those songs to you.
9376000	9378000	That's true you brought the first couple.
9378000	9382000	And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.
9382000	9386000	And you know unfortunately we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.
9386000	9390000	But he was a big part when Ultra Mix 4 was coming out.
9390000	9393000	He let our show straight up have the exclusives on everything.
9393000	9395000	And that was a wonderful honor.
9395000	9398000	And you know he is greatly missed.
9398000	9401000	As is well Jason didn't pass away.
9401000	9404000	But Jason you know moved on from Konami.
9404000	9406000	Or had to move on from Konami.
9406000	9410000	And obviously his lack of impact.
9410000	9413000	You know not being at Konami anymore has greatly been felt.
9413000	9415000	You know so.
9415000	9417000	This is true.
9417000	9420000	As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal.
9420000	9423000	Because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.
9423000	9425000	That's true.
9425000	9428000	But as I was I think talking to him one night about.
9428000	9430000	Like I go back and look at my old stuff.
9430000	9432000	And some of it's garbage.
9432000	9436000	Like really really truly garbage.
9436000	9438000	And I wish I could get a do over.
9438000	9440000	It's kind of funny too.
9440000	9443000	Because someone like you know you got me into Echo Image.
9443000	9446000	Which is like one of my favorite bands ever now.
9446000	9448000	Because of DDR.
9448000	9450000	And maybe I'm not supposed to say this.
9450000	9452000	But oh shit oh well it's been seven years.
9452000	9455000	You told me about that song long before the game was out.
9455000	9457000	Because it was amazing.
9457000	9459000	And played the CD for me. What?
9459000	9461000	It's been seven years?
9461000	9463000	It's been a long time hasn't it?
9463000	9465000	How long has it been since Ultra Mix was out?
9465000	9467000	A million years I don't know.
9467000	9470000	Like 2005?
9470000	9473000	I've known Shane for.
9473000	9476000	You and I met because of this show obviously.
9476000	9478000	Yeah it was because of Animal Crossing.
9478000	9480000	That's right it was.
9480000	9482000	And then so god I've probably known you at least nine years.
9482000	9484000	Because I remember you came to this show like during its first year.
9484000	9486000	And all that.
9486000	9488000	But yeah you told me about Skulk and all that.
9488000	9490000	And then we found the CD somewhere.
9490000	9492000	And I fell in love with that CD.
9492000	9494000	And that's one of my favorite bands ever now.
9494000	9497000	Even though they only ever did one stinking album.
9497000	9500000	Yes because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.
9500000	9502000	Which is you know the same thing.
9502000	9504000	They're just high.
9504000	9506000	Alright Shane I gotta let you go to get more calls.
9506000	9508000	They're busy wrestling me.
9508000	9510000	Anything else you want to say especially about us?
9510000	9512000	No why would I want to talk about you?
9512000	9514000	I don't know. Because we're awesome.
9514000	9516000	Because of Garris.
9516000	9518000	I thought it's but Garris not because of Garris.
9518000	9522000	Because without us Shane you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.
9522000	9525000	That's a lie. It's reverse.
9525000	9527000	Alright bye.
9527000	9529000	Bye.
9529000	9532000	1877 game OLR. Our username on skype is orange launch radio.
9532000	9534000	Or the phone is already ringing so you can just go to another phone.
9534000	9536000	Oh hi.
9536000	9538000	Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9538000	9541000	I wasn't expecting to be next but hi.
9541000	9543000	Hi.
9543000	9546000	Shut off your radio stream because I'm hearing myself.
9546000	9548000	Oh okay.
9548000	9550000	I don't know why I'm hearing myself.
9550000	9552000	Go ahead and say what you want to say.
9552000	9554000	Oh I'm sorry.
9554000	9557000	I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years.
9557000	9559000	Well off and on.
9559000	9561000	And I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.
9561000	9563000	Yay.
9563000	9565000	Give me a second.
9565000	9567000	Dang it.
9567000	9569000	Alright.
9569000	9571000	I wanted to say that
9571000	9573000	I enjoy listening to you guys.
9573000	9575000	When I came back from
9575000	9577000	Rhode Island and I was starting to get into
9577000	9579000	Dance Dance Revolution
9579000	9581000	I found you guys on
9581000	9583000	Live 365 and
9583000	9585000	I started listening
9585000	9587000	and I met a lot of good friends like
9587000	9589000	Richie which is
9589000	9591000	you know
9591000	9593000	I forget his name
9593000	9595000	while here.
9595000	9597000	I've met Junami and
9597000	9599000	I just stayed for a long time.
9599000	9601000	And if you guys weren't here
9601000	9603000	I wouldn't have started, had the
9603000	9605000	inspiration to start this ingenious radio.
9605000	9607000	We're just still going by the way.
9607000	9609000	Congratulations on that.
9609000	9611000	I actually was, I mean this is going to sound terrible
9611000	9613000	but I knew you guys had started the show
9613000	9615000	or the station. I knew it was kind of like
9615000	9617000	you know a spin off of what had
9617000	9619000	been going on at OLR but I actually thought
9619000	9621000	it stopped during the time
9621000	9623000	we were doing all games but apparently it hadn't.
9623000	9625000	It's still going.
9625000	9627000	Yep. We're still doing. Congrats on that.
9627000	9629000	You guys have got to be getting up to like
9629000	9631000	eight or nine years yourselves.
9631000	9633000	No. Really?
9633000	9635000	Probably about four or five maybe.
9635000	9637000	I thought it was more than that. Alright.
9637000	9639000	We've been around for a while. I started on Live 365
9639000	9641000	back in the day
9641000	9643000	and like I was just starting it
9643000	9645000	and I was like huh.
9645000	9647000	Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of
9647000	9649000	like took over from there and
9649000	9651000	created like a solid stream and everything.
9651000	9653000	I ask him every now and then if I can
9653000	9655000	start my own stream you know
9655000	9657000	stream on the station
9657000	9659000	and he lets me every now and then
9659000	9661000	but I haven't gotten contact with him
9661000	9663000	for like a few months but I do too.
9663000	9665000	I think one of the best comments we ever
9665000	9667000	get on the show about
9667000	9669000	doing the show is that you know you guys
9669000	9671000	because of you guys I kind of
9671000	9673000	figured out how to do my own podcast or
9673000	9675000	I learned that any idiot can podcast
9675000	9677000	because you guys do it so I started
9677000	9679000	my own show and believe it or not that's actually
9679000	9681000	like you know what they say imitation
9681000	9683000	is the finest form of flattery.
9683000	9685000	Not to say that everybody's copying us because
9685000	9687000	I don't think they are but just the fact that
9687000	9689000	we're empowering people to let their own voices
9689000	9691000	be heard means a lot
9691000	9693000	and it's a great compliment. It really is.
9693000	9695000	Yeah.
9695000	9697000	Thank you for being around. If you
9697000	9699000	weren't around I would never
9699000	9701000	have any friends from the DDR
9701000	9703000	universe. I've been friends with
9703000	9705000	Junami for over seven years.
9705000	9707000	Wow. Well congrats and
9707000	9709000	thank you for listening and being here
9709000	9711000	with the show. Do you have anything else you want to share
9711000	9713000	tonight? I love you guys.
9713000	9715000	Mwah. Heart heart heart heart.
9715000	9717000	Hold on hold on somebody else wants to send
9717000	9719000	kisses. Here he is.
9719000	9721000	There you go.
9721000	9723000	Alright. Have a great night
9723000	9727000	uni. Bye. Bye.
9727000	9729000	I don't even have to give the number. The calls just keep coming in.
9729000	9731000	Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio. Who's this?
9731000	9733000	Hello.
9733000	9735000	Hello and let me just say
9735000	9737000	if you're not getting through
9737000	9739000	on Skype it's never
9739000	9741000	been this busy on the phone so just keep
9741000	9743000	trying. We'll get to you eventually. We have
9743000	9745000	a good 30 minutes still to take calls.
9745000	9747000	What's on your mind SSJ100 map?
9747000	9749000	Not much. Just want to
9749000	9751000	congratulate you guys on ten years
9751000	9753000	of amazing work in our radio.
9753000	9755000	Thank you very much.
9755000	9757000	Well you know I was
9757000	9759000	trying to do the map and how long
9759000	9761000	I've been actually listening and I came up
9761000	9763000	with 2004
9763000	9765000	I started listening to the show.
9765000	9767000	Wow that was a long time ago.
9767000	9769000	And thank you for the holiday news.
9769000	9771000	The funny thing is
9771000	9773000	I didn't start listening to
9773000	9775000	all our posts. I think
9775000	9777000	I told you this several times that
9777000	9779000	I started listening to
9779000	9781000	a show that you would have on Wednesday nights
9781000	9783000	on lives 365.
9785000	9787000	Outside the Box.
9787000	9789000	Oh yes. Outside
9789000	9791000	the Box. Oh god. The spinoff
9791000	9793000	shows. Before there
9793000	9795000	was Horde House
9795000	9797000	there were shows, spinoff shows
9797000	9799000	on the Orange Tons
9799000	9801000	Radio network. Yes I
9801000	9803000	remember Outside the Box very well.
9803000	9805000	Which is kind of you know the prerequisite
9805000	9807000	to the video game show
9807000	9809000	that this became.
9809000	9811000	In a way yeah.
9811000	9813000	I never really thought about it that way
9813000	9815000	which I know sounds weird but you're right.
9815000	9817000	We kind of
9817000	9819000	started doing the general gaming
9819000	9821000	chat there. I think I kind of always
9821000	9823000	had the fire in me
9823000	9825000	to do like a general gaming show
9825000	9827000	and like I think maybe subconsciously
9827000	9829000	I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.
9829000	9831000	So that's why we had Outside the Box.
9831000	9833000	I think you know back then
9833000	9835000	it was you
9835000	9837000	DDR Angel and Wanky Style
9837000	9839000	kind of thing.
9839000	9841000	So
9841000	9843000	yeah now that's what I started with.
9843000	9845000	I was originally
9845000	9847000	introduced to the show by Sephora 12
9847000	9849000	16
9849000	9851000	who
9851000	9853000	you know
9853000	9855000	who caught on to it from
9855000	9857000	DDR Freak re-broadcasting
9857000	9859000	the show.
9859000	9861000	Oh yeah DDR Freak.
9861000	9863000	Yeah they re-broadcast it.
9863000	9865000	They re-broadcast it.
9865000	9867000	Like that.
9867000	9869000	SSJ 100 Matt I have something special
9869000	9871000	just for you.
9871000	9873000	Since you brought up old memories
9873000	9875000	here's a really old memory.

9911000	9913000	and Wanky Style.
9913000	9915000	I remember the one
9915000	9917000	cause I used to play
9917000	9919000	Final Fantasy 11 right next to you guys
9919000	9921000	on that.
9921000	9923000	It was
9923000	9925000	Final Fantasy 7
9925000	9927000	where you guys were playing One Winged Angel
9927000	9929000	or whatever.
9929000	9931000	MURDER!
9931000	9933000	Yeah that was a good memory.
9933000	9935000	You know you bring up a good point
9935000	9937000	that really was
9937000	9939000	I mean especially as you listen to the intro
9939000	9941000	it's about video games
9941000	9943000	and all the randomness outside the box.
9943000	9945000	That's kind of this fucking show
9945000	9947000	now.
9947000	9949000	So in a way Outside the Box took over
9949000	9951000	you make a damn good point.
9951000	9953000	Yeah.
9953000	9955000	Well most of all you know
9955000	9957000	all of that has always been about the community
9957000	9959000	the fans and everything
9959000	9961000	and I think over the past ten years
9961000	9963000	we've kind of grown to a really nice community.
9963000	9965000	We've
9965000	9967000	gotten friends involved in the show
9967000	9969000	I mean I've got
9969000	9971000	I've told a couple of people
9971000	9973000	and now you guys
9973000	9975000	while we are
9975000	9977000	going to have a dream game about you
9977000	9979000	guys coming out.
9979000	9981000	So you know
9981000	9983000	I've always said tell a friend
9983000	9985000	and it's true
9985000	9987000	tell a friend
9987000	9989000	and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.
9989000	9991000	That's right and then it funds my future trips
9991000	9993000	to New York which I'm trying to get back to
9993000	9995000	but $800 will go a long way
9995000	9997000	and get me back to New York. No I'm kidding
9997000	9999000	but I will be trying to get back to New York
9999000	10001000	with my own money very soon so that will be awesome.
10001000	10003000	It's true you know
10003000	10005000	I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations
10005000	10007000	and
10007000	10009000	next time I see
10009000	10011000	any of you guys
10011000	10013000	I'll buy you a beer or
10013000	10015000	probably in your case red mango
10015000	10017000	or pinkberry.
10017000	10019000	I'll take free beer
10019000	10021000	and free yogurt.
10021000	10023000	And I will always exchange holiday cards with you.
10023000	10025000	That's true.
10025000	10027000	Alright well thank you so much for your
10027000	10029000	support SSG100M. It was a pleasure
10029000	10031000	meeting you a couple times and
10031000	10033000	I'm sure I'll see you guys again
10033000	10035000	up in New York. Absolutely.
10035000	10037000	Alright take care buddy.
10037000	10039000	You know without SSG100M
10039000	10041000	I want to say without him
10041000	10043000	I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show
10043000	10045000	and I see YYR is in chat so he can confirm
10045000	10047000	or deny this. YYR of course
10047000	10049000	is making the first
10049000	10051000	OLR dream game a reality
10051000	10053000	budget ferret tossing which I guess he's in like
10053000	10055000	push push push mode with it right now and it sounds
10055000	10057000	like it's gonna be
10057000	10059000	a big game. Like it's gonna be
10059000	10061000	one that people are talking about outside this show.
10061000	10063000	That is awesome. Cause it's
10063000	10065000	gonna be awesome. We're gonna do all we
10065000	10067000	can to make bungee ferret tossing a success.
10067000	10069000	You know what I actually have
10069000	10071000	to thank SSG100M for having
10071000	10073000	a hand in helping me with my
10073000	10075000	conversion. Oh
10075000	10077000	that's true. That is that's there
10077000	10079000	we go. That's the big thing you went through personally.
10079000	10081000	Yeah. On this show.
10081000	10083000	Well I did get married. Oh yeah
10083000	10085000	there's that too. Eh that's no
10085000	10087000	big deal. I'm just kidding.
10087000	10089000	Alright um
10089000	10091000	I mean I got married too.
10091000	10093000	I'm not making a big deal out of it. I got
10093000	10095000	I had like four boyfriends
10095000	10097000	alright listen
10097000	10099000	but this one's the best one
10099000	10101000	obviously. I agree.
10101000	10103000	Me too. Alright let's move on.
10103000	10105000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
10105000	10107000	Hello.
10107000	10109000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's
10109000	10111000	this? This is Rama from
10111000	10113000	Indonesia. Whoa
10113000	10115000	we got a call from Indonesia tonight?
10115000	10117000	Yes. I
10117000	10119000	recognize your name from Twitter. I'm
10119000	10121000	happy you're listening live. What's up
10121000	10123000	buddy? Yeah
10123000	10125000	it's fun. It's nice to talk to
10125000	10127000	you finally because I've been here
10127000	10129000	for you know like um
10129000	10131000	since 06 I guess.
10131000	10133000	Oh my gosh. Well to what do
10133000	10135000	we owe this phone call tonight?
10135000	10137000	Yeah so I just want to say
10137000	10139000	that you know maybe I'm the
10139000	10141000	father's caller.
10141000	10143000	I did enjoy everything
10143000	10145000	that you know even though I'm blind
10145000	10147000	personally I can enjoy everything
10147000	10149000	that you've done. I'm
10149000	10151000	especially lucky and all
10151000	10153000	of that kind of joke
10153000	10155000	it's nice. Unfortunately
10155000	10157000	because of the distance you're breaking up really
10157000	10159000	bad and we're having a hard time hearing you but

10177000	10179000	humbling in a way because you know

10243000	10245000	hello hey
10245000	10247000	not much uh just first off
10247000	10249000	I want to wish you guys a happy
10249000	10251000	10 year anniversary since
10251000	10253000	you're wondering if your podcast I know has been around
10253000	10255000	for 10 years
10255000	10257000	we are finally snatching the crown
10257000	10259000	of we are the longest running video game
10259000	10261000	podcast on the internet we've done some heavy
10261000	10263000	research and we don't
10263000	10265000	think anybody has been around
10265000	10267000	right now anyway as long
10267000	10269000	as we have
10269000	10271000	you know it's a nice feather to put in our hat
10271000	10273000	um but what we don't want
10273000	10275000	to do is we don't want to be all like
10275000	10277000	well we're the best
10277000	10279000	cause we've been around that long cause that's
10279000	10281000	not the impression we want to give there's a lot
10281000	10283000	of great great shows out
10283000	10285000	there and you know just the other day I was
10285000	10287000	kind of talking on twitter with uh
10287000	10289000	video game outsiders you know I brought them up on the show plenty
10289000	10291000	of times I think they're a great show they have a
10291000	10293000	very similar chemistry to what we have here
10293000	10295000	except they kind of like whereas
10295000	10297000	our foundation is DDR
10297000	10299000	they were an adult gaming community
10299000	10301000	that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter
10301000	10303000	games so obviously a very different type
10303000	10305000	of thing but they were talking about like wow
10305000	10307000	we've been around for 7 years but
10307000	10309000	I guess they had to correct somebody like oh yeah
10309000	10311000	OLR's been around longer but I'm like dude don't
10311000	10313000	sell yourselves short what you guys have accomplished
10313000	10315000	in 7 years is amazing
10315000	10317000	most shows don't get to
10317000	10319000	6 months or 1 year
10319000	10321000	and you know to have your
10321000	10323000	own community and all that is just
10323000	10325000	it's an amazing
10325000	10327000	feeling it really is so anyway
10327000	10329000	that's exactly the reason why
10329000	10331000	I try to listen to you guys
10331000	10333000	as much as I can because
10333000	10335000	it's mostly the community that actually has
10335000	10337000	me hooked on it I've met
10337000	10339000	a lot of great people on there
10339000	10341000	some in real life and some I wish
10341000	10343000	I could meet in real life one day
10343000	10345000	you know I've met some
10345000	10347000	I knew DJ Ramus from a while back
10347000	10349000	from some of the conventions I finally
10349000	10351000	got to meet actually I got to hang out with Misty
10351000	10353000	a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic
10353000	10355000	I got to meet
10355000	10357000	some of the other people like the
10357000	10359000	Effective Candy way back in the day
10359000	10361000	and Gamer Girl is one of my closest
10361000	10363000	friends now and even
10363000	10365000	Jamie it's like so I don't talk to her
10365000	10367000	I still consider her really cool and
10367000	10369000	one of the people I admire the most
10369000	10371000	aww
10371000	10373000	now I'm gonna cry
10373000	10375000	oh someone's chopping onions in the
10375000	10377000	OLR studios oh shut up
10377000	10379000	oh just wait till October dude
10379000	10381000	what's in October
10381000	10383000	oh yeah there's a
10383000	10385000	train gathering I'm hanging out
10385000	10387000	with Misty for that one in Philly
10387000	10389000	that's awesome just to know that like this
10389000	10391000	show made people like want to hang out
10391000	10393000	is so cool
10393000	10395000	and just we really need to make
10395000	10397000	an effort to get to more conventions and
10397000	10399000	do these like especially packs because that's
10399000	10401000	you know that's the one that all the fans want to get to
10401000	10403000	and just like try to get people together and just like
10403000	10405000	hey let's let's go do
10405000	10407000	what this show
10407000	10409000	was think about it
10409000	10411000	this show is because we used to go to the
10411000	10413000	arcades and play video games and talk shit
10413000	10415000	so let's get together IRL
10415000	10417000	play video games and talk shit
10417000	10419000	exactly
10419000	10421000	oh my god did you see that guy
10421000	10423000	Rob holding onto the bar
10423000	10425000	what you did this week
10425000	10427000	I forgot I mentioned um
10427000	10429000	well I didn't play it but I installed Step
10429000	10431000	maybe on my laptop mainly because
10431000	10433000	I was looking for sound files from 4th Mix
10433000	10435000	but I couldn't find them but uh
10435000	10437000	yeah
10437000	10439000	I have to admit when I was playing
10439000	10441000	DDR this week cause I did play Max 2
10441000	10443000	and I played Disney Rave once each
10443000	10445000	and I have to admit there was a part of me
10445000	10447000	that even though that dance pad was ass
10447000	10449000	cause it was from a golf land and one of the buttons
10449000	10451000	didn't even work there was a part of me that went
10451000	10453000	I kind of missed this
10453000	10455000	yeah well I was watching was it 4th
10455000	10457000	Mix Plus and 4th Mix
10457000	10459000	videos and stuff like that I'm like damn
10459000	10461000	I missed that machine was awesome
10461000	10463000	even just 4th Mix and stuff
10463000	10465000	Max and Max 2 were
10465000	10467000	pretty sweet and
10467000	10469000	I kind of wish we had like something cause like I was even
10469000	10471000	looking at some of the uh cause I never really
10471000	10473000	got into Supernova and Supernova 2
10473000	10475000	and like I don't even know what the hell they have
10475000	10477000	now it's like uh that
10477000	10479000	versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff
10479000	10481000	and there's like you know
10481000	10483000	I don't even know what
10483000	10485000	half of these songs are anymore
10485000	10487000	because I haven't played any of the
10487000	10489000	you know Bomani games in a while but it's like
10489000	10491000	that'd be kind of fun to go back
10491000	10493000	I have to admit there was a part of me that didn't want
10493000	10495000	to get up on the machine because I was like here I am
10495000	10497000	there's all these teenagers running around
10497000	10499000	all these people at the water park
10499000	10501000	here I am 34 years old
10501000	10503000	and I want to get up on that machine
10503000	10505000	and play DDR and make a fool of myself
10505000	10507000	but there really came a point where I said you know what
10507000	10509000	fuck em
10509000	10511000	hey man
10511000	10513000	I did the same exact thing um
10513000	10515000	when I was at Anime Central this uh this year
10515000	10517000	they had a 4th Mix Plus machine
10517000	10519000	and I got on
10519000	10521000	and I started
10521000	10523000	I started doing tech and then
10523000	10525000	I think through the 2nd song I said ah
10525000	10527000	fuck this I'm not a techie
10527000	10529000	so I freestyled the rest of the damn
10529000	10531000	damn stages
10531000	10533000	nice that is awesome
10533000	10535000	and also there in over
10535000	10537000	New Jersey down to Jersey Shore
10537000	10539000	there is an older but still
10539000	10541000	workable 7th Mix
10541000	10543000	wow
10543000	10545000	that's pretty cool
10545000	10547000	that's awesome that there's still lots of DDR machines
10547000	10549000	that are working everywhere you know I should make it a goal
10549000	10551000	to go play DDR as many places as possible
10551000	10553000	before it's a thing of the past for real
10553000	10555000	for real so
10555000	10557000	alright, DDR Tell the Bill I gotta let you go

10599000	10601000	you know the only reason
10601000	10603000	I found you guys was through Bobby Black Wolf
10603000	10605000	show because I was a big fan of
10605000	10607000	Friday Night Gaming and I believe
10607000	10609000	that the partnership that you guys
10609000	10611000	have got
10611000	10613000	together now is going to
10613000	10615000	bring you to a much better future
10615000	10617000	and I'm so
10617000	10619000	glad to be around
10619000	10621000	seeing this you know
10621000	10623000	well you know Bobby and
10623000	10625000	us you know are very kind of like
10625000	10627000	minded I mean Bobby was a big music
10627000	10629000	game fan as well if you
10629000	10631000	kind of look at our classic game of the week BeatMania
10631000	10633000	2DX Bobby will admit that's one of his
10633000	10635000	favorite games he even said in chat he would have
10635000	10637000	that game in his basement so there's a lot
10637000	10639000	that Bobby and us have in common yet we're
10639000	10641000	different enough where that our shows kind of
10641000	10643000	are different you know he's the very NPR show
10643000	10645000	we're the very morning room
10645000	10647000	waka waka waka type of show
10647000	10649000	and uh you know
10649000	10651000	we need a waka waka waka soundboard
10651000	10653000	but you know the two of us
10653000	10655000	actually compliment each other very well and I think
10655000	10657000	kind of professionally there's a lot we
10657000	10659000	look at too and you know especially
10659000	10661000	you know obviously it's no secret there's been some
10661000	10663000	big changes in the past year and there was
10663000	10665000	a lot that we were looking at going
10665000	10667000	what could we be doing better we kind of
10667000	10669000	feel like right now we're kind of
10669000	10671000	we're kind of riding a stationary bike
10671000	10673000	right now we're doing our things
10673000	10675000	we're burning calories we ain't going anywhere
10675000	10677000	so how can we take
10677000	10679000	this to the next level and you know that's
10679000	10681000	Bobby's a great business partner
10681000	10683000	in that regard and shit I mean
10683000	10685000	look at what he has done with vog network
10685000	10687000	dot com look at that website
10687000	10689000	that is in a month
10689000	10691000	I mean it's amazing
10691000	10693000	so and you
10693000	10695000	know and I wouldn't have been listening to your show
10695000	10697000	without him and I'm so
10697000	10699000	glad that I stumbled upon it unfortunately
10699000	10701000	during my
10701000	10703000	my current situation at the time
10703000	10705000	when I first started listening to
10705000	10707000	Bobby I wasn't able to hear your
10707000	10709000	show but now that I'm more involved with it I'm

10773000	10775000	you know what Rob?
10775000	10777000	go ahead Dark Soccer first
10777000	10779000	in the article that
10779000	10781000	Tara wrote on Geek Life there's actually a link
10781000	10783000	to
10783000	10785000	the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio
10785000	10787000	back in the day that talked about our first few shows
10787000	10789000	so I relinked that in the chatroom
10789000	10791000	yes very cool
10791000	10793000	speaking of the clubhouse I was trying to visit the clubhouse
10793000	10795000	yesterday
10795000	10797000	I'm so glad I've never come back
10797000	10799000	to home because I tried
10799000	10801000	you know I downloaded the new client
10801000	10803000	and which I'm pissed off
10803000	10805000	because it didn't fucking save my crazy
10805000	10807000	hobo Santa
10807000	10809000	which is weird
10809000	10811000	so I had a new character so I was like
10811000	10813000	okay I'm going to check out the clothes in there
10813000	10815000	crash okay fine
10815000	10817000	I'm not going to check out the clothes relaunch the whole thing again
10817000	10819000	I'm going to try altering my appearance
10819000	10821000	crash again so I'm like fuck this
10821000	10823000	I'm not coming back to home
10823000	10825000	we got another call coming in I want to get to but let me just say this
10825000	10827000	I think home would benefit greatly if they would just
10827000	10829000	force you to do a 2 gig download
10829000	10831000	up front I mean there's just so much
10831000	10833000	buffering and loading
10833000	10835000	and you know it's just that's the one
10835000	10837000	drawback it's not as
10837000	10839000	smooth it's not
10839000	10841000	as seamless that's what I'm looking for of an experience
10841000	10843000	as it ought to be and if it was
10843000	10845000	that seamless experience I think home would
10845000	10847000	be the thing everybody's talking
10847000	10849000	about but certainly it has its fans
10849000	10851000	you know and I think because of
10851000	10853000	the environment that it does provide it's
10853000	10855000	kind of similar to Second Life but for gamers anyway
10855000	10857000	I won't get too far into that let me go to the phones
10857000	10859000	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?
10859000	10861000	It's the one and only Ranma
10861000	10863000	Hey Ranma what's up you finally got through
10863000	10865000	Yes cause you know you can't have an anniversary show
10865000	10867000	without me doing the toast
10867000	10869000	Oh you missed us with
10869000	10871000	the wine already but I guess
10871000	10873000	I have some grapefruit soda
10873000	10875000	for you buddy
10875000	10877000	Of course you know cause this year
10877000	10879000	it's ten years
10879000	10881000	ten great years of friendship which is
10881000	10883000	an awesome thing cause you know why?
10883000	10885000	Friends rock? Friends give you money when you're
10885000	10887000	poor? Yes my friendship is magic don't forget
10887000	10889000	Ugh die
10889000	10891000	Hehehe
10891000	10893000	But I have here
10893000	10895000	three drinks I have a Loki
10895000	10897000	I have a Jamie
10897000	10899000	and I have a Rob
10899000	10901000	Now the first drink I dedicate to Loki
10901000	10903000	is a shot of very
10903000	10905000	strong honey mead
10905000	10907000	because he is straight forward
10907000	10909000	to the point we'll say what he
10909000	10911000	has to say and in the end
10911000	10913000	Honey Badger doesn't give a fuck
10913000	10915000	And it burns a little going down does it?
10915000	10917000	Ah yes
10917000	10919000	Let's just walk away from that comment
10919000	10921000	On the bottle
10921000	10923000	Ew he's eating that snake that's disgusting
10923000	10925000	Now
10925000	10927000	Next up I
10927000	10929000	have for Jamie
10929000	10931000	Now for Christmas I got this nice
10931000	10933000	bottle of rum
10933000	10935000	It's very potent, very powerful
10935000	10937000	and I only open it for
10937000	10939000	special occasions and close friends
10939000	10941000	and Jamie is my darling Oogchon
10941000	10943000	so I toast
10943000	10945000	this glass to her
10945000	10947000	Thank you Ronchon
10947000	10949000	I think it might have onions in it
10949000	10951000	I think it might have a little onion in it
10951000	10953000	I'm gonna have a beer for you when I get home
10953000	10955000	Make sure it's a Guinness
10955000	10957000	I'm not a Guinness but it's a Killians
10957000	10959000	Now
10959000	10961000	I have here a drink
10961000	10963000	that Ron would probably enjoy
10963000	10965000	because we made this at a con a couple
10965000	10967000	of years ago, it's called
10967000	10969000	Captain Fabulous
10969000	10971000	It's one part Captain
10971000	10973000	Morgan and two parts
10973000	10975000	Fruit Punch, thus the name Captain
10975000	10977000	Fabulous
10977000	10979000	I remember Captain Fabulous
10979000	10981000	and it is Fabulous
10981000	10983000	Oh definitely, oh girl
10983000	10985000	Do you remember the drink we invented at Fanime?
10985000	10987000	When all we had was the
10987000	10989000	bottle of pineapple Malibu so we
10989000	10991000	paid five bucks for twenty ounce
10991000	10993000	of 7-Up
10993000	10995000	That was so epic
10995000	10997000	We made that 7-Up last and we're
10997000	10999000	playing apples to apples
10999000	11001000	Oh hell yes
11001000	11003000	Drunk on pineapple Malibu and 7-Up
11003000	11005000	Oh Oogchon you are the party girl
11005000	11007000	And you saw me through
11007000	11009000	my horrible cosplay
11009000	11011000	There's no such thing as horrible cosplay
11011000	11013000	get over that, come on now
11013000	11015000	We didn't get to go to
11015000	11017000	Fanime to do like, because that was one of the plans
11017000	11019000	was well we're gonna do something at Fanime for our
11019000	11021000	ten year anniversary or whatever
11021000	11023000	I still have my costume from Halloween
11023000	11025000	in my car
11025000	11027000	I was waiting to use that again
11027000	11029000	Alright well Ron I gotta let you
11029000	11031000	go to try and squeeze in a few more calls
11031000	11033000	I didn't even do it, I didn't even take the drink yet
11033000	11035000	Drink it! Drink it!

11077000	11079000	lounge radio, it was gay pride this weekend
11079000	11081000	by the way, in San Francisco
11081000	11083000	and that brought up the conversation in the chat room
11083000	11085000	what if OLR had a pride parade
11085000	11087000	what would be the first float
11087000	11089000	and I said of course the opening
11089000	11091000	float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float
11091000	11093000	followed immediately
11093000	11095000	by Dykes on Bikes, because you
11095000	11097000	can't have a parade without
11097000	11099000	Dykes on Bikes, I'm sorry
11099000	11101000	That's what the people are coming out to see
11101000	11103000	I totally saw Dykes on Bikes
11103000	11105000	today at the parade
11105000	11107000	Did you?
11107000	11109000	Yes, there was a few naked
11109000	11111000	Dykes on Bikes at the parade today too
11111000	11113000	That's cause you're in San Francisco
11113000	11115000	home of the finest, alright let's take some more
11115000	11117000	calls, hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

11119000	11121000	Hey Acteft, what's up?
11121000	11123000	Well, first of all
11123000	11125000	I want to again
11125000	11127000	thank you for 10 years of
11127000	11129000	magnificent online radio
11129000	11131000	Thank you very much
11131000	11133000	and thank you for being a part of it
11133000	11135000	I actually say
11135000	11137000	my words in Spanish, even though
11137000	11139000	you probably won't understand it, but
11139000	11141000	you know the message, you know the feeling
11141000	11143000	So
11143000	11165000	...
11165000	11167000	There it is
11167000	11169000	That was very nice, thank you
11169000	11171000	I wanna make a joke about how
11171000	11173000	we know that's a song you sing at funerals
11173000	11175000	but I'm gonna stay away from doing that joke
11175000	11177000	cause it'd be disrespectful and I think
11177000	11179000	that was
11179000	11181000	very lovely, no really, thank you
11181000	11183000	It's humbling
11183000	11185000	to know that it's a worldwide
11185000	11187000	show and we've even been complimented before
11187000	11189000	and I take great pride
11189000	11191000	in this, speaking of OLR Pride
11191000	11193000	I take great pride in the fact that we do try to
11193000	11195000	remember that we do have a worldwide audience out there
11195000	11197000	that we're not, you know, the show from the Americas
11197000	11199000	you know, there
11199000	11201000	there is a whole world out there
11201000	11203000	And thank you for doing a bumper for us
11203000	11205000	Yeah, for VOG, yeah
11205000	11207000	Yeah, no problem, and again, thanks
11207000	11209000	for being, well, who you are
11209000	11211000	and bringing us every week
11211000	11213000	a very good show, even though we have
11213000	11215000	we have had some problems
11215000	11217000	from their side and even on my side
11217000	11219000	it's still a pleasure
11219000	11221000	and still pretty
11221000	11223000	enjoying to listen to you
11223000	11225000	well, listen to you every week
11225000	11227000	Damn, I'm
11227000	11229000	kinda nervous because I'm excited
11229000	11231000	Let me put it this way, if friends
11231000	11233000	agreed on every single solitary thing
11233000	11235000	they'd be really boring
11235000	11237000	That's true
11239000	11241000	So we'll end on that note
11241000	11243000	Act Def, thank you so much, and enjoy
11243000	11245000	that Kirby collection coming out later this year
11245000	11247000	Yeah, I will. I thought of you when I saw that
11247000	11249000	Alright, later buddy

11259000	11261000	it's already after 9
11261000	11263000	That's alright, we can go a little long tonight
11263000	11265000	We can go a little long tonight
11265000	11267000	I gotta let the rest of that wine burn
11267000	11269000	off so I can take
11269000	11271000	It's already gone
11271000	11273000	I had to put mine in the fridge, I didn't want to finish it off
11273000	11275000	because I don't want to drive drunk, that's irresponsible
11275000	11277000	so
11277000	11279000	Alright, oh
11279000	11281000	there it goes, lighting up again, hi, you're on

11291000	11293000	Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you
11293000	11295000	on your teniversary
11299000	11301000	Pretty soon this show will be older than you, George
11301000	11303000	I know, I'm looking forward to it
11307000	11309000	George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?
11309000	11311000	That's what I want to know
11311000	11313000	Oh, I don't know
11313000	11315000	I guess it's just my natural charm
11315000	11317000	No, it's
11317000	11319000	Sturlock, hi, how's it going?
11319000	11321000	It's good, no, that was a good impression
11321000	11323000	I gotta say
11323000	11325000	Oh my
11325000	11327000	What's on your mind, Sturlock?
11327000	11329000	Besides, apparently, George Takei
11331000	11333000	No, I don't know
11333000	11335000	I've always wanted to do that
11335000	11337000	I don't know, a long time ago
11337000	11339000	like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned
11339000	11341000	something about George Takei
11341000	11343000	and um
11343000	11345000	He needs to be my gay daddy
11347000	11349000	Well, I thought about calling in
11349000	11351000	to the voicemail or something
11351000	11353000	and just leaving a message as George Takei
11353000	11355000	saying like, oh, I heard your comments
11355000	11357000	and I just wanted to say thank you
11357000	11359000	but uh, anyway
11359000	11361000	It's that George Takei
11361000	11363000	has a really sexy voice
11363000	11365000	That's just all it is
11365000	11367000	It's a sexy, sexy voice
11367000	11369000	It is
11369000	11371000	Ever since that one commercial he did
11371000	11373000	about the basketball player
11373000	11375000	you know, running his hand along the guy's thigh
11375000	11377000	I was like, that is a porn voice
11377000	11379000	You
11379000	11381000	You forget, when you hear George Takei's
11381000	11383000	voice, you kind of forget that he's 78
11383000	11385000	and you still want to sleep with it, you know?
11385000	11387000	I know, he doesn't, you cannot tell
11387000	11389000	by his voice that he's that old
11389000	11391000	He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know
11391000	11393000	He just always had that deep and
11393000	11395000	melodious theatrical voice
11395000	11397000	Oh my
11425000	11427000	and there was also reaction today
11427000	11429000	from a prominent member of the gay community
11429000	11431000	including this celebrity
11431000	11457000	who went so far as to tape a PSA
11461000	11471000	Heh
11471000	11477000	Heh
11477000	11485000	Heh
11485000	11495000	Heh
11495000	11505000	Heh
11505000	11513000	Heh
11513000	11515000	Alright, I'm sorry, that was quiet
11515000	11517000	but unfortunately that was at max
11517000	11519000	volume because YouTube's aren't
11519000	11521000	standardized, unfortunately
11521000	11523000	I hadn't heard that, actually, that was awesome
11523000	11525000	Oh, it's frickin' amazing, I love George Takei
11525000	11527000	But anyway, I wanted to
11527000	11529000	talk about how I discovered
11529000	11531000	O.L.R. Oh, please
11531000	11533000	Kind of an interesting
11533000	11535000	I came in at a weird time
11535000	11537000	I came in
11537000	11539000	sometime in 2007
11539000	11541000	back when
11541000	11543000	It was in that weird point where
11543000	11545000	you guys were being syndicated
11545000	11547000	on All Games but not
11547000	11549000	broadcasting from there
11549000	11551000	Oh right, yeah, we were the first affiliate show
11551000	11553000	on All Games Radio and
11553000	11555000	yeah, and again, Bobby was the station
11555000	11557000	manager at All Games at the time and you know
11557000	11559000	because he liked O.L.R.
11559000	11561000	and he knew we were doing the syndication
11561000	11563000	with DDR Freak Radio for a time
11563000	11565000	he'd offered it up to us and we were like
11565000	11567000	heck yeah, more people to hear our show? Of course
11567000	11569000	Why not? So yeah, that was
11569000	11571000	a great thing for us
11571000	11573000	So I remember when the whole
11573000	11575000	live 365 crap went down
11575000	11577000	when they were raising their prices
11577000	11579000	and you guys weren't sure what
11579000	11581000	you were going to do for a while
11581000	11583000	That is very true
11583000	11585000	But yeah
11585000	11587000	I've been, I don't know
11587000	11589000	I forget what my first
11589000	11591000	exact episode was
11591000	11593000	It was like
11593000	11595000	I don't know, in the 150's I want to say
11595000	11597000	or maybe 250's
11597000	11599000	But
11599000	11601000	I don't know, there was just something
11601000	11603000	about the chemistry
11603000	11605000	there with the three guys
11605000	11607000	and it was just a lot of fun to listen
11607000	11609000	to and very funny
11609000	11611000	and entertaining and I was just
11611000	11613000	kind of hooked
11613000	11615000	Well thank you for getting hooked on whatever
11615000	11617000	crack cocaine we must be offering because
11617000	11619000	people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough
11619000	11621000	I just gotta go back and get another hit
11621000	11623000	I don't know
11623000	11625000	Now it's just like, I can't imagine
11625000	11627000	not listening to it on Sunday nights
11627000	11629000	It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like
11629000	11631000	well shit, what am I going to do for three hours?
11631000	11633000	It's a nice sentiment but it's also
11633000	11635000	a little bit scary I got to admit because you know
11635000	11637000	as they say, all good things
11637000	11639000	must come to an end. There will be a time when
11639000	11641000	OLR will end. I'm not saying it's happening now
11641000	11643000	or that it's even planned
11643000	11645000	but you know, shit happens
11645000	11647000	Yeah And we've had our scares
11647000	11649000	We have had many scares here
11649000	11651000	on Orange Lawns Radio
11651000	11653000	Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still
11653000	11655000	here but you know, there is going to come a time where
11655000	11657000	we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending
11657000	11659000	and that's
11659000	11661000	the impact that's going to have on some
11661000	11663000	people, I'm always like
11663000	11665000	well thank god we have an archive of
11665000	11667000	400 plus episodes that people
11667000	11669000	could always go back and listen to
11669000	11671000	When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode
11671000	11673000	that I have and just marathon it
11673000	11675000	I have a new friend
11675000	11677000	I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well
11677000	11679000	You know this girl, right?
11679000	11681000	And she loves
11681000	11683000	Beverly Hills 90210
11683000	11685000	And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended
11685000	11687000	Not the new one, we don't count it
11687000	11689000	She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended
11689000	11691000	So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD
11691000	11693000	Aww
11693000	11695000	We hope
11695000	11697000	It's just like with the new
11697000	11699000	Thundercats where
11699000	11701000	I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon
11701000	11703000	but it's like
11703000	11705000	like most things
11705000	11707000	that are remade, it just
11707000	11709000	pales in comparison to the classic
11709000	11711000	80's cartoon
11711000	11713000	The same mutual friend introduced
11713000	11715000	me to a side a while back that's actually gone now
11715000	11717000	that's called Elijah Wood is very
11717000	11719000	very very very very very gay
11719000	11721000	It was all
11721000	11723000	kind of fuchsia colored
11723000	11725000	Nice
11725000	11727000	I saw her the other day!
11727000	11729000	I know, she told me about it. Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that
11729000	11731000	because there's something else involving her that's happening
11731000	11733000	next week that I want you to be a part of
11733000	11735000	Alright, and you're going to tell me no
11735000	11737000	Anyway,
11737000	11739000	the philosopher in chat says
11739000	11741000	Don't ever end, I will cry so hard
11741000	11743000	Not half as hard as we probably will
11743000	11745000	Except for Loki, he doesn't cry
11745000	11747000	He'll cry a single man tear
11747000	11749000	Let's not talk about that
11749000	11751000	10 more years, right kids?
11751000	11753000	Yes
11753000	11755000	Oh, and I didn't have it ready
11755000	11757000	but I was going to get you with the vuvuzela again
11757000	11759000	I didn't think of it until like 10 seconds ago
11759000	11761000	Oh, darn, I'm so upset
11761000	11763000	that you weren't able to find that
11763000	11765000	What am I going to do?
11765000	11767000	You can try and squeeze in at least one or two more calls, okay buddy?
11767000	11769000	Alright, take care
11769000	11771000	1-877-GAME-OLR
11771000	11773000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
11773000	11775000	Let's go to the phones
11775000	11777000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
11777000	11779000	Hey guys
11779000	11781000	Is that DDR Angel?
11781000	11783000	It is so good to hear from you
11783000	11785000	The brain's behind the EcoMaker
11785000	11787000	I know
11787000	11789000	Isn't he great?
11789000	11791000	Well, okay, only brain
11791000	11793000	Exactly, website
11793000	11795000	That's your job because you're going to bring back the other thing
11795000	11797000	You can plug the website all you want
11797000	11799000	I can't do that
11799000	11801000	I plugged it
11801000	11803000	Plug's done
11803000	11805000	That's the future, I want to talk about the past
11805000	11807000	But Garris
11807000	11809000	Okay, shut up
11809000	11811000	DDR Angel, you were here
11811000	11813000	for many of the early episodes
11813000	11815000	I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning
11815000	11817000	No, I wasn't
11817000	11819000	Pretty fucking close, all things considered
11819000	11821000	I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39
11821000	11823000	In the scope of
11823000	11825000	462 episodes
11825000	11827000	39 is pretty much the beginning
11827000	11829000	Yeah, well
11829000	11831000	But Angel
11831000	11833000	Shit, I don't even know what to say
11833000	11835000	Thank you
11835000	11837000	for being a big part of those first few episodes
11837000	11839000	I know, I think of you
11839000	11841000	in many ways as one of the
11841000	11843000	first really
11843000	11845000	hardcore passionate people about
11845000	11847000	this show
11847000	11849000	I still love it, you know, every Sunday
11849000	11851000	So, even though I might not be
11851000	11853000	in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always
11853000	11855000	paying attention to tweets and everything else
11855000	11857000	too, so
11857000	11859000	I'm pretty much just like
11859000	11861000	Joe sitting on the couch over there
11861000	11863000	I just want you to know
11863000	11865000	we really appreciate it, because that type of
11865000	11867000	enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like
11867000	11869000	Joe, Misty, JV
11869000	11871000	You know, we have lots of people that are
11871000	11873000	so enthusiastic and everything
11873000	11875000	I just remember you were one of the first
11875000	11877000	I always thank you for that
11877000	11879000	And I personally thank you guys also
11879000	11881000	because, not only for ten years of friendship
11881000	11883000	Thank you
11883000	11885000	But if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have
11885000	11887000	met and married my husband and all that other stuff
11887000	11889000	It's just, you know, it's been a
11889000	11891000	crazy ten years, and I'm just looking forward
11891000	11893000	to ten more plus
11893000	11895000	The crazy thing about what you just said
11895000	11897000	is that you're the second person
11897000	11899000	to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle
11899000	11901000	your story because it's amazing, but
11901000	11903000	Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook
11903000	11905000	that inadvertently, you know, because of
11905000	11907000	OLR, there was Geek Life
11907000	11909000	and because of Geek Life, there was Dan
11909000	11911000	So, kind of the same thing happened for her
11911000	11913000	in a way, and it's... She has a Dan
11913000	11915000	I have a Dan It's so
11915000	11917000	Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way
11917000	11919000	It blows my mind, and in some ways
11919000	11921000	I mean, I didn't meet
11921000	11923000	Alan through OLR, but Alan
11923000	11925000	and I probably got a lot closer because of it
11925000	11927000	So even my own life, this show has had
11927000	11929000	an impact on in that kind of way
11929000	11931000	It's crazy, it's very crazy
11931000	11933000	But great
11933000	11935000	And humbling
11935000	11937000	But maybe we can get together and see if you guys
11937000	11939000	can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show
11939000	11941000	I'm sure we can arrange that
11941000	11943000	Let's work out the beats
11943000	11945000	Yeah, that'd be great
11945000	11947000	Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from
11947000	11949000	all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier
11949000	11951000	I'm not going to be very interesting tonight
11951000	11953000	Big hugs for you and the hubby
11953000	11955000	and thanks for being a part of OLR's history
11955000	11957000	Hugs to you guys too
11957000	11959000	Happy ten years again
11959000	11961000	Bye!
11961000	11963000	That's the time she played DDR was
11963000	11965000	Maybe she's just Angel now
11965000	11967000	I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what
11967000	11969000	Rama wants to know where is
11969000	11971000	Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up
11971000	11973000	Alan is working tonight, he couldn't make the show
11973000	11975000	because he's working
11975000	11977000	Well, you know what, in this economy
11977000	11979000	I am fucking thrilled, he's working tonight
11979000	11981000	don't get me wrong, so
11981000	11983000	But I'm sure he would be here to say hello
11983000	11985000	and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight
11985000	11989000	I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in
11989000	11991000	because I saw a couple
11991000	11993000	But we are getting towards the end of the show
11993000	11995000	How's your headache doing? Are you feeling better?
11995000	11997000	I feel bad
11997000	11999000	I want to say thanks as well to
11999000	12001000	JV Mon because I didn't get to say this on air
12001000	12003000	because you did it during break, but you got us presents
12003000	12007000	and there's nothing I love more in the world than presents
12007000	12009000	and I got brought
12009000	12011000	Dunkin Donuts K-Cups which you can't
12011000	12013000	buy in California
12013000	12015000	The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines
12015000	12017000	We have the old school
12017000	12019000	Keurig machine which we don't use anymore
12019000	12021000	because it sucks
12021000	12023000	but the new one is pretty awesome
12023000	12025000	They need to bring a Dunkin Donuts over here
12025000	12027000	because we don't have a
12027000	12029000	well we have a Krispy Kreme but it's all in Roseville
12029000	12031000	I did drive there one time when I woke up
12031000	12033000	for work at 5 in the morning
12033000	12035000	because I'm like
12035000	12037000	I can't go back to sleep
12037000	12039000	I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville
12039000	12041000	I want a donut
12041000	12043000	Let's go back to the phones
12043000	12045000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio
12045000	12047000	Who's this?
12047000	12049000	Chugga Chugga
12049000	12051000	Chugga Chugga
12051000	12053000	Choo Choo
12053000	12055000	It's Jim Sally
12055000	12057000	What is up Jim Sally?
12057000	12059000	Not much everybody
12059000	12061000	Happy anniversary everybody
12061000	12063000	Thank you, would you buy me?
12063000	12065000	Well I'll tell you what
12065000	12067000	In honor of the donations I will donate
12067000	12069000	one dollar for every minute
12069000	12071000	that this call goes on for
12071000	12073000	How's that sound?
12073000	12075000	Please hold
12077000	12079000	Alright I seriously I'm not going to be
12079000	12081000	looking at the time but that's hilarious
12081000	12083000	What's on your mind buddy?
12083000	12085000	Not much man, I wanted
12085000	12087000	to call in and share some of my
12087000	12089000	Orange Launch Radio stories
12089000	12091000	Please
12091000	12093000	I used to always listen to you guys
12093000	12095000	I'll listen to the Bobby Show
12095000	12097000	Everyone knows about the Bobby Show, it's a great show
12097000	12099000	He's the man
12099000	12101000	He is the man, I wish Bobby lived close to me
12101000	12103000	But anyway I listened to the Bobby Show
12103000	12105000	Then I would listen
12105000	12107000	to a little OLR on live
12107000	12109000	Because I have to always
12109000	12111000	work early in the morning
12111000	12113000	and maybe get like an hour into it
12113000	12115000	This sounds bad, don't take this the wrong way
12115000	12117000	Guys I love you guys, don't take this the wrong way
12117000	12119000	Listen, I would
12119000	12121000	go to bed listening to you and I'd fall
12121000	12123000	asleep listening to you every night
12123000	12125000	I know that sounds horrible, it's just because I was really
12125000	12127000	tired and I had to go to bed
12127000	12129000	I listen to you while I sleep
12129000	12131000	It sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear
12131000	12133000	at night is my voice
12133000	12135000	I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes
12135000	12137000	I don't want to say that
12137000	12139000	And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like
12139000	12141000	God damn it!
12141000	12143000	Yeah
12143000	12145000	I was the champion wrestler in high school man
12145000	12147000	I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen buddy
12147000	12149000	I would snuggle
12149000	12151000	As a caller three calls or so ago would say
12151000	12153000	Oh my
12153000	12155000	Oh that guy was awesome
12155000	12157000	But you know what, no wait guys
12157000	12159000	You know what's nice though, I had a baby
12159000	12161000	about a year ago
12161000	12163000	So I've been having to stay home so my baby would always be
12163000	12165000	shitty at nighttime
12165000	12167000	How'd you accomplish that? I thought you were ill equipped
12167000	12169000	No, I'm Jim Salley
12169000	12171000	I can do anything baby
12171000	12173000	This train is fully equipped
12173000	12175000	You know what I'm saying?
12175000	12177000	Let's not go into details
12177000	12179000	You know what I'm saying?
12179000	12181000	But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you
12181000	12183000	and then I'd listen until midnight, I'd sit in the rocking chair
12183000	12185000	with my baby beside me and the iPod on the
12185000	12187000	table and me and my baby
12187000	12189000	for the last ten and a half months that she's been on
12189000	12191000	we listen every week
12191000	12193000	I don't know if I want to influence a baby
12193000	12195000	because that could be bad
12195000	12197000	I totally want to influence a baby
12197000	12199000	I already know how that turns out
12199000	12201000	It's nice having a baby, it's like a little padawan learner
12201000	12203000	teaching her soul and shit
12203000	12205000	She chokes the shit out of the cat right now
12205000	12207000	She's going to be ready when she gets
12207000	12209000	Fuck that dark side man, all the way
12209000	12211000	Fuck them light side bitches man
12211000	12213000	That's what I tell my baby every night
12213000	12215000	You grow up to be an ultimate fighter
12215000	12217000	I hope so, oh my god
12217000	12219000	My little girl is an ultimate fighter
12219000	12221000	Oh my Jesus
12221000	12223000	Can you imagine?
12223000	12225000	There's only two things I want from my little girl
12225000	12227000	But now there's two things I want from my little girl
12227000	12229000	Number one, please become an MMA fighter
12229000	12231000	The best MMA fighter in the world
12231000	12233000	Pencil hold motherfuckers to death, oh I love her
12233000	12235000	Number two, I pray to Jesus every day
12235000	12237000	She's a lesbian
12237000	12239000	Every day I pray
12239000	12241000	Oh my god, I say Jesus, I think of myself
12241000	12243000	When I was a little boy, when I was like a 15 year old kid
12243000	12245000	I was a pig, I don't want no pig boys
12245000	12247000	hanging around my girl
12247000	12249000	Fuck that shit, I want her to just be a nice lesbian
12249000	12251000	Find a nice girl
12251000	12253000	Get them married, and then when they want to have kids
12253000	12255000	I got two ovens to be baking babies in
12255000	12257000	Double that bacon up baby, bacon ovens baby
12259000	12261000	Double them up
12261000	12263000	The most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear
12263000	12265000	you've given this some detailed thought
12265000	12267000	I'm telling you right now
12267000	12269000	If there was like, you know you can
12269000	12271000	pay for procedures and stuff
12271000	12273000	Do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever
12273000	12275000	If you could pay to turn the gay switch on
12275000	12277000	I would turn it on
12277000	12279000	That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy
12279000	12281000	That's when you gotta
12281000	12283000	sink those genetics in there, I would have done it a long time ago
12283000	12285000	I've thought about this myself
12285000	12287000	cause you know, Dan and I were trying
12287000	12289000	And I wanted to have a lesbian
12289000	12291000	And I'll tell you why
12291000	12293000	I'll tell you why, okay
12293000	12295000	I don't have to
12295000	12297000	pay for a bris
12297000	12299000	And number two
12299000	12301000	I
12301000	12303000	I think of all the money I would save
12303000	12305000	if I had a really dykey baby
12305000	12307000	Well you also gotta think about this too
12307000	12309000	cause you're a chick right, if you had a dykey baby and she was
12309000	12311000	more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe
12311000	12313000	All of a sudden you're wearing the best
12313000	12315000	clothes ever, right, your kids buy them
12315000	12317000	You just steal her from her closet, aw man
12317000	12319000	I gotta say, one of the perks about
12319000	12321000	being gay is that like if I have no clean
12321000	12323000	shirts, oh Alan has a clean shirt, I'll steal that
12323000	12325000	Like it works out really well
12325000	12327000	Clean shirts man
12327000	12329000	Geez, did you really go for pride weekend this weekend guy?
12329000	12331000	No because you know I
12331000	12333000	usually don't because Sundays are the show
12333000	12335000	And I know this
12335000	12337000	I swear I'm not saying this to get pity, I'm really not
12337000	12339000	The show kinda comes
12339000	12341000	first before that, I haven't gone
12341000	12343000	I've gone to some prides
12343000	12345000	but I usually have to like run home in time for the show
12345000	12347000	And I wanna say once or twice
12347000	12349000	in the ten years I did cancel out
12349000	12351000	on the show that week so I could you know do stuff in the city
12351000	12353000	But you know I don't know, I don't get
12353000	12355000	it's all, it's
12355000	12357000	too many people for me
12357000	12359000	I get gay pride
12359000	12361000	like you know in the
12361000	12363000	60's when it was not
12363000	12365000	okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk
12365000	12367000	about and you had to hide it from the
12367000	12369000	world you know and
12369000	12371000	cops tried to arrest you because
12371000	12373000	you know you were gay
12373000	12375000	there was a point where we said
12375000	12377000	you know a bunch of gay people in a bar
12377000	12379000	in New York City said fuck you
12379000	12381000	fuck the police, we are not gonna take this
12381000	12383000	shit anymore and that's what pride
12383000	12385000	is really about celebrating is it's
12385000	12387000	like you know what we're gonna be
12387000	12389000	whoever the fuck we wanna be
12389000	12391000	and deal with it
12391000	12393000	Well can I share a story
12393000	12395000	not to be a complete downer?
12395000	12397000	Well you know what last week was
12397000	12399000	Alan Turing's 100th birthday
12399000	12401000	Oh right yes of course
12401000	12403000	Basically because of him we have computers
12403000	12405000	pretty much and
12405000	12407000	you know at the end of his life
12407000	12409000	it came out that he was gay
12409000	12411000	and his choices were either go to jail or go through
12411000	12413000	hormonal treatment so he killed himself
12413000	12415000	Go to jail? That's so
12415000	12417000	stupid what they would do you know
12417000	12419000	This was in England
12419000	12421000	Well what can you expect sometimes right?
12421000	12423000	They're pretty
12423000	12425000	old school over there I guess. It's dumb though right?
12425000	12427000	It's totally dumb like I'm straight
12427000	12429000	but I go to pride every year and I make a t-shirt
12429000	12431000	every year. Last year I had
12431000	12433000	I'm straight
12433000	12435000	364 days a year and on the back it said
12435000	12437000	today's your lucky day
12437000	12439000	That was a funny shirt right?
12439000	12441000	Like why not? This year I had
12441000	12443000	can a straight guy get some lovin'
12443000	12445000	and I just walked around my arms and I just got hugs from dudes right?
12445000	12447000	Just get some hugs
12447000	12449000	He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens
12449000	12451000	to our brothers man
12451000	12453000	and gentlemen, straight boys
12453000	12455000	I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again
12455000	12457000	the more gay dudes there are in the world
12457000	12459000	the more boobies there are for us okay?
12459000	12461000	So help them out
12461000	12463000	Give them the pride week you know what I mean?
12463000	12465000	Put on this shirt and just go out
12465000	12467000	and have a good time. You can bring your girl
12467000	12469000	no one's gonna hit on her. So why wouldn't you
12469000	12471000	bring your girl with you?
12471000	12473000	It's the best. I remember the first time I went to
12473000	12475000	Gay Days at Disneyland
12475000	12477000	and there were two brothers and one of them says
12477000	12479000	I'm not but he is on his shirt and the other one says
12479000	12481000	I am but he's not
12481000	12483000	I've been to Disneyland. I think every day
12483000	12485000	might be Gay's Day at Disneyland. I don't know
12485000	12487000	This is when everybody's
12487000	12489000	walking around in red shirts
12489000	12491000	You either think it's a bunch of death waiting
12491000	12493000	to happen if you're a Star Trek fan
12493000	12495000	but anyway
12495000	12497000	Alright Jim Sally
12497000	12499000	I gotta let you go but I have loved
12499000	12501000	this call and I've loved talking to you tonight
12501000	12503000	and thank you for your support over the years
12503000	12505000	and whether your daughter
12505000	12507000	grows up to be an

12509000	12511000	grows up to be Miss Canada
12511000	12513000	I know she's gonna be great
12515000	12517000	Thanks guys. I'm just gonna
12517000	12519000	go to bed now and I'm gonna
12519000	12521000	try to smuggle with Loki
12521000	12523000	and go to sleep
12523000	12525000	Goodnight. Goodnight Jim
12525000	12527000	Can Loki say it?
12527000	12529000	He went to the bathroom
12529000	12531000	Your call made him pee
12531000	12533000	I scared the piss out of him
12533000	12535000	Alright Jim
12535000	12537000	Take care buddy
12537000	12539000	Bye

12599000	12601000	celebrating 10 years
12601000	12603000	it's kind of a milestone in the sense
12603000	12605000	that you can walk from one niche
12605000	12607000	genre of video games to encompass
12607000	12609000	just about every genre
12609000	12611000	and I guess part of it
12611000	12613000	was also evolving
12613000	12615000	you had to adapt to the fact
12615000	12617000	that you couldn't just keep
12617000	12619000	shoveling the money for
12619000	12621000	affinity and at some point you had to
12621000	12623000	become a bit more mainstream
12623000	12625000	and so far
12625000	12627000	At some point we had to go from
12627000	12629000	Charmander to Charizard
12629000	12631000	that had to happen
12631000	12633000	That is true
12633000	12635000	That's the whole point of evolving
12635000	12637000	and the fact that you adapted
12637000	12639000	you won podcast awards left and right
12639000	12641000	or you were at least nominated for them
12641000	12643000	Zaku we just wanted to be the very best
12643000	12645000	that no one ever was
12645000	12647000	And also everyone thinks you should be pounding
12647000	12649000	on your keyboard while you're talking
12649000	12651000	I'm not. I'm on my phone
12651000	12653000	right now. I'm still trying to
12653000	12655000	set up a new router that I had to put out
12655000	12657000	fires with. Don't pound the phone
12659000	12661000	So yeah I mean
12661000	12663000	we're pretty much my routine for the past
12663000	12665000	eight years
12665000	12667000	almost on a consecutive basis
12667000	12669000	except for the night that you were off
12669000	12671000	obviously that breaks the streak but
12671000	12673000	you get the idea. It was pretty much consistent
12673000	12675000	Like almost Sunday night
12675000	12677000	starting from like 2004 onwards
12677000	12679000	we're just like listening to you guys
12681000	12683000	pretty much that was it
12683000	12685000	just like going there, listening to all our
12685000	12687000	and that's become almost
12687000	12689000	a routine
12689000	12691000	It is like
12691000	12693000	as you were saying
12693000	12695000	It is kind of life changing
12695000	12697000	that you have something
12697000	12699000	that you
12699000	12701000	just listen to that you try to
12701000	12703000	out of curiosity
12703000	12705000	all of a sudden
12705000	12707000	it just sticks
12707000	12709000	in a good way
12709000	12711000	Well Zaku after all these years what would you say
12711000	12713000	would be your favorite memory involving
12713000	12715000	you and OLR because I know
12715000	12717000	that I have my favorite memory
12717000	12719000	involving you and OLR
12719000	12721000	Oh
12721000	12723000	Me and Kat?
12723000	12725000	Really?
12725000	12727000	You know what I mean?
12727000	12729000	Well
12729000	12731000	It's been in and out
12731000	12733000	but yeah I get the whole point
12733000	12735000	I'm trying to remember right now
12735000	12737000	Geez
12737000	12739000	I think
12739000	12741000	getting like interrupted
12741000	12743000	during a Skype call
12743000	12747000	a few years ago
12747000	12749000	man there's so many
12749000	12751000	it's really really hard to actually
12751000	12753000	nail down on like
12753000	12755000	something
12755000	12757000	and it's just me and Kat
12757000	12759000	and the whole thing else
12759000	12761000	Alright Zaku
12761000	12763000	no matter what I tell the other callers
12763000	12765000	you're my favorite
12765000	12767000	Yeah I'm right
12767000	12769000	Alright take care of Zaku have a good night
12769000	12771000	Yeah definitely
12771000	12773000	and maybe 10 more years
12773000	12775000	left upon you
12775000	12777000	We will try our best
12777000	12779000	We'll need lots of booze to get there
12779000	12781000	Hope to see you when I come to New York next
12781000	12783000	Thank you
12783000	12785000	Hopefully you make it out there
12785000	12787000	like soon
12787000	12789000	Date TBD
12789000	12791000	Alright later buddy
12791000	12793000	Alright
12793000	12795000	Alright
12795000	12797000	Let's go to more calls
12797000	12799000	Nobody asked for it tomorrow
12799000	12801000	Hello
12801000	12803000	Oh it's the intern
12803000	12805000	Hi Drew
12805000	12807000	It's the one who forgets to choose his audio input before calling
12807000	12809000	Yes echo 123 intern
12809000	12811000	after all these years
12811000	12813000	It's been a while
12813000	12815000	Can I be unfired yet?
12815000	12817000	If you write on the blackboard
12817000	12819000	100 times
12819000	12821000	I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Naugahyde
12821000	12823000	I burned it
12823000	12825000	I burned all of them
12825000	12827000	All of the books
12827000	12829000	I just want to congratulate you guys
12829000	12831000	I know I've been with you guys since
12831000	12833000	episode 2
12833000	12835000	and it's been a long crazy ass ride
12835000	12837000	I wasn't even there
12837000	12839000	Joe has you beat by one show
12839000	12841000	How does that make you feel?
12841000	12843000	I know there can be only one
12843000	12845000	so I'm going to have to take his head off one these days
12847000	12849000	What was your favorite memory of OLR
12849000	12851000	because I know I have mine involving you
12851000	12853000	and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table
12853000	12857000	God dammit man
12857000	12859000	I'm just giving you shit, Drew
12859000	12861000	Karyuki Revolution
12861000	12863000	anything involving Karyuki Revolution
12863000	12865000	God what was it
12865000	12867000	Episode 69 we decided to prank you with jelly beans and milkshakes
12869000	12871000	and you took a sip on air
12871000	12873000	the reaction was golden
12875000	12877000	Absolutely priceless
12877000	12879000	You'll have to go find that in the OLR archive
12879000	12881000	Geez, Drew
12881000	12883000	it's been ten years
12883000	12885000	you've been listening to this show for ten years
12885000	12887000	well on and off
12887000	12889000	I imagine
12889000	12891000	what kind of impact has this show had for you?
12891000	12893000	Well, for one it gives me something interesting to talk about
12893000	12895000	at conventions
12895000	12897000	but for that
12897000	12899000	you know, I'm not a really boring guy otherwise
12899000	12901000	And you did transform from being our young Republican
12901000	12903000	to being a long haired hippie
12903000	12905000	Sorry, I'm recovering
12905000	12907000	That's true
12907000	12909000	We really did go through a very
12909000	12911000	psychological shift at one point
12911000	12913000	too, it's kind of neat
12913000	12915000	We all grow up, most of us
12915000	12917000	Y'all do whatever politics you want
12917000	12919000	I don't care
12919000	12921000	this is a diverse place
12921000	12923000	I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360
12923000	12925000	Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person
12925000	12927000	go through that type of change, for sure
12927000	12929000	360?
12929000	12931000	I don't own one of those
12931000	12933000	Better than the Xbox lube
12933000	12935000	Alright, Drew, any final thoughts
12935000	12937000	before we let you go?
12937000	12939000	Hoping for many more years to come
12939000	12941000	and I'm really appreciating
12941000	12943000	the way Orange Launch Radio
12943000	12945000	is going with Voice of Geeks
12945000	12947000	and hopefully everything turns out
12947000	12949000	well, I'll still keep listening
12949000	12951000	I'll still keep phoning in
12951000	12953000	and I'll be a big part of the community
12953000	12955000	that
12955000	12957000	I mean, come on, it's been ten years, I grew up with you guys
12957000	12959000	You did, quite literally
12959000	12961000	Powerful thing to say
12961000	12963000	And you went to school with me
12963000	12965000	Yes, I did
12965000	12967000	We would often run into each other on the lawn
12967000	12969000	at ARC
12969000	12971000	The grassy knoll, which no shots
12971000	12973000	were fired at
12973000	12975000	Which is actually now sort of off limits
12975000	12977000	since they're building the new student center
12977000	12979000	Yeah, which I will never get to see
12979000	12981000	Aww
12981000	12983000	You can always go back and forth
12983000	12985000	Well Drew, thank you so much
12985000	12987000	for being a part of the show for ten years
12987000	12989000	and we'll see you next week
12989000	12991000	Definitely!
12991000	12993000	Bye
12993000	12995000	I think with that I'm gonna finally
12995000	12997000	close the Skype line
12997000	12999000	I am so sorry to those that didn't get through
12999000	13001000	but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B
13001000	13003000	in addition to an hour and a half for Part A
13003000	13005000	Guys, it's okay because of Garris
13005000	13007000	Yeah, and the fact that
13007000	13009000	Dark Soccer and Loki do have to work tomorrow
13009000	13011000	I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV
13011000	13013000	Yay
13013000	13015000	Which is even worse
13015000	13017000	I am so sorry to those of you that didn't get through
13017000	13019000	If you still want to leave some messages, you can certainly leave those on the Skype line
13019000	13021000	Emails would be great too
13021000	13023000	Mailbag at orangeonshooter.com
13023000	13025000	We will get back to them next week because I think it's important to say
13025000	13027000	Same shit, new week
13027000	13029000	next week
13029000	13031000	with episode
13031000	13033000	463
13033000	13035000	Alright, we gotta go around
13035000	13037000	and wrap up the show tonight
13037000	13039000	quickly, last minute stories
13039000	13041000	Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list
13041000	13043000	and then you can add whatever you want to it
13043000	13045000	Just real quickly, some last minute stories
13045000	13047000	that we didn't get to tonight
13047000	13049000	Iron Brothers crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it
13049000	13051000	There's a Kickstarter going on about that
13051000	13053000	And he's local, that's kind of funny
13053000	13055000	And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him
13055000	13057000	and see if he wants to come on OLR to promote that
13057000	13059000	Haven't done that yet, but we will
13059000	13061000	Apparently reskinning the characters, but saying
13061000	13063000	it's not just a reskinning, they want to do
13063000	13065000	vertical levels as well as horizontal
13065000	13067000	It makes sense because you put all this
13067000	13069000	time into a game and then it's like
13069000	13071000	well, I can't really do anything with it because it has all these licensed characters
13071000	13073000	so they're changing it enough to where
13073000	13075000	they can, like we talked about earlier
13075000	13077000	changing it enough to where you can release it without
13077000	13079000	violating any copyright laws
13079000	13081000	Or being violated by the copyright holders
13081000	13083000	Valve and Adult Swim
13083000	13085000	for Team Fortress, I didn't
13085000	13087000	Jamie, this was one of your stories, I don't remember
13087000	13089000	what this was about Yeah, and I already forgot what it was about
13089000	13091000	They're doing some sort of crossover content
13091000	13093000	thing or something, they didn't really say why yet
13093000	13095000	Yeah, it was like
13095000	13097000	a quickie I can only hope it's a
13097000	13099000	TV series because that would be awesome
13099000	13101000	based on like, you know, the meet the
13101000	13103000	whomever
13103000	13105000	Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on
13105000	13107000	Xbox.com, so that's likely to be
13107000	13109000	coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon
13109000	13111000	Dark Soccer, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?
13111000	13113000	Not really, nothing was as good as the first one
13113000	13115000	I mean, I'm serious, we tried Sonic Adventure 2
13115000	13117000	was not as good as the first one But there are
13117000	13119000	some fans that will be very happy about that
13119000	13121000	I'm sure And they're wrong
13121000	13123000	Jay's raising his hand over there, Jay, are you a big
13123000	13125000	Sonic Adventure 2? Yeah
13125000	13127000	If Xbox Live could take pre-orders
13127000	13129000	I'd pre-order it right now
13129000	13131000	Awesome
13131000	13133000	DreamWorks and EA are gonna make a need
13133000	13135000	for speed movie
13135000	13137000	Cause Fast and the Furious just
13137000	13139000	wasn't enough I'll be hiding in a cave
13139000	13141000	Very interesting, Capcom
13141000	13143000	plans to make some Mega Man 25th
13143000	13145000	anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath
13145000	13147000	over Mega Man universe or whatever
13147000	13149000	Maybe announce a soundtrack that's in it Yeah, exactly
13149000	13151000	Yeah, more
13151000	13153000	downloads of the old stuff will be
13153000	13155000	coming to your way
13155000	13157000	Looking quickly at the Twitter
13157000	13159000	real quick, TigerClod sent us a couple stories
13159000	13161000	Marvel vs. Capcom
13161000	13163000	The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming
13163000	13165000	history coming soon
13165000	13167000	Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix
13167000	13169000	Yikes
13169000	13171000	ActDeaf says
13171000	13173000	OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio
13173000	13175000	Virtual Phil
13175000	13177000	who was on Hoardhouse this week
13177000	13179000	says, if you had to live in a video
13179000	13181000	game for the rest of your life
13181000	13183000	which game would you choose? Pro Tip
13183000	13185000	not Silent Hill
13185000	13187000	If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life
13187000	13189000	I would live in the Pokemon universe
13189000	13191000	cause let's be real, Pokemon are adorable
13191000	13193000	and you could just, you could teach them
13193000	13195000	to do your killing
13195000	13197000	I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet
13197000	13199000	with that
13199000	13201000	is like low on the list of harvesting
13201000	13203000	where you could cuddle with Garris
13203000	13205000	Yeah, I would live on the palaban
13205000	13207000	Loki? You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third
13207000	13209000	but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach, Volleyball
13211000	13213000	Good answer, anybody on the couch
13213000	13215000	what game world would you want to live in most of all?
13215000	13217000	Oh god, Animal Crossing
13217000	13219000	Animal Crossing says Star Tetsuya
13219000	13221000	Jay?
13221000	13223000	Cause Cole's kinda hot
13223000	13225000	Good answers, good answers
13225000	13227000	Misty, did you have one?
13227000	13229000	Yeah, I agree with Pokemans
13229000	13231000	cause fuck, I picked my name
13231000	13233000	my nickname from it
13233000	13235000	Ah, there you go, that's true
13235000	13237000	Misty
13237000	13239000	You know, it just occurred to me that it would actually be really good
13239000	13241000	The
13241000	13243000	Doctor Who games
13243000	13245000	That's cheating
13245000	13247000	I'll hide on the TARDIS
13247000	13249000	I second that
13249000	13251000	Really want to give thanks to you guys
13251000	13253000	that all gave us OLR 10th anniversary
13253000	13255000	shout outs and retweets, there was an awful lot
13255000	13257000	of you, I can't name everybody
13257000	13259000	but I just want to say a big thank you to everybody
13259000	13261000	on the Twitter who gave
13261000	13263000	their thank yous to us
13263000	13265000	so that brings us
13265000	13267000	almost to the end of the show
13267000	13269000	but just walking in from work
13269000	13271000	can I bug you for a minute?
13271000	13273000	Hi, SalaciousPop or Allen is
13273000	13275000	home, how was work?
13275000	13277000	Good, happy 10 years to the OR
13277000	13279000	Thank you, anything you want to
13279000	13281000	say, cause we're almost at the end
13281000	13283000	anything you want to say about the anniversary or whatever?
13283000	13285000	It's a good show, there's tons of
13285000	13287000	people in the apartment right now, just came home and it's a
13287000	13289000	big party, but I knew it was going to be like that
13289000	13291000	When are all these people going to leave?
13291000	13293000	They're fine, they're fine
13293000	13295000	Okay, well if
13295000	13297000	Allen is home from work, that means
13297000	13299000	we really got to wrap it up and get on
13299000	13301000	out of here, Loki, any last minute stories you want to add?
13301000	13303000	Final Fantasy XI is getting another
13303000	13305000	expansion
13305000	13307000	Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting
13307000	13309000	a new class Geomancer
13309000	13311000	Geomancers are cool
13311000	13313000	I said a long time ago it should have got
13313000	13315000	Geomancer, so I'm excited they're actually getting it
13315000	13317000	So they're doing that, and that's just kind of crazy
13317000	13319000	because I guess it's
13319000	13321000	also been around for
13321000	13323000	a long time
13323000	13325000	and then Skylanders are getting some
13325000	13327000	sidekick characters and
13327000	13329000	exclusive Frito-Lay
13329000	13331000	things
13331000	13333000	Yay, so
13333000	13335000	you're going to get those in bags of Frito-Lays
13335000	13337000	and you get little characters that I think
13337000	13339000	are compatible with the game, maybe
13339000	13341000	Neat
13341000	13343000	And then
13343000	13345000	there is a
13345000	13347000	I don't know if it's a hint
13347000	13349000	or if it's sort of a tease or something, but
13349000	13351000	apparently there was
13351000	13353000	an image tweeted by
13353000	13355000	the creator of Seaman
13355000	13357000	that is a Santa Seaman
13357000	13359000	perhaps
13359000	13361000	hinting that there may be an
13361000	13363000	announcement or a game release
13363000	13365000	regarding Seaman
13365000	13367000	maybe?
13367000	13369000	That's been teased for a while I think, so that could be very
13369000	13371000	interesting
13371000	13373000	And I guess
13373000	13375000	Kim.com is
13375000	13377000	launching a new mega upload
13377000	13379000	site called Megabox
13379000	13381000	So it'll be interesting to see
13381000	13383000	what happens there
13383000	13385000	Megabox
13385000	13387000	Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy 11 again
13387000	13389000	to play Geomancer with him, and you know Shane is really
13389000	13391000	good at peer pressure, right Jamie?
13391000	13393000	I'm telling you
13393000	13395000	free to play and my life is over
13395000	13397000	Is it going free to play?
13397000	13399000	I wish
13399000	13401000	I already started
13401000	13403000	playing Lord of the Rings
13403000	13405000	I think by the time Final Fantasy 14 comes out
13405000	13407000	it probably would
13407000	13409000	Alright, we really have to
13409000	13411000	bring this show to a close and say good night
13411000	13413000	First off
13413000	13415000	over the past 10 years you guys have
13415000	13417000	tuned in and supported our show and we just want to
13417000	13419000	say thank you and
13419000	13421000	you know we never ask for your money
13421000	13423000	although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts
13423000	13425000	want to help pay to keep it going
13425000	13427000	and trust me we really, really appreciate it
13427000	13429000	but you know all we ask most of all
13429000	13431000	tell a friend or 20
13431000	13433000	about the show and help
13433000	13435000	spread the word, give us a nice 5 star review on
13435000	13437000	iTunes or whatever pod catching site you use
13437000	13439000	Stitcher Radio, you can give us
13439000	13441000	thumbs ups and stars on, we appreciate that
13441000	13443000	and just whatever to help spread the word of our show
13443000	13445000	Before we go though
13445000	13447000	of course we have to get everybody's
13447000	13449000	final thought, I want to thank everybody for being here
13449000	13451000	in studio tonight
13451000	13453000	Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight
13453000	13455000	Oh man, I don't even know
13455000	13457000	I
13457000	13459000	I don't even know
13459000	13461000	10 years
13461000	13463000	you know
13463000	13465000	I did have a request though
13465000	13467000	Sure!
13467000	13469000	Is this DJ Melvis'
13469000	13471000	promo?
13471000	13473000	I think so
13473000	13475000	Yes, I can do that
13475000	13477000	I did an interview with him and he mentioned it
13477000	13479000	On orangelaunchradio.com you can see
13479000	13481000	Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now
13481000	13483000	and
13483000	13485000	I will play that by request
13485000	13487000	It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long
13487000	13489000	They're talking about C-man in chat and AlphaKananagram
13489000	13491000	said Siri man
13491000	13493000	That might almost work
13493000	13495000	You know there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles
13495000	13497000	There's people requesting
13497000	13499000	Siri versus GLaDOS
13499000	13501000	and the guys there are seriously considering it
13501000	13503000	Alright
13503000	13505000	To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series
13505000	13507000	on orangelaunchradio.com, here's his final thought
13507000	13509000	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF
13509000	13511000	and for an extra $1.99 a minute
13511000	13513000	my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all
13513000	13515000	the fun together
13515000	13517000	Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am
13517000	13519000	why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to
13519000	13521000	and still the fun is just as great
13521000	13523000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights
13523000	13525000	Kick it with me and you
13525000	13527000	just might realize the best things in life
13527000	13529000	are free
13529000	13531000	Thank you Rob
13531000	13533000	Of course, anytime buddy

13539000	13541000	I hope you had a great time in San Francisco and all that too
13541000	13543000	I did, and I had a great time here tonight
13543000	13545000	I'm sorry the traffic sucked
13545000	13547000	and thank you once again for the coffee
13547000	13549000	My favorite thing in the world
13549000	13551000	You squeaked a little bit
13551000	13553000	You had to go change your pants
13553000	13555000	I did, I did
13555000	13557000	Rob had special feelings in the pantsal region
13557000	13559000	Do you have a final thought tonight, Jay?
13563000	13565000	Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't
13565000	13567000	You're going to have to come back to me on that one
13567000	13569000	Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show
13569000	13571000	to give that final thought later on
13571000	13573000	So how do you like that?
13573000	13575000	I will return, there you go
13575000	13577000	I'll be back
13577000	13579000	Misty, thank you for
13579000	13581000	getting on a train all the way out here
13581000	13583000	I hope you had fun in Sac-A-Tomato
13583000	13585000	What's your final thought tonight?
13585000	13587000	To confirm your theory
13587000	13589000	Out of 50 milliliter bottles of UV cake
13589000	13591000	4 out of the 6 that I packed
13591000	13593000	plus the glass of wine
13593000	13595000	Yes, I am drunk by my usual standards
13595000	13597000	Whoo!

13603000	13605000	Lowkey, your final thought tonight?
13605000	13607000	My final thought is next week is going to be interesting
13607000	13609000	because
13609000	13611000	apparently
13611000	13613000	12 AM Eastern Time
13613000	13615000	on July 1st
13615000	13617000	which happens to be in the middle of our show
13617000	13619000	is when the Jade Gate opens
13619000	13621000	and you know I gotta play that
13621000	13623000	Oh lord
13623000	13625000	Alright
13625000	13627000	I was ranked 159 last time
13627000	13629000	I'm going to try better
13629000	13631000	Go for 158
13631000	13633000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
13633000	13635000	I have to drive home
13635000	13637000	and I have to go to work tomorrow
13637000	13639000	but this is
13639000	13641000	going to be a very
13641000	13643000	I'm going to be dreaming in orange
13643000	13645000	I'm going to be dreaming
13645000	13647000	and by the way
13647000	13649000	reject false icons
13649000	13651000	Why not?
13651000	13653000	My final thought tonight is
13653000	13655000	thank you for giving a shit
13655000	13657000	I really mean that
13657000	13659000	and 10 more years my friends

13681000	13683000	Who did that when I wasn't looking?
13683000	13685000	Who did that?
13685000	13687000	Somebody
13687000	13689000	Somebody switched
13689000	13691000	or rude that on me when I wasn't looking
13691000	13693000	Bastards
13693000	13695000	Alright here it is for real

13763000	13765000	and god I'm just really not prepared
13765000	13767000	tonight I was going to say here it is your fortune cookie message
13767000	13769000	of the day but I
13769000	13771000	didn't have it up
13771000	13773000	Fail I'm a failure what can I say
13773000	13775000	Alright let me
13775000	13777000	get to the show roll

13815000	13817000	I bet you didn't know that
13817000	13819000	when I eat
13819000	13821000	beans
13821000	13823000	I say it in my own little cloud
13823000	13825000	Nobody
13825000	13827000	comes to visit
13827000	13829000	me in my
13829000	13831000	little
13831000	13833000	cloud
13833000	13835000	I don't know why
13835000	13837000	maybe because I'm
13837000	13839000	cutting muffins
13839000	13841000	because I love
13841000	13843000	beans

13845000	13847000	every day

13853000	13855000	doo doo doo
