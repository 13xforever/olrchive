129255	130036	That is awesome.
132026	148828	and I think I've been listening for about 5 of those years and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to and you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and BlackWolf
150905	179374	and my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the Vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago and that was a lot of fun so have an awesome 10iversary and hey maybe you guys will make it to another 10 years that would be awesome anyway stay black
179901	182663	Hey, OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, a.k.a.
182923	183543	YYR.
184164	193150	Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.
193190	199494	I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR Dream Game Bungie Ferritossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it.
200014	202816	I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.
203456	208880	I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.
209690	212993	I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives.
213093	213893	Thank you, slaves.
214754	218717	But I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.
219398	224001	Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last 10 years.
224141	227584	So Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.
228476	229357	What's up, OLR?
229437	230238	It's Zeether.
231138	245972	I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say that you're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to because you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts.
246132	247293	I like that.
247333	249134	I love the Classic Game of the Week segment.
249815	255179	It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for 10 years.
255800	262865	Starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining too.
263746	266308	So yeah, congrats guys, congrats on the 10 years.
266848	269551	Hopefully you can do 10 more of this, maybe?
270011	270451	I don't know.
270471	271572	Congrats.
272913	279098	Hey, Orange Violence Radio, this is Bajazan here, wishing you the best for 10 years.
280095	286917	10 years, that's pretty long for the radio that started off as, you know, doing DJ Ranma Mani and then morphing into video games.
286977	290939	But still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.
291539	299641	Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years.
299761	302242	And for that, I tip my hat to you.
302382	303703	And no, I'm not drunk or high.
304103	304623	Have a good one.
313280	316281	Hey, DJ Ranma S here from Anime Jam Session.
317642	325584	I've been a listener of Orange Dogs Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.
326185	329266	The OLR community is not just friends.
330285	333748	This has become a massive, wonderful family.
334108	337791	And as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that.
338031	341714	They all talk about video games, the game of culture, and the game of lifestyle.
342114	348539	But there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us.
349160	351181	And we have to sit there and discuss, which I think is great.
351802	359768	OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose.
360388	365009	When you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.
365029	366670	It's like you got different rankings of it.
366870	370330	And that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years.
371211	376092	As for me, I admire them and I totally respect them for what they do.
376972	385834	And my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match.
386514	390816	and from that point on, I said, you know, I wanna do something like this.
391257	403123	And because of what they do, is now what I do with Anime Jam Session with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting like our own family thing.
403483	411788	And if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.
412388	413829	So I am eternally thankful
414469	415830	for their contribution.
416551	420995	And in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people.
421055	426760	So to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you.
427281	428882	Congratulations on 10 years.
429463	431725	And I will be around for another 10 more.
432305	432706	Take care.
452982	464888	Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.
470495	479100	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio.
479460	482441	The show where every gamer has a voice.
483042	484022	Established 2002.
485183	489946	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-host.
490346	494108	Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
494508	497209	Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.
497850	499791	It took me about 7 to get it right.
503593	505995	Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.
506055	508196	There's been some bad ones in the past.
508316	510117	Are you going to make me go back into the archive?
510137	510638	No, I'm not.
510838	512579	Do I have to go back into the archive?
515281	516321	I think you're making me go back into the archive.
516341	519163	But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.
521264	524126	You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you?
524226	525807	It's disturbing me a little bit.
525847	526708	But Garris.
529051	530091	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
548371	551033	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
571007	583751	Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts DarkSakura and Sky where we'll talk about all things Bomani.
583771	584332	There you go.
584372	585572	In the meantime, enjoy.
585592	587433	That was episode one right there.
587913	588493	Episode one.
588813	591114	That was the little promo cut from episode one.
592400	596361	By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.
596441	599082	It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.
599162	600663	Has your opinion changed after 10 years?
601123	608985	Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.
609326	615608	And now I'm happy being the aunt because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.
617088	617488	TechMasterLoki
641127	641688	I have a headache.
643632	645294	All this time later and now you have a headache.
645315	645835	I'm sorry.
646457	651626	I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it, but caffeine will work.
652207	653930	Nah, probably not, but we'll try.
654406	658588	And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the 10th anniversary of OLR.
659088	661349	McDonald's because I'm late.
662409	664090	And that's really the only reason why.
664410	673034	I was sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something and I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.
673174	675495	I need to stop what I'm doing, need to leave now.
675555	678076	And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.
679056	682437	Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.
682477	695862	If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network, where we tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show, www.vognetwork.com.
696143	699324	I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com.
699384	703125	And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,
705946	707208	It kind of outgrew that time frame.
707428	715115	If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast, the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.
715956	718358	The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20-minute show.
719599	721361	Yeah, that didn't work out so well.
723503	728387	SSJ100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.
729508	730208	Arigato.
731389	731629	All right.
732350	734291	You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.
734412	735052	I'm getting better.
735392	735973	You're getting better.
735993	736593	A little better.
736613	737054	A little bit.
737074	737954	It's only taking me 10 years.
738095	738335	All right.
738735	741757	Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.
741797	743959	We've filled things up here in the OLR studios tonight.
743979	749384	We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show, and I want to say hello to them for a little bit.
749784	750284	Up first.
750364	752126	Rob, is your guy doing the cabbage patch?
752426	756148	Yes, I am on a DDR machine nonetheless.
756288	764431	DarkSakura is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse, which I think I'm the only one in right now.
764511	766712	And he's doing the freaking cabbage patch.
766812	767692	On a DDR machine.
768653	770894	How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?
771514	772735	Am I doing a dance from the 80s?
773255	774836	I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.
775776	777237	We turn in 10.
777477	778897	We turn in 10.
779097	780658	Thank God this is radio.
782559	785500	Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.
786721	787281	And it's radio.
787301	788142	You'll never get to see it.
788722	790182	But these guys just saw that.
790283	790823	Say hello.
790903	792223	Joining us all the way from St.
792283	793084	Louis, Missouri.
793724	795365	Say hello to Misty.
795936	801366	Because I know you're wondering between delays, layovers, and actual travel time, it took about three days to get here.
802375	803395	Now that's because you don't fly.
803935	804376	Exactly.
804756	807456	But you're like a huge train fan.
807576	808397	You're a train fanatic.
808417	810777	You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.
811297	817179	Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.
817359	818639	Yet I never rode on trains.
818699	819680	It was this really weird thing.
820040	820780	You are so fired.
821380	821960	I guess not.
824361	824981	Alright, anyhow.
825701	828762	Well, hello to you and how are you today, I guess?
829522	830022	Very good.
830203	831683	What made you want to be here for tonight's show?
832858	835338	G, I wonder G, I wonder
859924	860944	Yeah, I guess that's true.
861004	862405	Where in the city are you exactly?
862665	863866	I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.
864286	864566	Okay.
864726	865647	Oh, so you're in... Okay.
865967	866788	I can never remember.
867768	868408	It's a big city.
868468	869109	It's a big place.
869309	869989	And it's far away.
870109	870970	I went once.
871770	871970	Yeah?
872191	872351	Once.
872871	873011	Once?
873491	874492	What did you do in New York City?
874712	875472	Oh, nothing.
875492	876393	Just played at Carnegie Hall.
876915	878056	Oh, okay.
878076	879116	Hey, just a little something-something.
879136	879477	Band trip.
880737	882118	What brings you to California?
882178	885080	You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?
885220	886621	That and my sister also.
886781	886961	Yes.
887501	888221	Just for that.
888542	888982	Nothing else.
889042	889222	No.
889522	891984	My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.
892264	892524	Mm-hmm.
893044	898605	and I've just been here for like the past week and I was like, oh, my vacation coincides with the 10th anniversary.
899085	900226	Might as well make a visit.
900466	901786	What a nice convenience.
901886	904627	I'm sorry that the drive was all traffic-y, you trying to get here today.
904847	905187	No, yeah.
905387	908167	Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.
908187	912868	Well, Picaruno says, my fellow Eurobeat nerd.
913308	913548	Yes.
913989	916049	And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.
917202	919023	My name does come from Digimon, yes.
919123	921005	V-Mon was my favorite Digimon growing up.
921545	921705	Yes.
922206	925088	I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.
925188	927610	Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?
927690	931913	I think DarkSakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.
931993	932714	Thank you very much.
933895	936077	Thank you very much.
936117	937498	That's in another 10 years.
937918	940660	The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.
940740	941281	You do the math.
945206	947248	We feel young and that's the important thing.
947309	948170	Now get off my lawn.
949792	951974	What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?
951994	953637	Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?
954117	954337	No.
954838	956220	Is the Metreon even still open?
956781	959504	It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.
959845	960906	I haven't been to the Metreon since 2004.
962728	989125	Metron was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago like there was an epic you know one where they gave away a DDR machine and then they had that epic arcade and they had all the crane machines and they had the oops cat what the hell oops I went to hell store what was her name that mascot I used to love those shirts somebody in shall think of it and then there's the official Sony store was there as well and now they're talking about putting a target in there
990934	994976	And look, I love Target, but... You know they have like the Gamer Walk of Fame?
995556	995877	Oh yeah.
995897	996637	That little catwalk thing?
996657	997998	They do, that's right, that is there.
998038	1008303	But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it and so half of it was like white and the other half of it was like, you know, DDR machine and even the screen was faded.
1009183	1010804	It was awful to play on.
1011965	1012465	But Garrus...
1012845	1015366	So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?
1016046	1022468	Since it's my first vacation in like four years and my first time out here in like eight, I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.
1022828	1023489	Touristy stuff?
1023569	1026249	I've been, you know, pretty much at all the tourist traps.
1026269	1030211	You went to Pier 39 and Alcatraz and Napa.
1030591	1032251	I went to Sonoma, not Napa.
1032451	1035012	Oh, well, excuse me, princess.
1039698	1041840	I got myself lots and lots of wine.
1041880	1043061	I was very happy.
1043121	1043821	Good times.
1043841	1046303	But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became.
1046644	1048505	I saw the Riptide Arcade was gone.
1049906	1050887	I cried a little bit.
1050907	1052068	I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.
1052088	1056971	We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.
1056991	1065017	That was actually, I got to say, that was one of our earliest achievements, really, as a station, was that we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments.
1065117	1066979	And we did the Sacramento ones, of course.
1067039	1067519	We broadcasted.
1067799	1068579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1093749	1097711	I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.
1098592	1099553	Let's not talk about that on air.
1100793	1101494	Maybe after the show.
1101554	1101954	Whoops.
1102274	1103735	You heard nothing.
1108258	1112140	I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.
1113621	1116763	And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.
1117303	1118484	Maybe later, if you're good.
1118504	1120145	Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.
1120265	1120665	That's right.
1120725	1121305	Of course.
1121965	1123346	We're going to have a poetry slam.
1125446	1128247	In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR.
1128287	1129327	Like by pure coincidence.
1129347	1130187	We didn't plan it that way.
1130247	1131308	But my birthday is Tuesday.
1131328	1132988	So, you know, yay, I'm old.
1133408	1133688	All right.
1134448	1135969	Also joining us tonight.
1136069	1141430	Now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.
1141790	1145411	He's the one person I know was here for episode one.
1145951	1146852	Dark Tetsuya Dark Tetsuya
1165868	1166329	Good, good.
1167149	1168691	So, what's new?
1169712	1172015	Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.
1172435	1172875	Not us.
1173116	1181204	Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one, and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.
1182045	1183587	What's changed in 10 years?
1185809	1188152	Well, DDR kinda died.
1189642	1190002	DarkSakura
1213999	1215441	I know, and old.
1216702	1216882	Oh, man.
1216922	1217623	Put me on the spot here.
1217643	1218184	I don't know, man.
1218204	1218284	Just...
1232918	1234159	Be prepared for anything.
1234199	1237900	Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.
1238160	1238741	Absolutely.
1239161	1240401	It's live and uncensored.
1240802	1245364	And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.
1245724	1247565	Say hello, final guest tonight.
1249766	1250366	That's right.
1250746	1252487	The OLR ferret is in the house.
1254568	1260930	Actually, this is the OLR Ferret's cousin, because we don't know where the original OLR Ferret is, but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.
1261270	1263471	Thanks to the Magicka Radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.
1265872	1266332	There you go.
1266572	1267173	OLR Ferret.
1267193	1267753	They're in the house.
1268826	1270426	Well, there we are.
1270526	1276008	Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.
1276528	1278729	You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.
1278829	1284430	We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.
1284670	1286071	And, you know, the scene...
1287151	1287471	DarkSakura.com
1312347	1314768	Why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?
1314888	1319690	Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.
1320191	1321151	And that's kind of what happened.
1321351	1322972	Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob.
1322992	1323292	Thank you.
1323552	1324092	You're welcome.
1324152	1325793	Anytime.
1326794	1328194	And here we are 10 years later.
1328234	1330335	And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.
1330735	1332596	We went from being two hours to three hours.
1332976	1338819	Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.
1339279	1362495	and then you know we've we've been on three different networks now and it's just it's been a crazy ride but but here we are some things stay the same and here we are after 10 years and I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it whether you started listening last week or this week or your Dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for DarkSakura and Loki I'll let them speak in a
1363516	1364317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1379232	1380192	This is a lot of work.
1380813	1382453	How have you done this for the past 10 years?
1383734	1388015	And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody's listening.
1388656	1393918	And by somebody, I mean one person listening is an amazing accomplishment.
1394138	1394938	I mean, it really is.
1395078	1400320	And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.
1400760	1403541	It is a true community that we've built here.
1403661	1404882	I mean, it's a small community.
1405302	1406362	We're not IGN.
1406742	1407643	We're not one of the top...
1408603	1411544	We're probably not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.
1411884	1418027	We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.
1418207	1426410	And it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.
1426810	1429531	Because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.
1430051	1431992	Once in a while we might and then get in big trouble for it.
1432452	1438077	But it's awesome that you guys tune in to hear our opinions and we're so thankful.
1438438	1440099	DarkSakura, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
1440159	1441260	Oh my god, actually.
1441300	1442721	I just got a link from...
1444526	1450669	One of our listeners who played a happy birthday song for us on ukulele on YouTube.
1451169	1452250	I'm going to send this to you.
1452750	1452990	Really?
1453110	1454011	He used to work with Dan.
1454431	1457092	Oh, yeah?
1457132	1457953	Is it safe to play on air?
1458353	1460894	I can't hear it on here, so I guess that's the only way we'll find out.
1460934	1462535	All right, I'll cue it up, but in the meantime.
1463675	1466197	My motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.
1468638	1469178	And Garris.
1471339	1472780	Garris is the reason for life.
1473286	1475807	Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?
1475827	1476387	I'm motivated?
1504460	1504760	DarkSakura.com
1525137	1526978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1549691	1550172	Every other week.
1550292	1551494	I started a job.
1551514	1552154	Actually, you did.
1552295	1553156	Well, okay.
1553336	1557041	The chatter's thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?
1557261	1557561	Yeah.
1557902	1558462	That's true.
1558563	1560465	And actually, I was doing the show when I had the plague.
1560926	1561446	That's true.
1561727	1561987	See?
1562007	1563349	I said being sick.
1563369	1565732	I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.
1566716	1571877	So, but the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot.
1572278	1576959	Anyway, we will By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.
1577559	1578239	Just saying.
1579159	1580680	That's not good for anybody involved.
1580800	1582941	Look, I just want to plug this too as well.
1583521	1588002	Vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network, as you know, our third network where we've done OLR.
1588122	1588222	It's
1588342	1589003	Thanks for watching!
1606497	1628105	yet in that regard but I do want you to know we are working on podcast listeners being rewarded as well keep in mind the site is only a month old and we have one guy Bobby Blackwolf he's the man building it all so do you know we we want to be fair for everybody and let the podcast folks have their say too but uh we just need a little more time to get all that programmed so uh bear with us
1629605	1631845	Anyhow, let's move on.
1632105	1632646	Am I going to play this?
1632666	1633826	Am I going to play the birthday song here?
1634186	1638046	This is a birthday song from... What's the name he goes by now?
1638146	1639047	Shesro?
1639427	1640747	Is his name online, I think?
1641647	1641967	Here we go.
1641987	1643327	I'm going to play this YouTube here.
1643947	1644848	Hey, what's up, guys?
1644928	1646268	It's your boy, Scarzo.
1646768	1650909	Just want to give a quick birthday shout-out to the one and only OLR, a.k.a.
1651089	1652129	Orange Lounge Radio.
1652729	1654509	Man, 10 freaking years.
1654529	1658910	10 years running strong, making a kick-ass live show and a wonderful podcast.
1659350	1661831	I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart.
1662151	1663132	I mean heart, yeah.
1663432	1666573	So anyway, before this video gets- Did he say the bottom of his fart?
1666593	1668454	Is that what Sully was about to say?
1668474	1670075	Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.
1670315	1671416	His fucking heart.
1671936	1672116	Yeah.
1672136	1675337	But he censored himself, and then it made it sound like he said fart.
1677378	1684962	Camp I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts, and when I think about you, you make me wanna- Too long and I take too much of your time.
1685282	1686703	I'm just going to play a song for you real quick.
1686783	1687243	Check it out.
1688692	1689271	Thanks for watching!
1727000	1732928	Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Niles Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.
1734460	1736141	DarkSakura, starting us off tonight
1760402	1760802	Garrus.
1762683	1775331	Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for $11 with the first one... Thank you, Shane.
1777432	1781915	I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.
1783756	1794701	And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.
1794841	1796222	She is amazing.
1796442	1797442	I love her so much.
1798203	1798643	You'll love her.
1799023	1801564	But it came with the... Whatever.
1803525	1806467	Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.
1806947	1807067	Aw.
1807747	1817092	So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.
1818252	1819833	I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.
1819933	1824015	Well, that's why it makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.
1826019	1850029	and Grunt kind of is weird but yeah so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garrus again because I was happy and I've so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I and I was already a little sick and I got so motion sick playing it doing the the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.
1851767	1854329	OMG spoilers in those first five minutes of the game.
1854850	1864679	So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about ten minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5 a.m.
1865299	1868162	Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wild this morning.
1870305	1871686	Girlgasms for Garrus and I'm a boy
1895054	1895855	Okay, see?
1896015	1896295	See?
1897776	1904320	Anyway, so I did actually play some World of Warcraft because we have the druid guild, Druidia.
1905100	1911384	So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge, we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.
1911765	1915587	Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids.
1916307	1916828	Don't you think so?
1917968	1918909	And Rob's got one in there.
1919830	1920630	Miss Nomi Malone.
1920690	1921731	I do, I have Nomi Malone.
1922371	1923372	I'm a dancer, not a stripper.
1924012	1925393	Yeah.
1926773	1927714	So I did a little bit of that.
1927774	1931495	And I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.
1932255	1939398	Which, I mean, because like six hours I check it, do more missions, turn it off, check it another six hours, you know, because that's how long it takes.
1940599	1944460	Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.
1945001	1945241	Awesome.
1946261	1949325	I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one.
1949686	1949986	Right?
1951127	1951468	Garrus!
1951908	1953510	Like, it's not that the first one's a bad game.
1953530	1954872	Bitch needs to give me his mission!
1956074	1956614	He will soon.
1957475	1959298	He needs to give you more than that, I imagine.
1959958	1960900	Some bird love.
1961080	1961741	Alright, anyhow.
1961841	1963523	Anything else in your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?
1963752	1965293	Mario Marathon Mario Marathon
1984901	1985982	I deeply appreciate it.
1986002	1993548	I almost feel bad because that's a charity event, but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating, and I figure if you're watching them for 72 hours, you can spare one for us.
1994289	2000214	And since we aren't asking for donations tonight, we will say go donate to a great charity, Child's Play, through Mario Marathon.
2000234	2009142	Well, Dan and I donated, and if you look at when they hit level 7-2, you will see Dan and Jamie, parentheses, O-L-R.
2010062	2025466	oh nice so that's our donation put them to level 7 too very cool so go look at their page and give them some money after the show awesome let's move on and Techmaster Loki how was your gaming week?
2026566	2038369	I played Minecraft more Minecraft I've been working on the minecart track entrance to my giant volcano thing how are you dealing with Friday's Patch?
2039255	2039995	Oh, it's just fine.
2040055	2041876	There's still Way the Doop in it, so it doesn't matter.
2042196	2042676	Of course!
2043056	2044676	Of course, where there's a will, there's a way.
2046397	2047657	And then, what else?
2048457	2053879	Oh, I played Lollipop Chainsaw, and I'm disappointed.
2054459	2062201	I mean, how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and...
2064369	2069774	You know, over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.
2070194	2071295	How is that possible?
2071575	2073417	I mean, you just can't.
2073737	2075398	But yet they found a way to do it.
2075679	2077780	And yes, it is an incredibly boring game.
2078481	2080903	That I literally said, I'm not playing this anymore.
2080943	2082364	That's really disappointing.
2082644	2083245	Yeah, it is.
2083265	2083845	I want to play it.
2084686	2085567	I know, I still want to play it.
2085587	2086348	It's my friend's copy.
2087749	2087969	Don't.
2090670	2091070	Anything else?
2092251	2095273	A little bit of Modern Warfare 2, or Modern Warfare 3.
2095914	2097074	And, yeah, that was it.
2097815	2102398	So, I didn't play a lot of new games this week, but I think I might have a problem.
2103478	2104699	Because, here's the thing.
2105120	2107701	So, I have Mass Effect on Xbox, right?
2108141	2109582	And DarkSakura... Oh, shoot!
2109743	2110203	I know, right?
2110283	2115366	I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.
2115406	2117548	That's alright, no, because wait until I'm going to say next.
2118488	2121231	But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC.
2122151	2124013	And then Alan plays it on PC as well.
2124033	2126315	And he's like, oh, the graphics are better and da-da-da-da-da.
2126435	2126956	Which is true.
2127016	2128537	Your video card will look so nice.
2128557	2133381	And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.
2133702	2136544	So I was like, all right, I'll buy it.
2136664	2137105	I'll buy it.
2137665	2139727	So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again.
2139747	2141749	And this time I'm playing as a renegade and da-da-da.
2141829	2142109	And then...
2143030	2165229	Then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99 So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC That's right, I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long When I haven't been doing stuff for the show I don't feel bad anymore
2166470	2191641	like it is it is addicting and I gotta say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war there's advantages to both there really are I do miss playing on my TV I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller but I gotta say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse and that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with a controller but Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and
2192041	2193382	I am so much better with it.
2194043	2199547	And like, I am kicking ass with my engineers, which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.
2199927	2202329	My little combat drones and setting people on fire.
2202409	2203010	It's amazing.
2203170	2203911	I'm playing an adept.
2204511	2207593	So, but I have literally bought the same game.
2208550	2209530	Same three games.
2210250	2210751	Twice.
2211451	2212471	On two different systems.
2213151	2214111	I have a problem.
2214471	2215392	Loki, do I have a problem?
2216232	2216712	He's nodding.
2216752	2217552	Yes, I have a problem.
2218332	2218953	You know what, Rob?
2219093	2222693	Don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.
2224574	2228475	Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.
2231678	2232058	All right.
2233499	2235420	Otherwise, that was pretty much it as far as my gaming week.
2235440	2241043	I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing, things on the iPhone and so forth, but not a lot of new stuff.
2241103	2243184	So that's really it for my gaming week.
2243904	2245985	And yeah, this is the really sad part.
2246025	2246385	You ready?
2246605	2248706	Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Alinko.
2249226	2251628	Says, Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.
2253148	2271981	uh Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding Sky but I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week this whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with a keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking oh my god maybe I should like get into first person shooters
2273393	2274573	What is happening to me?
2276234	2278394	Well, you know how I got into PC gaming, right?
2278574	2278795	What?
2279095	2279535	My hand.
2280215	2283216	Oh, yeah, because when your hand was not as well.
2283236	2285877	And I'm doing all this with a trackball, so.
2286877	2288757	But, like, I literally sat there today.
2288817	2292158	Like, seriously, you guys have listened to this show a long time, many of you.
2292999	2295319	You guys on the couch, you've all been listening for a long time.
2295859	2301001	I sat there looking at the PC going, maybe I should give Battlefield a try.
2301021	2301521	Yeah.
2304406	2306288	Something's happening to me and I don't like it.
2307969	2309871	Suddenly I want to play first person shooters.
2309891	2311232	Are you feeling not so fresh?
2311373	2312394	This is so weird.
2312714	2315356	Like, am I going to want Madden next?
2315536	2316818	Rob needs a gaming douche.
2317578	2318399	Oh my God.
2319901	2320201	Anyhow.
2321144	2324006	I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.
2324747	2325887	I'm going to ask chat.
2326528	2330370	Chatters, what first person shooter should I play next?
2330550	2334153	If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer, what first person shooter should I play next?
2334273	2340237	I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.
2340497	2341438	Misty, how was your gaming week?
2343851	2346452	It was actually more existent than I anticipated.
2347293	2355015	And even for being on a train, Step Mania I believe works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.
2359337	2364039	Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.
2364859	2366199	Dabbled at pocket planes a bit.
2369000	2370241	Seems to be it.
2372629	2375991	All right, playing games on the train, going faster than the speed of light.
2376391	2380453	Not really, but going to our chat room, I want to see some of the comments here.
2380493	2382835	Let's see, Jim Sally says, Battlefield on PC.
2384155	2385916	Nietzsche says, Battlefield 3.
2387037	2388998	Actdeft says, screw that, get Team Fortress 2.
2389678	2390819	I do like Team Fortress.
2390879	2392300	I have played a little Team Fortress.
2392340	2397102	That is kind of fun, actually, because I like playing a healer in that and using the little bandaging gun.
2397423	2398383	That's actually kind of fun.
2398683	2401745	It's like the opposite of other first-person shooters where you're not shooting things.
2402185	2407953	Dark Knight says, Monday Night Combat.
2407993	2408814	I've heard that one's pretty good.
2408874	2410196	Drew Nami says, Gears of War.
2410937	2412358	I see a lot of people seeing Halo.
2412579	2415402	See, I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.
2416303	2417505	You guys keep shouting Halo 4.
2417926	2419828	I can't play a game that's not out yet.
2420769	2440545	I was not in love with Halo 3 I gotta say Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny I agree with that one You know what, I do have that on Steam and I tried to play that for a little bit so maybe I should go back and do that Zether says Quake Live I do love Quake Quake is real good So thank you for the suggestion I second Borderlands because you like loot, right?
2440846	2443708	You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?
2443988	2450713	I like loot at vognetwork.com Well, I'm just saying that you can also, I mean, that's basically, it's a first-person shooter with a lot of loot.
2450993	2451434	That's cool.
2451494	2452434	You get, like, tons of weapons.
2452855	2453575	I like shinies.
2453595	2454236	And it's funny.
2454736	2456317	Alright, I think Borderlands might be a winner.
2456337	2457158	I'll have to check that out.
2457714	2457994	4Player Co-op
2474495	2481838	Fuck that Best Buy front-end program that I had to use to download it because once I downloaded it, Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.
2481878	2482918	Thank God it took my key.
2483239	2484199	I had to re-download.
2484239	2490421	I had to download 10 gigs twice because that stupid Best Buy front-end program can't talk to Origin.
2491002	2493142	And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.
2494263	2497744	I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.
2497824	2500345	I mean, it's fucking better when it's all your games, right?
2501926	2502206	But
2503740	2504881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2524301	2527624	and at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.
2528625	2528965	Nice!
2530666	2534049	I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.
2535550	2540054	It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.
2541277	2543058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2570444	2572111	Don't worry Rob, everyone's allowed to be wrong.
2574501	2575906	That's right, you are allowed to be wrong.
2578826	2605144	I'm just saying Civ 5 is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like three days later I'll probably check out Civ 5 once my boyfriend gets a better PC because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization okay that's cool yeah I think like Civilization 3 is like the most recent one he can run on his computer
2606371	2606751	Oh, I see.
2606771	2613552	It's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old, for lack of a better term.
2614993	2615193	Yeah.
2616153	2616513	All right.
2617513	2619954	DarkTetsuya, what have you been playing this week in gaming?
2620634	2621254	Not too much.
2621294	2624134	I mean, a little dusted off the 2DX controller.
2624154	2625075	I played a little bit of that.
2625175	2627235	We can barely hear you, so I'm going to have you switch mics.
2628355	2629976	Dusted off the 2DX controller.
2629996	2631736	I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.
2633466	2635989	Other than that, let's see, a little bit of Stepmania.
2636009	2642236	I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play until I drop.
2644618	2647101	That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Bros.
2647141	2652367	Wii, trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.
2654249	2655270	And a little bit of Mario Kart.
2657003	2662291	I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but that's whatever.
2662892	2669281	You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.
2669762	2671765	We went on an adventure to break the law.
2671785	2671825	No.
2672626	2679589	We thought about it, but we went to Roseville Golf Land, which, you know, we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.
2679629	2681870	It is the place we all met, right?
2683190	2683771	Milpitas.
2683791	2684931	That's true.
2685151	2686552	It was actually Milpitas.
2686712	2689133	Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land, it gets sadder and sadder.
2689513	2692054	So Misty and I went this weekend.
2692094	2694375	It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.
2694515	2694835	Easy.
2695515	2696536	And let me put it this way.
2697617	2705224	The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like, oh my god, they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.
2710208	2715732	I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.
2717234	2720616	So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the mechs too.
2721057	2722218	Didn't even touch the Disney mechs.
2723323	2731609	I play doubles on Disney Mix I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I play doubles on Disney Mix because I'm hardcore
2733234	2733554	Anyhow.
2734315	2734695	All right.
2735256	2736957	That's enough for our gaming weeks.
2737097	2738218	Let's move on, folks.
2738278	2740539	We got to get into the news tonight.
2740560	2741500	A little bit of housekeeping.
2741820	2745423	We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.
2745563	2748225	Part B, there's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.
2748505	2751548	Just you guys, emails, tweets, and phone calls.
2751928	2754550	So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.
2755510	2759192	or get the phone number down, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2759252	2761492	We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.
2761912	2765114	But for now, let's get to tonight's news.
2765414	2767014	And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.
2767254	2778478	Yes, let's talk about... It's kind of a duh, because we knew that there was a new system coming, just we thought there'd be a little something-something extra on there.
2779579	2780379	But it's not...
2781499	2783461	So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.
2783601	2787543	The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS, no duh.
2788224	2791426	And it doesn't have another circle pad.
2791806	2792827	It only has one circle pad.
2793087	2793707	What are they doing?
2795068	2804154	So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the Circle Pad Pro and other accessories like the... Circle Pad Pro attachment?
2804654	2806836	Like the Circle Pad Pro attachment, yeah.
2807216	2810238	So Nintendo really just fucked that thing, didn't they?
2811266	2821089	Yeah, it's hilarious, too, because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the Circle Pad, except I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now?
2822610	2829812	No, there probably was supposed to be a Circle Pad there, but they didn't want to admit failure, so they just said, we'll just put it out larger.
2830272	2838435	Is it possible that they might release a Circle Pad Pro XL and, in a smart move this time, not make it exclusive to one store so that maybe I'll get one?
2838935	2840597	So how wide is this thing going to be?
2840637	2844662	I mean, seriously, if it's larger as it is, I got to add something on top of that?
2844702	2846384	It's going to be like four feet long.
2846444	2848426	I mean, it's ridiculous.
2848687	2852732	Why would we... I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.
2852752	2853392	I'm a little...
2854494	2862882	Not that I would necessarily have to buy the Circle Pad Pro, because I'm not playing any games that would utilize it, like Resident Evil, which was apparently not very great.
2864043	2866005	The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.
2866665	2870509	If you're a lefty, you get a lot of use out of it, especially in Kid Icarus and some of that.
2872391	2878537	Well, you would if you can hold on to... If you can actually hold the thing, yeah.
2879646	2882589	I, I, there's a lot I like about the XL.
2882829	2890455	I mean, obviously, if you've played a DSi XL, those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen, you know, it's really cool.
2890875	2895099	So I like the idea that there's going to be a 3DS that's huge like that.
2895539	2899642	I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.
2899662	2902985	I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.
2904426	2907307	But yeah, I mean, the bigness is going to be nice.
2907347	2910369	It's going to make the games look even better, which is exciting.
2910449	2914091	But then the realist in me is like, dude, you already have a 3DS.
2914111	2914971	You don't need another one.
2915271	2918173	I mean, yeah, it has better battery life, whatever.
2918233	2920254	There's really no must-have thing.
2920274	2926077	If you need more battery life, you can buy an extra battery for like another $30 instead of buying a new system for another $200.
2926197	2927878	Yeah, if I didn't have a 3DS, I'd buy this.
2931480	2934022	But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.
2935042	2939005	He's going to be like, Rob, I want that for Christmas.
2940366	2945069	The new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.
2945169	2950833	And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to, or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.
2952914	2969200	and apparently, I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff, it's actual size for the regular DS, which would be nice, because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS, although I didn't play that many DS games, so who knows and of course, yeah, priced $199 so, hmm
2972641	2981347	All righty, and that's the same day that that... I know this isn't coming up on our show roll, so we can mention here that Mario... New Super Mario Bros.
2981727	2988232	2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game with the whole DLC.
2988392	2994676	Now Nintendo is like, all right, I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.
2995156	2996477	I guess it's kind of where things are going.
2996797	2999079	But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video...
2999679	3003061	This is a full featured game out of the box.
3003801	3007643	The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.
3009524	3010845	And why should I buy the DLC?
3010925	3011125	I mean...
3012972	3013292	I don't know.
3013352	3014453	They're just experimenting.
3014814	3016876	Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.
3017056	3018537	They have never been online before.
3019378	3021800	What, a decade into the internet?
3021920	3023461	Two decades into the internet.
3023742	3026364	And this is their first time getting online.
3026404	3031588	It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.
3031949	3033590	You know, some things never change.
3033630	3035112	Why is it talking to me? !
3035808	3040771	It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.
3041552	3042572	Some things have to stay the same.
3044613	3045614	They need to grow up though.
3046775	3048035	Going to some comments in our chat room.
3048075	3050017	I almost said the old one there.
3050077	3052598	Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.
3054659	3061864	Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen so it's less pixel depth.
3062384	3063285	I'm still getting one.
3064985	3070028	YYR says, I mean, it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.
3071509	3074730	And I guess that's... Oh, the whole fact about the DSi XL.
3074770	3076871	What the hell's going to happen to that?
3077692	3078652	That's a good question.
3079012	3080273	Will that go down in price?
3080353	3082374	I imagine they've got to phase out the old DSs soon.
3082394	3085315	They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May, so...
3087118	3088959	I might have to drop it again.
3089119	3089899	He makes a point there.
3089939	3091300	Only $30 difference?
3091380	3093321	That's going to really kill the DSi XL.
3094982	3095722	Need to put that out for $99.
3098904	3101545	TigerClaw in chat asks a Nintendo-related question.
3102445	3109548	Says, Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC, are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?
3110289	3110369	Um...
3111229	3114151	It depends what new awesome thing they're gonna put on it.
3114191	3117914	You're also assuming I'm gonna buy a Wii U. I may not at this point.
3118434	3121296	It really depends on how great those games are.
3121996	3122577	So we'll see.
3123629	3124190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3145793	3149314	Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.
3149934	3155316	Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.
3155796	3156576	That's interesting.
3156937	3159717	Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.
3160258	3171081	And for the haters, I just want to remind you, the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega, we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.
3171841	3178368	So, but then I think, alright, but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.
3178388	3187519	The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M. I didn't dislike it as much as other people did, but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M. So what do you guys think?
3187599	3189020	Namco Bandai is involved now.
3189901	3200389	I think that means it's pretty obvious we're going to see some Namco characters show up now as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake and all those characters before.
3200710	3201570	We're going to get what?
3201630	3202851	We'll have Pac-Man.
3203412	3208936	What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari Damacy, although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?
3210327	3212448	or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?
3212468	3214729	There was supposed to be a DS version but I don't think they ever made it.
3215149	3216490	So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.
3216870	3217050	What?
3217730	3219111	Maybe from the Tales games?
3219151	3219411	I don't know.
3219431	3220591	I might be stretching here but what?
3220752	3221852	They can still do the Prince.
3221872	3223333	Pac-Man's gonna eat him up yum yum.
3223393	3223813	That's true.
3224369	3224909	Mr. Driller Mitsurugi
3247752	3249674	Vandy in our chatroom suggests his pole position.
3250034	3251775	Loco Poco suggests Klonoa.
3252155	3254177	That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?
3254197	3255137	And they'll have HuPow.
3255318	3259360	Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube, or excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least.
3259380	3259921	And the Wii.
3260781	3261042	And the Wii?
3261062	3261162	Yeah.
3261822	3262583	I guess that could happen.
3262603	3263023	There you go.
3263143	3270068	But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie from that game that never came out in the U.S.?
3271289	3274331	What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Bros.
3274351	3275372	being developed by Namco in part?
3277441	3278782	JV Mon, aren't you a Smash Bros.
3278822	3279022	fan?
3280423	3285707	Yeah, but it's not going to come out for another five years, so it's no point getting excited for it now.
3286687	3287167	Good point.
3287207	3287808	Let's move on.
3289049	3289869	DarkSakura.
3290890	3291250	Garrus.
3291851	3293011	I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.
3294352	3308362	The extended cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360 on June 26th and on the 4th of July which means it's already out for those two platforms and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.
3308402	3309543	By the way, just tangent.
3309703	3311705	It's not already out because that's my birthday.
3312025	3312926	My birthday's Tuesday.
3312986	3313646	Sorry, brain.
3313986	3314987	I'm a week ahead, Rob.
3315127	3315728	I'm a week ahead.
3315788	3316188	That's all right.
3316728	3319371	Additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.
3338212	3341493	and there's another quote on here on how to access it.
3341993	3348596	To experience the extended cut, load a saved game from before the attack on the Cerberus base and play through to the end of the game.
3348616	3351497	I had to do my... Sorry.
3352377	3353678	Welcome to... No.
3354318	3355398	Welcome to the Citadel.
3355478	3355858	Stop.
3356139	3356399	Sorry.
3357779	3360700	No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the consort.
3360980	3362401	She just sounded so perky.
3363221	3373750	You know what's interesting to me though, Jamie, is that you're a new Mass Effect fan, kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.
3374370	3385159	Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending, so my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first, or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your endings?
3385299	3387360	and see if I'm still pissed off and then go back and watch the other one.
3409461	3411282	I can always just YouTube the other endings.
3411502	3418484	And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently nobody else liked, the one where everyone gets all mixed up.
3420605	3421706	Black Lab is in chat.
3421906	3422226	Puppy!
3422266	3423466	Yeah, I saw him earlier.
3423626	3425287	Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.
3425327	3425867	We gotta fix that.
3425987	3427648	Yeah, what's up with that, dude?
3428408	3429168	Lost Puppy.
3430869	3437331	Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.
3438752	3439212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3459617	3460598	Well... But we'll see.
3461559	3464382	To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.
3464803	3469248	The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.
3469708	3477237	So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.
3477757	3480841	Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.
3481869	3483669	No, there's no way it's going to be that.
3483729	3487230	I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.
3487770	3493892	The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.
3494312	3500613	So that means there's like 20% of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.
3500813	3504114	So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.
3504941	3522257	it kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned and rushed the ending because I've been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing
3522933	3531801	I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody, which I kind of believe... I mean, I don't know what to believe.
3531922	3538608	There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.
3539008	3539629	You know, I just...
3540729	3541790	I'm hopeful for the DLC.
3542070	3544411	I did not hate the ending as is.
3544651	3555656	I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole... I mean, the letdown for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.
3556097	3557958	Maybe you get a two second scene.
3558418	3561199	A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.
3561239	3562940	I mean, it's very little.
3563140	3564580	That's the part that got me.
3565001	3567501	I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.
3568002	3572503	I understand that there's some things they want to close up.
3572863	3576664	That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.
3576945	3577745	I understand that.
3577865	3581946	I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.
3584367	3586007	And I think there's some people that are mad about that.
3586088	3586568	They want...
3588128	3591751	My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.
3592632	3594033	What are all those people going to eat?
3594893	3595954	You can't eat Earth food.
3596514	3596995	Each other.
3598376	3601358	I mean... Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.
3602178	3602498	No.
3603459	3607202	I'm just thinking of all... They're going to have a long road home.
3607342	3609083	And then all the other people who can't get home.
3609303	3610244	That's just very sad.
3611041	3615103	All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending, let's move on.
3615123	3616183	That's all I left it at, Rob.
3616363	3618564	Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.
3619464	3620465	All right.
3620845	3623426	So this is... I'm kind of surprised by this.
3623486	3638791	You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games, plus they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.
3638851	3640132	Well, interesting enough...
3640552	3643993	The game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.
3645033	3648934	It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.
3649115	3651435	And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.
3651475	3653876	So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.
3653976	3655796	But that would be the case.
3655877	3657937	So I don't know.
3658597	3659277	Very interesting.
3659498	3660918	But that is coming out later on this fall.
3662230	3663070	That is interesting.
3665151	3671612	Especially if the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.
3672012	3686615	My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii DS and 3DS versions right now, and then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version, and then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.
3687115	3688355	That makes way too much sense.
3690802	3692543	Well, they definitely won't be doing that.
3693003	3694523	How dare you bring logic into this show?
3694543	3694883	Damn it!
3696964	3697864	How dare you?
3698905	3700125	It's very possible that they may not.
3700205	3704587	I mean, like Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July, and they cut out the PS3.
3705207	3708548	So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.
3709116	3728065	YYR in chat says Activision would release on every platform if possible there must be some sort of deal well just like I said no I don't think so so because if they think that's only going to reach the you know kind of children demographic then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions all right let's talk about a remake
3729886	3731769	There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.
3731889	3735213	This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.
3735313	3737036	It's Okami HD.
3737496	3741121	Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.
3741482	3744205	I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling.
3744266	3745067	How do we please them?
3745727	3749070	They're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.
3749130	3750792	It's full 1080p HD.
3751132	3754996	It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.
3755937	3760861	It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced, on Twitter, and of course on YouTube.
3761602	3762703	It is going to be launching.
3762723	3763924	This is the really interesting part.
3764324	3766506	It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen.
3766526	3767127	That's about 50 bucks.
3770675	3774899	In the U.S., Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.
3777421	3779003	Ha ha, we get a deal.
3779763	3780664	Sorry, Japan.
3783126	3783647	But that is awesome.
3783667	3786890	Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.
3787751	3788312	Yeah, you never know.
3788352	3798225	The one in Japan might come with, like, I don't know, stickers, box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark, maybe a soundtrack or something extra.
3798285	3801630	Now, now, now, it was only... Oh, that was the Wii version.
3802851	3810180	I thought it was the... There was something with the DS Okamiden, I think, that had something funky with that, too.
3811081	3811982	Maybe the box art?
3812122	3812462	I don't know.
3812762	3814084	It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30.
3814144	3816006	That was a Bubble Bobble game.
3817708	3821531	So, but that, you know what, what's funny, this is one of those games I never really got around to playing.
3821591	3822131	I missed it.
3822191	3823632	Like, I, you know, played a demo.
3824032	3824553	That was about it.
3824873	3830617	But I really wanted to try this out, and I think the price of $20 download online is a great place to see this.
3830857	3841144	And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer, and it looks great.
3841164	3843825	Like, when they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.
3843885	3847488	Like, there's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in studio, and then it goes,
3847988	3850490	Oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color.
3851250	3851630	It's great.
3853872	3856033	So yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.
3857394	3859355	And trophies for your EPing.
3861196	3867400	Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates and just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which yes, of course, we have one tonight.
3867720	3869101	DarkSakura, first up with some news.
3869653	3870173	Diablo 3 Patch 1.0.3
3890407	3904677	so they're trying to make it more secure and the quote here says for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete before they can access certain game features
3906858	3918491	So basically it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.
3918531	3920653	So here's the official list.
3921374	3924357	No public game access for unverified digital purchasers.
3926739	3931140	No auction house access real money or gold for unverified digital purchasers.
3931760	3935541	Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.
3936022	3940023	Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.
3940623	3947345	Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests, but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.
3947785	3951306	Global Play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.
3953547	3981369	but they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and level 13 so well I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house especially when real money's at stake but that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online and it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way
3982110	3982891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4001172	4012760	and granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3 and then, you know, they're doing that but I don't know.
4012920	4015262	God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.
4015682	4017584	I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.
4017824	4019205	But yet, Diablo 3 is a huge game.
4020393	4021113	Huge, huge game.
4021694	4022134	Go figure.
4022694	4029658	SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.
4030258	4033520	So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming it sounds like.
4033900	4034120	Hmm.
4036129	4036569	Interesting.
4037690	4040873	DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.
4041493	4049199	I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.
4049899	4051821	Is it really a damning number or no?
4051901	4055703	Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?
4057305	4061828	So you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.
4063462	4064142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4085615	4093641	The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360 And that's it
4097975	4102797	I hope that amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.
4102897	4104058	The game looks pretty good though.
4104338	4104578	Really?
4104598	4106699	The game is done by, was it Beenox?
4106759	4111501	I think they're the guys that did the last two games and it's open world and it looks pretty awesome.
4112121	4117484	The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.
4117604	4120165	I was watching the YouTube interview with him.
4120185	4121906	I was just like, what the fuck is that?
4123446	4125007	It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.
4125598	4126819	Hey, you're the creator of the game.
4126839	4128941	Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man.
4129081	4129401	Okay.
4129421	4131583	He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.
4132704	4135086	I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.
4136107	4139329	Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.
4139430	4140631	Hurry before he dies.
4141231	4142152	Seriously.
4142552	4143193	Let's be real.
4143233	4145134	The celebrities we love, they're getting older.
4146095	4147436	Him and Morgan Freeman, man.
4148877	4149738	Keep the old people.
4149758	4150799	Get them acting more.
4150979	4152120	They should do a buddy comedy.
4152881	4153561	Morgan Freeman?
4153761	4154322	And Adam West.
4156417	4156758	I don't know.
4157499	4157819	Maybe.
4158460	4160022	It's just cool old bastards.
4160383	4161545	Cool old bastards.
4161565	4161945	You know what?
4162005	4169737	Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold, and apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.
4173001	4173261	Nice.
4174642	4174962	All right.
4175342	4178564	Let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.
4178684	4183627	On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners... Cricket, cricket.
4184687	4190991	Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction, but a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.
4191031	4194553	I've never heard of that company, but that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
4194573	4196033	I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.
4196093	4200536	This looks like it's another... I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.
4201016	4201576	What the hell?
4201717	4202137	Wait a minute.
4202177	4202457	It's like...
4202817	4211379	Yay, little girls are happy and da-da-da-da-da and she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on and then robots!
4212799	4213719	So Neon Genesis?
4214739	4215860	I don't know what the hell that is.
4217120	4218460	What is that that it comes with?
4218500	4218940	Look at that.
4219360	4220101	Is that a microphone?
4220221	4221361	Cosplay pieces.
4221581	4222441	How did partner?
4223081	4228042	Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together in our school uniforms.
4228142	4229482	What the fuck is this?
4229662	4230543	Pointing!
4230563	4232003	Giant Mecha Rancher.
4233373	4233673	DarkSakura.com
4251707	4252087	Let's see.
4252588	4259232	Okay, Zether in chat explains Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.
4259692	4261653	Oh, well that explains everything.
4261693	4262454	I'm so fucking angry.
4262474	4263314	I've heard Steins Gate.
4263694	4264095	Oh, you have?
4264395	4265015	Yeah.
4265395	4265956	Explain it to me.
4266116	4266716	I just heard of it.
4266776	4268017	I don't know what the hell it is.
4269118	4270859	I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.
4270919	4272880	There is a book report due Sunday.
4276008	4277449	This is why I love having a chat room.
4277469	4279950	They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.
4280450	4300219	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection, Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well, Atelier Aisha, Kokan no Daichi no Rikenjutsu in regular and premium flavors, and I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3, but .hack//.
4302320	4306164	Sekai no Muko ni vs. Hybrid Pack
4321560	4325345	That would be very meta.
4326226	4328789	Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2, though.
4328909	4330051	Have they done one on PlayStation 3?
4330291	4330912	I don't think they have.
4331473	4332554	This is the closest we get.
4332814	4333575	It's a fighting game.
4333776	4334276	All right, well.
4334356	4338662	Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then... I guess anything's possible.
4339002	4339723	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4367702	4368883	Yes, I love this game.
4369243	4370164	I'm importing it.
4370344	4371665	I didn't even know it was coming out.
4371685	4372985	Did you know they have one on the 360?
4373025	4377948	Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.
4378189	4379449	Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.
4380730	4382291	Uh-oh, Rob's going to get it.
4386794	4390016	Okay, so the count is a two.
4392563	4394804	Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.
4394964	4397925	Two people in the world own Cold Step Saga on the Xbox 360.
4399325	4399745	Well, there you go.
4399765	4400725	Now you have a friend to play with.
4400846	4401346	I do!
4401446	4401886	Yay!
4401946	4402726	We're friends!
4402786	4403286	Yay!
4406507	4408028	Are you my Xbox 360 friend?
4408308	4409028	Friends!
4409628	4409868	Yes.
4410048	4410668	Friends.
4412309	4412489	Aww.
4412989	4413889	That's so sweet.
4413909	4421992	They still haven't removed that 100 person limit even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago so they could do that?
4422637	4424519	Yeah.
4424839	4427501	Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?
4427521	4428082	How about the Wii?
4428122	4429603	Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?
4429844	4430084	Yes.
4430264	4431185	People still do the Wii.
4431385	4431845	One game.
4432366	4433607	And it's called Zero.
4434127	4436650	Shinku no Chou comes out this week.
4437470	4441494	And it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly.
4442055	4443536	And it's like a ghost scary game.
4443576	4444597	Oh, this is a scary game.
4444757	4445918	Wait, crimson butterfly?
4445938	4446759	That sounds familiar.
4447880	4448701	Was that a...
4449758	4451019	DarkSakura DarkSakura
4476661	4478662	Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.
4479203	4480983	It's part of the Fatal Frame series.
4481003	4484305	Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.
4484385	4485346	Okay.
4485426	4489227	On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.
4489848	4490828	You know what that means?
4491188	4491749	Droh.
4492949	4518293	27th we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD collection on PS3 and the Darkside Chronicles HD for PS3 the 29th Harvest Moon the Tale of Two Towns because we can't have enough sheep and cows Mini Ninja I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it when that is totally incorrect so I am not going to say it the way it is on the box it's Mini Ninja Adventures
4520196	4529722	Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection, Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir, Spec Ops The Line, and The Amazing Spider-Man.
4530342	4531383	Spider-Man!
4532924	4533304	Alright.
4534206	4537427	A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
4537487	4542448	And I've been assured that DarkSakura has picked a special game for the classic game of the week this week.
4542728	4543608	But first, Loki.
4544248	4548009	So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.
4548569	4549349	Good for him.
4550390	4551630	Get off that sinking ship.
4553510	4556931	Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday.
4557831	4561712	And basically just, you know,
4563641	4566442	I don't know, just moving on to better things.
4567522	4577425	He said, both as individuals and as a group, you've taught me more than I could have ever thought possible, and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.
4578526	4582167	That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.
4583827	4585168	Okay, maybe I made up that last part.
4588889	4592770	Could this be a very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?
4597183	4597704	Yes.
4598606	4599067	I don't know.
4599087	4604458	I mean, honestly, I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games, but it's a team that puts that stuff together.
4604478	4605640	It's not just one dude, so...
4606277	4608478	That's true, and he's not the only guy, too.
4609599	4613822	We just had a story last week about other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.
4613862	4617304	I didn't want to be worked to death, so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.
4618185	4619006	Did he say where he went?
4619386	4620206	No.
4620286	4621907	It could be interesting to see where he ends up.
4622028	4624069	That's the part of the story I want to know.
4625430	4634756	Did he leave for another opportunity, or did he leave because he would rather go work at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?
4635076	4636177	I'd be very curious to know that.
4637398	4638499	That's at least as old as you are.
4638519	4638959	One of the best...
4669195	4670316	Well, technically that's true.
4670336	4671116	It is true.
4671617	4673698	It's from the 80s.
4676040	4676360	It's not... Hi.
4676440	4677281	It's older than the show.
4677501	4678062	Hi.
4679382	4680643	Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.
4680703	4681904	Alright, moving on.
4681924	4682165	What?
4682185	4682705	I got ferreted.
4690461	4691641	I felt good after 10 years.
4691781	4692101	All right.
4693042	4698863	So the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court against a clone game.
4699403	4713167	And, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these, and it's out of control because Apple doesn't – the people that are screening the games don't necessarily know what intellectual property is what, although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out.
4713267	4716648	Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or –
4717228	4724430	Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was like the number one thing and all it was was an app that was like pictures of Pokemon or something?
4724790	4725190	It was bad.
4725210	4727211	Pokemon and the gold is going in my pocket.
4727231	4727911	That's right.
4727951	4728932	Pokemon, give me your money.
4729492	4735914	Anyhow, Zio Interactive made this game called Mino and they said it was inspired by Tetris.
4736334	4741855	But when the Tetris company found the game, they sued Zio for copyright infringement in New Jersey.
4742536	4743656	And during the legal fight,
4744356	4749599	Zio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.
4750020	4752161	Rules cannot be covered by copyright.
4752761	4759505	Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets so this game infringed on the copyrights.
4759846	4763968	Which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris.
4764268	4766710	And we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs.
4766790	4771513	But the difference is Zio was like a fucking copy, right?
4772293	4779038	So in the ruling, the judge basically says, here's what is and what isn't copyright.
4780178	4784501	The judge says the basic rule sets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.
4785882	4797290	He says the basic rule set of Tetris is not copyrightable as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board is not an idea you can copyright.
4797590	4798691	Hence, Dr. Mario.
4801141	4805905	You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier, but I am now since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.
4806565	4813430	Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?
4815332	4823378	It would be interesting to... Well, according to some law or some court cases against two competing games that are very similar like that... It was settled.
4823818	4824899	It never went to court, did it?
4825700	4826600	I believe it was settled.
4827512	4829616	So anyway, I'm just curious.
4830037	4833544	Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I'm just curious.
4834827	4840548	But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.
4840748	4845349	And I'm sure all of us go, okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously.
4845389	4849190	Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing.
4849230	4849810	But it's not Tetris.
4849830	4852891	Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but, you know, I digress.
4853931	4855831	Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?
4855851	4858852	It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's...
4859812	4864216	Anyway, but Zio, according to the judge, copied more than this.
4864336	4870381	They copied the exact dimensions of the play area, the shape, the color of the pieces, and other mechanics.
4874944	4877725	Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.
4878045	4883606	The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games that showed that they were identical.
4883966	4887587	They said that Zio altered enough of the game... Oh, I'm sorry.
4887667	4896669	The judge said that if Zio had altered enough of the game, like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior, it would have avoided.
4899430	4900630	So what does this mean?
4900870	4904631	And again, going off the article at GamePolitics.com, they say not much.
4905872	4910473	The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.
4910813	4913354	So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.
4913654	4917535	This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court, which means it could change.
4917895	4922937	But let's imagine, according to GamePolitics here, that it did have bearing across the U.S.,
4923357	4923677	DarkSakura.com
4940430	4940670	Nope.
4941111	4942952	Radical Fishing vs. Ninja Fishing?
4943392	4943633	Nope.
4944273	4949337	Even though some of us sit here and go, Zynga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to Tiny Tower.
4949777	4956042	But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.
4956062	4967150	Well, Zynga's smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties, and they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this, and you're gold.
4969535	4975999	GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.
4976880	4978321	Oh, that is a good thing.
4979641	4985905	YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days, including the color of each piece.
4986085	4987226	I never realized that.
4987967	4988347	Crazy.
4989784	4998971	Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating, especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network, you know, the store and all that.
4999031	5000432	So, yeah, there you go.
5001273	5002534	We'll see what happens in the future.
5002574	5006517	I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.
5006838	5011581	But, of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.
5012802	5015604	Speaking of years and years and years and years...
5017961	5028834	every week here on the show DarkSakura likes to spotlight the classic game of the week all of which I'm older than a game from the archives that DarkSakura says hey
5030583	5033205	You should be respecting this game and you should play this game.
5033586	5039971	And for the 10th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm sure DarkSakura has picked something very special tonight.
5040331	5042994	DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
5043134	5043674	Pong!
5044455	5044655	No.
5045976	5046577	Could have been.
5047077	5048358	Pong would have been a good choice.
5048458	5049079	No, it wouldn't.
5049119	5049539	Boop.
5049920	5050100	Boop.
5050640	5050820	Boop.
5051281	5051461	Boop.
5051781	5051921	No.
5052562	5053383	Beatmania 2DX.
5055160	5055780	A good choice.
5067702	5071226	And I had to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.
5071426	5082518	I started with a little game called BM98, which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.
5082958	5086682	So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.
5089324	5090904	It's a Beatmania 2DX song.
5091224	5091884	Heck yeah.
5092224	5092844	Heck yeah.
5093505	5096065	This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.
5096666	5102547	So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.
5103347	5109009	And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.
5109729	5111950	And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.
5113479	5116041	So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.
5116081	5118482	If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?
5119763	5132031	But you have two extra keys than the original five-key Beatmania, and your turntable is on the opposite side, depending on what side you're playing on.
5132451	5137915	So this has started Right Side Pride and Left Side Pride, where a lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.
5138335	5139296	Ooh, good for you.
5139416	5140076	I play right side.
5140516	5142398	Left Side Pride, weakling.
5142518	5142738	Right.
5143510	5148173	And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.
5149434	5157559	But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.
5157639	5163143	Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.
5163763	5164164	Or me.
5167666	5167866	Girl.
5169447	5170708	D'Artistio over there says Lisu.
5170928	5171108	Yeah.
5171128	5171849	I don't remember him.
5172009	5172149	Yeah.
5173652	5180981	So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.
5182604	5186969	There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time, and a backspin scratch.
5187831	5189493	So you have to scratch directionally.
5191215	5193256	For difficulty, you go from 1 to 7.
5193936	5197858	And then in 5th style, you had a flashing 7 that was the highest difficulty.
5198558	5201779	With 10th style, you actually had level 8.
5202439	5205340	And then an 8 plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.
5206761	5210382	With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.
5210783	5213263	So it's getting way past me.
5213343	5214264	I think the last one that...
5214824	5221168	I was really into was 8th Style, which I think was the last one I bought.
5223809	5233995	Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.
5234015	5235056	Ooh.
5235136	5235336	Ooh.
5238378	5261552	and also 7th style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song and then 13 distorted had multiple extra stage songs gold had two different ones the 1ES and the 1MES so yeah it was really getting crazy there like where else can they go with it
5262012	5266380	As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.
5266420	5274533	It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller.
5276374	5280055	and the effectors so basically you could control what it sounded like.
5280656	5283777	Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?
5283917	5285418	Yeah, to make it really noisy.
5285438	5287818	So you could hear it over every freaking thing else?
5288299	5289299	Can I admit something here real quick?
5289319	5291460	I mean, not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.
5292000	5294261	You have to find the song that got me into your beat What song is that?
5294281	5295341	Ultra High Heels Oh really?
5295361	5295781	Yeah I can do that
5318490	5321211	I beat the hell out of that song because I freaking loved it.
5322252	5323792	But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.
5325193	5332356	Also, the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs so you can see the song information and titles while you played.
5333937	5334737	Yeah, turn this up.
5340922	5343203	This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.
5345144	5349947	For me, I mean, even if a lot of people are like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they're just songs that were fun.
5351107	5358471	So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.
5359551	5366075	As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever.
5367095	5370177	A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.
5371258	5380443	Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.
5381003	5391950	You also had the, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.
5393150	5396531	and all kinds of really, really good artists.
5397432	5406375	Not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.
5406896	5414058	Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.
5414959	5416419	There were the...
5418941	5425365	They put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.
5426886	5435553	As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play it.
5436053	5442298	There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller and it would not work.
5442338	5443238	They wouldn't take my credit card.
5444218	5444558	I tried.
5444819	5446701	I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan.
5447001	5447902	He was going to ship it to me.
5448122	5448583	Didn't work.
5449604	5450905	One time I got Dan to agree to this.
5450925	5452847	Oh, I was so pissed.
5453248	5456911	But there are aftermarket arcade-style controllers that you can get.
5456931	5458713	And tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.
5461054	5471597	For all the different music, we just heard some Eurobeat, we had different types of dance, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions, I'd like to say.
5472577	5474757	Some rap songs in the earlier version too.
5477078	5482239	As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced Dingle, I guess?
5482259	5482699	600 songs.
5482899	5483079	Dingle.
5483099	5483459	Dingle.
5488400	5488841	Dongle.
5489542	5492085	Maybe a 2DX19 Dongle edition.
5492505	5492866	Awesome.
5493186	5493787	I support that.
5494448	5497752	Basically, the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD.
5498292	5503759	So for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit.
5504420	5505281	Like I said, hard drive.
5506897	5516284	So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tran, who is the little alien chick with white hair.
5517144	5527752	We have Yamato Tora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.
5527772	5530294	I'll try saying that three times fast.
5530874	5532735	I mean, just basically a lot of cool characters.
5532915	5540240	And you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like, who did the DJs.
5541221	5546884	Like, Etiquette, Q-Jack, Mix, all of them.
5547484	5550706	And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.
5551967	5575070	uh in fact I've actually got a um issue of Cosmode that has it's all 2DX cosplay so uh Celica all of that so anyway there you go Beatmania 2DX if you don't know what it is after listening to this show climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears there it is uh my man I love you Taku
5576773	5577673	This song was so much fun to play.
5577693	5580854	I wanted to have lots of Tran babies with you.
5581135	5581575	Not really.
5582075	5584816	A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Lingerie.
5584856	5589217	Beatmania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.
5590158	5590638	Just kidding.
5590998	5591758	Dongle style.
5591918	5592578	Dongle style.
5592798	5593719	2DX dongle style.
5594799	5597780	Alright, that does it for part A of our show.
5597800	5598741	But don't go anywhere, guys.
5598781	5600321	We have part B coming up.
5600401	5600982	And guess what?
5601322	5601842	No news.
5602342	5603983	Part B is all about you guys tonight.
5604043	5607945	That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundry is with you guys.
5608085	5608785	We'll friend your butt.
5608905	5609205	Of course.
5611386	5611766	Alright.
5612687	5615268	But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news.
5615288	5616908	We do have some news standing by if we need to.
5617068	5618509	Otherwise, Loki, you'll just run through it quick.
5618549	5619309	It's a last minute thing.
5620290	5624211	But we're hoping to get some calls here in Part B. But first, a break.
5624391	5624952	Don't go anywhere.
5624972	5629454	We've got to save Part A, you know, in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.
5629754	5634716	So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th Style.
5639286	5639747	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5661748	5663309	Otherwise, this shit is old.
5663630	5667192	And it starts with a clip from episode number one.
5667392	5674597	And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed in its entirety on this show.
5676179	5677359	Oh yes, here we go.
5677419	5678260	We'll be back after this.
5678400	5678800	I hate you.
5679281	5681462	That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5681502	5684284	Here we are live on our very first broadcast.
5684324	5684985	How's it feel, Jamie?
5685834	5687075	It feels like burning.
5688276	5689196	My thoughts exactly.
5689837	5692118	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5692158	5696581	This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.
5696681	5698562	So we thought we'd take the show a little early.
5699002	5700323	So it's actually Wednesday night.
5700383	5701243	We're at Golf Land.
5701624	5702744	But we are taping live.
5702824	5703565	No do-overs.
5704105	5705626	It's just like it was a live show.
5705806	5706507	So what do we want to do?
5706527	5707927	We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land?
5707947	5710649	I don't want to do anybody publicly.
5711209	5712550	I'm holding a bench of stuff.
5712570	5713531	Who wants to hold my wood?
5715460	5716501	Thank you for volunteering for that, Ted.
5716681	5718122	We just got a funny... Hi.
5720623	5721764	Oh, we're doing a school project.
5723045	5724506	Yeah.
5724586	5725466	For Oakmont High.
5729629	5730950	No, we're doing an online radio program.
5731990	5733111	We have an internet radio show.
5733131	5734532	Would you like to say some words for our listeners?
5735766	5742951	Um, actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.
5743732	5743852	Oh.
5743892	5744892	We're just recording ourselves.
5745113	5748975	Goddammit, Rob, these things burning a thousand degrees, I feel like burning heat.
5749075	5751197	While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot.
5751257	5752298	I'm going to do my next shot here.
5752338	5753078	Hot damn.
5753158	5753819	Some hot damn.
5754319	5754899	So, cheers.
5754959	5756280	I'm going to toast Loki's water here.
5757401	5758342	Oh, wait.
5758622	5759743	It looks like Walt Husson.
5765504	5768046	Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.
5768426	5768967	Oh, wow.
5769547	5770427	He sounds like a woman.
5770908	5771468	Shut up.
5773970	5775190	Oh, God.
5776051	5779233	It tastes like 20 Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.
5779293	5780353	Cute.
5781254	5782395	Contestants, here we go.
5782775	5784496	Snub's got to catch up, and here's his answer.
5784916	5787718	Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
5787778	5791120	Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.
5792335	5792915	Good answer.
5794116	5794456	Okay.
5794856	5799199	Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
5799279	5800680	Her secret weapon was her.
5801000	5805102	Skyline says... Oh, he changed his answer.
5805182	5806563	I think his first answer was better.
5807262	5812383	He said Orange Bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it.
5812463	5814164	His new answer is Boomstick.
5815924	5818965	So we have Remote, Collar, Exploder, Dealey, and Boomstick.
5819905	5821626	Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?
5821866	5822406	Orange Bat.
5822486	5823326	Orange Bat!
5824886	5825767	I knew it, too.
5826627	5829267	That's right, you're already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it.
5830108	5832608	Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.
5832788	5835109	Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team, Magus and Angel.
5835669	5837469	Big Black Cock.
5837650	5838990	Her big black cock!
5839010	5840050	Dun dun dun!
5842211	5843311	Sorry, that's not a match.
5843671	5844091	But funny.
5844731	5845071	Puppy.
5846572	5847432	The ferret!
5847792	5848572	The ferret!
5849552	5850773	Good answer, but not a match.
5850793	5855554	Uh, Loki.
5855714	5860135	Her secret weapon was her... Iraqi?
5861966	5863747	Suicide babies.
5864448	5865669	Iraqi suicide babies.
5866309	5867310	Jamie, is this true?
5869071	5869672	I admit it.
5870072	5871173	I've been exporting them.
5871253	5872894	I keep them in my trunk.
5875296	5876297	Alright, in your trunks.
5876517	5877698	Dear God, what about the children?
5877758	5879059	Alright, moving on.
5879339	5881260	Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.
5881701	5883522	It sucked ass, kinda.
5883862	5887105	It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.
5888906	5890968	Never rent whatever the hell that movie was.
5892813	5893396	It was bad.
5896009	5897276	Envy of the dot dot dot.
5897898	5900579	The film that we watched was called Envy.
5900780	5902020	Actually, it says Envy on the box.
5902080	5904101	It's actual full title is called Penis Envy.
5904662	5907063	It's a story about these two drifting chicks.
5907083	5908304	They're walking through the desert.
5908764	5910905	They go to this bar and they get really drunk.
5910965	5913486	And, I mean, this is talking about, like, white trash America.
5914047	5915828	They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.
5915948	5919250	And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?
5919610	5927134	And so they walk around and, lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen.
5927774	5928775	Hey, Loki?
5942549	5943550	Was it Mr. Spanky?
5943950	5956257	And then they start, like, you know, screwing this one chick, and then this other thing, they screw this other guy, and then eventually they get tired of having a penis, and so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A.
5956297	5965943	where she's at a gay bar, and then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis, but the one chick likes the penis so much, and then she ends up getting killed in the end.
5968864	5970045	That was beautiful, thank you.
5971030	5972831	Xtifer, what were you doing on my computer last night?
5972871	5975031	Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.
5975592	5978312	I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago.
5978332	5981613	You remember how messy my desktop used to be, like it was just icons everywhere, right?
5981854	5982834	And you couldn't even see my background.
5983294	5984354	Now you have balls on it.
5984434	5987195	I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?
5987615	5998079	Now, Xtifer went in, and last night, while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop, and now I have folders that say, Big Boobies Number One.
5999306	6000707	Big Boobies No.
6000727	6021618	2, Big Boobies with Cocks in Them, Blood Spattered Boobies, Boobies and Sunflowers, Boobies for Milkin, Boobies in Pee, Mastectomy Leftover Boobies, Hot Hairy Saggy Man Boobies, and then my last, my favorite here, Women in Roller Skates Peeing in Glass Bowls.
6023259	6024180	What the hell?
6025293	6026354	Why did you do that?
6026374	6030756	I'm not gonna, you know, if you're gonna download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.
6031256	6034218	Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.
6036479	6039240	By the way, um... Did they use something other than bleach?
6039520	6041581	Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?
6042202	6042422	No.
6043222	6044883	Oh, well, you know how you have, like...
6047263	6056805	What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?
6056825	6058866	I'm disgusted.
6059846	6061086	I am so disgusted.
6061826	6064007	Girls, just want to have a... Alright, I'm coming out.

6065527	6067048	Loki's singing, I'm coming out.
6068968	6070409	At the county fair with Teninga.
6071029	6071469	Here we go.
6072432	6074534	Remember, it goes, I'm coming out.

6281574	6283715	It just keeps on going on.
6286356	6288717	I'm gonna kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.
6288957	6290018	You're gonna so die.
6290538	6291579	I know where you live.
6292619	6295701	As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
6299055	6302196	A score of 6,964 points for Loki.
6302276	6303456	Not even a gold record.
6304137	6305597	There is no justice in this world.
6305677	6306077	Okay.
6307397	6309418	Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.
6309518	6311578	Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.
6311698	6313359	I laughed so hard my head scared.
6313379	6315179	I laughed so hard I peed, okay?
6315539	6316620	I peed a little.
6317420	6318500	I peed a little bit.
6319520	6322381	I can't with my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight, huh Rob?
6326070	6327534	Oh, that hurt so bad.
6327774	6328637	Oh, my God.
6330481	6334804	Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.
6334944	6354439	I did want to play something, and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro, because I was actually trying to make a new intro, but then I didn't do that, and then I did something else, and it's cheesy, but it's funny, and it's fun with text-to-speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.
6355920	6356220	Here we go.
6362867	6364188	Well this is a surprise.
6364948	6369872	I figured after 10 years of constant testing you would quit, or even better, would be dead.
6370752	6372974	I guess we should celebrate with some cake.
6373914	6375275	It's right behind that door.
6376036	6377116	Why would I lie to you?
6381539	6382740	Well here's a fun fact.
6383501	6384521	Today is cake day.
6385182	6386823	Do you know how they celebrate it?
6387523	6389965	If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.
6402662	6404583	This next test is very dangerous.
6404983	6425611	To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death, Smooth Jazz will be deployed in 3... 2... 1... Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.
6446417	6451779	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
6453759	6454299	That was cute.
6454319	6454759	I like that.
6454799	6455200	Good job.
6455660	6456040	Thank you.
6456420	6456660	All right.
6457200	6458460	Let's get back into the show, guys.
6464642	6465843	Welcome back, everybody.
6469844	6472865	You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.
6473665	6474485	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
6476263	6476685	You done.
6479657	6479958	Here we go.
6486832	6487433	Orange Lounge Radio June 23, 2002
6511098	6536287	Having live radio fail Mike sneezes And the games we don't love so much sometimes too Alright, anyhow Let's get into part B tonight And here's the thing We didn't really pull any stories for this Because we're going to open up the skyline here real soon We do want to do the mailbag first though We got some emails So while you load that though We do have the Fugle Question of the Week We still did that this week So I'm going to go ahead and load that up Here it is, the Fugle Question of the Week
6544452	6548254	As a reminder, the Foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.
6548354	6550115	Put them together and you get Foogle.
6550955	6557359	Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+, it really should be like Gacebook or something.
6559240	6562081	Sadly, you're not a lot of Google users, but we do have some.
6562881	6565603	And we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+.
6566183	6568324	And we did get some answers to our question of the week.
6568364	6568804	Here it is.
6569465	6571026	It is a little self-serving this week.
6571946	6573527	Considering the occasion, deal with it.
6574087	6581351	We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts or a friend told you about it.
6581831	6586313	What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?
6586974	6589075	So going to Google+, here are the answers.
6590075	6592017	We have 13xForever says, Oh, and Ferret.
6612620	6618766	Even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization, or at least it looks like it.
6620107	6622549	Tony M replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.
6622950	6633920	The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games, no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase... Oops.
6634160	6634801	Oh, crap.
6634941	6636322	I almost closed the window on accident.
6637603	6638283	Jeez, Rob.
6638643	6640084	Fail.
6641084	6645686	It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.
6647487	6647907	Perfect.
6648387	6652289	I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase your own games.
6652649	6655010	And this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.
6655290	6662793	The show's coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.
6663913	6664593	Technist says,
6690018	6695961	Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news, but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.
6696462	6702745	Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic, us fanboys?
6703225	6703485	Never.
6704366	6707468	I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.
6707828	6708888	Finally, I will end with this.
6709048	6711950	OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.
6712310	6717193	As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think, I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.
6717853	6718493	That's really nice.
6718854	6719154	Thank you.
6720235	6724218	All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.
6724238	6728742	Let's see, we got 20 answers.
6728762	6729563	Do you think I can read them all?
6730404	6731165	Oh, go for it.
6731645	6735549	This chick named Nelly replied and said, Spousal pressure.
6736049	6737731	What's up with that?
6739753	6740974	Let's see, Picaruno said...
6741696	6749482	Seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining, and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the hosts in such a familiar way is something you don't really get anywhere else.
6751043	6758189	Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005, and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.
6758389	6759010	Stay independent.
6759870	6762192	Ranma says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.
6762312	6766556	I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.
6766896	6768177	Who said we were good friends?
6768417	6769798	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6769838	6770078	Girl.
6771960	6775322	RedTheHaze says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.
6776303	6784730	A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006 when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.
6785790	6787792	It's okay to say all games interactive, by the way.
6787812	6788432	It was a great show.
6788512	6788813	It was.
6789133	6790494	It's really a bummer it's not on anymore.
6791202	6797666	I then decided to check out the podcast and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast and just how really nice people y'all are.
6797986	6801968	The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.
6802308	6805530	More power to you guys and gals and may you have another 10 years of awesome.
6805910	6806291	P.S.
6807463	6810546	Again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.
6810606	6812628	The Stupor Bowl?
6813849	6817032	Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head.
6817092	6819995	And then the announcer voice says, blah, blah.
6821356	6821857	Makes me laugh.
6822448	6822869	Let's see.
6823689	6827973	Deakman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lounge Radio to go.
6828013	6830855	You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.
6831235	6834958	After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.
6835879	6838741	Fabrice A says, the chemistry between three good friends.
6838941	6841123	Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.
6841723	6843204	Thank you for noticing that because we really do.
6845005	6847607	Terry J says, I've been listening since late 2005.
6848207	6852429	I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.
6852749	6855950	To put it simple, you guys know your shit and your presentation proves it.
6856270	6858471	Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.
6858792	6860132	Don't tell Loki he knows this shit.
6860172	6861393	It'll only increase his ego.
6861833	6862313	I'm just kidding.
6862993	6863914	That's why my head hurts.
6864294	6864974	It can't fit.
6865374	6867735	Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy.
6869456	6870517	is why he's listened twice.
6871318	6876302	Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.
6876642	6879785	I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.
6881236	6884317	Benny L says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.
6884737	6887258	Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.
6888498	6890039	A local.
6890159	6893800	Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.
6895020	6896641	Dan M, don't inflate his ego again.
6896661	6897221	What did I tell you?
6897581	6900022	Dan M says, I kept listening because it was relatable.
6900282	6903063	The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.
6903383	6904943	I was also told there would be cake.
6906804	6907324	We have cookies.
6907504	6908324	It's behind the other door.
6909185	6909885	It's cake day, you know.
6909905	6910185	Yeah.
6910640	6911361	I prefer pie.
6912962	6913622	There's a joke there.
6914343	6923729	Clover N says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.
6924669	6929513	Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.
6929893	6935917	What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.
6936317	6940200	Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.
6940680	6949414	Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.
6950515	6953059	That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.
6953079	6955323	That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.
6957265	6959907	Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.
6960768	6966834	From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.
6967054	6972279	2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.
6972699	6973660	Wow, he had a reputation?
6974180	6976521	I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.
6977422	6980603	There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.
6980683	6985606	I really enjoyed the segments such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.
6985986	6988227	I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.
6988547	6992770	This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.
6993690	6997373	Flo Walker, Mel B, says, I was down with OLR since day one.
6997694	7004520	It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.
7004840	7008323	Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.
7008363	7008824	Well, that helps.
7009284	7013287	I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.
7013467	7013928	Still do.
7015589	7020453	Mel B was one of the freestyle kings when the show first started.
7020513	7023555	He brought his cred to OLR very early on.
7023575	7026097	They were on episode 6 or something like that, Mel and Mel.
7026878	7029600	We're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.
7029760	7034003	I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.
7034584	7036265	Just another good friend I made because of DDR.
7037646	7038167	Believe it or not.
7039814	7040175	Let's see.
7040595	7041896	Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.
7042416	7042836	You know what?
7042936	7043657	It's a special show.
7043697	7044277	I'm reading them all.
7044377	7044758	I don't care.
7045718	7048480	Chiggers says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.
7048640	7051462	The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.
7051842	7057526	Always a witty comment from DarkSakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.
7057906	7059547	I love you guys so much.
7059788	7061229	Add the extra O. So much.
7062069	7067292	I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.
7067592	7069453	Keep it up and here's to another 10 years.
7070193	7071874	Dave Falcon says, I was in college.
7072014	7075415	I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.
7075856	7081638	Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints and cheats on the internet.
7082179	7085640	Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?
7086100	7087601	OLR came up in the search.
7087961	7088842	So I checked it out.
7089182	7091603	Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
7091943	7097669	Gee, however did discussion on the Sims trigger our show, DarkSakura?
7098490	7098910	Shut up.
7100251	7102013	I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways.
7102354	7102634	Hush.
7103675	7105397	Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.
7105577	7105897	Garrus.
7107859	7108139	All right.
7109019	7109359	Let's see.
7109880	7110820	Oops, I lost my place here.
7111780	7112020	Oh, yes.
7112360	7115321	So I checked it out, listened to the show for about a year until I left school.
7115701	7116921	Fast forward to 2012.
7117041	7118402	I'm living in Washington, D.C.
7118462	7122223	since 2007, working in social media and got engaged in December 2011.
7123143	7123523	P.S.
7123603	7125443	My fiance is a huge video game lover.
7126124	7126964	Well, you lucked out.
7129045	7148000	I saw Sky's post on DDRfreak.com back when those forums were still popular I thought I'd check out the show and admittedly I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly Bomani to video games in general but it turned out to be a really entertaining show I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view which are all pretty different and unique I was hooked and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on
7148260	7149200	Alright, last comment.
7149220	7149540	You ready?
7149600	7150161	Last one.
7151521	7155563	Orange Right says, The first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.
7156243	7158764	I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.
7160384	7169908	I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much, and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.
7170428	7171188	Stay gold.
7172881	7181339	great feedback guys thank you I apologize if you thought that went on a little long but you know what I really enjoyed reading all that stuff so I have fuzzies now thank you very much
7182924	7183204	All right.
7183524	7184345	They're kind of warm.
7184865	7187687	AkumaJP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems.
7187887	7188968	So he sent me a private message.
7189048	7189608	So why not?
7189929	7190169	Why not?
7190189	7190329	Do it.
7190869	7198914	The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.
7200055	7201596	That's pretty powerful, actually.
7201876	7202236	Yeah.
7202777	7206839	And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.
7208340	7212001	But, you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.
7212341	7216162	Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now, like, you're working in the game industry.
7216182	7219943	And, you know, I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.
7220043	7226525	I mean, I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do Umlaut, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.
7226545	7228086	I got to do the design for Umlaut last year.
7228166	7228486	Exactly.
7228526	7229986	We've had a great experience through him.
7230066	7232687	And, you know, I have other friends that probably would appreciate it.
7232707	7233227	I don't name them.
7233627	7240252	but I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.
7240352	7241133	Really appreciate it.
7243634	7244035	All right.
7245056	7246677	That's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
7249078	7249979	What do we do next?
7250019	7250700	How about the mailbag?
7250720	7251620	I think the mailbag's up next.
7251640	7252241	Does that sound good?
7252421	7252921	Oh, good lord.
7253462	7253722	All right.
7253782	7254903	So we got some emails tonight?
7255503	7256044	A few.
7256264	7256824	A few?
7257084	7257845	I'm going to read them all.
7258205	7258525	All right.
7258766	7259306	I read them all.
7261648	7261908	Go ahead.
7262341	7265202	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
7266542	7270304	This is actually from DarkTensia, but there's a lot of pictures.
7271824	7278566	Why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?
7278806	7279647	I will see what I can do.
7280287	7281267	Oh, Joe.
7281567	7282567	Hi, Joe.
7282948	7285989	So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.
7286289	7286709	That's right.
7287649	7297514	But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio battle royale thing, which, interestingly enough, DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day.
7297534	7298854	Was that the paper plate battle royale?
7299955	7300515	Oh, lord.
7300895	7301916	I remember because I won.
7304013	7305334	They can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.
7305434	7305754	Oh, hey.
7306634	7307294	Here, use this one.
7308335	7309255	She's in chat right now.
7309635	7309895	Yeah.
7309915	7310195	I'm sorry.
7310836	7313897	So yeah, these will have to go on the forum.
7314617	7315917	Okay.
7315997	7316978	Okay, so next up.
7317178	7318518	Oh, it's from Robert Kidman.
7319399	7320359	Send me some biscuits.
7327789	7333872	Thank you for 10 wonderful years and your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.
7334312	7347279	Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays, finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.
7347979	7349921	If it weren't for OLR, there would be no Geek Life.
7350101	7354545	Tiara and I wouldn't have met and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.
7355767	7357248	Strange how these things happen.
7357288	7363554	Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.
7364194	7365135	So yeah, thank you.
7365476	7366537	Long may it continue.
7366637	7369640	And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.
7369980	7370981	That's Rob from Geek Life.
7372915	7392940	by the way huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well and I love Geek Life I'm going to be doing a guest column for them Tiara received an opportunity and she didn't think of the other Rob she didn't think of Dan she didn't think of Jamie she thought of me and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed and I'm so excited
7394710	7398292	Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.
7399233	7402235	I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.
7403215	7403495	Okay.
7404016	7405297	I make this promise from here out.
7405437	7410860	I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week because I still have to finish part two of Tabletop Gaming.
7411040	7411480	There you go.
7411961	7412221	Okay.
7412381	7412821	Due Monday.
7414162	7414542	I'm kidding.
7414722	7415163	Wednesday.
7415183	7416484	It's due before Wednesday, Rob.
7417404	7418986	Hey OLR and OLR me.
7419426	7425251	I wanted to give a shout out and congratulate you on 10 years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.
7425651	7426492	It's quite a feat.
7427073	7430756	I remember when I first met Rob, it was New Year's 2008 slash 9.
7431236	7434059	He was sick and quiet on the couch.
7434099	7436921	We got to chatting and he mentioned he was a gamer, G-A-Y-M-E-R.
7437902	7441444	I knew then he'd be a good friend and then he told me about his podcast.
7441924	7443085	I figured, man, why not?
7443125	7443705	I'll download it.
7443765	7445766	I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.
7445826	7450929	For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.
7451449	7454871	Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.
7455011	7457152	It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.
7458093	7460174	Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.
7460214	7465697	Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.
7466818	7470502	I've seen your last two to three studios and I know you're on a shoestring budget.
7470882	7478451	So as DarkSakura is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
7478551	7479012	Wait, what?
7482762	7485825	This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.
7485885	7486805	Let me finish reading it, Rob.
7487045	7487286	Okay.
7487626	7489427	So take note of the time and count them up.
7489568	7492590	Let me know what the total is and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.
7493371	7494932	I believe in the work that you do.
7495152	7495893	Please keep it up.
7495973	7503439	Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.
7503539	7507562	I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.
7508022	7509904	Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft.
7510064	7510785	Matt.
7510925	7511025	P.S.
7511105	7512006	You guys are old as fuck.
7514307	7520792	Did I just hear that somebody is donating $10 for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?
7522794	7526097	Donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.
7526477	7529239	Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?
7529319	7529839	In the chat room?
7530020	7530260	Yeah.
7530740	7531301	How many people?
7531521	7533622	It's 79 people in chat right now.
7533842	7536124	And I got a print screen right there.
7536304	7537025	79 people in the chat room.
7539488	7540229	We love you, Matt!
7560091	7560932	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7584861	7587643	Wow, that's super cool.
7588124	7591846	I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.
7593147	7593388	Okay.
7593568	7594388	Oh, it's three bots, 76.
7594609	7594849	Okay.
7595129	7594849	76.
7595769	7605657	All right, this is from... The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.
7606298	7611542	It's a link on here about fall unlocking those Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.
7611622	7614464	God, I hope so, because I'm not buying those things.
7616500	7622885	You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.
7623285	7627588	But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.
7627968	7628909	Remember 1 vs. 100?
7629289	7636174	Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes so they must have felt it was too much like money.
7637015	7639456	So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.
7639596	7644300	Strangely, we can have a skee-ball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.
7644320	7645341	And that's from blah blah blah blah blah.
7647588	7648391	Moving forward.
7650900	7678445	um hey OLR hi it's the one and only Degenerate Johnny five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program it might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants my personal favorite was the one about the wee peripherals or as Loki put it $20 pieces of awkward shit Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with okay wow
7679845	7701071	regardless of doing this show for 10 consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of with that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters myself included congratulations for reaching the 10 year mark here's to another 10 years of successful podcasting your faithful listener Degenerate Johnny
7701471	7701891	P.S.
7702552	7707134	I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.
7707554	7709675	What selection would you suggest for a first comer?
7709955	7712736	Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.
7712796	7715117	You know who should be giving us money per each listener?
7715157	7716017	Pinkberry!
7716037	7716818	It's Pinkberry.
7719219	7721220	My personal favorite is the chocolate.
7721540	7724321	However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.
7724361	7726202	Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.
7728413	7730695	Moving forward, thank you, Johnny.
7731295	7731856	Thank you, Johnny.
7732256	7733157	Howdy, OLR.
7733737	7734498	Howdy, partner.
7735739	7738280	I just wanted to say congrats on 10 years of doing the show.
7738801	7746346	It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.
7746747	7749549	You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.
7750229	7753332	We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and Gal to look up to.
7753412	7755413	Here is to 10 more years of OLR, Brad.
7756574	7757915	It's from Brad at PodCulture.
7758075	7759055	We love PodCulture.
7759175	7759836	Mondays on VOG.
7760476	7762597	I still need to get you your missing stuff.
7762857	7763058	Sorry.
7763078	7763938	Is it premiering this week?
7765579	7767200	A premiere episode of PodCulture?
7767380	7767540	Yeah.
7767780	7769161	I believe it is this week, yes.
7769321	7769521	Okay.
7769830	7770591	Yay!
7771732	7783922	Alright, Dear OLR, I was hoping to write a long rambling email in honor of your 10th birthday on how this show has kept my attention for 7 years, longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.
7784523	7787265	By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.
7788446	7809199	use, use an honor I can recognize on how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out and overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show but unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the 20th anniversary instead cheers for everything Sky's Elliot B
7810099	7837241	Elliot is from the UK he's one of the VOG contributors he is from the UK and thank you I'm just me and I like video games and I have a boyfriend it is what it is and I thank you guys for just you know not giving a shit which people shouldn't be happy that people are in love that's what it's all about and Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection
7838539	7840962	I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but all right.
7841063	7842625	I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.
7842845	7843105	Oh, okay.
7845108	7845348	Okay.
7846249	7851837	This one has a title in Spanish, and he actually corrected me about El Telefonos en Fuego.
7851877	7856003	That's not how it's actually supposed to be said, but I don't know anything about Spanish grammar, so my bad.
7857983	7866045	Yo no se So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja Naranja, or is that it?
7867106	7878509	I guess that's orange Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?
7878769	7879449	and I'll see you next time.
7909089	7910951	I still remember the live 365 days.
7911311	7911772	So do we.
7913554	7916897	I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.
7916917	7917757	Hey, I got speakers.
7918638	7919019	You did?
7919199	7919459	I did.
7919679	7920620	At least we got something.
7920680	7922302	We didn't get a trophy, but we got speakers.
7922322	7924344	I played bingo and won speakers.
7924924	7925725	Thank you for watching!
7943533	7951296	There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff, but it also helps to show how great the community can be.
7951456	7954797	Always supportive to the show in good times and especially bad times.
7956098	7958719	You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.
7962449	7964089	We have also learned a lot from you guys.
7964229	7972293	Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong, and to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.
7973193	7980676	Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad, to not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.
7981257	7981457	Okay.
7982137	7991484	and Loki have taught us to question everything not to accept anything as it is and that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions
7994952	8017559	I laughed love it you're an inspiration for all of us listening whether it's been 10 years 5 years or even just a few months we are forever grateful for making every week a blast you may not have many awards or recognition but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet you know the one award we have is sitting on my mantle and it's not moving it was a good award it was the first podcast award for gaming yeah
8019352	8020513	Congrats, Orange Zones Radio.
8020533	8022255	Congrats for 10 fabulous years.
8022375	8029122	I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and well, anything that OLR has given me all these years.
8029603	8034648	And while you may act like a 10-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person 100 years old.
8036030	8039293	I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of 100 years old, however.
8040414	8044238	Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.
8044858	8048121	So here's for another 10 whole years of Raises Glass Toast.
8048781	8049862	Speaking of toast.
8051384	8052985	Speaking of toast.
8053626	8054506	French toast.
8055247	8055908	Wait, what?
8057449	8058250	I love French toast.
8058470	8059991	French toast is amazing.
8060211	8061032	There is a place.
8061252	8062934	Okay, I'm going on the food tangent.
8063194	8064635	There's a place in Sacramento.
8064655	8065836	Okay.
8066437	8066697	Okay.
8068596	8071377	that has French toast made out of challah.
8072677	8073238	What's challah?
8073898	8075699	Challah.
8078620	8084462	It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.
8085262	8086362	That does sound delicious.
8086542	8088663	And it makes the best French toast.
8089283	8090164	Challah French toast.
8091224	8093765	Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.
8095282	8099665	So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.
8099745	8101886	And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.
8102326	8105988	So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.
8106448	8112772	And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, 10 more years, what do you say?
8113112	8113813	To our 40s?
8113913	8114713	To our 40s!
8115754	8118295	I'm trying not to spill.
8119176	8119876	We had clingies.
8120557	8121117	Clingies.
8123044	8124324	Okay.
8124945	8125845	Now, everyone get drunk.
8127845	8128846	As I spill it on my shirt.
8128866	8129686	That's some good wine.
8129886	8131686	I'm going to get water intoxicated.
8132287	8133907	It's making my headache feel a lot better.
8134067	8134427	That's good.
8134567	8137008	I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake.
8137468	8142729	It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey, I'm going to do this real quick.
8142769	8144330	And then my brain's like, no.
8145750	8147451	By the way, I have a follow-up.
8149711	8154313	I kind of didn't react because I kind of did this double take, like, what, what?
8154373	8163295	But I'm text messaging Grandpa right now, and I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said, it says this number, but it's 76 when you subtract the bots.
8163775	8166616	And I said, I won't hold you to that.
8166676	8167676	You really don't have to.
8167936	8169737	He replied back, I'm of my word.
8169757	8172478	$760 for VOG right there.
8172558	8172778	Sweet.
8173058	8173438	So that's...
8174478	8176300	I'll throw in another 40 just to round it up to 80.
8176661	8178062	What the hell?
8179143	8179484	What?
8180465	8180765	Really?
8180945	8182427	Yeah.
8182587	8185049	I like round numbers.
8185210	8186251	And you know what, Rob?
8186591	8186811	What?
8187532	8190175	What I will do, because you know I had that account open.
8191376	8193879	How about we go take it and convert it to a business account?
8194155	8195055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8213783	8241498	BlackWolf and I have probably paid about that much out of pocket like I can't speak to what BlackWolf has spent but I know I've spent enough let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running and I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much if not about twice as much from his end of the things because he bought software and designs for the site so just to like get that money for the next year is a great great burden off our shoulders actually
8241809	8249416	Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working on it.
8250216	8255141	And, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone who's been listening, too.
8255261	8259144	But there'll be more coming up about the book because I'm designing it beginning to end.
8259965	8260085	So.
8261753	8264175	As soon as people send me old logos.
8264435	8268438	Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say how you don't make any money on the show.
8268478	8269979	Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.
8270479	8274462	We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would be nice.
8275542	8277424	The money's gonna go right back into the show.
8277564	8286690	I can tell you, I came this close, this close to dropping $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise for the show.
8286790	8291313	And the only, because I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like, oh my God,
8291813	8293955	And don't forget my husband works at Radio Shack
8315268	8341708	so all right um thank you guys so much we will have as soon as good wine as soon as Jamie has the account set up we will tell you guys how you can donate we have to we have to tread carefully here though because I'm really worried about tax stuff I don't know that stuff at all so I need tax help if anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us that's what I could really use well I mean I think it's actually and I'm not gonna say any more about this but maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license
8342328	8342829	We had one.
8343309	8343689	We did.
8343930	8344690	Yeah, we let it lapse.
8344750	8345111	Yeah.
8345491	8347072	Anyway, we won't talk about that on air.
8347573	8347793	Okay.
8348734	8348934	All right.
8348974	8350055	We have four emails left.
8350335	8350495	Yes.
8351236	8355399	Dear Orange Launch Radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday.
8355920	8358842	In an attempt to keep this email short and to the point, let me say thank you.
8359302	8362445	I started listening to the podcast back on March... What?
8364066	8364807	I heard snorting.
8364947	8365507	Just chat.
8365948	8366228	Okay.
8366768	8370771	I started listening to the podcast back in March 2010 after I bought my first iPod Touch.
8370991	8371271	Wow.
8372011	8375514	From that point on, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki have become an important part of my life.
8376134	8376755	Do we touch you?
8377675	8378075	Okay, anyway.
8380757	8389179	I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life, and I fully agree with the listeners.
8389339	8395361	Through bad relationships, major family issues, and a brief period of unemployment, OLR has been a constant positive in my life.
8395982	8402264	With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room and fellow listeners have become my second family.
8403124	8406346	Once again, thank you, Orange Lounge Radio, for running strong for 10 years.
8406827	8412731	You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak, and you have definitely been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.
8413331	8419976	Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to be there, just like how OLR has been there for me.
8420336	8423618	Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.
8423979	8424599	Happy birthday.
8424619	8425920	And that's from Sherzo, a.k.a.
8425980	8426280	Gion.
8427541	8430823	And I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.
8431864	8432866	I'm feeling verklempt.
8433747	8435469	Here's a topic, talk amongst yourselves.
8436210	8436671	Sorry, no.
8437892	8438193	Okay.
8439815	8440335	Three more to go.
8441036	8441697	Holy moly.
8442839	8444321	To Rob, Loki, and DarkSakura.
8444921	8451246	As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you have done over the past 10 years in an effort to entertain your listeners.
8451927	8454189	I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.
8455850	8457532	Ah, who cares?
8457552	8458272	They sucked anyway.
8458672	8459033	Bite me.
8459793	8461455	And then, that was just on behalf of them.
8461855	8463135	We had good years on Life 365.
8463175	8464156	They took care of us for a little while.
8464176	8464716	We did.
8464776	8465516	We did.
8465776	8466577	Betty was nice.
8467137	8467657	Betty was nice.
8468117	8473299	And then becoming a member of the All Games community and finally joining you on your very own network, VOG.
8473839	8479961	I have met each of you at least once, although I'm fairly certain it is more than that, whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.
8481221	8487304	The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meet up at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.
8487665	8495249	I remember listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed the whole group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.
8495649	8501973	I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.
8502573	8509537	Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.
8510277	8513758	I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.
8513798	8518480	Congratulations on this incredible milestone, and I look forward to seeing everyone again at future events.
8518880	8519860	And that's from Shadow Next Gen.
8520860	8521360	I agree.
8521440	8533264	That was a great memory, and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that, because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.
8536649	8539670	This one isn't an anniversary memory, it's actually news.
8540390	8542330	Alright, fair enough.
8543251	8544451	There's gaming news this week?
8545391	8557153	Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic, and this is Turrican, sorry, will be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra November 10th in Cologne, Germany.
8558154	8558834	Have a good one, guys.
8558854	8559614	That comes from RDG.
8560194	8562135	I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turricans.
8562195	8563675	It's a link from Kickstarter.
8563935	8566176	Very cool.
8566436	8568037	Oh, dude, we got another email in, too.
8569777	8571658	Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?
8572178	8573879	This one comes from Dan Shadow.
8574599	8576159	Congratulations on 10 years, guys.
8576239	8582482	I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two parts, and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.
8582602	8584502	I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.
8584922	8587963	Since this show, I lost my virginity.
8589824	8590405	Me too.
8590725	8591325	No, just kidding.
8591385	8597370	Graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie, ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.
8597970	8598631	Feel old yet?
8598751	8600692	Phoenix Force 5 for the win.
8601253	8601793	Thanks, guys.
8601973	8602474	I'm Batman.
8603454	8609799	That's... Okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.
8610320	8610820	All right, yeah.
8611120	8613342	And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.
8613782	8617365	He'd talk like that, so he's Batman.
8619019	8642200	No, I am Batman And then this one, okay Dear OLR, I love the podcast, however there is one thing I must say Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having at the moment Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite Okay
8642760	8645662	You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.
8646003	8648204	We had pizza because we were playing Catan.
8648224	8651407	What does that have to do with pizza?
8652116	8654538	Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.
8654558	8656060	I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.
8656100	8657301	Bacon and garlic pizza.
8657821	8658982	That actually sounds pretty epic.
8661204	8664267	I also have never had Pinkberry and hope to try it someday.
8664307	8665348	What flavor should I get?
8666089	8666529	Chocolate?
8666629	8666950	Strawberry?
8667010	8673896	I seriously want Pinkberry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.
8674196	8677780	I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.
8679204	8683869	We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.
8684149	8685971	I want blood orange lounge radio.
8686792	8689034	Yes.
8689154	8691317	Thanks to Keep Up the Great Work, Randy.
8692478	8693619	You know what?
8693859	8699805	That is two emails on our 10th anniversary going, congrats, tell me more about Pinkberry.
8700546	8702147	Randy Peters Are you feeling Randy?
8724258	8725619	Starring Randy Peters.
8725719	8726380	Yeah, I could see that.
8726540	8728982	That would be the best male porn name ever.
8729122	8730743	It sounds like a British male porn name.
8732484	8733965	Or Sir John Thomas.
8735546	8737668	Alright, is that it for emails?
8738208	8738689	That is it.
8738729	8739349	I closed it.
8739469	8741210	Well, you know what comes after the emails?
8742131	8744293	Ten years of pent-up angst.
8756317	8756977	Here's your mama.
8760498	8764919	F you to me, because I missed Girls Gone Wild today, and I was so excited about it.
8765379	8767520	But I was like, I was dreaming about the show.
8767640	8769260	I texted Rob in my sleep.
8770280	8772001	Okay?
8772541	8773001	And Garrus.
8774421	8776382	I blame Garrus for this, too.
8777162	8778943	And I blame Shane for me blaming Garrus.
8779183	8781204	Because, fuck Mass Effect.
8782344	8787306	I've played over, since yesterday, I've played 20-something hours of Mass Effect.
8788287	8789647	I do not know what's wrong with me.
8790588	8792308	I never even did that on WoW.
8793089	8798451	So, the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy VI.
8800052	8801072	When I was in high school.
8801652	8802112	Just saying.
8802393	8802793	Just saying.
8803853	8804133	I'm done.
8805254	8805574	Loki.
8805594	8805674	Loki.
8806414	8813098	I fuck you to my headache because I hate getting these... I think it's a sinus headache because, you know, it's been a little windy today.
8813858	8820902	And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post, you know, a blog about this show having a 10 year anniversary.
8820982	8823723	Because, you know, they can have wonderful, you know...
8824944	8847149	topics like woman hit by ball sues little leaguer or work in progress zombie survival short story or you know hey is this person on the forum gay you know they can have those you know posts on there oh but I post about something and they're just like yeah no we need to remove that post that is kind of stupid
8847819	8848499	Eh, whatever.
8848760	8849340	They're kids.
8850280	8852481	Why am I on a forum about... Fuck kids!
8852501	8856223	Why am I on a modding forum with all fucking... Seriously, it's all kids.
8856303	8857044	I mean, not really.
8858024	8861126	I mean... I'm not like that guy at Penn State.
8861286	8868170	I talk to these people online, and then I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about modding and stuff, and they're like teenagers.
8868330	8870311	I mean, I feel so old.
8870331	8873212	I'm like, yeah, I'm like 30-something, and you're 16, 17?
8873272	8874012	I don't know.
8878152	8880475	BlackWolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.
8880555	8886081	We never made the front page, but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.
8886421	8889565	Probably helped that we asked pretty please onto Facebook and so forth.
8889645	8889985	But anyway.
8891481	8896426	My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.
8897987	8898488	Moving on.
8898888	8900350	Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.
8900370	8901691	The stuff that I brought is wheat-free.
8902431	8905414	Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.
8905935	8912341	Gamer Girl has this FU to, she has this, what is that, carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.
8913862	8914723	So FU to that.
8918198	8936557	F you to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today and he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza so F you to Loki Misty I will go ahead and second that F you to carpal tunnel I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist
8937606	8941131	Other than that, yeah, again, not winning the lottery.
8942433	8947880	Because when I win the lottery, once I get all the tech shit dealt with, I will supply money for the fort.
8949179	8949519	Awesome.
8949679	8950740	F you to not having a fort.
8952141	8953401	I think that's what it comes down to.
8953601	8954161	Thanks, you guys.
8954902	8956763	All right, that does it for the FUs of the week.
8956823	8957243	Let's see.
8957343	8958944	So we did FUs, check.

8960084	8960765	Fugle, check.

9006345	9008266	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
9030939	9032281	So I'll second JV, man.
9033624	9037690	Well, that's not all I have to say, but that was the most important thing in the last five minutes, that's for sure.
9037991	9041116	It's always important to turn to Loki and say, hey, buddy, F you.
9043203	9043643	Oh, it is.
9043883	9044264	Oh, it is.
9044884	9045504	Time and time again.
9046105	9055110	Oh, I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 2002.
9056911	9059173	I know I was still in high school, so that puts it in 2003.
9059613	9067718	I remember my group of friends that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani discussion that we all know and love.
9068078	9071160	And obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less than that.
9072379	9073801	I have no idea why I just said that.
9073901	9078047	Obviously, it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.
9081031	9081932	Hopefully, in a good way.
9082793	9083354	Oh, absolutely.
9083815	9084315	Well, thank you.
9085217	9089923	Numerous events of live coverage and yeah, definitely, hopefully, that all starts coming back.
9090572	9092333	Yeah, and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.
9117862	9118482	No shit No shit
9141004	9150793	July, August, November, January, and then at the very least continuing perpetual August and January after that seems kind of definitive.

9171877	9176338	Pay way too much money, unfortunately, is the answer to that question.
9176378	9176698	Hooray.
9176778	9179219	And next time, warn me so we can crash it together.
9179779	9180880	Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

9199165	9199485	What's up?
9200475	9202977	Well, I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world.
9203057	9203917	Can you guess them?
9204357	9206218	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9206559	9207819	You're talking to me.
9210721	9212282	Talking about Mass Effect with me.
9213583	9215104	None of those are the right answer.
9215384	9216925	I am playing Mass Effect.
9217005	9219046	I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.
9223989	9226952	So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.
9227072	9227712	Thank you.
9227732	9229554	Appreciate your paying attention.
9229594	9229794	Yes.
9230935	9237220	And I wanted to say that for me, without this show, I never would have worked at Konami.
9237520	9238941	And that's a major thing for me.
9239161	9241603	So I have to thank the show for that.
9242944	9244926	I'm kind of sorry about that, too, at the same time.
9244986	9246327	No, I'm kidding.
9246367	9247088	Nowadays, yeah.
9247208	9249069	You had some great memories at Konami, though, right?
9249490	9249750	Yes.
9249890	9252152	Like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.
9255283	9258744	That was one of my best memories Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?
9259565	9262426	Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?
9263046	9269569	No What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR that you can talk about?
9270771	9287146	I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR, but I would say one of the more scandalous things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one, we had no females work there anymore, so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.
9291465	9296307	I mean, he still had underwear on, but he decided that since there were no females, there was no reason for pants.
9296467	9296887	Hey, Shane.
9296907	9296988	Yes?
9297648	9299889	Last week I went to work with no pants.
9300789	9301229	What was that?
9301550	9302950	Last week I went to work with no pants.
9302970	9303991	Maybe you were wearing a skirt.
9304511	9305711	This is true.
9305731	9306852	He was not wearing a skirt.
9307092	9309293	Wait, let me... This is really important, Shane.
9309313	9310514	This is the most important question.
9311134	9313015	Was it boxers or briefs?
9313055	9314055	It was boxers.
9314215	9315336	Okay, because boxers...
9315876	9317217	That's kind of like swimwear.
9317297	9318237	That's not that bad.
9318657	9319037	That's exciting.
9319057	9320958	But still going with no pants.
9321218	9321879	That is true.
9321979	9322379	That is true.
9322399	9324220	Now, boxer briefs are fairly exciting.
9325220	9326020	They're kind of in the middle.
9326060	9328962	Because then you get the grippy with the... All right, look.
9330542	9332283	That's not what we're here to talk about tonight.
9332323	9333684	I don't know what show you're listening to.
9333704	9334644	I could wear lounge or radio.
9335822	9337663	This sounds about par for the course.
9337683	9339523	Not what you're talking about.
9339784	9340744	And Garrus.
9341004	9343885	That's a great story about Konami.
9343925	9345646	Some of the games were designed with no pants.
9346846	9348007	You'd think they would have come out better.
9349627	9350027	No, just kidding.
9350047	9351728	The Ultramix games were the best in the series.
9351768	9353989	You know I've always said that, and it's not just because you guys were working on them.
9354349	9367334	Pantsless Rage But think about this you guys If it weren't for this show Then Shane would have ended up at Konami In a way, this show impacted the game we made this show about
9368257	9368657	It's true.
9369477	9375920	And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusive reveals because I was the one that brought those songs to you.
9376100	9376520	That's true.
9376560	9378060	You brought the first couple.
9378120	9382262	And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.
9382362	9386043	And unfortunately, we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.
9386523	9387724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9407216	9412960	His lack of impact, not being at Konami anymore, has greatly been felt.
9415822	9416463	This is true.
9417824	9422447	As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.
9423928	9431594	That's true, but as I was, I think, talking to him one night about... I go back and look at my old stuff, and some of it's garbage.
9431614	9431694	Yeah.
9433926	9437427	Really, really, truly garbage, and I wish I could get a do-over.
9438107	9446989	It's kind of funny, too, because you got me into Echo Image, which is one of my favorite bands ever now because of DDR.
9447569	9451570	And maybe I'm not supposed to say this, but oh shit, oh well, it's been seven years.
9452010	9454911	You told me about that song long before the game was out.
9455411	9456411	Because it was amazing.
9456511	9458712	And played the CD for me.
9458772	9458932	What?
9459332	9460472	Thanks for watching!
9477358	9478298	That's right, it was.
9478499	9485241	And then, so, God, I've probably known you at least nine years, because I remember you came to the show, like, during its first year and all that.
9485301	9491944	But, yeah, you told me about Skulk and all that, and then we found the CD somewhere, and I fell in love with that CD.
9492044	9496246	And that's one of my favorite bands ever now, even though they only ever did one stinking album.
9497048	9499429	Yes, because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.
9500789	9501949	Which is, you know, the same thing.
9501969	9503950	They're just high.
9504330	9507071	Shane, I gotta let you go to get more calls.
9507171	9509031	Anything else you want to say, especially about us?
9510132	9511392	No, why would I want to talk about you?
9511732	9512052	I don't know.
9512392	9513073	Because we're awesome.
9513573	9514233	Because of Garrus.
9515393	9517274	I thought it was but Garrus, not because of Garrus.
9517374	9518694	Everything is Garrus.
9518874	9521715	Without us, Shane, you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.
9522435	9523096	That's a lie.
9523256	9524056	It's the reverse.
9526030	9526591	Alright, bye.
9527111	9527351	Bye.
9546870	9547310	Oh, okay.
9547971	9551252	I don't know why I'm hearing myself, but go ahead and say what you want to say.
9551592	9552252	Oh, I'm sorry.
9552312	9554593	I got to... Yeah.
9554813	9561556	I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years while off and on, and I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.
9561836	9562116	Yay.
9562176	9563317	Give me a second.
9565131	9566592	Dang it.
9567572	9573154	I wanted to say that I enjoy listening to you guys.
9573274	9588961	When I came back from Rhode Island and I was starting to get into Dance Dance Revolution, I found you guys on Live 365 and I started listening and I met a lot of good friends like Richie, which is...
9592332	9593834	I forget his name on here.
9594915	9598678	I've met Junami, and I just stayed for a long time.
9599259	9606706	And if you guys weren't here, I wouldn't have started, had the inspiration to start Disingenious Radio, which is still going, by the way.
9607307	9608568	Congratulations on that.
9608948	9613971	I actually was... I mean, this is going to sound terrible, but I knew you guys had started the show, or the station.
9614031	9622755	I knew it was kind of like a spin-off of what had been going on at OLR, but I actually thought it stopped during the time we were doing all games, but apparently it hadn't.
9622915	9623556	It's still going.
9624136	9625237	Yep, we're still doing it.
9644492	9650577	Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of like took over from there and created like a solid stream and everything.
9650657	9656082	I ask him every now and then if I can start my own stream, you know, stream on the station.
9656802	9662207	And he lets me every now and then, but I haven't gotten in contact with him for like a few months, but I do.
9662927	9689728	I think one of the best comments we ever get on the show about doing the show is that you know you guys because of you guys I kind of figured out how to do my own podcast or I learned that any idiot can podcast because you guys do it so I started my own show and believe it or not that's actually like you know what they say imitation is the finest form or is the finest form of flattery not to say that everybody's copying us because I don't think they are but just the fact that we're empowering people to let their own voices be heard
9690448	9692329	means a lot, and it's a great compliment.
9692369	9692849	It really is.
9693370	9693710	Yeah.
9695410	9696611	Thank you for being around.
9696691	9701733	If you weren't around, I would never have any friends from the DDR universe.
9701773	9704515	I've been friends with Junami for over seven years.
9704815	9705355	Wow.
9705715	9709657	Well, congrats, and thank you for listening and being here with the show.
9709677	9711258	Do you have anything else you want to share tonight?
9711946	9713648	I love you guys!
9714089	9715030	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
9715450	9716131	Hold on, hold on.
9716191	9717412	Somebody else wants to send kisses.
9717593	9718033	Here he is.
9719795	9720256	There you go.
9721998	9722258	Alright.
9722518	9723419	Have a great night, Uni.
9724100	9724601	Bye.
9724641	9724981	Bye.
9727124	9728185	I don't even have to give the number.
9728245	9729246	The calls just keep coming in.
9729286	9730227	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9730247	9730568	Who's this?
9731772	9735474	I was trying to do the math on how long I've been actually listening and I came up with
9763103	9764884	2004, I started listening to the show.
9765465	9766625	Wow, that was a long time ago.
9766926	9767806	And thank you for the holiday news.
9767826	9773729	And you know, the funny thing is, I didn't start listening to it all at first.
9774190	9781754	I think I told you this guy several times, that I started listening to a show that you would have on Wednesday nights on Life's 365, Outside the Box.
9787412	9792798	Which is kind of the prerequisite to the video game show that this became.
9809993	9811094	In a way, yeah.
9811214	9814456	I never really thought about it that way, which I know sounds weird, but you're right.
9814596	9819699	Like, we kind of started doing the general gaming chat there.
9819820	9824883	I think I kind of always had the fire in me to do, like, a general gaming show.
9825103	9829025	And, like, I think maybe subconsciously I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.
9829446	9831147	So that's why we had Outside the Box.
9831927	9837251	I think, you know, back then it was you, DDR Angel, and Wanky Style.
9837991	9838331	Yes.
9838351	9839032	Kind of thing.
9839112	9839232	Mm-hmm.
9841575	9842556	That's when I started listening.
9842636	9857112	I was originally introduced to the show by Sephora 1216, who caught on to it from DDR Freak rebroadcasting the show.
9858374	9866100	Oh yeah, DDR4 Yeah, they rebroadcast us And then I caught on to the other shows With that So
9879514	9880756	It is Wednesday night.
9881176	9886082	You are tuned in to Outside the Box, live on Orange Lounge Radio.
9886523	9895293	Outside the Box is a show dedicated to video game news, reviews, and all the other randomness you might discover outside the box.
9895994	9906724	To interact live with our show, check out our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com Check out the chat room and interact with us links.
9907225	9912249	And now, here are your hosts, Sky, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style.
9913809	9919934	I remember one of the ones, because I used to play Final Fantasy XI right next to you guys when you were doing that.
9920134	9921775	Yeah.
9921955	9927019	And it was Final Fantasy VII where you guys were playing One Winged Angel or whatever.
9927499	9928560	Murder!
9931422	9933344	Yeah, that was a good murder.
9933624	9934845	You know, you bring up a good point.
9934945	9936166	That really was.
9937026	9939088	I mean, especially as you listen to the intro.
9939248	9942911	It's about video games and all the randomness outside the box.
9943351	9945432	That's kind of this fucking show now.
9946472	9946732	Yeah.
9947113	9949113	So, in a way, Outside the Box took over.
9949614	9950594	You make a damn good point.
9951534	9951795	Yeah.
9952495	9957717	You know, most of all, you know, all of that has always been about the community, the fans and everything.
9957797	9963019	And I think over the past 10 years, we've kind of grown to a really nice community.
9964060	9967441	We've gotten friends involved in the show.
9967541	9971703	I mean, I've got high... I've told a couple people, and now you guys...
9972591	9977655	with Wally R. You guys are going to have a dream game about you guys coming out.
9977775	9982559	So, you know, Rob always says, you know, tell a friend.
9982959	9983460	And it's true.
9983700	9988384	You tell a friend and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.
9988704	9989204	That's right.
9989304	9992667	And then it funds my future trips to New York, which I'm trying to get back to.
9992747	9995509	But $800 will go a long way and get me back to New York.
9995549	9996250	No, I'm kidding.
9996290	9996670	I'm kidding.
9996690	9996971	I'm kidding.
9997291	10000113	But I will be trying to get back to New York with my own money very soon.
10000193	10000954	So that would be awesome.
10002043	10022767	I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations and next time I see any of you guys I buy you a beer or probably in your case Red Mango or Pinkberry I'll take free beer and free yogurt and I will always exchange holiday cards with you
10024042	10024522	That's true.
10024802	10025263	That's true.
10025703	10025963	Absolutely.
10026203	10026283	Yep.
10040310	10063595	I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show and I see YYR's in chat so he can confirm or deny this YYR of course is making the first OLR dream game a reality Bunget Ferret Tossing which I guess he's in like push push push mode with it right now and it sounds like it's gonna be a big game like it's gonna be one that people are talking about outside this show that is awesome it's gonna be awesome
10064235	10066777	We're going to do all we can to make Bungie Ferret Tossing a success.
10067998	10068379	You know what?
10068519	10073363	I actually have to thank SSJ100Matt for having a hand in helping me with my conversion.
10074544	10075505	Oh, that's true.
10076826	10077286	There we go.
10077526	10080369	That's the big thing you went through personally on this show.
10081130	10082190	Well, I did get married.
10082711	10083391	Oh yeah, there's that too.
10084552	10085433	Eh, that's no big deal.
10085593	10086054	I'm just kidding.
10088357	10090599	Alright, um... I mean, I got married too.
10091120	10092281	I'm not making a big deal out of it.
10092481	10095184	I got... I had like four boyfriends.
10095244	10099928	Alright, let's... But this one's the best one, obviously.
10100329	10100809	I agree.
10101430	10101710	Me too.
10101890	10102551	Alright, let's move on.
10103492	10104533	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10104553	10104953	Who's this?
10106795	10107095	Hello?
10107456	10108977	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10108997	10109358	Who's this?
10109758	10109798	Hi.
10110319	10111600	This is Rama from Indonesia.
10112300	10114982	Whoa, we got a call from Indonesia tonight?
10115822	10116062	Yes.
10116803	10118384	I recognize your name from Twitter.
10118684	10120445	I'm happy you're listening live.
10120525	10121225	What's up, buddy?
10122526	10123887	Yeah, it's fun.
10123947	10130151	It's nice to talk to you finally because I've been here since 2006, I guess.
10131131	10132272	Oh my gosh.
10132352	10134073	Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
10135354	10139556	Yeah, so I just want to say that maybe I'm the father's caller.
10141211	10144055	I did enjoy everything.
10144215	10147620	Even though I'm a blind person, I can enjoy everything that you've done.
10148381	10149963	Especially Loki and
10150780	10152621	All of that kind of jokes.
10152962	10153482	It's nice.
10154303	10158706	Unfortunately, because of the distance, you're breaking up really bad, and we're having a hard time hearing you.
10158826	10164730	But I think I heard something about, and I know this is true about you from Twitter and everything, that you are a blind gamer.
10164890	10166851	And you know what's funny is that we've had a couple.
10166871	10168932	You're not the only one, which is funny.
10168972	10173235	We've had a couple blind gamers that I've heard from from Twitter, and we've gotten emails as well.
10173776	10174997	And it's really...
10176457	10185061	It's really humbling in a way because sometimes we take things for granted, like sight, that not everybody has.
10185742	10193425	And I'm so happy that we get to kind of deliver something that you don't need that for to be able to participate in this program.
10195206	10195627	It's just a...
10197007	10201229	It's a really humbling how big am I in this universe type of feeling.
10201289	10203731	I can't explain it, but it's amazing.
10203991	10206892	And thank you for that and for sharing that with us.
10208153	10208673	Absolutely.
10208713	10212795	Just would like to say happy birthday and enjoy the life.
10213315	10213675	Thank you.
10213735	10214176	Thank you.
10214416	10215236	Thank you so much.
10215316	10215876	Oh, my gosh.
10216377	10220439	And please keep sending us more videos of you playing Chrono Trigger songs because that was great.
10220599	10221179	Absolutely.
10221279	10221559	All right.
10221879	10222560	Take care, buddy.
10222580	10222880	See you, guys.
10224346	10226247	Give everyone in Indonesia hugs for us.
10226387	10227008	The whole country.
10227808	10228248	Get started.
10229109	10230350	Yeah, what time is it over there right now?
10230370	10231010	That's what I'd like to know.
10231030	10232151	All right, we got another call coming in.
10232411	10233251	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10233271	10233612	Who's this?
10235032	10235393	Hello, guys.
10235413	10235833	Can you hear me?
10236253	10237154	Hello, we can hear you.
10237194	10237694	Hi, who's this?
10238615	10240316	Wow, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
10240516	10241877	DDR Dollar Bill.
10242217	10243137	What is up, buddy?
10243377	10245579	Hey, not much.
10245999	10253904	Just first off, I want to wish you guys a happy 10-year anniversary since you're one of the few podcasts I know has been around for 10 years.
10254881	10260024	We are finally snatching the crown of we are the longest running video game podcast on the internet.
10260064	10268048	We've done some heavy research and we don't think anybody has been around right now anyway as long as we have.
10269068	10274751	You know, it's a nice feather to put in our hat but what we don't want to do is we don't want to be all like
10275331	10280333	Well, we're the best because we've been around that long because that's not the impression we want to give.
10280393	10283254	There's a lot of great, great shows out there.
10283615	10287816	And, you know, just the other day I was kind of talking on Twitter with Video Game Outsiders.
10287836	10289397	I brought them up on the show plenty of times.
10289497	10290437	I think they're a great show.
10290738	10301382	They have a very similar chemistry to what we have here except they kind of like whereas our foundation is DDR, they were an adult gaming community that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter games.
10301402	10303423	So obviously a very different type of thing.
10303803	10332002	But they were talking about like, wow, we've been around for seven years But I guess they had to correct somebody like, oh yeah, OLR's been around longer But I'm like, dude, don't sell yourself short What you guys have accomplished in seven years is amazing Most shows don't get to six months or one year True And, you know, to have your own community and all that It's just, it's an amazing feeling, it really is So, anyway That's exactly the reason why I try to listen to you guys as much as I can
10332574	10336076	because it's mostly the community that actually has me hooked on it.
10336557	10342440	I've met a lot of great people on there, some in real life and some I wish I could meet in real life one day.
10342841	10347884	You know, I've met some, I know I knew DJ Ranma from a while back from some of the conventions.
10348504	10353427	I finally got to meet, you know, I actually got to hang out with Misty a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic.
10355089	10361933	I got to meet some of the other people like the Effective Candy way back in the day and Gamer Girl is one of my closest friends now and
10362679	10363359	and even Jamie.
10363419	10368461	As much as I don't talk to her, I still consider her really cool and one of the people I admire the most.
10369501	10369681	Aww.
10371381	10372462	Now I'm gonna cry.
10372482	10375603	Uh-oh, someone's chopping onions in the OLR studios.
10375863	10376543	Oh, shut up.
10376683	10378063	Oh, just wait till October, dude.
10378724	10379304	Wait, what's in October?
10381756	10384077	Oh yeah, there's a train gathering.
10384437	10386538	I'm hanging out with Misty for that one in Philly.
10386999	10387899	That's awesome.
10387939	10392882	Just to know that this show made people want to hang out is so cool.
10393822	10400465	We really need to make an effort to get to more conventions and do these, especially PAX, because that's one that all the fans want to get to.
10400845	10407449	And just try to get people together and just like, hey, let's go do what this show was.
10408089	10408589	Think about it.
10408910	10413032	This show is because we used to go to the arcades and play video games and talk shit.
10413473	10416575	So let's get together, IRL, play video games and talk shit.
10417976	10418696	Exactly.
10419857	10422319	Oh my god, did you see that guy Rob holding onto the bar?
10424020	10433627	What you did this week, I forgot, I mentioned, well, I didn't play it, but I installed Step Mania on my laptop, mainly because I was looking for sound files from Fourth Mix, but I couldn't find them.
10434387	10436529	But, uh, yeah.
10436549	10436589	Oh.
10437634	10452451	I have to admit, when I was playing DDR this week, because I did play Max 2 and I played Disney Rave once each, and I have to admit, there was a part of me that even though that dance pad was ass, because it was from a golf land, and one of the buttons didn't even work, there was a part of me that went, I kind of miss this.
10452611	10457413	Yeah, well, I was watching, was it 4th Mix Plus and 4th Mix videos and stuff like that?
10457433	10458873	I'm like, damn, I miss them.
10458993	10460454	That machine was awesome.
10460854	10465375	Even just 4th Mix and stuff, and Max and Max 2 were pretty sweet.
10465895	10475178	And I kind of wish we had, like, some of the... Because, like, I was even looking at some of the... Because I never really got into Supernova and Supernova 2, and, like, I don't even know what the hell they have now.
10475238	10478739	It's, like, that versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff.
10479100	10480360	And there's, like, you know...
10481923	10482143	Fuck em!
10482163	10482263	Amen.
10511010	10512171	I did the same exact thing.
10512611	10516574	When I was at Anime Central this year, they had a 4th Mix Plus machine.
10517975	10526281	And I got on and I started doing tech and then I think through the second song I said, ah, fuck this, I'm not a techie.
10526782	10529484	So I freestyled the rest of the damn stages.
10531325	10531785	Nice.
10532066	10532826	That is awesome.
10533547	10539391	And also, in over New Jersey, down the Jersey Shore, there is an older but still workable
10540118	10540759	and 7th Mix.
10564700	10584982	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome We would love that It's finally starting to quiet down a little bit on Skype I think a lot of the people that were wanting to get through Oh shit, there it goes again Spoke too soon Let's pick up the phone Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10586107	10587067	Hey, it's Blender.
10587348	10588068	Blender!
10588148	10589248	What is on your mind, my friend?
10589429	10590309	Are you making a smoothie?
10590329	10590649	Nothing.
10592310	10593510	I don't think he's a blender.
10593590	10594391	He's a blender.
10596232	10597632	Congratulations, you guys.
10598052	10598753	Thank you.
10599733	10606056	You know, the only reason I found you guys was through Bobby Blackwolf's show because I was a big fan of his on Friday Night Gaming.
10606596	10614900	And I believe that the partnership that you guys have got together now is going to bring you to a much better future.
10615874	10620371	and I'm so glad to be around seeing this, you know?
10621092	10625594	Well, you know, Bobby and us, you know, are very kind of like-minded.
10625694	10628195	I mean, Bobby was a big music game fan as well.
10628355	10633637	If you kind of look at our classic game of the week, Beatmania 2DX, Bobby will admit that's one of his favorite games.
10633657	10636078	He even said in chat he would have that game in his basement.
10636398	10641300	So there's a lot that Bobby and us have in common, yet we're different enough where that our shows kind of are different.
10641320	10642900	You know, he's the very NPR show.
10643220	10646582	We're the very Morning Room, Waka Waka Waka type of show.
10646602	10646682	Yeah.
10648763	10650683	We do need a Waka Waka Waka soundboard.
10651884	10654485	But, you know, the two of us actually complement each other very well.
10654525	10657726	And I think kind of professionally, there's a lot we look at too.
10657906	10662227	And, you know, especially, you know, obviously it's no secret there's been some big changes in the past year.
10662647	10666449	And there was a lot that we were looking at going, what could we be doing better?
10666529	10671651	We kind of feel like right now we're kind of riding a stationary bike right now.
10672071	10672971	We're doing our things.
10673011	10674092	We're burning calories.
10674112	10674912	We ain't going anywhere.
10674932	10675452	Yeah.
10675492	10675752	Exactly.
10675772	10675992	Mm-hmm.
10676112	10680534	And I wouldn't have been listening to your show without him, and I'm so glad that I stumbled upon it.
10680614	10682935	Unfortunately, due to my current situation at the time,
10703920	10707162	I still have an open invitation for you guys if you ever pass through Napa I have a wine
10725418	10732141	a tour for you set up to where I'm going to point out the places for you guys to go and you guys are all going to have a good time.
10732321	10737144	Well, I bet JV Mon wishes he'd known that the other day when he went out there testing.
10737664	10741205	I'd be down for that as long as someone will carry me by the time we're done.
10741225	10744147	Yeah, I would have to get a DD, but if we can figure that out.
10744227	10745347	I'm not a fan of wine.
10745588	10748489	Jamie, trust me, I know the bus schedule, so you'll be all right.
10749900	10753985	Well, we might have to take you up on that someday because you know what I love more than video games?
10754686	10755987	Booze!
10756448	10757409	Drink responsibly.
10758430	10760312	All right, well, congratulations.
10760653	10761794	Here's to another 10 years.
10761814	10762735	You guys take care.
10763616	10764617	All right, and game good.
10764818	10766159	All right, we're going to do our best, buddy.
10766179	10766760	Thanks so much.
10768499	10770560	And thanks again for the VOG Network Clubhouse.
10771760	10772380	That shit is epic.
10772840	10773501	You know what, Rob?
10774601	10775701	Go ahead, DarkSakura first.
10775981	10786745	Okay, well, in the article that Tara wrote on Geek Life, there's actually a link to the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio back in the day that talked about our first few shows.
10787405	10788485	So I relinked that in the chat room.
10788745	10789005	Nice.
10789426	10789846	Very cool.
10789966	10790546	Loki, where were you?
10790566	10793727	Speaking of the Clubhouse, I was trying to visit the Clubhouse yesterday.
10795294	10808057	I'm so glad I've never come back to home because I downloaded the new client, which I'm pissed off because it didn't fucking save my crazy hobo Santa, which is weird.
10808878	10810338	So I had a new character.
10810598	10812418	So I was like, okay, I'm going to check out the clothes in there.
10813039	10813499	Crash.
10814039	10814839	Okay, fine.
10815019	10815939	I'm not going to check out the clothes.
10816079	10817180	Relaunch the whole thing again.
10817620	10818940	I'm going to try altering my appearance.
10819180	10820000	Crash again.
10820220	10821141	So I'm like, fuck this.
10821281	10822241	I'm not coming back to home.
10822441	10824584	We got another call coming in I want to get to, but let me just say this.
10824604	10829570	I think home would benefit greatly if they would just force you to do a 2 gig download up front.
10829650	10832934	I mean, there's just so much buffering and loading.
10833835	10835618	That's the one drawback.
10835678	10836439	It's not as...
10837640	10838681	Thanks for watching!
10858407	10861970	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10883459	10884100	Friends rock.
10884260	10885441	Friends give you money when you're poor.
10885461	10885922	Friendship is magic.
10886062	10886503	Don't forget.
10888625	10889086	Die.
10891689	10894112	But I have here three drinks.
10894272	10897416	I have a Loki, I have a Jamie, and I have a Rob.
10897996	10898176	Now...
10899110	10904773	The first drink I dedicate to Loki is a shot of very strong honey mead.
10905333	10907875	Because he is straightforward to the point.
10908235	10909596	Will say what he has to say.
10910156	10912137	And in the end, honey badger doesn't give a fuck.
10913138	10917280	And it burns a little going down, doesn't it?
10917320	10919821	Let's just walk away from that comment.
10919841	10922263	Ew, he's eating that snake.
10922303	10923123	That's disgusting.
10924604	10924644	Ow.
10926212	10928574	Next up I have for Jamie.
10929314	10932116	Now for Christmas I got this nice bottle of rum.
10933037	10938821	It's very potent, very powerful, and I only open it for special occasions and close friends.
10939302	10944826	And Jamie is my darling Oog-Chan, so I toast this glass to her.
10945326	10946267	Thank you, Ran-Chan.
10947048	10948188	Think it might have onions in it.
10948509	10949850	Think it might have a little onion in it.
10950350	10951771	I'm going to have a beer for you when I get home.
10952732	10953612	Make sure it's a Guinness.
10954053	10955434	I'm not a Guinness, but it's a Killian's.
10956613	10959655	I remember Captain Fabulous.
10978628	10980469	And it is fabulous!
10981189	10981769	Oh, definitely.
10981789	10984430	Do you remember the drink we invented at Faname?
10984450	10985771	Oh, God.
10985791	10992133	When all we had was a bottle of Pineapple Malibu, so we paid five bucks for a 20-ounce of 7-Up.
10992173	10992733	That was epic.
10992753	10993793	That was so epic.
10995014	10997935	We made that 7-Up last, and we were playing Apples to Apples.
10998835	10999935	Oh, hell yes.
11000055	11001896	Drunk on Pineapple Malibu and 7-Up.
11001976	11004877	Uh-oh, Sean, you are the party girl.
11006273	11008335	And you saw me through my horrible cosplay.
11009536	11011098	There's no such thing as horrible cosplay.
11011118	11011659	Get over that.
11011679	11012019	Come on now.
11012059	11020208	I'm kind of disappointed that we didn't get to go to, uh, you know, Fanime to do, like, because that was one of the plans was, well, we're gonna do something at Fanime for our 10 year anniversary or whatever.
11021229	11023612	I still have my costume from Halloween in my car.
11024493	11024593	Hmm.
11024773	11034237	I was waiting to use that again Oh my god, that's awesome Alright, well, Ranma, I gotta let you go to try and squeeze in a few more calls I didn't even take the drink yet Oh, drink it!
11034497	11035357	Drink it!
11035377	11050943	Chug, chug, chug, chug Here's to you, here's to me The best of friends we'll ever be If we should ever happen to disagree Well, fuck you, and here's to me And it's going down So I have to show you the other toast Here's to us Who's like us?

11055658	11056779	Work's gonna be fun tomorrow.
11058561	11059863	Have a DD if you need it.
11060243	11061224	Alright, Ranma.
11061565	11062806	You better sleep fabulous, homegirl.
11063067	11063407	I will.
11065369	11066390	Happy Pride, Ranma.

11069374	11069974	Stay Luigi.
11070855	11071276	Will do.
11074147	11101128	1877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio it was gay pride this weekend by the way in San Francisco and that brought up the conversation in the chat room what if OLR had a pride parade what would be the first float and I said of course the opening float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float followed immediately by dykes on bikes because you can't have a parade without dykes on bikes I'm sorry that's what the people are coming out to see
11104773	11105113	Did you?
11105553	11106434	Yes.
11107534	11110176	There was a few naked dykes on bikes at the parade today, too.
11110476	11113718	That's because you're in San Francisco, home of the finest.
11114099	11115279	All right, let's take some more calls.
11115339	11116360	Hi, you're on Orange Tawns Radio.
11116380	11116740	Who's this?
11118281	11119142	Hey, this is Actdeft.
11119302	11120122	Hey, Actdeft, what's up?
11120142	11120723	Hi, Actdeft.
11121944	11128468	Well, first of all, I want to, again, congratulate you for 10 years of magnificent online radio.
11130049	11132110	Thank you very much, and thank you for being a part of it.
11133669	11140496	I'll actually say my words in Spanish, even though you probably won't understand it, but you know the message, you know the feeling.
11141376	11147682	Estas son las mañanitas que cantaba el rey David.
11149004	11153988	A los muchachos y las muchachas bonitas que las cantaban así.
11154789	11158453	Despierta, ola, despierta, mira que ya amaneció.
11160011	11161472	That was very nice.
11161492	11161972	Thank you.
11161992	11162293	Thank you.
11181645	11185386	It's humbling to know that it's a worldwide show.
11185486	11187347	And we've even been complimented before.

11288683	11290104	What's up, Georgie?
11290704	11295046	Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you on your teniversary.
11298448	11300649	Pretty soon this show will be older than you, George.
11301330	11303131	I know, I'm looking forward to it.
11303571	11303771	Haha.
11306440	11309264	George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?
11309284	11315331	That's what I want to know Oh, I don't know, I guess it's just my natural charm
11317063	11317924	No, it's Sterlok.
11317944	11318664	Hi, how's it going?
11319105	11320045	Oh, it's good, it's good.
11320085	11321886	No, that was a good impression, I gotta say.
11322187	11322867	Oh my.
11323748	11324608	Oh my.
11324908	11326269	What's on your mind, Sterlok?
11326469	11328571	Besides apparently George Takei.
11331853	11332453	No, I don't know.
11333254	11339438	I've always wanted to do that, just, I don't know, a long time ago, like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned...
11341181	11345062	Something about George Takei and... He needs to be my gay daddy.
11347904	11357427	Well, I thought about calling in to the voicemail or something and just leaving a message as George Takei, saying like, oh, I heard your comments and I just wanted to say thank you.
11359028	11359888	But anyway...
11361295	11362116	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11378892	11384775	You forget, when you hear George Takei's voice, you kind of forget that he's 78 and you still want to sleep with it, you know?
11384896	11386837	I know, you cannot tell by his voice that he's that old.
11386857	11390159	He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know?
11391079	11396182	He just always had that deep and melodious theatrical voice.
11396242	11399384	Fifth dream in our chatroom says, I'm having Seaman flashbacks.
11399824	11401286	NBA star Tim Hardaway is having a very rough week.
11401306	11407452	He put out a statement apologizing for saying he hates gay people today, or at least his lawyer put it out.
11417222	11433087	and needless to say this rant, this crazy rant has upset a lot of people including the NBA which banned him from all future league related events and there was also reaction today from a prominent member of the gay community including this celebrity who went so far as to tape a PSA.
11435167	11436688	Hello, I'm George Takei.
11437908	11444810	Recently I've been troubled to hear comments made by former NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway who said
11445988	11447129	I hate gay people.
11447549	11450210	Let it be known, I don't like gay people.
11450710	11451731	I'm homophobic.
11453492	11456873	As a gay man and a human being, I was shocked and saddened.
11457874	11466538	But I want you to know, Tim, on behalf of gay people everywhere, that despite your ugly words, we don't hate you.
11467419	11469880	As a matter of fact, we like you.
11471877	11473398	We like you very much.
11473798	11483381	We particularly like your large, powerful hands.
11483481	11490823	Your smooth, chocolatey head.
11492224	11494084	Raged in man sweat.
11495485	11499986	I'll keep my eyes on you and let it be known, one day,
11500748	11511839	When you least expect it, I will have sex with you I love sweaty basketball players
11513809	11520513	Alright, I'm sorry that was quiet, but unfortunately that was at max volume, because YouTubes aren't standardized, unfortunately.
11520533	11521574	I hadn't heard that, actually.
11521594	11522054	That was awesome.
11522154	11523715	Oh, it's freaking amazing.
11523755	11524616	I love George Takei.
11524676	11524956	Anyway.
11525497	11529759	But anyway, I wanted to talk about how I discovered OLR.
11530340	11530800	Oh, please!
11531380	11534262	Kind of an interesting... I came in at a weird time.
11535143	11542708	I came in sometime in 07, back when... It was in that weird point where...
11543956	11548279	You guys were being syndicated on All Games but not broadcasting from there.
11548860	11549200	Oh, right.
11549240	11552122	Yeah, we were the first affiliate show on All Games Radio.
11552483	11556446	And, yeah, again, Bobby was the station manager at All Games at the time.
11556506	11564372	And, you know, because he liked OLR and he knew we were doing the syndication with DDR Freak Radio for a time, he offered it up to us.
11564432	11566653	And we were like, heck, yeah, more people to hear our show?
11566693	11567094	Of course.
11567254	11567654	Why not?
11567754	11567934	Yeah.
11568114	11569936	So, yeah, that was a great thing for us.
11570441	11580066	So I remember when the whole Live 365 crap went down when they were raising their prices and you guys weren't sure what you were going to do for a while.
11580527	11581327	That's very true.
11582948	11590272	But yeah, I've been, I don't know, I forget what my first exact episode was.
11590452	11594594	It was like, I don't know, in the 150s I want to say, or maybe 250s.
11594634	11594734	Yeah.
11599562	11611475	But I don't know, there was just something about the chemistry there with the three guys and it was just a lot of fun to listen to and very funny and entertaining and I was just kind of hooked.
11612560	11619243	Well, thank you for getting hooked on whatever crack cocaine we must be offering because people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough.
11619303	11621043	I just got to go back and get another hit.
11622584	11627146	Now it's just like I can't imagine not listening to it on Sunday nights.
11627246	11630407	It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like, well, shit, what am I going to do for three hours?
11631307	11634531	It's a nice sentiment, but it's also a little bit scary, I gotta admit.
11634571	11637815	Because, you know, as they say, all good things must come to an end.
11637855	11640018	There will be a time when OLR will end.
11640058	11642541	I'm not saying it's happening now, or that it's even planned.
11643101	11645064	But, you know, shit happens.
11645845	11646946	And we've had our scares.
11647286	11649930	We have had many scares here on Orange Lounge Radio.
11650950	11653271	Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still here.
11653371	11656993	But there is going to come a time where we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending.
11657734	11661415	And that's the impact that's going to have on some people.
11661776	11667918	I'm always like, well, thank God we have an archive of 400 plus episodes that people could always go back and listen to.
11667938	11672621	When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode that I have and just marathon it.
11673361	11674382	I have a new friend.
11674882	11677223	I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well.
11678427	11679368	You know this girl, right?
11680088	11681750	And she loves Beverly Hills 90210.
11682851	11684772	And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended.
11684812	11685393	Not the new one.
11685413	11685873	We don't count it.
11686213	11687694	She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended.
11687775	11690377	So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD.
11690877	11690997	Aww.
11693840	11722661	it's just like with the new Thundercats where it's just I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon but it's like like most things that are remade it's just pales in comparison to the classic 80s cartoon the same mutual friend introduced me to a site a while back that's actually gone now that's called Elijah Wood is very very very very very very gay and it was all kind of fuchsia colored
11723360	11723700	Nice.
11724280	11725121	I saw her the other day.
11725661	11725901	I know.
11725961	11726761	She told me about it.
11726841	11733284	Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that because there's something else involving her that's happening next week that I want you to be a part of.
11733644	11733944	All right.
11734265	11735165	And you're going to tell me no.
11735945	11738926	Anyway, Osfer in chat says, don't ever end.
11739047	11740087	I will cry so hard.
11740507	11742048	Not half as hard as we probably will.
11742108	11742688	Except for Loki.
11742708	11743148	He doesn't cry.
11743828	11744089	All right.
11746149	11747510	He'll cry a single man tear.
11747590	11749411	Let's not talk about that.
11749911	11751512	Ten more years, right, kids?
11751872	11752092	Yes.
11752572	11753572	is that DDR Angel?
11779542	11780623	Hi!
11780703	11782444	It is so good to hear from you.
11783044	11784945	The brain's behind the EcoMaker.
11785646	11786166	I know.
11787086	11787687	Isn't it great?
11788087	11788367	Yes.
11789108	11789908	Well, okay.
11789948	11790408	Website.
11790448	11791229	Yeah, only brain.
11791289	11792049	Exactly, website.
11792330	11793250	No, I'm not plugging it.
11793290	11795431	That's your job, because you're going to bring back the other thing.
11795912	11799894	You can plug the website all you want, but I'm... I can't do that.
11800134	11801535	It has nothing to do with gaming.
11802015	11802676	You're done.
11803176	11804096	That's the future.
11804136	11805117	I want to talk about the past.
11805137	11806838	But, Garrus... Okay, look, shut up.
11806918	11807018	Okay.
11809219	11813263	Um, DDR Angel, you were here for many of the early episodes.
11813363	11816586	I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning, but pretty fucking- No, I wasn't.
11816606	11818107	Pretty fucking close, all things considered.
11818127	11819788	I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39.
11819828	11820029	Okay.
11820149	11821170	Or episode 39, rather.
11821190	11822831	In the scope of 462 episodes, 39 is pretty much the beginning.
11822851	11823351	Yeah, well.
11823411	11823892	But, uh, Angel, I-
11832379	11833500	Shit, I don't even know what to say.
11834481	11837143	Thank you for being a big part of those first few episodes.
11837703	11845589	I know, I think of you in many ways as one of the first really hardcore, passionate people about this show.
11846750	11847371	I still love it.
11847791	11849072	You know, every Sunday.
11850133	11855637	Even though I might not be in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always paying attention to tweets and everything else too.
11857378	11860521	I'm pretty much just like Joe sitting on the couch over there.
11862280	11876230	I just want you to know we really appreciate it, because that type of enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like Joe, Misty, JV, you know, we have lots of people that are so enthusiastic and everything, and I just remember you were one of the first, and I always thank you for that.
11876450	11887278	I have to personally thank you guys also, because not only for 10 years of friendship, thank you, but if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have met and married my husband and all that other stuff, and...
11888839	11892522	It's been a crazy 10 years, and I'm just looking forward to 10 more plus.
11893183	11908676	The crazy thing about what you just said is that you're the second person to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle your story because it's amazing, but Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook, that inadvertently, because of OLR, there was Geek Life, and because of Geek Life, there was Dan.
11909177	11911899	So kind of the same thing happened for her, in a way.
11912079	11912740	She has a Dan.
11912960	11913480	I have a Dan.
11913981	11914561	It's so...
11915422	11917343	Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way.
11917383	11918404	It blows my mind.
11918584	11924927	And in some ways, I mean, I didn't meet Alan through OLR, but Alan and I probably got a lot closer because of it.
11924947	11928748	So even my own life, this show has had an impact on in that kind of way.
11929249	11929729	It's crazy.
11930149	11930990	It's very crazy.
11932310	11933451	But great and humbling.
11933831	11939494	But maybe we can get together and see if you guys can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show.
11939794	11941034	I'm sure we can arrange that.
11941114	11941975	Let's work out the beats.
11942950	11943751	Yeah, that'd be great.
11944271	11949496	Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier.
11949516	11951197	I'm not going to be very interesting tonight.
11951598	11954660	Big hugs for you and the hubby and thanks for being a part of OLR's history.
11955161	11956042	Hugs to you guys too.
11956302	11956662	Take care.
11956682	11957383	Happy 10 years again.
11957583	11957983	Thank you.
11958504	11959044	Bye.
11959084	11959384	Bye.
11959785	11961907	I should have asked her when the last time she played DDR was.
11964031	11965251	Maybe she's just Angel now.
11965311	11967152	I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what.
11967772	11970532	Ranma wants to know where is Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up.
11970692	11971892	Alan is working tonight.
11972073	11973893	He couldn't make the show because he's working.
11974333	11975333	Well, you know what?
11975513	11977714	In this economy, I am fucking thrilled.
11977774	11978714	He's working tonight.
11978754	11979434	Don't get me wrong.
11980614	11984555	But I'm sure he would be here to say hello and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight.
11987055	11990076	I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in because I saw a couple.
11991909	11993691	But we are getting towards the end of the show, I think.
11993891	11994631	How's your headache doing?
11994651	11995232	You feeling better?
11995732	11996153	I feel bad.
11996173	11996934	I still got pressure in my head.
11997434	12003419	I want to say thanks as well to JV Mon, because I didn't get to say this on air because you did it during break, but you got us presents.
12004260	12006842	And there's nothing I love more in the world than presents.
12007763	12012525	and I got brought Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, which you can't buy in California.
12012665	12013025	That's awesome.
12013045	12014625	The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines.
12014645	12015585	Yeah, I know.
12016186	12020807	And I love... We have the old school Keurig machine, which we don't use anymore because it sucks.
12022067	12023248	But the new one's pretty awesome.
12023268	12023668	But yeah.
12025253	12030377	They need to bring a Dunkin' Donuts over here because we don't have a fucking... Well, we have a Krispy Kreme, but it's all in Roseville.
12032258	12038162	I did drive there one time when I woke up for work at 5 in the morning because I'm like, I can't go back to sleep.
12038242	12040484	I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville or wherever.
12040644	12041365	I want a donut.
12041405	12043946	All right, let's go back to the phones.
12045648	12046588	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
12046608	12046949	Who's this?
12047549	12053715	Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, choo-choo, it's Jim Sally.
12054115	12055737	What is up, Jim Sally?
12056237	12057979	Not much, everybody.
12058019	12060422	Happy anniversary, everybody, on the show.
12060502	12060822	Thank you.
12060842	12061382	What'd you buy me?
12063184	12063985	Well, I'll tell you what.
12064145	12066187	In honor of the donations, I will donate $1...
12067512	12069553	for every minute that this call goes on for.
12069593	12070234	How's that sound?
12070254	12072335	Pay my hold!
12073516	12074056	Please hold.
12077238	12080860	Alright, seriously, I'm not going to be looking at the time, but that's hilarious.
12081520	12082221	What's on your mind, buddy?
12083561	12084442	Not much, man.
12084702	12089064	I wanted to call in and share some of my Orange Lounge radio stories.
12089525	12090085	Please.
12091046	12092587	I used to always listen to you guys.
12092667	12093767	I'll listen to The Bobby Show.
12094328	12095628	Everyone knows about The Bobby Show.
12095668	12096269	It's a great show.
12096369	12096769	He's the man.
12097529	12098770	He is the man.
12098790	12099990	I wish Bobby lived close to me.
12100050	12101671	I would just idolize him all day long.
12101711	12103792	But anyway, I listen to the Bobby show.
12103832	12107054	Then I would listen to a little OLR on live, right?
12107514	12113217	Because I have to always work early in the morning and maybe get like an hour into it.
12113697	12114297	This sounds bad.
12114337	12115478	Don't take this the wrong way, guys.
12115518	12116038	I love you guys.
12116058	12117158	Don't take this the wrong way, okay?
12117599	12117879	Listen.
12119039	12122541	I would go to bed listening to you and I'd fall asleep listening to you every night.
12123041	12124082	I know that sounds horrible.
12124122	12126583	It's just because I was really tired and I had to go to bed.
12126903	12128343	I listen to you while I sleep.
12128403	12131984	It actually sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear at night is my voice.
12132865	12134865	I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes.
12134905	12135725	I don't want to say it.
12136165	12139266	And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like, God damn it!
12139306	12139786	Yeah.
12139806	12144167	I was a champion wrestler in high school, man.
12144227	12145928	I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen, buddy.
12146408	12147348	Come on, have a snuggle.
12147608	12151429	As a caller three calls or so ago would say, oh my.
12152710	12153890	Oh, that guy was awesome, man.
12155615	12156115	But you know what?
12156155	12156876	No, wait a minute, guys.
12156896	12157817	You know what's nice, though?
12158277	12159698	I had a baby about a year ago.
12159718	12160939	Mm-hmm.
12160959	12163821	So I've been having to stay home, so my baby would always be, like, shitty at nighttime.
12163961	12164802	How'd you accomplish that?
12164842	12165903	I thought you were ill-equipped.
12167124	12167484	No!
12167624	12168245	No, yeah, yeah.
12168265	12169626	Jim Sally can do anything, baby.
12171673	12173033	This train is fully equipped.
12173053	12173854	You know what I'm saying?
12173894	12175354	You know what I'm saying?
12175394	12176854	Let's not go into details.
12176974	12177774	You know what I'm saying?
12178175	12180635	But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you guys.
12180675	12181775	And then I'd listen until midnight.
12181815	12186116	I'd sit in the rocking chair with my baby beside me and the iPod on the table and me and my baby.
12186497	12189797	For the last ten and a half months that she's been on, we listen every week.
12190077	12192798	I don't know if I want to influence a baby because that could be bad.
12192858	12194338	I totally want to influence a baby.
12194358	12196479	I already know how that turns out.
12197239	12198339	It's nice having a baby.
12198359	12201180	It's like a little Padawan learner teaching her so much shit.
12201852	12203874	She chokes the shit out of the cat right now, man.
12203894	12207098	She's gonna be ready when she gets... Fuck that dark side, man, all the way.
12207238	12208940	Fuck them light side bitches, man.
12209240	12210502	That's what I tell my baby every night.
12210902	12214586	Oh my god, your baby is gonna grow up to be an ultimate fighter.
12215988	12216689	I hope so.
12216709	12219752	Oh my god, if my little girl was an ultimate fighter, I would... Oh my Jesus.
12220313	12221054	Can you imagine?
12221274	12221374	She's
12221514	12222775	There's only two things now.
12222795	12224637	There used to be one thing I wanted from my little girl.
12224937	12226639	But now there's two things I want from my little girl.
12226679	12228840	Number one, please become an MMA fighter.
12228880	12230142	The best MMA fighter in the world.
12230462	12232003	Pencil hold motherfuckers to death.
12232103	12232744	Oh, I'd love her.
12233144	12235907	Number two, I pray to Jesus every day she's a lesbian.
12236347	12237388	Every day I pray.
12238909	12240070	Oh my god, I say Jesus.
12240090	12241771	I think of myself when I was a little boy.
12242031	12244392	When I was like a 15-year-old kid, I was a pig.
12244432	12246793	I don't want no pig boys hanging around my girl.
12247074	12247754	Fuck that shit.
12247794	12255278	I want her to just be a nice lesbian, find a nice girl, get married, and then when they want to have kids, I got two ovens to be baking babies in.
12255638	12257779	Double that bacon up, baby bacon ovens, baby.
12259340	12259840	Double them up.
12260382	12265026	Most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear you've given this some detailed thought.
12265867	12273613	Rob, I'm telling you right now, if there was, like, you know how you can pay for procedures and stuff, like do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever?
12273793	12277036	If you could pay to turn the gay switch on, I would turn it on.
12277276	12279158	That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy.
12279198	12282161	That's when you've got to sync those genetics in there.
12282201	12283722	I would have done it a long time ago, man.
12283862	12288246	I've thought about this myself, because, you know, Dan and I were trying, and I wanted to have a lesbian.
12289366	12304387	and I'll tell you why I'll tell you why okay I don't have to pay for a bris and number two I think of all the money I would save if I had a really dykey baby
12305205	12307467	Well, you also gotta think about this, too, because you're a chick, right?
12307487	12311509	If you had a ducky baby and she was more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe.
12311789	12313891	All of a sudden, you're wearing the best clothes ever, right?
12313911	12314651	Your kids buy them.
12314792	12316433	You just steal her from her closet.
12316513	12317053	Oh, man.
12317313	12322437	I gotta say, one of the perks about being gay is that, like, if I have no clean shirts... Oh, Alan has a clean shirt.
12322457	12322997	I'll steal that.
12323057	12323878	Like, it works out really well.
12323898	12325619	You know you have to take Alan's shirts, man.
12326471	12329212	Jeez, did you go to any Pride weekend this weekend, guy?
12329693	12332954	No, because, you know, I usually don't because Sundays are the show.
12333134	12334135	And I know this.
12334895	12336236	I swear I'm not saying this to get pity.
12336356	12336936	I'm really not.
12337357	12340158	The show kind of comes first before that.
12340278	12340798	I haven't gone.
12341519	12344921	I've gone to some Prides, but I usually have to, like, run home in time for the show.
12345301	12351224	And I want to say once or twice in the 10 years I did cancel out on the show that week so I could, you know, do stuff in the city.
12351284	12351424	But...
12352163	12352523	I don't know.
12352603	12356545	I don't get us all... It's too many people for me.
12356866	12359547	I get gay pride.
12359867	12371193	In the 60s when it was not okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk about and you had to hide it from the world and cops tried to arrest you because...
12371713	12372854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12390485	12391185	and deal with it.
12419341	12420843	What can you expect sometimes, right?
12420863	12424188	They're pretty old school over there, I guess.
12424288	12425149	It's dumb though, right?
12425489	12426230	It's totally dumb.
12426251	12429916	I'm straight, but I go to Pride every year and I make a t-shirt every year.
12430356	12435724	Last year I had, I'm straight 364 days a year and on the back it said, today's your lucky day.
12437423	12438644	That was a funny shirt, right?
12438664	12439264	Like, why not?
12439645	12442126	This year I had, can a straight guy get some lovin'?
12442166	12444748	And I just walked around with my arms out and I just got hugs from dudes, right?
12445168	12445949	Just get some hugs.
12446529	12450432	He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens to our brothers, man.
12451628	12454669	Gentlemen, straight boys, I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again.
12454949	12457810	The more gay dudes there are in the world, the more boobies there are for us.
12458010	12458310	Okay?
12458871	12459711	So help them out.
12460051	12461171	Let them have the pride.
12461211	12462152	Give them the pride week.
12462172	12462812	You know what I mean?
12463372	12465773	Put on this shirt and just go out and have a good time.
12466273	12467153	You can bring your girl.
12467213	12468114	No one's going to hit on her.
12468394	12470014	So why wouldn't you bring your girl with you?
12470875	12471655	It's the best.
12471755	12474796	I remember the first time I went to gay days at Disneyland.
12475496	12478497	And there were two brothers and one of them says, I'm not, but he is on his shirt.
12478517	12480178	And the other one says, I am, but he's not.
12481570	12482531	I've been to Disneyland.
12482551	12484834	I think every day might be gays day at Disneyland.
12484874	12485234	I don't know.
12485995	12488738	This is when everybody's walking around in red shirts.
12489118	12492482	You either think it's a bunch of death waiting to happen if you're a Star Trek fan.
12495944	12498385	Thanks guys, I'm just going to go to bed now
12518814	12521956	I'm going to try to snuggle with Loki and go to sleep.
12522256	12522837	Good night.
12523017	12524118	Good night, Jim.
12524818	12526299	No, I wonder, can Loki say it?
12526339	12527820	He went to the bathroom.
12527840	12528781	He went to pee.
12528841	12529842	Your call made him pee.
12531383	12533024	I scared the piss out of him, eh?
12533144	12534445	All right, Jim.
12534725	12535386	Take care, buddy.
12536066	12536506	Take care.
12536546	12536987	Later.
12537127	12537547	Bye.
12538988	12539869	Oh, my gosh.
12539929	12540189	All right.
12540249	12542571	I got to try one more call, maybe.
12543811	12545433	We're going to have to say no more at some point.
12545713	12546573	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
12546593	12546914	Who's this?
12548083	12548723	Did I hit the call?
12548883	12549324	Oh, I missed it.
12549384	12550284	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
12550304	12550664	Who's this?
12553566	12555707	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawns Radio.
12556627	12557788	Caller, we can't hear you.
12559728	12560989	Caller, we can't hear you.
12561189	12561909	Can you hear us?
12563450	12565491	Could I just make up whatever you're saying right now?
12566412	12566952	Try again later.
12568272	12570053	Echo 1-2-3, kids.
12570193	12571334	Echo 1-2-3.
12571894	12572254	All right.
12573835	12575136	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
12575176	12575536	Who's this?
12577032	12579593	Legend of Zaku.
12581854	12584775	Nothing much, just having some internet issues at home, trying to put out fires.
12585155	12585655	But yeah, happy 10th.
12585675	12585795	Really?
12585815	12586595	Nothing much.
12586615	12588036	I mean, well, aside from you celebrating 10 years,
12601297	12609221	Kind of a milestone in the sense that you walk from one niche genre of video games to encompass just about every genre.
12610101	12612182	And I guess part of it was also evolving.
12612862	12619465	You had to adapt to the fact that you couldn't just keep shoveling Vamadi for affinity.
12619805	12623767	And at some point you had to become a bit more mainstream.
12624428	12628329	At some point we had to go from Charmander to Charizard.
12628529	12629410	That had to happen.
12630814	12632835	That is true, that is true.
12632855	12640678	That's the whole point of evolving and the fact that you adapted, you won podcast awards left and right, or you were at least nominated for them.
12641058	12644359	Zaku, we just wanted to be the very best that no one ever was.
12645180	12648101	And also, everyone thinks you should be pounding on your keyboard while you're talking.
12649522	12650022	I'm not.
12650042	12651522	I'm on my phone right now.
12652183	12655524	I'm still trying to set up a new router that I had to put out fires with.
12655884	12656684	Don't pound the phone.
12659386	12660506	But yeah, I mean, that's
12660854	12663916	You were pretty much my routine for the past eight years.
12664136	12666677	Like, almost on a consecutive basis.
12667437	12668658	Except for the night that you were off.
12668758	12671480	Obviously, that breaks the streak, but you get the idea.
12671520	12673661	It was pretty much consistent.
12674141	12678943	Like, almost Sunday night, starting from 2004 onwards, was just listening to you guys.
12680904	12682445	Pretty much, that was it.
12682605	12687668	Just going there, listening to all our... And that's become almost a routine.
12689389	12689789	It is like
12690763	12691063	Go ahead.
12691283	12691804	As you were saying.
12692524	12692944	No, go ahead.
12693404	12707172	I mean, it is kind of life-changing that, you know, you have something that you, you know, that you just listen to that you try to, like, you know, out of curiosity and all of a sudden it just, like, sticks to you in a good way.
12707981	12714024	Well, Zaku, after all these years, what would you say would be your favorite memory involving you and OLR?
12714064	12718126	Because I know that I have my favorite memory involving you and OLR.
12719447	12719607	Oh.
12721268	12721928	Me and Kat?
12721948	12723309	Really?
12725710	12726451	Really?
12727491	12732474	Well... It's got an in and out, but yeah, I get the whole point.
12732654	12734655	I'm trying to remember right now.
12735315	12736196	Jeez, um...
12737998	12739878	Alright, Zaku.
12739898	12743159	No matter what I tell the other callers, you're my favorite.
12743199	12747620	Yeah, I'm right.
12747640	12748580	Alright, take care, Zaku.
12748740	12749500	Have a good night.
12768737	12796894	yeah definitely once again enjoy your 10th and may 10 more years bless upon you we will try our best we'll need lots of booze to get there hope to see you when I come to New York next thank you hopefully you make it out there like soon date TBD the date TBD alright later buddy alright alright let's go to more calls

12812848	12813849	Can I be unfired yet?
12815669	12817970	If you write on the blackboard 100 times.
12818170	12821351	I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Nogahide.
12821931	12822352	I burned it.
12823032	12823752	I burned all of them.
12824532	12825112	All of the books.
12825333	12826293	So what is on your mind, Drew?
12827231	12829011	I just wanted to congratulate you guys.
12829051	12834553	I know I've been with you guys since episode two, and it's been a long, crazy-ass ride.
12834593	12835373	I wasn't even there.
12836173	12838133	Joe has you beat by one show.
12838193	12839514	How does that make you feel?
12840494	12840874	I know.
12841374	12845015	I know there can be only one, so I'm going to have to take his head off one of these days.
12847075	12848976	What was your favorite memory of OLR?
12849016	12852816	Because I know I have mine involving you, and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table.
12853377	12854677	God damn it, man.
12855257	12855377	Um...
12857549	12859170	I'm just, I'm just giving you shit, Drew.
12859270	12863952	Karaoke Revolution, anything involving Karaoke Revolution, especially, uh, god, what was it?
12864012	12867354	Episode 69, we decided to prank you with jelly beans and the milkshakes.
12869475	12870915	And you took a sip on air.
12871416	12871656	Yeah.
12872636	12873937	The reaction was golden.
12875476	12876636	Absolutely priceless.
12876676	12878517	You'll have to go find that in the OL archive.
12881878	12883599	Jeez, Drew, it's been 10 years.
12883639	12885379	You've been listening to this show for 10 years.
12887300	12888580	Well, on and off, I imagine.
12888640	12890261	What kind of impact has this show had for you?
12891261	12898986	Well, for one, it gives me something interesting to talk about at conventions, but aside from that, you know, because I'm a really boring guy otherwise.
12899226	12904509	And you did transform from being our young Republican to being a long-haired hippie.
12904949	12905810	Sorry, I'm recovering.
12905970	12906790	That's true.
12906930	12911193	He really did go through a very psychological shift at one point, too.
12911273	12911353	It's...
12913134	12913754	We all grow up.
12913854	12918356	Y'all do whatever politics you want.
12918416	12919336	I don't care.
12919416	12920876	This is a diverse place.
12921016	12922497	I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360.
12923077	12926278	Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person go through that type of change, for sure.
12927779	12926278	360?
12927919	12930560	I don't own one of those.
12931300	12932601	Better than the Xbox Lube.
12933201	12935702	Alright, Drew, any final thoughts before we let you go?
12936469	12947397	I'm hoping for many more years to come, and I'm really appreciating the way Orange Launch Radio is going with Voice of Geeks, and hopefully everything turns out well.
12948057	12953000	I'll still keep listening, I'll still keep phoning in, and I'll be a big part of the community.
12954842	12956082	I mean, come on, it's been 10 years.
12956142	12957183	I grew up with you guys.
12958344	12959264	You did, quite literally.
12959304	12961846	That's a powerful thing to say, but yeah, in a way.
12961966	12963067	And you went to school with me.
12963727	12964308	Yes, I did.
12964827	12968690	We would often run into each other on the lawn at ARC.
12969371	12971813	The grassy knoll, which no shots were fired at.
12972193	12977158	Which is actually now sort of off-limits since they're building the new student center.
12977618	12979059	Yeah, which I will never get to see.
12980120	12980260	Aww.
12980821	12981642	You can always go back and visit.
12981662	12982302	Oh, wait, I graduated.
12982342	12982642	Never mind.
12983343	12988447	Well, Drew, thank you so much for being a part of the show for ten years, and we'll see you next week.
12989088	12989508	Definitely.
12989769	12990569	Alright, take care, buddy.
12990589	12991510	Have a good one.
12991790	12992011	Bye.
12993111	12996552	I think with that, I'm going to finally close the Skype line.
12996672	13004534	I am so sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B in addition to an hour and a half for Part A. Guys, it's okay because of Garrus.
13004714	13008715	Yeah, and the fact that DarkSakura and Loki do have to work tomorrow.
13008795	13010975	I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV.
13011856	13012156	Yay.
13012736	13013696	Which is even worse.
13014116	13014737	For a month
13029136	13031857	with episode 463.
13032917	13033237	All right.
13033977	13036238	We got to go around and wrap up the show tonight.
13036338	13038299	Quickly, last-minute stories.
13039579	13042640	Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list, and then you can add whatever you want to it.
13043140	13045901	Just real quickly, some last-minute stories that we didn't get to tonight.
13046501	13047261	Super Mario Bros.
13047341	13049322	Crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it.
13049342	13050902	There's a Kickstarter going on about that.
13051162	13051722	And he's local.
13051742	13052302	That's kind of funny.
13052362	13056244	And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him and see if he wants to come on to OLR to promote that.
13056664	13057784	I haven't done that yet, but we will.
13058024	13059726	or being violated by the copyright holders.
13082259	13085064	Valve and Adult Swim for Team Fortress.
13085164	13086606	Jamie, this was one of your stories.
13086646	13087688	I don't remember what this was about.
13087708	13088850	Yeah, I already forgot what it was about.
13089210	13091974	They're doing some sort of crossover content thing or something.
13092075	13093277	They didn't really say what yet.
13094098	13095941	Yeah, it was like a quickie.
13096246	13101908	I can only hope it's a TV series because that would be awesome based on like, you know, the meet the whomever.
13103108	13108750	Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on Xbox.com so that's likely to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon.
13109010	13110770	DarkSakura, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?
13110990	13111450	Not really.
13111670	13112831	Nothing was as good as the first one.
13112871	13113591	I mean, I'm serious.
13113991	13116532	We tried Sonic Adventure 2, was not as good as the first one.
13116632	13119253	But there are some fans that will be very happy about that, I'm sure.
13119313	13119893	And they're wrong.
13120233	13122434	Jay's raising his hand over there.
13122474	13123614	Jay, you a big Sonic Adventure 2 fan?
13124235	13128159	Yeah, if Xbox Live could take pre-orders, I'd pre-order it right now.
13129800	13130101	Awesome.
13131202	13134145	DreamWorks and EA are going to make a Need for Speed movie.
13135776	13137737	because Fast and the Furious just wasn't enough.
13137937	13139098	I'll be hiding in a cave.
13139819	13140559	Very interesting.
13140619	13146984	Capcom plans to make some Mega Man 25th anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath over Mega Man Universe or whatever.
13147004	13148665	Maybe announce the soundtrack that's in it.
13148845	13149465	Exactly.
13149986	13154589	More downloads of the old stuff will be coming to your way.
13155789	13159111	Looking quickly at the Twitter real quick, TigerClaw had sent us a couple stories.
13159752	13164074	Marvel vs. Capcom, The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming history, coming soon.
13164835	13166836	Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix.
13167837	13169437	Yikes.
13169878	13172960	Actdeft says, OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio.
13174660	13182144	Virtual Phil, who was on Horde House this week, says, if you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?
13182324	13184045	Pro tip, not Silent Hill.
13184905	13186526	If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life.
13186906	13193910	I would live in the Pokemon universe, because let's be real, Pokemon are adorable, and you could teach them to do your killing.
13194870	13200933	I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet where that is like low on the list of harvesting.
13200953	13202133	Where you could cuddle with Garrus?
13202653	13204174	Yeah, I would live on Palavan.
13204474	13204794	Loki?
13205115	13210677	You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third, but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.
13211057	13211557	Good answer.
13212098	13212858	Anybody on the couch?
13212938	13214719	What game world would you want to live in most of all?
13215785	13219026	Animal Crossing Animal Crossing says Dark Tetsuya Jay?
13220067	13227370	Infamous because coal's kind of hot Good answers, good answers Misty, did you have one?
13228870	13237854	Yeah, I agree with Pokemans because, fuck, I picked my nickname from it Ah, there you go, that's true, Misty You know what just occurred to me that would actually be really good?
13240935	13242036	The Doctor Who games
13244059	13249703	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
13269525	13270626	Can I bug you for a minute?
13292483	13292764	Alright.
13294406	13299412	Okay, well, if Alan is home from work, that means we really gotta wrap it up and get on out of here.
13299452	13301275	Loki, any last-minute stories you wanted to add?
13301395	13303698	Final Fantasy XI is getting another expansion.
13304399	13304739	Why?
13305100	13308645	Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting a new class Geomancer.
13309181	13338094	Geomancer's are cool I said a long time ago it should have got Geomancer so I'm excited they're actually getting it so they're doing that and that's just kind of crazy because I guess it's also been around for a long time and then Skylanders are getting some sidekick characters and exclusive Frito-Lay things yay so you're gonna get those in bags of Frito-Lays and you get little characters that I think are compatible with the game maybe
13343365	13356833	I don't know if it's a hint or if it's sort of a tease or something, but apparently there was an image tweeted by the creator of Seaman that is a Santa Seaman.
13358394	13364098	Perhaps hinting that there may be an announcement or a game release regarding Seaman?
13365410	13365690	Maybe?
13366531	13369472	That's been teased for a while, I think, so that could be very interesting.
13370413	13371793	Yeah.
13373074	13378617	And I guess a guy, Kim.com's launching a new Mega Upload site called Megabox.
13379757	13381678	So it'll be interesting to see what happens there.
13382579	13383199	Megabox.
13384020	13387942	Yeah, Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy XI again, to play Geomancer with him.
13387962	13390383	And you know Shane is really good at peer pressure, right, Jamie?
13390403	13390503	Yeah.
13392446	13394687	I'm telling you, free to play and my life is over.
13395508	13396028	I know, I know.
13396048	13396808	Is it going free to play?
13397149	13397749	I wish.
13398309	13398689	It should.
13399370	13406393	Because, man, I already started playing Lord of the Rings and then... I think by the time Final Fantasy XIV comes out, it probably would.
13407478	13407798	All right.
13408299	13411121	We really have to bring this show to a close and say goodnight.
13411921	13417625	First off, over the past 10 years, you guys have tuned in and supported our show, and we just want to say thank you.
13417846	13424931	And you know we never ask for your money, although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts want to help pay to keep it going.
13424971	13427232	And trust me, we really, really appreciate it.
13427292	13429114	But all we ask most of all...
13429874	13433637	Tell a friend or 20 about the show and help spread the word.
13433698	13437240	Give us a nice five-star review on iTunes or whatever pod-catching site you use.
13437561	13440023	Stitcher Radio, you can give us thumbs-ups and stars on.
13440063	13440823	We appreciate that.
13441624	13443385	And just whatever to help spread the word of our show.
13444326	13447869	Before we go, though, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.
13447909	13449951	I want to thank everybody for being here in studio tonight.
13450852	13452313	Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight.
13453153	13454655	Oh, man, I don't even know.
13454675	13457417	Speak up.
13458772	13460453	Man, I don't even know.
13460493	13461674	Ten years, you know?
13463356	13464697	I did have a request, though.
13464897	13465157	Sure!
13466078	13469561	Can you find the DJ Melvis' promo?
13470954	13471854	I think so.
13472555	13473655	Yes, I can do that.
13473735	13476737	I did an interview with him and he mentioned it.
13477137	13481039	On OrangeLaunchRadio.com you can see Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now.
13482339	13484340	And I will play that by request.
13484400	13486541	It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long.
13486561	13489803	They're talking about Seaman in chat and Alpha Cananagram said Searyman.
13491905	13492785	That might almost work.
13492805	13494967	You know, there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles.
13495007	13498090	There's people requesting a Siri versus GLaDOS.
13498731	13500552	And the guys there are seriously considering it.
13500993	13501353	All right.
13502274	13506798	To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, here's his final thought.
13507178	13508819	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
13509160	13514024	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
13514910	13520872	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
13521213	13523113	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
13523694	13529476	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
13529516	13530836	The best things in life are free.
13530856	13531657	Of course, anytime, buddy.
13534011	13537273	JV Mon, thank you so much for coming out here all the way from the Bronx.
13537574	13538834	You're very welcome.
13538854	13540656	I hope you had a great time in San Francisco and all that, too.
13540676	13542737	I did, and I had a great time here tonight.
13542977	13544178	I'm sorry the traffic sucked.
13544458	13546040	And thank you once again for the coffee.
13546360	13546780	You're welcome.
13547060	13548181	My favorite thing in the world.
13548501	13549482	You squeed a little bit.
13549662	13550523	I did, in my pants.
13550563	13553645	I think it was... You had to go change your pants.
13553785	13554345	I did, I did.
13554445	13557227	Rob had special feelings in the pantal region.
13557808	13559249	Do you have a final thought tonight, Jay?
13560390	13560450	Um...
13563452	13564973	Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't.
13564993	13566433	You're going to have to come back to me on that one.
13567254	13570715	Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show to give that final thought later on.
13571015	13571876	So how do you like that?
13572616	13573336	I will return.
13573376	13573756	There you go.
13573856	13574277	There you go.
13574497	13575097	I'll be back.
13575477	13576237	I'll be back.
13576257	13576978	All right.
13577878	13581680	Misty, thank you for getting on a train all the way out here.
13581700	13583520	I hope you had fun in Saka Tomato.
13583781	13584641	What's your final thought tonight?
13585256	13594985	To confirm your theory, out of 50ml bottles of UV cake, 4 out of the 6 that I packed, plus the glass of wine, yes, I am drunk by my usual standards.
13595746	13596466	Woo!
13597407	13597868	Party!
13597908	13600290	Good times, good times.
13600830	13602071	Where to start?
13603232	13604393	Loki, your final thought tonight.
13605194	13612358	My final thought is next week's going to be interesting because apparently 12 a.m.
13612458	13621462	Eastern Time on July 1st which happens to be in the middle of our show is when the Jade Gate opens and you know I gotta play that.
13621822	13622583	Oh lord.
13623163	13623543	Alright.
