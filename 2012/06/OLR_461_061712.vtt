00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, June 17th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Have new details leaked out on the next Xbox?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Rumors intensify that Star Wars The Old Republic may go free to play

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
And did Nintendo withhold some big games from E3?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Or the Voice of Geeks Network

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
www.vognetwork.com

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Where we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
And that's okay too

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
To talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
People are confusing

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Why?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Just because

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Am I sending you mixed signals?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
No, I'm just wondering why I'm like actually in a somewhat good mood

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
And everybody else is pissy

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
You're not pissy

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
You've thrown off the balance

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, I'm not pissy

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I maybe wasn't as chipper in the opening as I usually am

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
But that's because I had the coffee an hour ago as opposed to five minutes ago

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I just finished my coffee, it was fantastic

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
It was delicious

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
But I've noticed at Whole Foods there's two types of people

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods, what are you doing here?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And then there's the, oh let me, go ahead of me

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Like the lady, I had like my salad, she's like, why don't you check out ahead of me? Go on

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You sure?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, go ahead

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I wish there was more people like that in the world

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Alright, say hello as well to tech master Loki

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hello

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Who is not at Whole Foods today

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
How you doing, Loki?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I tend to like to buy my food in, you know, the whole form

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Is that like a Costco endorsement? I'm not sure

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
No, I'm just saying that like, you know, I don't want half foods

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I see, alright, I get it, there's a joke there

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Alright, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
And checking the comments in our chat room, I'm not sure

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Let's see, I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts, I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
You know, I checked out that game this week

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
That game's messed up

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
It is, it really is

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's a disturbing little game

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
But it's a very different kind of game

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
But looks can be deceiving, it's more like a twin stick shooter

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
In Zelda's kind of box

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
I have wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
It may work, you can do like a, it tells you, it's weird

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
When you go into the options, it tells you, use joy to pad

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
To use whatever joystick

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I've just been using the keyboard

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
If someone says, don't know what it is? Google it

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Which I found funny

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I've just been using keyboard

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
But I was just, I thought it was very strange

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Which I might find treasure in

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
And I was like, this is

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
The hell is this?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
But I won't spoil it, I won't spoil it

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
This crazy mom

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Did you get any of the items?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Cause one of the first items you get is mom's underpants

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
And I was like

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I actually didn't get too far into it

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
This creeper right there

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Cause I had mass effect

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, well we are going to talk about our gaming weeks

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And all the games that we've been playing this week

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
At the top of the show here

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
For one, if you were listening to Bobby

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
When he gave us a call there at the end of the show

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
He said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And that's correct

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
You know next year, or next year, next week

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Is the ten year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
If you can believe it

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
We had our very first show

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Way back on the live 365 network

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
June 23rd of 2002

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And here we are, ten years later

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
For some reason, still doing this

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And no, I know why we still do this

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But it's interesting because a lot of shows

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
You know, I'm not

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Cause you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
And all that other stuff

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't make it

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Heck, two or three years even

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
It's a milestone to get to one year

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
What do you think has caused us to go for ten whole years

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Where other people don't make it?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
We've set the bar really low

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
That's true

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You know, we don't have a huge audience

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
And that's okay

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I mean, we were doing

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
That first show

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
You're doing better than twelve

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
The first show was for twelve people

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And for internet radio, that was huge

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
You know, we were really excited

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
To have twelve people who gave a shit enough to listen to us

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And that's the way it was for many years

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It wasn't really till a couple things happened

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
We got a couple Konami exclusives

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
With some of the DDR games

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Which helped bring a lot of eyes to our show

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
You know, a few years ago

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Before we went to the podcast format

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And then certainly

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Being a video game podcast that existed

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
When iTunes launched podcasting

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
We never will have a week that big again

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
That's for sure

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That was a huge week

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And, you know, now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
All over the iTunes market

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So it gets a little harder to stand out

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
If you're not, you know, IGN or 1UP

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Or one of the, you know, big deep pocketed producers out there

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
But, you know, I'm really happy with the following that we do have

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And it does seem like, you know, the folks that do show up

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And participate with our show every week

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Are really the reason for me that

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Kind of we keep doing this, you know

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Thanks to this show

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And it is a way for me to hang out with Darkstalker and Loki

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Who are, you know, they're okay

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Eh

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Jamie, what's-

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Were you talking?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Jamie, what's motivated you for the past ten years?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
She's thinking

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It was at my house

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
For a while

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
For a little bit

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
But not in the beginning

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Dan says he misses the show being at the house

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Does he?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
That's actually kind of a nice compliment

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Um

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
My ego

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Mhm

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Spite

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
You're not getting paid for it

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Me, me, me

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Bitch, please

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It's a hobby

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
It's something you do for fun, you know

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I do it for more than just for fun

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I do it for the people who are waiting to listen to us

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We do have an audience

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Mhm

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
You know, I'm

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Even if it's all of 50 people

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Right

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't care

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
It's more that download it

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Mhm

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
You know, clearly by the numbers

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Right

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And even if they can't make it into the chat room live

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Or catch the podcast later on, you know

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm doing it

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I mean, I enjoy it

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Except your ego

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, except my ego, of course

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Make my ego grow!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Um

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
But, no

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I just do it because I like attention

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I mean, because I like all of you

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That's why I kinda, I don't know

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
That's why, and I've talked a little bit about this

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And I don't want to be very direct

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
But I get a little uncomfortable

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
When I see people who have been doing a podcast

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
For like one or two years

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You know, or whatever, maybe three, I don't know

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Kinda stop doing it

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And then request a heck of a lot of money to do it again

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Mhm

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
It's like, what's your motivator?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
We have integrity

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
What's your motivator there?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
We have integrity

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
We really do

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Mhm

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You know, you ask, we deliver

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Mhm

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Unless you're being bitches

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
And then we'll, you know, tell you off

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Or Rob will have a hissy fit

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So, I don't know

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, it's certainly, let me tell you this

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
It's certainly not money that motivates us

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I'll tell you that much, that's for sure

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We've had some generous people

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And we've had good things fall into our laps

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Ronma, mostly, wasn't it?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I mean

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It was a variety of people

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah, I don't wanna give one person more credit than another

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But that was, that was a really great

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And I also

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Gesture

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You know that too

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, hi Shane

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I was a little slow in activating the check-in

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I have to put a button to do it

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Lazy

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But you can now check into the show

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Robleslacker

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
At live.vognetwork.com and get your points

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Sorry about that

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Slacker

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I just wanted you, I just wanted you to wait for it

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
He was busy playing that game on his iPad

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
The

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
The Pocket Planes

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Pocket Planes

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
PokePlane, PokePlane

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
We'll start with you

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I played Mass Effect

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And I played, um

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I started a new guild

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So anyone who plays World of Warcraft

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I made an all druid guild

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So you have to be a druid to be in it

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And, uh, it's called Druidia

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And if you don't get the joke

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Then I feel very, very sorry for you

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And probably a little old

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I was also, I was either gonna name it that

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Or Jewish Princesses

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Or Order of Vespa

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So, you should all get where that comes from

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And I played, like, a little Lotor

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
But, you know, I, I

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
This week has really been kind of exhausting for me

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And next week is gonna be exhausting as well

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I've had some design work

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Come onto my plate

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That I'm getting a little bit for

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I did a book cover

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So, um, I really haven't

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I've been playing more games than usual, though

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I've played some Fractal

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You know, I love freaking Fractal

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That game pisses me off and I love it for it

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It's like an abusive boyfriend

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So, I was right that you, uh

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Are gonna really like Mass Effect

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Even though you're on the first game

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Like you'll play through the series

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That was messed up

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
What you were telling me about that

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
But, like I was telling you in chat last night

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That's, you know, I'm still gonna play it

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Cause I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And you will, you, I mean, there's so many subplots

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
About the various characters

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
But not so much in one, I hate to say it

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But when you get to two, there's a lot

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm looking forward to Miranda

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Miranda's great, Miranda's hot

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, if not for my overwhelming just fandom of Garrus

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I would totally romance that bitch

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You can't as a fem chef

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Sucks!

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You can only lez out with Liara, I think

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Ashley, Ashley's a bitch

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And Liara's too skinny

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You can't be lesbian, lesbianic with Ashley

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I don't think, no, I'm pretty sure you can't

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You know what character I'm also looking forward to?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Jack

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Jack is awesome

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah, it's a great story

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
My friend Gary's sister

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Just saying

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But yeah, she was pretty cool

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Infinel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
That's true, and you know what, DarkSakura?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
By the time you get to three

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
There's gonna be that extra content

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That's the enriched ending

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Like pop-up video?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Exactly

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
See, this is what this meant

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
In case you didn't get it

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's all about Miranda's assets

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
She is a nice war asset

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It's round

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's round and plump

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And you just wanna reach in the screen and get squished

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
It's modeled after the voice actress

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You know who I love too?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Talk about genetic perfection

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Not that I'm into aliens

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm very secure in my homosexuality

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But if I were to get it on with a fam alien

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Samara's kinda hot

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Just sayin'

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Even though her children are apparently fucked up

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Aha! You haven't even played to yet

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
You know this

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
The Mass Effect wiki

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And it came up with whatever it is that they have

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And I know one of them's like addicted to

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, yeah

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And so I actually, out of curiosity

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
With the crazy chick

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And of course, dead

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So that was pretty funny

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And I also

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I've decided that if I play through it as a dude

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm totally going after Tali

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Cause she's just funny and cute

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Oh, there's so much I wanna say

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
But I can't, just keep playing, keep going

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Mass Effect lounge radio

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I can't believe I missed this series

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
For so many years

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It's so flippin' good

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Anyway

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
At any rate, I've been averaging like

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
A planet a play

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
If that makes sense, Rob

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So, like, I just

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, actually no, two plays

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Got me all the way through

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
The Citadel stuff

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And then, cause I had a better idea of what I was doing

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Cause I'd already played that

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And then instead of going to

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Naveria like I did the first time

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I actually went to

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Pick up Liara

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And then, now I'm heading back to Naveria

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Which, I should at least

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Be where I was

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Probably by the end of

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The night one night when I'm playing

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Cause I tend to, you know, play

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And chat with people at the same time

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I multitask, I multitask

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And Acidic Vampire asked me who my

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Favorite character is so far in the first game

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And, I mean, Shepard's actually

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Pretty, pretty badass

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I dig her

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I'm assuming you're playing Paragon, cause everybody plays Paragon the first time

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Actually, I'm playing neutral

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm holding it neutral

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And my Renegade actually points

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Are about even right now

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, between my, uh

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
My charm and Intimidate

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
If that makes sense

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So, but I'd have to say

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Of anyone other than

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Shepard, Garrus

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
He's just so

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
He can be a dick

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And you love him and he's like Thor, kind of

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Except, you know, not as the invalid

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Wearing his mother's drapes

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I think all boys that play Mass Effect

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Go on a bromance, Garrus, too

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That's it

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
He can be kind of a jerk

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
But he's a good jerk and you like him

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
He's just a nice, jerky

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
He's like your husband

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
He's like Dan, he's really like Dan

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And you just can't help but be charmed

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
By his degrees of arrogance

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
By the way, I do

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't mean to veer off

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Track too much, but we are

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Currently in the

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
VOG Network Clubhouse on Sony Home

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And if you want to log into PlayStation Home

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And search for VOG Network

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
VOG Network

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I don't know, what the hell is Spazinator wearing?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's like a chicken costume

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It is a turkey costume with the head of

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Sweet Tooth and I'm not sure

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
The glowing thing is

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
That is disturbing me

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm not looking at that anymore

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
There's also somebody with a sack boy and there's a mime

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, yeah, Blender's the mime, I get that

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I also really like Rex

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Rex is cuddly

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
He's just

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I like the gruff, sort of, you know

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Mercenary attitude, I mean, I've always

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Had a thing for that kind of character

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
While I'm at it, okay, Liara

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Is too talkative and she needs to

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Shut up sometimes, I mean, there's one

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Take things and run away with it

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Ashley's a bitch, I thought I would like her

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
But she's really just kind of a bitch hoe bag

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And, uh

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Kate, I hate to say it

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Caden is just too

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Mr. Generic Pretty Guy

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Get out of my house

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm sorry, you know what I mean

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
He's, he's, I mean

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Maybe he'll get better

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I haven't used him that much

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I really think that Tali is adorable

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
She's just so cute

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Alright, I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But going to some of the comments from our chat room

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
At vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Garris is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
When he does bad things

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Not as much as Liara

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Moving on, anything else for your

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Gaming week, DarkSakura?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I would not have Romanced Rex, I'm sorry

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
But that's too much like doing it

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
With, um

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I can't even say with

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Like, Jabba the Hutt

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Sorry

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Alright, Loki, how is your gaming? I know you're not a Mass Effect

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Addict, so you have something else going on

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, thank god

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
This is turning into like a soap opera

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Just talking about all the people that you would have sex with

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
In Mass Effect

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
So how many block people have you Romanced in Minecraft?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
There are no block people in Minecraft

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
There's just blocks

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And farm animals

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
How many farm animals have you Romanced?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
None, because I'm playing on peaceful

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So there's none

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You know, sneak up on you

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I tunneled from

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
My original track

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That went from the one station to the next

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
To my volcanic layer now

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And so I have that

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I love that you have an evil underground layer

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, it's above ground

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
It's the tallest mountain in the

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I thought it was in the volcano

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It is in a volcano

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Aren't a lot of evil layers in volcan- I swear that was in a James Bond movie

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I swear

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It was also in, uh, you know, Austin Powers

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
That's true

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I was, uh, hollowing out the volcano

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
To build more stuff

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Although I'm starting to kind of wonder what the hell

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I'm supposed to fill this volcano with

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Um, I tried making

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
A library

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But apparently if the library

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Or the bookshelves

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Are too close to lava

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Even though the lava could be, like, on several

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
You know, on the other side of a wall

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Several layers away

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It'll still catch those books on fire

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I need more, uh, more materials

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
To build in my library

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Come back and the whole library burned down

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm like, ah, dammit

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
But we are going to talk a little bit about some things

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That changed in Minecraft this week

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And one of them is the removal of the duping bug

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
How are you feeling about that, Loki?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I just haven't updated yet

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Never! I'll never update

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
No, I will update, it's just, it's a little annoying

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
This is how I built, like, a huge old

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Storage facility now that I'm slowly filling

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Duping stuff

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
They'll have creative mode in there

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, they're gonna have creative mode

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
But even technically that they patched out the duping

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
There are still ways for me to get stuff

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
That I want to have a save file editor

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That you can edit what you have in your inventory

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So I can still dupe that way if I wanted

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
But it's just a pain to, like, pull the save off

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And do this

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And I know they fixed the, um, you know

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The clay spawn rate and stuff

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So you can actually find clay now

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Instead of it being, like, diamond

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You know, like, searching for a diamond

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But even though diamond's a lot easier to find

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Than this right now

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And you have to start a new world

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
In order for all those update effects

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
To take effect in your world

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
So, like, if we respawn the vogseed

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Or whatever, it'd actually have different things in it

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And they're gonna do the same thing again with pistons

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
So, right now I'm just gonna stick with this world

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And I'm not gonna bother starting a new one

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Just to get more clay cause I don't really want clay

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And, um

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I think I'm gonna start over

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I need to do some work in Peaceful

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Like, that's what was slowing me down before

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Was that I was too, like, I could not get to stuff

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because of the stupid creepers

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And all that stuff

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
And I realize that's kinda part of the fun of the game

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But I would like to just do Peaceful

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And then, once I have my underground lair built

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I will turn on the monsters

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Make it the point to go out and destroy them all

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna do

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But right now, it's just kinda fun

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
If I could stop playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I would do that

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
For the record, the chatroom and I are talking about Mass Effect still

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Don't spoil it for Jamie

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
She's in the same position I was in about three months ago

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
She really doesn't know a whole lot about what's upcoming

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So, just saying that

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Be kind

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So, I played that stuff

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
What else did I do?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Um

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I played Call of Duty

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Modern Warfare 3 a little bit

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
A little bit of the System Link stuff

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Still, wish I had some more maps to play

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Because a lot of them are really big

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Whereas the first game, you know, Modern Warfare

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
That we could actually play on

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And it wasn't, you know, such a big deal

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
There was only, like, a couple that were too big

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And now it's like the reverse problem

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Um, so hopefully there will be

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Some more maps that we can check out

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Hopefully for free

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And then, um, I was gonna play

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Gravity Rush

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But I

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
What the fuck?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Home is interesting

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That's all I can really say

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It gets hard

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Get your minds out of the gutter

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It's a big piece of wood

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I'm not helping, am I?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
That says it gets hard

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
There's a lot of these double entendres

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
In Sony Home

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Dirty ass people who play Home

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Like me

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But yeah, I've been good this weekend

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I have not played any Minecraft this weekend

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
But, um, I did not play any Minecraft

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Today, or yesterday

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Uh, that's it

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Not a lot for me to report

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Still kinda consumes

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Sentinel, who's awesome

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Uh, I considered

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Buying Mass Effect 3 on PC

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Just so I could play with Alan

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
But now I'm not gonna be able to

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
We think it's the power supply

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Like, he was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Yesterday

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And finally there was just this loud

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It was during Undersedation Live and I was listening

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
There's just loud pfft

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Damn it, I forgot your game

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Come to my house next week

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We'll see

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Anyway, off-air discussion

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Where was I? Damn it, you threw me off

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh, Mass Effect

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So, Alan's computer broke

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I ended up having to buy a power supply

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
For Alan's computer, so

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
You know, maybe in the future

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
As Renegade on Xbox 360

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Other stuff

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I have been playing that's

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Non-Mass Effect

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I checked out a little more of Sony Playstation Home this week

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Thanks to the VOG Clubhouse

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
There's positives and negatives

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Positives is there's a whole lot more

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It seems like to do

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
In Home now

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
A lot more of these mini-games

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
That are pretty well rounded

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
You can just walk up to it and play it

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's called Cluster Puck

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Which is kind of a

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't know, it's like

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Tetris Attack meets

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I don't know

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
There's this weird mechanic where you move

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
You can actually move pieces

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And once you attach it to another piece

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It becomes part of the big block

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That you're moving, and then when they all fall down

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
If you have three in a row

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
They go away, it was weird

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
But I liked it, it was a pretty cool, kind of different little puzzle game

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And you unlock dumb little rewards for it

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I was checking out Sony's E3 booth

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I checked out some type of

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
What is it, Midway thing?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
But, they

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Won 99 cents for 50 tickets

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
To actually play the games

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And it's all a contest

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And I was like, I don't think I want to do that

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
My only real complaint about Home is that

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Some of it's really slow

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
A lot, like

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
You know, if it's your first time in Home

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You have to download everything

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
For a little while, and I like to think I have a fast connection

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That's really the only thing

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
That really bums me out though

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Is that Home is kind of

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
That you could launch

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Other games from

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And it was going to be literally Home

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Like, you wouldn't go into your crossbar

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You'd go into Home

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And kind of do everything from there

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's too slow, you could never do anything like that

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's like a computer

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
From the 1980's

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It takes two and a half minutes to boot

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Sometimes, you know, that's the only

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
When it loads, and when you have things

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Cached, if you've loaded all the areas

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Or whatever, it's pretty cool

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Once you get in there, once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And all that, it's pretty cool, but

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Moving seamlessly is a little rough still

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But I do like, they've really

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
If you haven't checked out Home since it first

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Launched three years ago

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
There's like a million more things in there now

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That's pretty cool, I like that

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Multiple theatres

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Dedicated to the Twilight trailer

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh, really?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
No, I'm just making shit up

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Is it a Sony movie? I don't know

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You better believe they do stuff like that in Home

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Oh, by the way, Rob

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Before I forget

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Actually, there's one more game that I'm playing

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I'm doing the

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Mass Effect 3

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's like a Facebook game, yeah

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, but I'm already

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Preparing for Mass Effect 3

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
You're committed

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I've also been playing an iOS game and it's

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
From the makers of Tiny Tower

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Where now you fly planes

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Right

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
No, Pocket Planes is not a ripoff of

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Dream Heights

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
But yes, you

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Go to airports, you buy planes

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And you ship people and cargo between them

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Exact same art as assets from Tiny Tower

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Although, obviously, they had to go in

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And draw planes and clouds

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But it's like the same style, the same universe

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I kind of like that they have the two

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Very different kind of games yet in the same universe

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I've heard from some people, though, they don't care

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
For Pocket Planes

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It's not as easy to get

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
As Tiny Tower was

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Pocket Planes is a little

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
The airport, you have to manage the planes

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
So you're not just managing a tower

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You're kind of having to juggle two things

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
There's a lot more places to sink money

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
As well, and there's Twitter

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Integration and all this

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The one reason why nimble bits games do so well, though

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Is that you really do get the full experience for free

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And it doesn't nag you ever

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
About buying things

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
But if you want to buy the little bucks that make things

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Go faster, sure, you can go get a handful

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Of those easy

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
For 99 cents or 5 bucks or whatever

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But the nice thing is

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
The game will give you bucks

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Slowly

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You'll start to get bucks, but

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
You have to be patient if you don't want to pay

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
To go all the way

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
We do have a whole little flight team

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Or was it flight squad?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
It's just VOG

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
If you put in as the tag

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And you can see how you're doing in the world events

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
With folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And whoever else on the network is playing

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
The Pocket Planes

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's it for my gaming week

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Let's move on

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'll quickly say housekeeping

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Slash OLR and follow us on Facebook

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
One more reminder

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
We are going to get a notice out there

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
But our 10 year anniversary special

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Is next week

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I do know we're going to have some guests

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
We don't hardly ever have guests anymore

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
In studio

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But I know we're going to have some next week

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
That are going to show up

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That part is of course inevitable

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
That there's going to be people who want to come out for the 10th anniversary

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
We have some people traveling a great distance to be here

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
So that's going to be very cool

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And some clips from the oldies episodes

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And so forth

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I really encourage you guys to be here live

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
For that

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Please participate with us

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
At vognetwork.com

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
We have some special piece of loot in it for you

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Can't say too much but maybe

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It will be on the podcast feed though

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
If you absolutely have another commitment

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Sunday nights of course it will be on the podcast feed

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
We would just love to see you live

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Cancel them

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Cancel them for us

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
After tonight's show

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
If you want to leave a message for the 10 year anniversary show

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
You can do that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And you can do that through Friday

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
We will put your information up on Twitter and Facebook

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
After the show

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But that will be open

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We encourage our fellow podcasters to call

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Our fans to call

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
My only suggestion because we are anticipating

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
There will be a handful

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Not to be all ego

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
A lot of people have been asking

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
We are anticipating a lot

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So try to keep your messages brief

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
If you ramble on for 5 minutes I can't play it

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
We're not going to have the time next week

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
But if you make it 30 seconds

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Again more details on Twitter and Facebook

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
After the show tonight

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Alright now we can get into some gaming news

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Loki start us off tonight please

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Ok so there's some more details regarding the Wii U

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Some of the programming stuff

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
First off they have infrastructure

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
In place to allow free to play games

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Which is kind of interesting when you think about it

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Because they've made many comments

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
In the past about how they

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Didn't like the fact that some of the games

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
On the iOS platform and stuff like that

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Were too cheap and devaluing everything else

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But apparently they said

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
We've designed a system

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
From a technical standpoint to allow developers

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
To freely take advantage of things like free to play

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And microtransactions

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So that's kind of nice

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
We'll see some of that stuff coming that way

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And of course they're saying

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Currently

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
They're not actively looking to

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Enter the free to play market

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
For their first party content

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
They are making it available

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
For anybody else that may want to

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Make a free to play game

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Nintendo's not going to do that

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And then of course

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
There's some

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
There was some

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Rumors that they may be getting away

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
From doing friend codes for

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
This new system and god I wish

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That were the case but apparently

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
They're not

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Friend codes are still going to be a part

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Of the online service

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
However they're going to change

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
They're not

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Saying exactly how

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Just saying that

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Friends codes

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
They're going to be there

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
But not the existing friend code system

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
You'll be able to identify people as friends

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And have a certain level of interaction

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Versus different level of interaction

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
For more general

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Population

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't know is that like

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
The Google groups or something like that

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You can do that with Google plus or something

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Who knows but still

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Kind of annoying that you have to do that

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
But whatever

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
And then of course they also said that the system

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Will allow achievements in games

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
However it's not mandatory

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So some games will have

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Achievements and some may not

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I just get this

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Feeling from reading some of the

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Stuff that it's like Nintendo's

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Putting a lot of this

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You know stuff that they have available for

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Other platforms right now

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Like achievements or trophies

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And some of this other

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Like you know different online places

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And they have this

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Available for third parties but

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Nintendo themselves aren't really

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Taking advantage of it it's like

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh yeah we're just going to

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Kind of do things the way we have been doing them

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And we're not really going to do

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
A lot of this online stuff

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Or you know have achievements

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And things like that I mean it'd be nice

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
If they did but I don't know

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Kind of doing all this new fancy stuff

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
They're just kind of be you know repeating what

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
They've done before

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We don't like to do what everybody

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Else does we're going to do our thing

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
If everyone jumped off the bridge would you?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Perhaps

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
How high is the bridge?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
What do you think though about that achievement part

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Not being mandatory I find that kind of interesting

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Because it seems like the makers

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I mean some might kind of make it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
In parity with whatever's on 360

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
And Steam and so forth but others

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
May just decide not to do it

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It kind of reminds me of Steam though because Steam has that kind of thing

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Where some games do have you know

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Achievements and some don't I don't think it's

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Necessarily a deal breaker it's kind of

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Disappointing that there's not going to be achievements

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Along there I mean

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It just for me it seems like

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Eh we don't really want to

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Do that so but I know

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You guys want to so we're going to go ahead and

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Allow you to do it but we're not going to do it

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I mean it just kind of seems like

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
They're just taking the easy way out

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
For a lot of this stuff I mean how hard

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Have they straight up said the Pikmin's not going to have them?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
They haven't said it yet but

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Pikmin doesn't have certain things that they

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
You know kind of hinted

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
That it would have and then of course

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Their reasoning for why it doesn't have said

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
You know feature is because

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It's too hard

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So you know

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I don't know

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
We'll get to that later but

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It's just it's stupid

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Do you think they could land some big free to play games?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
You know I don't know you're thinking of

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Steam and so forth like I don't know

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Well DC Universe is a Sony game so no

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
You know it's good that they have

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That infrastructure in place so they could

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Possibly do that and also it would be nice

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
To see if they have like more of like an MMO

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Type thing in place I'd imagine

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It's free to play with microtransactions

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I wouldn't see it being too

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Difficult for them to have microtransactions

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
For like you know subscription

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Models and stuff like that but

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's nice to have the options there

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
But at the same time I just kind of wish

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
There was a little bit of a parity between

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Everything that they're doing

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Uh BlackWolf

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
In our chatroom says certain Nintendo

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
But suck too

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Alright moving on

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
One of the other big things that came out of E3

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Was obviously Microsoft Smart Glass

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And this is the whole iPhone

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
iOS and Android

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And likely you know whatever Windows tablets

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Have is the whole

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
They're all gonna be able to run this Smart Glass app

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And a lot of people

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
When they saw that said

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Oh Wii U just got stolen

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And done better, Wii U's dead, Wii U's gone

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
So of course Nintendo

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Was asked to comment on this whole situation

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
How does Nintendo intend to differentiate

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Between what Microsoft's doing with

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Smart Glass and what Nintendo's doing

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And essentially according to Satoru Iwata

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Who was interviewed here

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
He said that

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Basically it boils down to the fact that

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
The controls on the tablet devices

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Often suck

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Quote

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
From what we have seen so far

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It looks to us as what they are able to offer

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Really is only a small facet

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Of what the Wii U is capable of

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
We know that the core users

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Who love playing video games like controllers

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That you hold with two hands

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
What you don't have on smartphones and tablets

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Are the buttons and the control sticks

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They prefer to use

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Now if they could hold a controller with two hands

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And hold a tablet or a smartphone with another hand

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
There would be no issue

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Unfortunately this is not possible for humans to do that

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
That sounds like a challenge

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You can't play a game in a way you can play

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
With the Wii U

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You can check that out

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
In that interview

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That's also officially full of shit

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Really?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Let's see here

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
What they are describing is basically saying

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Because the Wii U tablet has the buttons

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And stuff like that

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
You can play games

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Using that you can't play regularly

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
But at the same time

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Look at the games that they are showcasing

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That use that tablet and stuff

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
They have a game where you flick ninja stars

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
At the screen

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
That uses buttons because

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I don't see any buttons being used there on the touch screen

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Or some of the other games

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That use that as a secondary display

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
You know

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I don't necessarily have to hold the tablet

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
To have a secondary display

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I can sit it down on the coffee table

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Or something like that

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
They may not require you to necessarily have

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
To hold that

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
To play these games

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I just think that they are

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
They are not going to say

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Oh shit they are right

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
They are going to steal our thunder

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Well we should have thought better next time

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
They are not going to say anything like that

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Of course they are going to talk it down

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Now along similar lines here since we are talking about smart glass

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I think it is worth bringing up that the official

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Xbox Live app on iOS

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Was updated

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And yes there is a Microsoft

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Xbox app on iOS

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Officially by Microsoft

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
It was updated this week

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
With the smart glass features in it

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Now this feature only works on the phone for some reason

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And not on the iPad which I found a little strange

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But what you can do with it

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Once you update it you hit the little button

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
When your Xbox is on that says connect to Xbox

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And your iPhone essentially becomes a controller

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
For the Xbox

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It actually has a little A button in the middle

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
So you can kind of use it like a TV remote

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But you can also use it to launch a game

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
And then when you launch a game

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The little iPhone turns into a display

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That tells you about the game

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It is nothing really that great

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It is kind of a pain to set up

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Because you have to do it each and every time

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
So it is not like a big time saving thing

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
But it is certainly showing hints of what is to come

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
What they are trying to do with this whole second screen technology

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It is a little weird that it is not on the iPad yet

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But it is available definitely on the iPhone

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And that is up now

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
You can download that now

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
The other thing you can argue with Nintendo

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Is that I don't have to buy another system

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
To be able to have this technology

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Or whatever

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
It is going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
But at the same time, like I said last week

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I am just worried we are going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Not necessarily

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
First off, I literally think we are going to get DS stuff

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I think they are going to do Virtual Console with the DS

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I mean, duh

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It has got the same setup

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
So we are going to see that eventually

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But literally it is just going to be

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Using

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
The second screen for just crap that you would have

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Like in a start menu or something

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Because there was a lot of

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Games on the DS

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It just didn't really need that second screen

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
But it was there

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
So they used it for like

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Here is a map

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Here is some neat touch screen things you can do

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Some things were really cool though

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Like Elite Beat Agents

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But I don't see that really working on the Wii U

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It is kind of like everything is there on the touch screen

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
So it is like, why would I look up

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And look at my TV ever

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
There is really not a lot to do

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
So I am curious

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
To see further developments

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Of what is actually coming out for Wii U

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And unfortunately E3

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Kind of didn't show enough

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But we will have more on that a little later

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
In the meantime DarkSakura

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Let's switch on to the

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Xbox thing

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Not under the name of the lube

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Unfortunately

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Because that would have been awesome

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
There is a document leak

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
About an X

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I should just say for the new listeners of OLR

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
We kind of missed that

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
We had a naming contest

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
In our popular list list segment a couple months ago

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
We decided the official name

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Of the next Xbox here on OLR

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Is the Xbox lube

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So if you are wondering where the hell did that come from

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
We are done

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Well at any rate

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
There was a 56 page document

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
That was leaked

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
For what was listed as the Xbox 720

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Which I am pretty sure

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
That is not going to be the final name

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
It looks kind of like a squishy dreamcast

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So I think that is funny

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
But it was talking about

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Having new things like a metro dashboard

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Xbox TV apps

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Smart glass of course

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And then

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
It was really

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Do you remember Rob that E3

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
When they announced the 360

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
And all the stuff they wanted it to do

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And how they wanted it to be a big hub

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
It looks like they are still trying

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
To keep that hub

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Thing going on with the new one

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But it is also supposed to have

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Blu ray support

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Native 3D output

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
And glasses

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Concurrent apps

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Peripheral support

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Sensors

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Additional sensors sorry

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
It says something about a connect 2

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And that they are debating whether or not to use

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
6 or 8

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
ARM or the

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
They are just

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Really pretty much debating processors

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Debating memory

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Debating the cores

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
But they are basically trying to make

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It be the be all end all

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Of anything that you should have

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
In your living room

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
They are putting a price point on it

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Of $299 with a projected

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
10 year life cycle

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And they think that they will sell more than 100 million

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Units and it is supposed to be out in 2013

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The one thing on here

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That I think is kind of neat

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Is what they are calling project

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Fortaleza I guess

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
The connect glasses

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Where basically it is kind of like a VR

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Thing

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
You can actually see all those lasers that the connect

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Is actually firing out

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
If you saw some of those early videos

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
What was it, infrared?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
If you actually look at the connect in infrared

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
It is like oh my god my room is full of lasers

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Well the thing that I think is kind of cool

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
About this

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Is that

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It is like an in person interactivity kind of thing

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Which I don't know if you have to have

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
A decent living room

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Or if it is adjustable or whatever the crap

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
But

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
It makes me think of a kind of

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Augmented reality kind of thing

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Which honestly I think is fully possible

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I don't know if you saw

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
For anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Which is

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I will post it later

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
On my Tumblr I posted a link about

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
These new

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
That are

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Full on display that basically

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Will

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Project an image directly to the retina

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
They are using it as enhancing

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Poor eyesight and

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Portable television that you can watch

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
With your eyes closed pretty much

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I am thinking that if they have gone that far

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
That this is simple

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
This would be simple technology in comparison

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Also

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The document that was leaked

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Was removed

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So even if they are saying

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh no that is not true

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It was removed at the request of

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Covington and Burlington LLP

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The international law firm

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
That Microsoft has hired

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Hmm

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
The plot thickens

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh and by the way

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Loki I know you have been

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Following this new story as well

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Do you think it is fanboy wank

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Or do you think it is the real deal

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Well I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So there is something in it

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Basically it is two years old

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
The document is not exactly

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Brand new but a lot of stuff

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
It is interesting

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I do not know

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
How much

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
It is all speculation

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
They are just kind of talking about

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
And thinking about something that is not necessarily

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Their step by step plan

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I did think it is interesting

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
How they are talking about acquiring

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
On live and that one of the things

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
That they are going to incorporate

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Later on like in 2015 or something

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
After the console would launch

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Would be that you would never

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Need another console again

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Any time that you would need to

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Upgrade to games and the platform

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Can't handle it, it is just streamed

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I do not know if that is necessarily

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Going to work

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
But a better Kinect is something

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
That we would expect

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
More processing power

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
The glass thing looks weird

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
It is kind of like that project glass

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That Google did

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
And it does not mean it is going to happen

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I think that is important to say too

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Just because they are talking about this two years ago

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Does not mean it is actually going to happen

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I mean look at something like the Wii Vitality sensor

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
That even came out on the E3 stage

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And suddenly disappeared

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
It does not mean the glasses thing will happen

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
This seems to me to be more of an R&D

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Type of document

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Well, I personally

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I am sorry, I will let you finish

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
But personally I think it is a real document

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I do and I think the fact that the lawyers

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Took it down, it is what they call

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
What is it, Streisand syndrome

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I think it is called that

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
The Streisand effect or something

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
And yes that is as in Barbara Streisand

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Because one time

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
She tried to sue a company

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Or her lawyers sued a company that published

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
A picture of her house

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Like four people in the world saw

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
The picture of that house

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Two of them being the lawyers until she sued the company

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Then millions of people saw the picture

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Of her house

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
So I think there is a little bit of that going on here

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Because the Microsoft lawyers by taking down the document

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Have somewhat proven

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
That there is legitimacy to it

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because Microsoft could have come out and said

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Oh that thing is a bunch of crap

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
And maybe it was not crap

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
But nobody would have been any wiser

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
No, if they just said

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh it is crap and then

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
However

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I do not think it is a deep within

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Microsoft document

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It did not look professional enough

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
To be something that was done deep within Microsoft

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I think this thing leaked out of some type

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Of affiliate arrangement

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I think a third party company put this thing together

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I do not think it is

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Directly Microsoft

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Necessarily

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Where there is smoke there is fire

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And I think there is definitely some hot stuff in this document

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Or perhaps

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It was

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
A quote leak

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
If you know what I mean

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Basically get it out there long enough for the

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
News centers to catch up on it

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Yank it

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Make it look official

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I also think that

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
If it was like a hype generating

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Stunt or something

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I just do not really think it would generate

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It is not really generating hype

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Because it is just all very speculative

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Especially if Microsoft is supposed to be announcing a new

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Tablet on Monday as all the rumors say

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Doing something like that between

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
E3 and a new tablet is kind of

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Dumb

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I do not know

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
There is too much coincidence in here

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
For this to not be real

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I think the depth of that document

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Would have been a lot to whip up

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
On the internet if that is the case

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Again

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I think there is some legitimacy to this

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But I do not think everything in here should be accepted

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
As fact because

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
A. The age

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
B. Ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That is

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Basically what it boils down to

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That is what good brainstorming is regardless

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
True

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You throw out the idea you see if it is possible

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
If the whole thing is

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Some dumb underground

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Marketing ploy

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Viral thing

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Microsoft is trying to get feedback on the glasses thing

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
But I just think this is a dumb way to do it

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
If that is the case

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
If you put out anything the internet will respond to it

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
It is a guarantee

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
And if it is something big like Microsoft

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Anything attached to Microsoft

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
The internet is definitely going to give some feedback

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
But let me just put it this way

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
If they are going to come to the table with something like that

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
You know in like two years time

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That is not good for Nintendo

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Because Nintendo does not

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
They are not bringing a whole lot to the table right now

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
They are bringing like

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Hey look we can use the tablet with our system

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And it is basically a Wii that does HD

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
That is not

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
This opens up a lot of possibilities

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Of how you can make games and other applications

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And stuff but

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I do not know we will see

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Especially since they are talking about these glasses

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Or whatever not launching with the system

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I do not know

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
All we need to see either way

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Not a whole lot of comments on this story

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
A lot of people still commenting about DS

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And tech specifications and all this stuff

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
But Tiger Claw says

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Smart glass how about dumb glass

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I do not know

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
There are things I like and things I do not like

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
About this whole smart glass idea

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I do not think it is as revolutionary as they make it sound

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I mean whoopty shit

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You can have some information

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Some of the movies do this

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Like the Tron Blu-ray

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And there are other Blu-rays where you can do a very similar thing

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It is cool

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
It is like the director's commentary track

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Very few people go that extra mile to use it

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Let's be real

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Some of you do

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Especially for movies that you love

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
That is a given but very few people do it

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
And it is not necessarily that this is something

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
That is not possible right now

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Before this update

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Because EA games have been doing this

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
With Mass Effect and stuff

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
They will have stuff that ties in with that

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Hell you can even do with Call of Duty Elite

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
You can get the app for that on your Android

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
IOS devices

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And you can tweak shit on there

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Before you play the game

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
So they have this kind of stuff available already

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And it is not that like

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That does not sell a game tip for me

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I mean if you know

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I am not going to go oh I have to get Madden now

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I mean it does not seem like it is something

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
That is really going to sell me on games

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I love this DC Nate in our chat room says

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
An alternate screen for your console

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Dreamcast sheds another tear

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It was just

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
It further proves that thing was just ahead of its time

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Well and

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Nintendo kind of already

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Had that going on with that

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Connection to the

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Crystal Chronicles

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
We will just call it the Crystal Chronicles

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
That and Four Swords were the only games that really used it

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Pac-Man

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Five games used it and then it disappeared

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Yeah

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
So

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Like their LAN adapter

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
One game used it and then it disappeared

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
And then a bunch of people hacked it

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
So Mario Kart could use the warp pipe

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Or whatever it was

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Well that was over the internet stuff

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I am talking about using the actual

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
LAN adapter

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Maybe online but as far as LANs

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Oh yeah you are right

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Alright let's move on

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
So we can get to the classic game of the week

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And release dates and all that good stuff

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
But first some more news stories Loki

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Alright so

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
There is some hoo-ha

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I guess about UDraw

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And basically

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
A Georgia law firm is investigating

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
THQ to see

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
If they misled their investors

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
About the demand

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
For the UDraw tablet

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Honestly I thought it was a really cool idea

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
So I could see where they

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Think that the demand would be really high

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
And then it wasn't

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
And also I wonder if a lot of that

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
That I think at one time

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Nintendo was going to make a few

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Games or whatever that would support it

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And hell

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Let's just get on the topic of the Wii U here

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Why wasn't Mario Paint one of the

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Launch titles for this system

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I mean

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
That seems like a perfect title for the Wii U

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Just saying

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
But yeah

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
They're still checking them out

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And making sure that there wasn't

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Any false and misleading statements

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
About its progress

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I want to say that this is

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Not the first franchise

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
That they were kind of

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Supposedly misleading

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
People on

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I want to see maybe UFC or something

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I don't know

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Interesting

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I know those UDraw tablets

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Are one of them sitting around

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
And they're going for dirt cheap

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Mmm

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
THQ's been in a company that's had some

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Rough times lately too

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
This is a fascinating story to me

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
What is like

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I mean could it be that they just said

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Okay

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I understand that they are saying the demand is high

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
What if they believe the demand

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
They literally believe that the demand

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Is going to be high for it and it just flops

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Is that misleading your investors

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
With how much the demand is but what if

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It's just like no one gave a shit

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
No shits were given that day

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Would it be fair to say that

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
38 studios misled

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
The state of Rhode Island

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Well that's a whole different story

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It isn't it isn't

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Well I don't believe

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Kingdoms of Amalur had a

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
You know a peripheral that was tied to

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Only you know certain games

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Well it was that MMO never coming

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Out too that really didn't do well

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I mean I always have a problem

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
When you have a device that requires

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
A special peripheral

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Because now you're locked in the buying games

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
That require that peripheral and if it's not something

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
That's widely used by a bunch of different companies

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Because it was only THQ that was putting out

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Stuff for it I mean they had licenses for

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Spongebob and Disney princess stuff

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And all that but no one

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Really cares about that and they tried

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Some funky stuff like with

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Actually the Spongebob game they tried making

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
A kind of wire-wire type game

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And it was dumb

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
So I could see why it just

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Didn't sell very well and then they tried putting it

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
On other platforms and just

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
It bombed kind of like the Tony Hawk

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Skateboard idea

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I mean it was terrible

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room theorizes perhaps Mario Paint is coming later

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It might just be one of their apps

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
I don't know I kind of think Nintendo

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Is over Mario Paint

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
It still should

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Pictochat

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Was Mario Paint

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Ooh do you think there's going to be something like Pictochat on the Wii U

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Or like over the internet?

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Oh is there oh

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I guess I haven't been paying attention

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
You can leave messages and forms and stuff and you can also draw pictures

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
And stuff

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
That's kind of cool so if I want to just send Dark Sakura a big penis

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I can do that

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Well no there's moderation remember

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Oh my gosh what if I don't want to post it publicly

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
What if I just want to send her a private penis

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Oh well

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I don't know how

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Private peni are the best

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I don't know how deep the moderation goes

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Are they that deep

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
So I mean

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
How long before penises are being sent

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
All over the Wii U network privately

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Instantly

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
There's no doubt about it I'm just saying that

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Check out what I do with my Wii U

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
You're listening to Orange Penis Radio

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Someone will see that penis

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
And it will be the moderator

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
The moderator will come home after the first day

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Like I've seen so much penis today

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I feel like I'm working in the porn industry

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Oh Lord dry up

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
This river of penis

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I knew you would get that one

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Well you know what's funny

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Is that

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I don't remember if we talked about this on the show

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
After the fact so I apologize if I'm not

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Crediting the right person with this

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
But somebody was theorizing I think maybe it was on Facebook

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
That Nintendo's probably

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Gonna hire an outsource company to do

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
All this moderation

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
So you're gonna have

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
This huge

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Call center-esque thing filled with people

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
In either the Philippines or India

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
These poor people are gonna see

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Penises all day long

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It won't be done in Redmond

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I think that's a damn

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Fine theory that it's probably gonna be outsourced

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I think I see that's my

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Problem with this system is I think if

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
You know I'm an adult

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I believe that I should be allowed

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
To you know post like

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You know if I have my friends that I'm playing

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Super Mario Brothers U with or whatever

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
And

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Like Rob keeps dying at this one spot

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And goes oh this is so hard

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
And I can tell him quit whining you

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Fucking pansy you know and

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Should be able to have that little thing pop up

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Over world 3-1 or something like that

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Why should that all be censored?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
You're censoring my fun

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
No one wants to censor my fun

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
And all of a sudden

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
You have a message

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Oh open up the message penis

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Oh my god

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Or tits I mean come on

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Alright

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I'm going to lie

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
They should totally have it in New Super Mario Brothers U

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Where you can draw on the background

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Of the levels you should be able to just stop

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And sketch something on the levels

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Uh alpha

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Kananagram in chat says sky mario paint on the

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
DS was Wario do it yourself

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I forgot about that

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
That was Nintendo we don't want to fucking

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Make a game you make it yourself

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Uh let's see

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
The chat room is wondering

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Where pen15 is tonight

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
This would be a perfect conversation for him

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
But sadly not here alright

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Anyhow anything else you want to say about

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Penis or I'm sorry this news story

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
That's it

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Uh apparently

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Didn't show their big game at E3

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
After all destiny wasn't shown

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
On the Xbox so maybe

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Something was held back a little bit

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And this is because of a tweet

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
That game trailers editor in chief

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Shane Satterfield said

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Uh apparently

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
He said before E3

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
That the Wii U launch lineup

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Was looking pretty damn good

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Well if that's the case then he's probably the only one

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
That was thinking that

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
But it came out later he went on Twitter

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
And said quote

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Just realized that a Wii U game

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I knew about well before E3

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Was never announced at the show

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm guessing there's others

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
To come as well

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Oh really? Yeah

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Well sure why not

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Because this

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Got me into a topic on Twitter

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Earlier this week that revealed

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
To me what I believe is the actual

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Launch day for the Wii U

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Which would be November 18th

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I have to check my date

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It's a Sunday of course

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Of course that way you can camp out Saturday right

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sundays

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
And I don't know why they're just obsessed with fucking Sundays

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
So yes November 18th

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Now remember before I said

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Well the 13th

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Is gonna be out the 13th or before

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Because there was a game that was dated for the 13th

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Well there's other games dated for the 20th

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Makes sense

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You know just like the Vita launch

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
There was stuff that was out the week before

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Could it just be a really good guest placeholder

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Because honestly if I were to make an educated guess

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Hmm the weekend before Thanksgiving

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah it's kind of in line with the way

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
They usually do it

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Oh okay

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And the game in question would be from Disney

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
And it's

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Der their big game

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Which would be

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Epic Mickey 2

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Which has not been announced yet

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
For the Wii U and I don't know when it will be announced

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
But it's coming

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
That they didn't talk about

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
At all

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
What up G in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Says rumor has it Nintendo is gonna show

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Metro's game which of course

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
You know still is nowhere to be seen

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Maybe it's the F-Zero game

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Dream dream dream fanboy wank wank wank

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It would be cool

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I mean

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I don't know but yeah I mean so

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
There that's you know

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
One and I know that

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
There was one I saw for

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Transformers the new Transformers Prime

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
You know people don't really care about that

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
But I mean Epic Mickey 2 that's a pretty big fucking

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Title not to mention

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
At all I mean unless

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
They're worried that it's not gonna be at launch but

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I have things

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That say otherwise

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Alright well right alongside

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That a story came out that

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Third party games are yet to be

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Announced and that's a quote from

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
David Yarnton who's the head of Nintendo's

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
UK division

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Apparently this was in Nintendo gamer

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Magazine it said quote

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I think a lot of third party companies are

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Developing for Wii U and a lot of it hasn't

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Been announced but we can't comment on

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Speculation there are lots of things

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Everybody wishes for

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Call of Duty is another one that's

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Confirmed but

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
They haven't announced it yet

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
But then again they also haven't

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Announced it for the Wii yet either so

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So that comes usually later

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
What does this mean Nintendo's waiting for their

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Tokyo game show concurrent event because they

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Don't do Tokyo game show but they usually do a big

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Event they may be announcing more

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Stuff there I think it's just a way that

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
These companies are they announce

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That far out ahead

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
You know ahead sometimes like Call of Duty

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Every year it seems to be it's always

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Gonna be Playstation 3

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Xbox 360 PC announced

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And then later on like last year it was

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
At their live

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Call of Duty event in LA that they

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Announced the Wii version

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And then also DS and there was

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The you know the elite

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Stuff and the

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know special editions

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And something none of that stuff's been announced yet

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Oh but that's I mean

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Just reality check the system's out in

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Five months you know assuming it's out in November

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Which is obviously a safe bet that's five

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Months from now it's not

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
A whole lot of time to finish up the games

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
If you don't already know you're doing it

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's interesting I mean

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Maybe there'll be something closer

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
To the end of summer when is Tokyo game show though

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
October? Seattle?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Oh it's September? Usually

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Maybe two months is enough lead time but one month

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Definitely isn't

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But a lot of these games like I mean I don't see them

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Game show because that's not really a title

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Skew towards the Japanese market

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
WhatupG in our chat room says

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
EA says they will announce a couple of games

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
At Gamescom for Wii U

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
FIFA probably

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I don't know about NBA Live

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
But FIFA I think is for sure

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Which Gamescom would be the place to announce

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
That too

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah I think they've already said FIFA was gonna be on the Wii U

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Madden is on the Wii U

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I believe I think that's already been announced

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
AkumaJP is in our chat he lives in Japan

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And has gone to Tokyo game show and confirms

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It's September my bad I thought it was October

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
For some reason

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Still

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I mean I don't know I could

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah I definitely agree this stuff

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Lots of it hasn't been announced yet

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I mean

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
For sure there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
But I don't know

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Everything

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's not been announced

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I just know I know that one

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And I know that it has a firm date on it

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And the week after so

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It seems to fit

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And like I said

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
They're delaying the game

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I don't know if that's even made it out yet

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The game is not coming out in September anymore

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
All the other platforms

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's been confirmed I know for Europe

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But they have not announced North America yet

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But that is also going to be delayed

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Europe is coming out on the 20th

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So if you think about it

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The console is probably not going to launch

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I mean it's going to launch at the same time roughly

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
In all regions but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Like they did with the Wii

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Wii launched on that Sunday

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I believe if I remember correctly

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah it did

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I remember we went out really late at night

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And you know remember we were going out and Breslow was here

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And everything and the lesbians

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We all went out

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Well I think it was just me and Kristin

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
We were at the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yeah Extifer was at Target with you guys wasn't he?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah Extifer

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
For a little bit

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
No Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Not at that Target we were at the

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Oh you guys went somewhere else

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yeah so was Extifer

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I don't remember him being there with us

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Because we were just sitting there exchanging fan fiction

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I had a Wii the day it came out because Extifer camped out for it

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
He was at that Target

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It was a long time ago

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I really don't remember seeing him then

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It was a long time ago

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Because we would have been hanging out with him

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Yeah because remember we went to WinCo I believe

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And got orange soda

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
No all we did was go to Krispy Kreme

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And get donuts and coffee

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah I remember hearing about that

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I only stayed out until about 2 am and then I was like fuck it I'm going home

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I'm not staying up for that

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Alright one more story for you guys then we're going to travel around the world

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And look at release dates but first Dark Sakura has a story for us

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I do don't I

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Well how about

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Well a game that we've brought up on the show before

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Draw something

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Over it

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I like it

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
At any rate it's kind of funny that

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Just as soon as Zynga purchased

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
OMG Pop

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
People stopped playing it

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
They dropped something like

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Ten

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
They did

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
They lost ten million

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Monthly active users

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
In thirty days

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But anyway they might be

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Doing a TV show with CBS

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's kind of along the lines

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Of what Win Loser Draw was

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Well they have that host with the awesome

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Hair what was his name Burt something

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Not Burt Reynolds but Burt something else

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I don't remember

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Oh man

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
But

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But the

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
In the mean time

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
While that's still in the talks

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
They're thinking about bringing it out in more

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Languages including Chinese

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Well I mean if they have a successful

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
TV show based off of it it would certainly

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Justify some of that extremely

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
High price

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I've decided that Draw something

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Would be much easier if I had an iPad

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Oh hey this says

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
A complete episode of Win, Lose

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Or Draw available here

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Complete with commercials

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I love stuff like this on YouTube

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's amazing

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's a coke commercial

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Let me fast forward

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
There we go there's one Loser Draw

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Burt Convy

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Yeah and they all sit on the floor

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
To play

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
This show is awesome

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Dude that's Alan Thicke

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
What ever happened to Lani Anderson?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Let's find out

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Look I could do this all night but we better not

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Oh it says right here in the description

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds and Alan Thicke

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I hope they have awesome

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
B list celebrities on

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Draw something TV

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That would be the only reason to watch

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Oh my god

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
She just is still kinda

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Plasticy looking

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Well Lani Anderson's gotta be like 65 at least

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
She was born in 45 so yeah

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I wonder if they'll have people

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Drawing really elaborate pictures

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Something simple

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Like Darth Vader holding a cup

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And it's a cup

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Acidic Vampire

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
She's on her fourth marriage

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Acidic Vampire in our chat room says bring back old game shows

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Supermarket Suite please

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Hell yes

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
The last movie she was in was

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
A Night at the Roxbury

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Well you know what they need to do

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So here's the trick

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
If you want to bring Supermarket Suite back

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
You've gotta write a new app

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
For iOS that mimics the old game show

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And throwing hams into a cart

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And brewing the coffee

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
For a bonus $200

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That were the bonus prizes

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Out of your iOS game

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The last two shows she was on was one called

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The Mullets

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And then So Notorious

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Oh god that was the Tory

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Spelling show

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Actually that show was really good

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Don't judge me

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Do not judge me you're judging me

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I am judging you

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You just said

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I of judgment almost

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I said I am judging you

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Release dates let's travel around the world

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That statement doesn't require

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Extra garbage

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
To play a card game

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So coming out

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Actually tomorrow

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Pokemon Conquest

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
On the DS it crosses

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Nobunaga's Ambition

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And Pokemon

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Because that really needed to be crossed

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Some people

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Are looking forward to it

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Disney Pixar's Brave

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The video game on Playstation 3, Xbox

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
360, Wii and DS

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
On Playstation 3, Xbox

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
360, Wii, 3DS

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
DS, Vita and PC

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Steel Battalion Heavy Armor

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Game that's gonna really suck

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Using the Kinect

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So that is also coming out

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Oh and I re-released the Quake 4

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Because now Bethesda is releasing it

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Of course, of course

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
We better not have another power outage before

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Part A finishes here

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I'd rather have the power outage today than next week

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yeah right? Don't jinx it

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I'm not jinxing it

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I don't know what we're- next week we're gonna need to have like a

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Moratorium on power in this place

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Because I don't want to blow a fuse

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Anyhow, going to Japan

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And looking at release dates over

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
There, we have on the Nintendo 3DS

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Hello Kitty

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Tohsekai Ryoku

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Irona Kunii Dorekake

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Shimasho

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
From Compile, who I am pissed

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Compile is around and instead of

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Hello Kitty games

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Yeah, get with it Compile

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You know what your people want

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Wouldn't it be hilarious? Rare

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Announces, or was it, not rare

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Retro Studios, Retro Studios announces

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Guardian Legend Cross

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
F-Zero, the racing action

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Shooter game I would jizz

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm not even gonna hold back

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It's what would happen

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Let's see

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Solid collection coming out next week in Japan

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
That's not this week, sorry to say

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
How about the Playstation 3?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
There's some stuff from Sega this week

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
K-ON! Hokkago Live

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
HD version

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Mass Effect 2 gets a best hits

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Version, and I think that's the version that comes with

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
All the DLC, I wonder if that's localized

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
With voice acting for Japan, that's pretty cool

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I'd like to play a copy

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Of that, just, you know, cause it's fun and different

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Comes out as well, and

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Shutsugeki

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Otometachi

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
No Senju 2 comes out

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
From SystemSoft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
We have over here, I don't think it is

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
That's not something I recognize

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Lol, no

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I was looking to see if

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Japanese, I wonder if it's

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I wanna see some dialogue

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Oh, maybe not

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Hey, this is kinda cool, actually

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Something SSJ100Matt said in chat

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
What's that?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Days on Sundays, apparently back

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
In the Super Nest days, they would release games

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
During the week in Japan, when games

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Were released during the week, people would skip work

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
In school to buy and play games

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Apparently the Japanese government requested Nintendo

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Change their release dates to the weekend

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
So there's no lost productivity

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Interesting

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I learned something

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
From the VOG Network chat room tonight, good job

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Alright

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And knowing is half the battle

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Exactly, alright, that's it for Japanese

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Release dates, let's move on to the UK

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Well, for the UK

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Not a whole bunch, it's a really short

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
List

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
On the 20th, Magic the Gathering

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Duel of the Planewalkers

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
2013

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
On the 21st, Mutant Mudds on 3DS

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And, let's see

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
On the 22nd, Civ V

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Gods and Kings

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And Steel Battalion, Heavy

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Armor, and that's it until the 25th

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So, nope

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Nothing

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Well, I mean, nothing

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I guess, really good unless you're a big Civ fan

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I guess that would apply to you, Rob

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But you're not in the UK

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
So

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
How about... Well, the good news is

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's out here, and

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It's out next week, or I think came out this week

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I need to check

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I gotta plan an epic Civ V night

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
With some friends, but, like, literally

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's an all-day, all-night event, so

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It'll be sometime in July

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So how about moving on to another story?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Alright, we can do that

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I'm out of stuff for the UK

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
That's really it

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Let's talk about Star Wars, and how

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Something that they announced during E3

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That Star Wars, the older public

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Is gonna be free to

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Well, not really free to play, but you can play for free

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Up to level 15

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And, you know

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
People are wondering, are they actually just

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Testing the market with this?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And, apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
They're saying that, you know, because

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Before they lost

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
You know, 400,000 subscribers

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And it's probably gonna get worse

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Once the new World of Warcraft

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Expansion comes out

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
But, you know, they're saying, you know

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
If it was just free to play games

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And they weren't very good

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It wouldn't even be a question, but

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
There are definitely good games out there

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And good games coming out, so, of course

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
All of this competition impacts your plan

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And with what you wanna do

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
So

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's interesting

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The other interesting thing is this article got pulled

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
As well

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Maybe they are gonna go all the way

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And make it free to play, especially if it's just not

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Panning out like they were hoping

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
If that's the case, it's kinda sad and unfortunate

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Because the game hasn't exactly

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Been out that long, and that's a really quick turnaround

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But, I mean, we've heard the fact

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
That servers are

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Losing people bad

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And they're already talking about server merges

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But when that game

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Excuse me

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
When that game came out, obviously it was huge

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And everybody wanted to check it out

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
But it had a real problem with retaining people

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And I think a lot of that

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
It hasn't been that long either, I mean, like, five months

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Five and a half months

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm assuming part of that is the weekend game

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
But I do know some people that are into the end game and enjoying it

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It seems like the launch of Star Wars

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Was better than the original

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
World of Warcraft launch, but then again

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
What you could get away with seven years ago

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
In this day and age when there's tons of MMOs to choose from

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Well, and also I think from what I've been hearing

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
A lot of the complaints with the Old Republic

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Was that it did a lot of the

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Same things that World of Warcraft does

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
You kinda have to make your game

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
A little different. Yes, I understand it works

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
For World of Warcraft, but if you just fucking copy them

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It's... put it this way

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Chinese knockoffs

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Have never as good as the real thing

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
If copying something made it just as good

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
As the original, then

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Why would be

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Having a whole bunch of, you know, counterfeit stuff

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Star Wars wasn't

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
To me, I mean certainly there were some things inspired

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
By WoW, but there was a lot

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
That kinda tied into the other Star Wars

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
There was a lot

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It was a good single player game

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
That's for sure, and I think that's what happened

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
A lot of people played to 50 and then that was kinda it

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
You know, I think

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That ended up being part of the problem

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
They invested so much in the single player

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
In all the voice acting and everything

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I kinda think that might have been one of the big mistakes

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
In the voice acting, I mean yes

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It really adds a great deep element

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And immersion into the game, but I think that was

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
A resource that could have been better spent somewhere else

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
More servers

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Well, not even that, they didn't need more servers

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
They had a problem at launch, I thought

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
They fixed it really quick

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It was no worse than what happened in WoW when it started

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I think Star Trek Online handled that type of thing better

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Because they really only had

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Two celebrities for voice acting

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They had Leonard Nimoy doing narration

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
For each of the new areas

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And they had

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
What's-his-face

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Zachary Quinto

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Yes, as the

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
EMH, the Emergency Medical Hologram

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
For the first mission

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You don't have people

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Saying, hey, give me money

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Or anything

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It has very limited voice acting

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Yeah, but

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
They've managed to get dedicated voice actors

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
For their main people

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
True

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I have to say, even What's-his-face

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Metzen does half of everybody

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Including Thrall

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I think their best voice actor

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Is the lady that does Sylvanas

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Because, oh my god, that just chills

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
But anyway

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
They put the money into

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Making sure, there's one dedicated

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Server that can handle everybody

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
That's on it, you've got your beta test server

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And as far as the voices go

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
They didn't license any music

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It's really kind of limited

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But you don't care once you're playing it

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Because the game itself is in depth

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And I think that's where you're getting

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Into the difference

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And it has to do with Ubisoft

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Or as a lot of people have been calling him since last week

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Boobysoft

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Is apparently talking to Warner Brothers and Paramount

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
For a movie dealing with

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Splinter Cell

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
This is according to a report from

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Deadline, Ubisoft is in talks with

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Warner Brothers and Paramount over a

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Film tie-in

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It could also follow a new

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Kind of story set in the same universe

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
However, it is worth pointing out

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
There have also been, in the past, deals on

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Uncharted and Bioshock

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Nothing's happened yet

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, just because they're talking

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
About it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Has also registered some

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Domains in regards

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
To their new IP Watch Dogs

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Remember that was the big game they showed

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
At the end of their press conference that

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Made a lot of people pay attention and some said

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Kind of stole the show away from the

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Big companies

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Watch Dogs The Movie

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Watch Dash Dogs The Movie and so forth

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
This could mean that there's plans

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Or talks about a movie

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I also kind of think this could just be

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Protection of the intellectual property

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Just to make sure

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Whatever or something, you know, and maybe because

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
The game looks so good it could be a movie

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
For one when they start seeing the commercials on TV

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I don't think you necessarily

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Want to read into this that they're absolutely

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Making a movie because of this, this could just be

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You know, trying to protect someone

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It's the same reason why we registered

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
TheVogNetwork.com

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Because so many hosts

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Were calling it TheVogNetwork

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Kind of a similar thing

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Alright, let's

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Let's go back to a time when games

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Were simpler and they weren't making movies

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Out of every single stinking game

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
In fact, the only movie that got a game was

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Super Mario Bros. or excuse me, the only game

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
That got a movie was Super Mario Bros. and it

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Sucked

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And since it's not the classic

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Video game of the week

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
It doesn't say classic

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Video game of the week, she's got a point

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
This is in my house too

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It is

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Twilight Zone that was

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Done by Bally Midway

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Uh, that's Mortal Kombat

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You unlock this door with the

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Key of imagination

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Anyway

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
It was designed by Pat Lawler

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Who is like one of the all

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Time best pinball

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Table designers, like let me go over his

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
List just real quick

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
He did Earth Shaker and Whirlwind

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
He did Fun House where you got to hit

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That ugly guy in the head a bunch of times

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
He did Adam's Family

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
He did Safe Cracker

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
With Stern, he did

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Roller Coaster Tycoon, Ripley's

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Believe it or not, NASCAR, Family Guy

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
CSI, and Shrek

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I mean this guy is

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
He's done some of the best tables

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Out there

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
But anyway, Twilight Zone

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Is based off of the

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Twilight Zone TV show

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It's one of the super pin series

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Of wide body pinball tables

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Other ones include

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Star Trek The Next Generation and

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Indiana Jones The Pinball Adventure

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Which is at Disneyland again

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's at the

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Was it the Jungle Trader? Anyway

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
But because

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
He was so successful with Adam's Family

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Midway's like, here you

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Can do the whole thing, you don't need to ask us

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Anything, and this is considered to be

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
One of the most complex pinball

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Tables ever designed

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It has a working gumball

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Machine that deposits balls

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
An analog clock deposits balls

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Shut up

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I knew you were going to do that

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
It has a working analog clock

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
It's a timer for different modes

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
A power field

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Which is basically like

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Right on top

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Of the left hand side

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Of the thing

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Basically instead of using flippers

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
You're using magnets

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
To play the ball through this little mini field

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
And the power ball where you use a white ceramic

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Ball that's lighter

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And it's given that it's

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Not magnetic, it's not affected by the

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Magnets in the table

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It also uses

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The original theme

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
From the Twilight Zone

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And it also uses

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I don't know who likes

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Their early 80's rock

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
But it uses the song Twilight Zone by

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Golden Earring

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
And it actually

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Has a

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Really good vocal

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Lightness, Tim Kittrow did

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The voice of Rod Serling

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It was

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Supposed to be the first game

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
To use the Williams Midway

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
DCS sound system

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
But it was still being developed

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So it used the Yamaha YM-2151

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Harris CVSD soundboard

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And it is

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Considered right now

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The top rated electronic pinball

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Table of Instagram

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
As far as

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Little fun stuff that's in there

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And I'm just going to read through the list on here

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
It has the door from the

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Opening credits right in the

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Center of the play field

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You have the mannequin, the zodiac

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Clop from the very beginning

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It has an image of

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Henry Burness from the episode

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Time Enough At Last

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's next to the slot machine

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
The hitchhiker

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
The slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You have the most

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Unusual camera

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Which is actually a pretty good episode

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The invader, static, the piano of the house

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Has the player piano

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
From that. You have

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Talky Tina from the living doll

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Here's your extra ball

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I know, it's pretty cool

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
They need the tower of terror

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Where your balls just drop

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Robbie the Robot

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Whipple is on the play field

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And in an animation

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And different sound effects

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Like the Serling voiceovers

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
My favorite one which we heard right at the beginning

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You unlock this door with a key of imagination

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
May I present

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
A most unusual camera

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
You know, that type of stuff

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
But the

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
You have different door panel modes

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Where one is like

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Ten million points, the light the gumball

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
The town square madness, fast lock

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Super skill shot, the super slot

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
The extra ball

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
The camera

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
There's also the spiral

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Clock millions, battle the power

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Greed, which actually

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Exactly

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
The hitchhiker

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And the clock chaos

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
There's actually one of my favorite things to do

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And this is one of the skill shots in the game

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Is when you use

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
One of the top right flippers

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And you have to hold the left flipper open

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
So that you're shooting it up a ramp

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Under the mini field

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So I mean, it's really

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Complex, really hard

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And then on top of that you have four different

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Multiball modes

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
You have the standard multiball

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Powerball mania

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Where it happens

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
When you load the powerball into the gumball machine

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And then

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You have to keep making shots over the main playfield

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And you get a 50 million point jackpot

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You have the

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Fast lock multiball

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And then lost in the zone

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Which is the wizard mode

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Where if you light all of the door panels

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
You get a door knob with a question mark

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And it pops open

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And you have 45 seconds

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
To make an unlimited number of shots

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
To all the targets

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Basically every playable

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Single ball mode is active during this time period

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
So it's basically

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
45 seconds of three for all

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And then

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
In most of the machines though

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
You have your standard multiball

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
With three being released

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
There's all kinds of custom mods

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That people have done

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Like one person added in

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The Robbie the Robot toy

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Into their machine

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
There's other design mods like the

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Third play field magnet

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The gumball flashers, the gumballs

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
We actually I think added an LED into ours

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I want to say

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
But yeah we have a gumball flasher

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That's an independent mod

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Different you know

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Colors, different things you can add in

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Just all kinds, people mod their stuff

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
All the way, now here's the cool stuff

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
You can play Twilight Zone

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Anytime you want to

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It's a license table for the pinball arcade

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It's out on

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
PS Vita

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And it's supposed to be out for the 3DS

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Windows and Mac OS

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So it kind of is a game

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Like a console game

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Well and for anyone who still

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Uses VPN which is basically

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
How we played it for the longest time in my house

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
You can play it on Windows

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I think there's also a version of PinMame

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And PinMame

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
For Linux

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I want to say

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So there you go, that's the game

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
It's Twilight Zone

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Are you lost in the zone?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Do you unlock this door with the key of imagination?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
There it is, Twilight Zone

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
The pinball game but now accessible

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Thanks to the wonders of emulation

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
On the 360 and Playstation Network

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And iPhone and all that good stuff

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
There it is

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Neat choice, something a little bit outside the box

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I like it

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So we are going to take a quick break

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
There's plenty more OLR to come, don't miss it

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We have the FUGL Question of the Week

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Some rapid fire news coming your way

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And of course the mailbag and your phone calls

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
At 1877 Game OLR

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
All when we come back after a quick break

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Live at vognetwork.com

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
On this June the 17th of 2012

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
With the 461st episode of our show

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Hey, happy Father's Day

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
To all you gamer daddies out there

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Happen to be listening to the show

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Including Loki, of course

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Has his kid Josh

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I see a lot of pictures

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
That the Mrs. and Mrs.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And the Mrs.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And the Mrs.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
And the Mrs.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I see a lot of pictures that the Mrs.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Has been putting up on Facebook, very cute

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
He was playing with another kid today it looks like

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Or the other day, I don't know

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I saw the picture today

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
He has the cutest hair

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And of course

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
As of course as I say

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
If you're a father figure or a father to pets

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I think you count too

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So I'm a wicked stepfather to two cats

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
One of which is being brave and coming out in the studio tonight

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Usually they hide

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But Maruko is out here

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
He wanted food

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I said tonight I'm not moving their dish tonight

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
There you go

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Clover Nikon in our chat room

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Says I'm a gamer uncle

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You know what, close enough

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I would still say that's a fatherly figure

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
In somebody's life

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I have a picture of Maruko, I'm gonna post it

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Awesome, over to orangelaunchradio.com

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Kind of a squinty picture

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
While you're checking out the pictures of the kitties

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
At orangelaunchradio.com

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Coming by vognetwork.com

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Because if you are participating live with the show

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You can check in and get your points

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And maybe, just maybe, get some loot

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Again that's vognetwork.com

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
If you're a podcast listener, sorry

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Can't check into the show yet

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
That's all I'll say about that

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Oh, by the way

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I think I should post the picture of the kitty cats kissing

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Outside of your

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Oh, the strays out in the neighborhood

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, that was cute

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
So, alright

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
We have some gaming news here

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
With rapid fire news

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I do want to put out a last call for any tweets

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
You guys want us to talk about tonight

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I'm gonna get to the foogle question of the week in a minute here too

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And I think DarkSakura is in her way to opening up the mail bags

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
You don't have a lot of time left there

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
But let's do some rapid fire news, Loki

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Sorry, I was looking up US Open

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Results

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Since when were you a tennis fan?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's not golf

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I'm stupid

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Well, no, fair enough

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
This is also tennis

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
No, but

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
My grandpa watches it a lot

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
We went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And he was watching it

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
There was this amateur

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
17 year old guy

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Who was just out shooting Tiger Woods

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Which I thought was hilarious

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Tiger Woods ended up 3 over par

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
For the 3 day course

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I don't remember the guys name

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Anyways, sorry

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So let's talk Journey

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Journey

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Don't stop

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
The journey was pretty awesome

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And of course

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
The developer, that game company

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Is now gonna go and self publish

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Their next game

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And they've got

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
5.5 million dollars

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Of capital from Benchmark Capital

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Mitch Lasky

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
They're gonna try to publish

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Their game on multiple platforms

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Possibly PC

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And I guess

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
They haven't announced

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Which platform the game's gonna be on

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
But I'm sure it'll be awesome

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Also should note that

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But I kinda hinted at it

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
On Twitter as well

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
That Sony will be releasing

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
On Playstation 3 a Journey compilation

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Now

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
There's only one Journey game

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
To believe that it's Journey, Flower, and

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Flow on disc

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Sadly not the 80's

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Game starring the super band

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Although that would be awesome

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
On top of that, you can throw in the music

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
In there as well

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Well it's funny to me though

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Flower and all that is good

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
But the Journey

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Why would you release this disc?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Because people can't go online to download it

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Or they're not connected

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Without being connected

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
You're not really playing Journey

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
That's the problem

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
You're not taking the true Journey

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You're like backseat driver

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I don't know

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah I know

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It's a cash grab

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Journey still is a fantastic game

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
But if you're playing it and not being online

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Then I think you kinda miss the point

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And that's where the other games

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Like Flower and stuff become

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Journey really needs to be on the Vita

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Because that would be amazing

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Racing games I've ever played

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Think about it

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
PlayStation Home would be interesting

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
On the Vita as well

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I don't know if I'd play it though

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But I would probably play it more on the Vita

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Than I would on the PS3

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Anyways, so let's talk Minecraft

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And there was a patch that was released

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Earlier, well Friday

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
The Secret Patch Friday

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
There's actually a bug fix patch right now

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
They didn't really do a whole lot

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
As far as any of the updates to the game

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
They added an auto save feature

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
So you can set it up to automatically save

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Every 15 minutes or 2 hours

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Or

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I guess up to 2 hours

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
They've also added a coordinate system

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
To the map, which is kinda good

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
That's good

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Exactly

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Also, they took away the dupe glitch

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So you can't dupe items anymore

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Some issues with clay not generating in your maps

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Which is a big no-no

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
So they finally fixed that

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
It can actually craft stuff with clay

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Also some framerate drops

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Stuff not spawning

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
So I sent them a message

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And switch to the third person camera

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That faces the front of you

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
You don't see the fire

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
But you'll see it from the back

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
If you do that

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
It's a one way fire

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
And then I guess

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Here's the other thing I didn't realize too

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
They set a fix for awaiting approval

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Showing all the time on some signs

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I've seen that happen

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
They don't

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That's weird

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Um

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I want to point out some comments from chat

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Clover Nikon is in chat saying

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
All the children at the school I work at

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Play the Minecraft demo

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And I'm like, well what age?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
8-10

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Which seems kind of young, but it's cool

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's a great game for kids

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It's pretty awesome

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I do like this

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
The ability they turn

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Or you can enable or disable the tool tips

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And he's seen all this stuff already

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And it'll be just like, hey

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah blah blah

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm like, yes I know, I built a giant

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Volcano out of Obsidian

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
It's just, I don't know, a little

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Annoying sometimes

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
When I was 12, or maybe 11

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
We used to go to the lab at the junior high

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
We would play Scorched Earth

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's epic

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Scorched Earth is still epic

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And what was it, Tank 256? There was another one

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Just like a Tank 256 or something like that

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
VGA Tank, I don't know, there was another one

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That is a game right there that needs it

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
That would be the perfect Facebook game

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
If you think about it

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Because it's not something that you take turns

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
It's a game that you take turns in

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And so, why not have it where

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You would play Scorched Earth on Facebook

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And I am not talking about

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Fucking Worms

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Inspired by Scorched Earth

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I am talking about Scorched Motherfucking Earth

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Right? Exactly

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So that would be pretty awesome

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
There will be an update

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Though for Minecraft, the next update

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
That's supposed to add pistons

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And that fun stuff

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
That's sometime in July

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I can't wait

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Do you realize, literally in one week

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
We're getting a Skyrim expansion

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
You may not be in Minecraft

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
For very long

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Do you realize in one week

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It's the 10th anniversary of our show

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
That's Bethesda's present to us

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Naturally, that expansion is coming out on my birthday

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
So it's Bethesda's present to me

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
The guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You really can't

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
You can never play enough Skyrim

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And then finally

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Tank Wars

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Thank you Jim Sally

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I think that was the one I was talking about

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Finally, Penny Arcade

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Their brand new game is going to be coming out

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Not on Xbox Live Arcade

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
But actually on PC, Mac

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
On Steam

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And Xbox Live Indie Games

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
It's coming out on June 25th

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
But they wait until July seems dumb

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Which sounds great to me

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And the game itself looks awesome

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I wasn't a huge fan of the

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Adventure game style that the first one had

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But this one looks

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Straight up

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
2D Final Fantasy game

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
So I may have to pick this up

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I just hope it doesn't

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Require too much knowledge of the other games

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Sorry, I was queuing something up here

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
I don't know, I zoned out when you

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Mentioned Minecraft

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Kirby

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Thank you for ruining it Dark Soccer

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I appreciate that

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I was going to play the music here

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And talk about

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
That's right, there's a Kirby 20th Anniversary Collection coming out

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
You may have already known that

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
But Kirby

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
20th Anniversary is going to include

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Now this is the Wii game

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
That's kind of like the Mario game

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
It was announced back in April

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
But now we know what's actually going to be in it

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Kirby's Dream Land

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Kirby's Dream Land 2

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Kirby's Adventure

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Kirby Super Star

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Kirby's Dream Land 3

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
There's also going to be a timeline

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Whatever that is

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I guess a poster or something

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And a soundtrack

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
It launches in Japan on July 19th

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
No North American information

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
As of yet, but I'm sure it will be

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Just in time for the holidays

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I think they've said September

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
On SNES

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Which was the best one

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm giving this props because

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's not a port of a Virtual Console game

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Because that's all the 20th Anniversary edition was

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Ported onto the Wii

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Literally game rips of it

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
The disc rips were like 30 megs

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
It was literally the ROM

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
From Super Nintendo

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
This is at least more than one ROM

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And they actually have to mink something

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Well, Majesco

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
The makers of Zumba Fitness

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Which sells really well

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And NBA Baller Beats

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Oh, Snapples

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
All right, NBA Baller Beats

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Well, they've got another baller franchise

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
That they've just acquired

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
American Idol is a license they just got

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I want to say, when American Idol first came out

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Codemasters had it, then Konami had it

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I remember the American Idol karaoke revolution games

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Well now, I guess Konami lost it

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Or gave it up

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Because Majesco now has the license

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
For American Idol

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No idea what they're going to do with that

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I imagine a type of karaoke game

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Would make some sense

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
A bunch of compliments

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
You know what's kind of funny?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Konami is actually getting out of the music game

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Genre completely

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Aside from Joy Sound

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
That they have coming out

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Which is a game that's pretty fucking old

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You know, I said for the 10th anniversary

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
We should have a funeral for Bomani

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And never talk about it again

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
But I don't know

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I don't want to do that

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
But it's true

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
In the first year, there was nothing on the floor

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
At E3 about Bomani

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
The very least they should have done

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Was put one of those DDRX3

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Versus second mix

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Machines in the Konami booth

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It would have been at least cool

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Which looks pretty awesome

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Anyhow, lastly here for me

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Mistwalker wants to make

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
RPGs for the Wii U

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
But nothing planned yet

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Mistwalker, of course, made

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
The Last Story

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Which is finally coming out here in America

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Some of the games before that they did

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
A criminally underrated 360 game

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I need to play that game

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Is that the 360 flopsied in Japan

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
We would have had a sequel

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I hate to say it, but it's so true

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
It's just really unfortunate

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I love that game

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
A quote from designer

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Takuya Matsumoto

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
The development team and Sakaguchi-san

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Are looking forward to making more

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Especially for the Wii U because it has another screen

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Right in front of you that will add another level

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Of strategic elements into the action RPG

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So we really are looking forward to it

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
But we really haven't planned anything

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
It seems like it's something you could

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Easily do, your little menus

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
You could even draw attack patterns

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I could see role playing action games

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Working very well with the Wii U

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
As long as it's in capable hands

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I think Mist Walker

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Has done a lot of underrated stuff

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Could be good if they decide to do it

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Since apparently they are

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Kind of married to Nintendo now

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I didn't realize this, but

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
They probably sold more of the last story

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Well, I have a few things

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
We have, first of all

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
The amount of money the

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
$5.1 million

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So all of that

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
The final amount is

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
$5,105,169.91

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
In two weeks

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
They basically blew

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Their previous records from 2 and 3

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Just out of the water

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
So basically

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
We had

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
598,794 people buy

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Make purchases

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
With the average price being

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
$8.53

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And it said that Linux users paid

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
More than anyone else at $12.51

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Per transaction

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And Windows users were paying the least

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
At $7.97

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
They always pay the least

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Yeah

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
But basically most of the purchases

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Were made on PC

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And then The Last of Us

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Is going to

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Not be out until 2013

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Well, of course

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
That's when all the games are coming out now

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Well, it was

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Technically it's late 2012

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Early 2013

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
But that's

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
What the Naughty Dog

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Director

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Directors, I should say

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Said on Jimmy Fallon

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And then Dance Central 2

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It has a June DLC

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
It is

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Um

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I don't know who this person is

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Eaz

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Replay

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
And Nelly's Hot in Here

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And Kat De Luna's Wine Up

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Yeah, these are all songs

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Well, I've heard the Hot in Here song, but I think it's awful

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
So, uh

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I don't care

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Alrighty then

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
What do we have for the week?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And Google Plus

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Put it together and you get FOOGLE

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Uh, this week's question

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Has to do with the story we talked about earlier

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
One of the stories we were talking about tonight was

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
THQ being suspected of misleading investors

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
On uDraw, which got us thinking

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Although all of us may not be financial investors

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Into our gaming habit

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
When was a time that you felt

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Misled by a gaming company

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
And, you know, we kept it a little bit vague on purpose

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
There's a lot of interesting responses tonight

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Let's start with Facebook tonight

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Um, I'm gonna start with Rob D

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It's hard not to feel

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Constantly misled by Capcom

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Their works, and especially their long-running

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Franchises, show that their developers

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Care about their games and have passion

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
However, we're promised so much

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And all we ever get is nickeled and dimed

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Zombie Princess says

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
The ending of Mass Effect 3

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
The whole series makes you think your choices

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Will make a big difference

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
In actuality, it doesn't matter at all

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Locopoco says

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
By Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Not Ultimate

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Was gonna have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Then when I bought it

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
All I got was a barebones fighter

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Sold it back to GameStop two hours later

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
That's two strikes against Capcom

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Um, let's go to

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Kareem J who says

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Have to agree with the above poster and Capcom

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
They hype up their franchises

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Then release a boatload of DLC

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Which should have been on the disc

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Then to add a further kick in the balls

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
They release a Game of the Year edition

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
But if you're really into one of their franchises

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
You want the game on day one

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
You can't help but feel like a sucker

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Ouch

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
That's three punches for Capcom

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Joe G says

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
GoldenEye Reloaded

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Frankly, I thought Activision was gonna make the original GoldenEye 64

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Pretty with some story

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
A few new missions and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
This isn't the case

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
They gutted the game, changed around the story

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
To make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And they fucking took out the jumping mechanics

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
You can vault over objects

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
But it's clunky to say the least

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Tyler M says

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
There's been many times

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
But nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I do remember being

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Kind of let down by Spore

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Spore wasn't

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
I think even Will Wright

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Kind of said it best

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
He just tried to accomplish too damn much

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I don't think he said it that way, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Let's see

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Let me try to wrap some of this up here

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Clover N says

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Driver was just awfully misleading

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Thank heavens EB Games has a seven day return policy

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
No questions asked

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
That's Driver 3

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
It's Driver with a three in it

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It is very entertaining though on its own merits

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It's Lulzy for about those first seven days

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
And then it's over

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I remember when you bought that

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
It's still Lulzy way after that

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It's one of those you have to keep going back to after a while

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I need to go back to that

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Shattered Hawk said

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Mass Effect 3

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
All the hours being drawn in by the story and characters

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Fuck you BioWare

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
For Mass Effect 3

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Let's go over to the Google Plus

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Uh oh

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Only one response on Google Plus

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
You know what that means about Google Plus

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
No one's on it

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
That's what it's starting to look like

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
We have another little kick for Google Plus

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Are you saying that Google Plus isn't the amazing thing

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
That they had us

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Let's believe that it was

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I have more I want to say about this

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
But I'm going to wait because there's another Google Plus story

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Coming up in a minute

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I want to say this about ActDeft

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Who has Google Plus all to himself

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And says I think there hasn't been a game yet

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
That has led to think or believe I've been misled

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Into buying by a game company

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I usually follow the word of other gamers

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And consumers before plunging into

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Buy a game

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Believing that EA and BioWare have totally

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Scammed them even if they didn't

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
In parentheses

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So there you have it

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
That's not really a third strike against BioWare

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Pointing and laughing at the other people maybe

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Looks like Capcom

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Took the cake on that one

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I can't say I blame the listeners there

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Over the past couple of years

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Maybe they'll redeem themselves if

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
End up being really really good

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I would still like to have that

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Mega Man universe someday

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Or the Mega Man Legends

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
They're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
On top of that

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I mean yes that was terrible

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
However I didn't buy the game so that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Wouldn't have been my choice

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
My choice would have to be Saints for the Third

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And not as

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I mean the game itself is a little misleading

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Kind of eh

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
The game itself is pretty fucking funny

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I mean that's just a funny

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Ass game

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It is a fun game

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
The DLC though on the other hand

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Is fucking terrible

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
It's just the expansion packs

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
That they had I mean don't get me wrong

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I understand the costumes that's a waste of money

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
But the expansion packs

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I was smart enough not to buy the season pass

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Because I know well enough

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
That you know what I'd rather

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Pay extra money

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And have each one of those expansion packs

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Be for you know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Definitely good

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Than to just pay twenty bucks

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
And have them all be terrible

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And thankfully I paid seven dollars

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Bought the first expansion and it was fucking terrible

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Rather reason the second expansion

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Even more terrible than the first expansion

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Third one

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Hey we get Johnny Gapat

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Except he's a giant mutant

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And it's fucking terrible

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Yeah I'm not

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I feel a little ripped off by them

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And also all the on disc

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
DLC they have more on disc

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
DLC than fucking Capcom does

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
It's ridiculous they're still releasing

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Stuff today that's on disc

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And then they have a whole

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Expansion that really could have been

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
An expansion of the game but now they're

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Gonna make it's own retail releases thirty bucks

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I'm waiting on that one

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I do want to play it because I like

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
The Matrix and I like Saints Row the Third

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
But I'm

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Very cautious going into it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Blender agrees with Loki

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Yes Loki Saints Row the Third

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
DLC pissed me off

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Bethesda got away with making the

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
True ending a DLC with Fallout 3

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I don't see a problem with Bioware

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Doing it as well

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
He makes a good point there about sometimes our

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Attention spans we let

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
One company get away with something but then

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Don't let the other

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Let's go back to some news

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Maybe some emails

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Let's go to Loki with news

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Let's talk a little bit about

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Retro and what their plans are

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Apparently

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Retro Games

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
It's been rumored for a while

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Well they've come out and said

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Hey we'd love to do a Zelda game

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And people started asking them

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Hey what's Retro working on?

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Because you know

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
You're not really saying anything about them

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
And

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Of course Miyamoto

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Basically saying

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
In terms of them working on a Zelda game

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It's not out of the question

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
But

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
You know

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Right now they're

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Incredibly busy with other things

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Then of course they said traditionally I think the Zelda team

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Has always had close contact with anyone

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Who's working on a Zelda game

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Traditionally

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Except for maybe in the CDI days

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Where they did not have close contact

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
With people that were working on that game

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
At least they probably

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Distanced themselves

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Ever since then

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
That's why Nintendo has had a close relationship

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Yeah

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Of course they're saying you know

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Retro is too busy

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
For that sort of thing right now

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
You know saying that they're

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Working on something else

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
And you know very busy right now

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
But I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
That they're working on

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
But

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I'm kind of curious to see if they are

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Making a Zelda game

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Could they be doing the next gen Zelda game

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Because if you think about you know the next gen type

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Zelda game for the Wii U

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Because Nintendo hasn't really worked in

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Next gen stuff I don't know if Retro's really

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Gotten their feet with it

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I don't know

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
We'll see

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Alright well I mentioned a minute ago we could come back

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And talk about Google Plus

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
This is not a good thing for the service

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
PopCap and

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Wuga Games

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
They're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Wuga already shut down

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Monster World

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Around May 1st

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
From the service this week

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I think it's already happened

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
They're going to quote redeploy our resources

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
To other adaptations of Bejeweled

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I think that's their nice way of saying

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Fucking no one's playing it on Google Plus

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
So we'd rather do the phones and

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
You know the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Wuga said

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
They decided to

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Decided to remove certain games from Google Plus

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Because we have had a much

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Larger following on Facebook

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And they are active users

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
So goodbye Bubble Island and Diamond Dash

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Those are leaving on July 1st

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
PopCap does say Google is

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
A valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
And will continue to develop for Google

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Platforms, that probably means Android

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I think also maybe Chrome

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
With games and stuff like that

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Chrome has a bunch of the

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Sort of add-ons with it too with games

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Which is strange that

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
You know it doesn't

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
That that won't therefore

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Integrate into Google Plus automatically

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
But maybe it does

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I don't know

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I remember seeing ads for Google Plus

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Like at the movies and stuff

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
They really tried to push this and

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
People just aren't taking the bait

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And I'm not sure I totally

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Understand why I mean is it the

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Interface is because maybe it's

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Maybe people don't like the oversimplification

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Next to Facebook I do see

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Some dedicated Google Plus people

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
There are definitely some people I see that use

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Google Plus more than they use Facebook

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And I have to admit I get so

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Sick of Facebook shit

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
There is so much shit on Facebook

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I don't need in my life I really don't

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
You know there's a lot of toxicness there

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
There's a lot of just

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
There's a lot of stuff

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
On there and I'm not saying Google Plus is

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Any better in that regard because I think

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
If everybody was on Google Plus instead of

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Facebook it would just be the same thing in

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Reverse but

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I don't know

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I'm just surprised more

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
People didn't run away

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
To Google Plus in a way

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Well for a while people did

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And I was like oh everyone else is still on

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Facebook because people needed attention

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
It's true it is absolutely

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
True people needed attention

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
They went back to Facebook I will totally

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Admit in some ways that's why I've still

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Posted on Facebook it is it's

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Been a great promotional tool for the show

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Now I will say this

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I think there's a huge

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And I hope to hell

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
This doesn't go away because I think there's

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
A huge potential to do something great

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
With Google Hangout

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And some of the interviews and some of that and I think

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
There's some cool untapped stuff there

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
So I hope they don't just close Google Plus

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
All together and you know what I don't

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Care if we only have like five fans on

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Google Plus that's five fans

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
That we have

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
So you know I don't want to like stop supporting

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Google Plus or whatever but you know it is

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
The fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
But MySpace

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Fuck them

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Fuck MySpace we don't care about that

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Fuck MySpace

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I still get messages on MySpace I'm like

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I don't even know where my page is anymore

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Let alone

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
All these artists hey listen to my shit

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I'm like no

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Zethur in our chatroom says r.i.p. Google Plus

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Well yeah

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I mean the game's leaving, Bejeweled leaving

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
That's when your PopCap

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Games are leaving

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
It's really not a good sign

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Yikes

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Alright anyhow

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Let's move on with some more news

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
DarkSaga

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Who pays attention to news?

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
How about some stuff about Starcraft

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
That'll make people perk up

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Is 99% done

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
The lead designer Dustin

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Browder basically said

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And this is a quote

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
99% done but that last 1% is a bitch

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
So

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
They're saying basically he says

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
He could do a playthrough

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I'm sorry then it's not really 99% done

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That was something he said to get quoted

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
May I finish?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
He said they can do a playthrough

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
And are like wow this is great

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Or you can do a playthrough

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And then find more items to fix

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So basically it's like they're in that last

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Beta stage

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Or I should say alpha stage

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Where they're finding those little last minute things

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
It sounds like it's all about your tweaking

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Which really is like the last little bit

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
So you're like 90% done

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Yeah

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
But um

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
So that's the only thing holding it back

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
At least they're waiting until it's done

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
What exactly do they have to do?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
They have the game done

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
They're adding an expansion pack

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Starcraft 2

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I don't know if I want my unit right here

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Do you play Starcraft 2?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
They are doing some more units and campaign analysis

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Here's the thing

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Starcraft 2 has to be balanced right

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
There is so much

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Esports and competitive gaming

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And things that go into something like Starcraft 2

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
It has to be right

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So I understand there's gonna be some

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Extensive testing that goes on with this

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Because they cannot afford to have a fucked up

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Balance in Starcraft 2

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Literally

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Hundreds of thousands of dollars go up for contests

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Over Starcraft 2

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
This game is huge in the competitive industry

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Especially though with all the shit over Diablo 3

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
You better bet your ass they're gonna

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Really put effort into this

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I mean really

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
If you look at the competitive gaming universe

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
It's Starcraft 2, League of Legends

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
That's where it's at right now

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
You know it's these type of games

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
It's not so much the shooters these days

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I mean yeah there's some of that still don't get me wrong

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
But it's a huge part

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
It's Starcraft, Warcraft Arena

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
To some extent, League of Legends is huge

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It keeps getting bigger too

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Anyhow

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Few more stories for you guys

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
In the mailbag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And Skype line in a little bit

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
But for first, Loki

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Well something I was talking a little bit about earlier

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Things that Nintendo says that they're doing

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And then

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Doesn't

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
We just talked about Starcraft 2

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And you know similar type of gameplay style

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
RTS, Pikmin 3

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
They're not doing online multiplayer

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
A brand new system that's coming out

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
HD

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And they're not fucking doing online multiplayer

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Because they said

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Well we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
So it would be hard for us to track all those

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Accurately on other systems

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Uh

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
No

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
That doesn't make any sense to me

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I'm sorry

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Because if you think about it

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
There are multiplayer RTS games

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Out there

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
There are multiplayer console RTS games out there

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I just fucking named some in the competitive space

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Hello, Starcraft, League of Legends

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And you can't fucking

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I mean

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
At one time, but

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Not like billions of

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Pikmin running around at the same time

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Ever heard of the Zerg?

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
It's a big

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Yeah, so it just seems like a

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Piss poor excuse for that

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I mean, you have a launch title

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Your system finally gets online

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Nintendo fucking gets online

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
But no, they don't fucking get online

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
They don't at all

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
It's no online multiplayer

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
You need to be online

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And send pictures of your penis to your friends

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Yay

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
But there's co-op local multiplayer

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
It's just all the online

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Functionality that they've shown right now

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
It's the same functionality we have

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
The 3DS and the Wii

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Send messages back and forth

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
And see what your friends are playing

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
That's not very functional

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Can fucking do on the 3DS with SwapNote

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Or on the Wii

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Wii has online gameplay

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
We had online gameplay with Mario Kart

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Why can't you do online gameplay for

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Pikmin

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Oh, I don't know

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
We've never coded online games before

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
What's the deal?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Oh, but we have local multiplayer

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Could it have anything to do with the fact

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
That the bandwidth that they have to send

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Data to tablet or something

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Is fucking things up

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Because they have to keep things synced between the tablet

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
And the system

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
And then also

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Other people's systems

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I don't know really how it works

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Because I'm not a developer

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
But it just seems like a piss-poor excuse

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Just saying

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
And they even said

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
One of the other things was that the Wii U

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
The whole idea was almost scrapped

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Because of the price concerns

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
They were saying sometimes

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
They almost gave up on the idea of additional screen

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
This was due over the concern

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Of expected high cost

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
It may not have been feasible

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
To create this and sell it

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
At a reasonable price point for the consumers

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Um

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And of course they haven't said

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
What the reasonable price point is yet

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Maybe now it's more reasonable

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
To pay $400 for a system

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Because there's tablets out there that cost that much

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I guess it's just

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
We're gonna have to wait and see

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
You know, how much the system's gonna cost

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
And if it's too much

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
It's gonna flop

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
If it's the right price point, it'll do okay

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
But

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I don't know

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Alright, moving on to a story

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
About a game a lot of people are looking forward to

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
We talked a lot about the Wii U tonight

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And not enough about this game

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Because this game looks so awesome, I can't wait to play it

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
It's Ni no Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
What's amazing is that Namco Bandai

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Is actually keeping that name in America

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
It's going to be called Ni no Kuni here

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Now they did change the subtitle

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Wrath of the White Witch has obviously

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Been translated into English

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
But yeah, the game is still planned

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
It is, if you're not sure what this game is

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
It's the whole level 5

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
And Studio Ghibli

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Collaboration, which has been out in Japan already

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
For a little bit

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I don't remember when it's finally coming out here

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I think it's towards the end of the year?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
2013, yet again

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
The reasons why they kept the name the same

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I love this, this is

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Quote, we really wanted to make sure

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
That all the fans who had come to know the game

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
As Ni no Kuni would still be able

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
To recognize it and find it

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Having a localized name of a game, you know

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Like Fight Quest 6, even though

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
It could be more westernized, that doesn't quite mean

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
That it has the same feel as the original game

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
That's why the name of the game

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Stayed with Ni no Kuni

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
There's a sound to it that feels right

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And the subtitle was of course localized

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
To Wrath of the White Witch

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Versus the original Japanese title

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
You know what that means though, right?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Second Country

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Ni no Kuni, Second Country

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
You know?

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I'm glad they did keep that name

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
With a title that isn't English

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Then why not?

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Yeah

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I think that Dew Prism had a different name

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Because I had been freaking looking forward

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
To hoping that Dew Prism would be out

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
And then I hear about Threads of Fate

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
And I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Speaking of Fight Quest 6

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I really do think that they should bring over

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Which is what I would call

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Toeball 3

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Because they really need a Toeball 3

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Because Toeball 2 is awesome

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Just saying

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Every week you guys email us

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
And DarkSakura

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Dives in the mailbag head first

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Surrounds herself

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
In the hundreds of thousands of emails

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
We get every week

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
And pulls out a lucky few to read here on air

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That's exactly what happens

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Well, we've got a few

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And there's one actually that we got

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
From Redertainment

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And just to say right now

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I've read it and I'm reading your thing

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
And I'll give you feedback

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Oh, it was an off-air question

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Okay, sure, I'll peek later

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
So

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Anyway, this one

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Dear O.L.R.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
I first have to say that I love this show

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Anyway

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Cancel your plans

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
O.L.R. memory I have

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Aside from getting pretty close to

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Dark Tetsuya

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Is that the day my father passed away

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
June 25th, 2003 from cancer

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
You guys were there for me

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I remember we were holding a show that day

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And I had delivered the news that he passed on

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And to help me get through it

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
You guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirit

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Ever since then

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
You guys have been a huge part of my life

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Thanks O.L.R. for the memories and keep up the good work

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Wow, that's heavy

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Like, you know

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I think we sometimes forget

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
That like people have their lives

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And their drama and the things that they're going through

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
And yet O.L.R. is kind of something

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
That stayed constant through 10 years

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
And I think some people have kind of, you know

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
It's really weird to say

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I mean, not in a bad way

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
But to hear something like that is very powerful

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I mean, when somebody's

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Looking for normalcy

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
So they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
To help them get through it

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Like I said

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
We don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
To feel that kind of power

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
That took one person in this case

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Very

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I'm glad we could help

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
That's all I can really say

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Same here

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Alright, the next

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
This is the one from Reddertainment I can read

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Greetings Omni Beings

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Attached to this email is a picture

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I took at a Best Buy on Saturday

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
It's of the PC version

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Of Final Fantasy XIV

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
The game is drastically reduced

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Not only does the price sticker read 20

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
The red sticker on the game

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Means the game is reduced to $10

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Still, even at $10, I question whether

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
This game was worth my money

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I posted this picture on Twitter

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Asking if the game was worth my money

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
The only reply I received told me

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
That the Wolverine movie game next to

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
What does it say

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
About Final Fantasy XIV that I

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
The gamer who cuts his teeth on

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Would question buying this game

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
And when asked, people replied

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
That I should buy a movie tie-in instead

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Stay black Reddertainment

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
This message has been brought to you by

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Locally produced microbrew beer

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Which is what I bought instead of a game

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
You could take a risk

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
That the 2.0 version

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Is going to kick a lot of ass

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
One thing we didn't talk about this week

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
There was a blog post on Sony's blog

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
That was still happening on the PlayStation 3

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Whenever the 2.0 version happens

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
There's going to be a beta test later in the year

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I just, I mean, rebooting an MMO

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
And expecting people to care

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I mean, it's a big

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Risk

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
But if you think about it, if you buy the game now

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
For $10, you're not going to have to buy it again

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
When the 2.0 upgrade comes out

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
At least on PC

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
I just hope that means free to play

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Final Fantasy XI

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I wish those rumors about the Vita

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Final Fantasy XI were true

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Oh god, dream on internet

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Okay

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
We have two more actually

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
But I never remember saying this

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
So, okay

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I agree with Dark Soccer 100%

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
When she implied that Nintendo

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Redeveloped Super Mario Bros. U

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
With a Crysis or Unreal type

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Graphics engine and put Mario in

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Real world 2D side scrolling

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
environment, oh, with real skies, trees

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
And weather effects, real gold coins

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Abuse the power of the Wii U

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I think I had said that it should

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Be like, remember how Fantasy Zone

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
The Sega Ages

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
2500

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Is, where it's all 3D

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
But it's side scrolling

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I think that's what I had

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Said

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
But

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I don't know that I would want it to be

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Like Crysis or Unreal

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
I just want it to be

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
2D side scrolling

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I think more like a game like

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Kinda had 2D, but a little bit of 3D thrown in

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I don't know

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And we had one last meal that came in

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
How about Paper Mario? That's a good example too

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Came in last minute

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And dear lord, sir

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Please spell out your words

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Well, sent from my iPod

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
That's what's happening

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I type out all of my words fully

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
On my iPhone

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
So if I can do it, you can do it

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
And I'm lazier

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Hey lord of the Orange Lounge

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
What's your most shameful moment

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
In video games?

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Mine is Star Wars Galaxies

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
The hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Just so I could make

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Hundreds of stem packs

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Because I want to be a medic

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Just that bad

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
That stupid game was such a let down

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Tons of money and time

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Never swinging a fucking light saber once

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Kisses, Jim Sally

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I may not want my co-workers to know about my

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
World of Warcraft podcast

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Actually, a lot of them already

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Do know about that

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
They don't get it, but they think it's

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Interesting

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I mean

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
You have to remember

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I work primarily

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Not exclusively, but primarily

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Middle-aged women

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
So when I say

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
When I say that I'm into video games

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I usually get a, oh

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
My son's really into that

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Type of reaction

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
We've got a few fellow geeks at my work

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
But one of them is into Supernatural

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Like I am

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
And you know, Becky works where I do

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And she doesn't play games

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Well, she plays R.I.P.M. but she sings

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I have another friend that plays Xbox

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Some of the people I talk to on the phone play games

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
The person I work

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Closest with at my work

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Who's another trainer and her and I are the same

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Subject matter experts

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I will say this

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I adore her very much

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
We work great together, we're a great team

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
But I do love the fact that even though

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
She may not totally get all my game talk

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
She kind of is a closet nerd

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
But it's not like you guys know her anyway

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
She's totally into comic books

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Oh, I totally know who that is

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
But no, she was telling me about

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Oh no, before you go see the Avengers

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
You need to go see Captain America

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Because there's parts of the story

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
That are in there that you're not going to see

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
In the Avengers

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
She likes to tell me about

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
How her and her son read comic books

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Together, that used to be a bonding thing for them

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
She's talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Together with them, and I thought that was just neat

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
It was neat

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
There's nothing to be ashamed of

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Unless you're a DC fan

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That's why

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Just to bring this back to an empowering moment

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
That's why I love VoG

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
The Voice of Geeks Network

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Let your voice be heard

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Nope

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
About what, VoG?

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Shame on you

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
No, about people knowing what my fandoms are

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
You've made a career out of it, woman

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
At least a nighttime career

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Well, I mean, but I really am

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Completely happy

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
You know, I like

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
My nerdy stuff makes me happy

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
And, you know

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yeah, I play games

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Play Mass Effect right now, yo

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
I got, you know, I actually

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
One of our reps was like, so what you're playing for this weekend?

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Oh, sleeping video games

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
And like, oh, what are you playing?

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I'm playing Mass Effect, really? I just finished that

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
You know, I have to do the conversation

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Back to work

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
But, you know, I get that

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I was like, oh, I play my Wii

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I took one of my co-workers

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
To the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
We drove over there

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
It was awesome

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
She had a blast

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Anyway

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
She's also a fan of this page on Facebook

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
One of my co-workers, yeah

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Do you be a fan of my page?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Well, you can go like Jamie, too

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
But I do want to say this

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
The Orange Lounge radio page is

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
A part of 500

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Do you think for our 10th anniversary

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
You could get us 500 likes on Facebook?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Like, I could go, oh, we want

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
1000 likes on Facebook and 5000

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Of course we fucking want 5000 likes on

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Facebook, but I'm gonna keep the goal reasonable

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Let's go

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
For 500 fans on Facebook

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Two more fans before the next episode

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
That would be great

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Alright, is that it for emails?

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Yeah, that's all I'm gonna read anyway

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Send us your emails

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Next week

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Meanwhile, let's get angsty

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
My FU, I have a few FUs

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
But I also have a thank you

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
My first FU goes

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Towards

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
This trend lately

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Of people having, like, you know

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
A Camry or some shit

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Up on these huge ass wheels

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
With, like, bicycle spokes in them

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
You know what I'm talking about, Rob?

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
They're like wheels

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
That are, like, way too big

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
For the car

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
And the spokes

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Are kinda like wagon wheels

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Except, they have spokes

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
You don't get it

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's like, what the fuck are you doing to your car?

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
And it's like, it doesn't add any

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
It, first of all

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
It reduces

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
It, um

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Decreases their gas mileage

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Because they have higher wind resistance

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
It adds no grip to the ground

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
And it's just not at all good

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
For their suspension

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
It's stupid, I mean

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
You know what broke my heart, Rob?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
You know what really broke my heart?

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
The 1970 Dodge Challenger

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Which is one of my favorite muscle cars

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
With the fucking wheels like that

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I wanted to kill a bitch

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I would have cut them so hard

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Now, I think that I would just fall over dead

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
If I happened to see one in the 72 Chevelle SS

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I mean, that would murder me

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
And then, there were

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
There was just the

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
The people, this is the other thing

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
People try to sneak around you

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Without saying, excuse me

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
When you don't see them, all you have to do is go

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Excuse me, may I get by, please

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
And I'm like

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I'll step aside and be like, okay

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
It's California in particular

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Where people don't do that

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
And like, anywhere else that I've been

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
People will tap me on the shoulder and say

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Excuse me, may I move around

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
But they don't do it here

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I don't get why

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
All you have to do is just speak to somebody

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
And not treat them like they're an inconvenience

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
But I also

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I love my mom

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Because I have to direct an FU in her direction

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And you know, actually

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I've got it in front of me on Facebook

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
I am going

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Making adjustments in my diet

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
And my mom says

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I've lost 8 pounds in two weeks

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
And I ain't no vegan, I eat meat

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Water weight

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And then

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
You're a bitch

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
But that's why we love you

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And I appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
And eat food that's good for me

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
And lose a little bit of my extra bulk

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Thanks mom slash sarcasm

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And so

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
It's just this thing with my mom

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Basically

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Anything that is not in her scope of reality

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
She sort of just rejects it

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
And substitutes it with her own version of reality

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And in some places

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
They call that insanity

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
So I don't know if it's just a mom thing

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
She just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So I guess this isn't

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Oh I just noticed

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I know look at that

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
500 likes

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Thank you whoever just liked us

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I can't see who it is

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
50 for every year of the podcast

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Alright now let's do 600

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Or no I want 666 now

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Well to continue

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Yes

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
It's just that

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Again I love my mom

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
It's not exactly an FU

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Really you know what I mean

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Where you just go really really

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
It's like that meme where the

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Girl is like looking sideways and making the

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Face which you can't see

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
So this is really good radio

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
You have a lot of FUs to give tonight

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Oh my thank you

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Who let me

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
And my small little purchase

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Go through and said oh no you've only

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Got a couple you go ahead of me

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I have a bunch more than you

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
And I was like well thank you

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
You have a nice day and she's like well you too

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I hope you have a great evening

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Bless her heart I hope she gets some tonight

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Yeah

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
But it just I'm glad that there's nice

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Considerate people in the world

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And there need to be it just takes one

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Act of kindness to make sort of

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
A ripple effect cause you know if you

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
If you take that moment and make a difference

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
In somebody else's day

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
In somebody else's day that's all I'm saying

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I'm done

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Spent

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Loki

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Uh

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I don't know I don't have anything

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
FU to my throat being sore

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
For a third week in a row

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
She's not going away

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
So I guess I gotta go see the doctor now

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Cause it could

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
No I don't know what it could be

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Maybe allergies

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
This is annoying

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I have to make mine

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Intentionally extremely vague

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Tonight but FU

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
To my fear of the

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Uncertain and the

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Uncomfortable probably causing

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
That's all I'm gonna say

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Alright

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Really there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Nothing wrong with changing brands

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
No that part's fun

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Are you kidding?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
That's like

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I know they might fit a little differently

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Than your current brand

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
That's the incentive to lose weight

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
It's like Rob if you lose weight

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
You can go buy new underwear

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Yes

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I meant like changing your brand

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Oh

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
They may fit a little weird in some places

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Maybe a little too snug

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
But it's a new opportunity

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
They might be cheaper and better made

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
On Orange Lawn's radio so I think we need to move on

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I think it'll be a good idea

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Please let's move on with something else

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Let's talk about Harmonix and

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
What they're planning on working on

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
They actually have three more projects

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Or three or more projects

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
They're in the work right now

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
And none of them are Rock Band

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Or Dance Central

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
So that's pretty awesome

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Of course they can't

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Talk about it but

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
At least they're coming out with something new

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Eventually

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Eventually

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
But they said yeah

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
They'll have some crazy stuff to talk about

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Hopefully next year

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Hopefully soon

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Coming soon

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Or not

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Yes

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Someday

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Eventually

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Alright let's move on

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Moving on to

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
One more story

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
It's about Capcom

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
And you gotta love this guy

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
He's so animated

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Yoshinori Ono

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
He's the guy behind

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
One of the producers of Street Fighter 4

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
He's awesome

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
He is awesome

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
There's this interview going around

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
That's on Eurogamer

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
About how he did Street Fighter 4

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Because he was working on Onimusha 4

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And he kept submitting a proposal

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
For a new Street Fighter

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
After Street Fighter 3 did not do so well

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
But apparently enough fans

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Pestered Capcom

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
They kind of let him do it

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I don't know if you forgot

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
But he had this whole thing where

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
He suffered from exhaustion

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Legit

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
He was just exhausted

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I don't want to say retire

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
But he had to really take a step back

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
For a little bit

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
What's interesting

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
About having come back to work

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
At Capcom

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Nobody told me to take a rest

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
When I returned to work

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Capcom didn't even acknowledge

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
That I'd been in the hospital

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
There was no change in my schedule

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I was at home for an entire week

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Before the doctors allowed me to return to work

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
When I returned to my desk

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
There was a ticket to Rome waiting for me

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
There's no mercy

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Everyone in the company says

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Ono-san we've been so worried about you

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
We've been overwhelmed with things to do

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
But then again when you made Street Fighter 4

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Which is kind of making Capcom

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
A lot of money right now I guess you can do that

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
And that is kind of messed up

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
I mean I don't know

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Is it just here in America

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
That you can kind of get that

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Like if you have an incident like that

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
I know if somebody at my work

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Had a bad incident like that

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
You would get what's called the work accommodation

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Where you work a limited schedule

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Whatever your doctor orders

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Which I still have

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
For several months

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I took two weeks off

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
And basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Which

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Some people might sound like

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Oh what a lazy

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
But no this is like a legit diagnosed thing

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Your doctor said she's got to do it

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
It's related to an immunodeficiency issue

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And I was also lacking in B12

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
And vitamin D

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
And it's almost

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
In some cases I've seen people

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Compare it to narcolepsy

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Where you start finding you'll be aware

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Of yourself nodding off

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
It's just overwhelming

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Exhaustion where you hurt

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
All the time

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
It's horrible

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
And anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Alright anyhow

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
What is this

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I guess Ono

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Was continuing to talk

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I thought this was a crazy quote

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Was this a quote from Ono? I guess it was

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Capcom was very good at squeezing

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
People to the last drop of their

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Blood to get work done

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Ouch

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
You know something else though

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I think it's

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So they basically bought him a ticket to Rome

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
To relax

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
See now that is though

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I would say understanding

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
What they did and saying sorry here you go

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Thanks for getting the product out

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I know in Denmark they get a month off

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Mandatory paid vacation

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Finland too

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Because they're you know

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
A socialist democracy and they have the highest

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Highest level of

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Reported public happiness in the world

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Just saying

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Learn from this America

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Alrighty

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Ah

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
That's it for my story there

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I guess we're about ready to open up the skype line

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
How's it sound when we open up the skype line?

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
1877 Game OLR

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And we'll get to the twitter topics

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
In just a minute as well but I want to ask Loki

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Surprise him here with any last minute stories

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
He might possibly have for us

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Just real quick there's going to be

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
A different circle pad attachment

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
That's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
It actually kind of conforms

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
To the 3DS shell

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
So it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
So cool

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And that'll be coming out I guess

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
For 30 bucks

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Soon

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
So a little bit more expensive but

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Pay for quality I guess

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And then there's a retro game

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
That's being put out

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
On PC

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
By developer JoyMashers

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And it's a game called Oniken

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Looks pretty awesome

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Supposed to be coming out on

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I guess Desura

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
For $4.99

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
And that's out uh

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
It was actually out this coming Friday

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
On the 22nd

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And I guess um

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Mac and Linux versions are coming out

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Later on

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
But the game looks a lot like Strider

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
So

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
It could be cool

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Which Strider? NES Strider?

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
NES Strider? Well I mean it's an

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
NES styled game

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So it's like NES Strider but

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
I mean it sort of resembles Strider

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But not Commando you know generic

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Futuristic action game

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Alright the calls are coming in

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
So let's go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Taunt Radio who's this?

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
It's Shane

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Hi Shane how are you?

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Hello

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
How are you?

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I'm burning up and achy

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
And tired

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
For those that listen to Horde House

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
How are you doing after the surgery?

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Well

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
I'm not falling asleep

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
In the middle of things as much

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Yeah that was a hilarious moment by the way on the show

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
If you didn't hear this week's Horde House

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Shane fell asleep part way through the show

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
It was amazing, amazing radio

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Go check it out

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
It's because I was on uh

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
What's that thing? Percocet

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
I'm still on it, only to get to sleep now

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Not for pain stuff

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
You even have comments in the chat room

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
BlackWolf says is Shane awake?

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I am

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Um crap

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I totally had what I was gonna say

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And then I forgot because you interrupted me

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I'm sorry well surely it was about Mass Effect

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Percocet

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Surely it was about Mass Effect

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I honestly don't think it was

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Which might

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Shock everybody

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
They replaced him after the surgery

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
What? Nothing

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Nothing? You're not a pod person

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Was it E3? Was it something we talked about?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
No I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
So I got that

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Indie bundle that had all those really good games

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
For super cheap

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
The most recent one

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Sorry BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
That was good

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
That was good

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yes the Humble Bundle

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
And I started playing Bastion which you know

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I heard so much about

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
I saw all the banners at E3 last year

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I was like oh that looks stupid

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
And now I'm playing it and the game

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
It's okay but I want every game to be narrated

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Now because that is the

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Best part of the game

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
It's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
It's the part of the game that makes

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
People feel so like hipster

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
And that they're playing something artistic

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Is like my game has a deep

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Voiced bassy narrator

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I don't feel hipster but I like to

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Jump off you know

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Well I fell off the world once and he narrated

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
That and that's where I was sold

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I thought it was so awesome

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Commercial in the style of the Old Spice Commercial

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
That Mustafa guy

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
That would be awesome

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I want a game narrated by Gilbert

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Godfried

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
What is up with that?

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
That would be terrible

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Nobody wants that

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
I would play that

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Oh my god I think you just

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Died

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
You're the worst video game player ever

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Have you seen the

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Funny video of Gilbert Godfried doing

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
The audio book for Fifty Shades of Grey

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Yes

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Yes I have

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Oh my god it's fucking amazing

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Yes I have

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Fifty Shades of Grey

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Oh my god

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
So Shane

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I am addicted and I blame you

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And Rob

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
That's fine I'll take all the blame

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
For that because

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Well here's the thing it's kind of like a pyramid scheme

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
So now you have to go and find

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I'm working on it I'm trying to get Dan to play it

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So that our entire house is infected

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Can Shirmi play it?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
No she'll just shit

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Oh that's disgusting

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Well everyone poops

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
That's true I know

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
From my little puppy Especially your new puppy

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
What did you end up naming your puppy?

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Helo from Battlestar Galactica

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Cool okay

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Well um

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Now I am completely addicted to

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Including Garris and everything

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Because I kind of dig my

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Birdman

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
He is awesome He totally is

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But I am looking forward to the

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Hotness of Miranda

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
But I don't know I'm not too impressed with Kaiden yet

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Really cause he's just

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Not doing anything he's just sort of like

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
It's cause you're not taking him places

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I heard earlier you're like

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I don't bring him along

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
I'm like hi Shepard

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Wink

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
No the same thing I felt for Liara

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I hated Liara and then I beat three and I kind of

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Liked her and then I started taking her

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Through my playthroughs

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Well I can't say stuff

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
And she became my hag

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
And I like Liara now

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
So I have her and Kaiden all the time

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Well then maybe

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Maybe I'll leave Rex at home

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
For a while and take Kaiden out

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Yes

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
That's a much better idea

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Although people have been spoiling crap for me

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Well you should

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Unfriend them and then drive to their house

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
And punch them in the throat

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It's because I was looking up the stuff

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
That I'm not doing in Mass Effect

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Like I was reading the wiki

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
And I don't want to

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Shoot somebody

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Oh yeah

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
So

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
That made me mad

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
That and the triple palette swap

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
That I won't go into further detail about

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
We can talk

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Later about that because I don't understand what that is

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I'm telling her she doesn't

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
That doesn't tell her the full picture

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
That doesn't tell her the full

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Picture I'm still going to play the whole thing

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I'll find out Rob

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I'm just saying

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Before I hang up here

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
So you don't hang up on me

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Something we'll probably talk about on Horde House

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
This week that I saw today

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I guess it was Dad of Mine for Diablo 3

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
That you'll get

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Some stuff for having the collectors

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Miss the Pandaria

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
You'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Banners and stuff but there's also

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Possibly these

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Wings that say in the

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Like the code string

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
That they give you quad damage

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Now how fair is that

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
To get something that's actually worth

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Something that's really good

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
For another game but you have to buy

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
A collector's edition of something you may not

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Care about

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
That fucking sucks actually that's pretty shitty

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I gotta say

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
But I'll get the collector's edition anyway cause

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
I want that soundtrack cause it's really good

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
And actually before I let you go

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
I have something I have to play

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Oops not that

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Was it my commercial I sent you cause that's awesome

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
No

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Holy fuck is this wrong

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
But holy hell

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Is it erotic

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000
He totally missed the part where he's actually

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I can't find the actual YouTube on there

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
It was apparently on College Humor

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
But I searched their site and I couldn't find it

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I'm sure Tiger Claw will have it in 30 seconds now

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
But it's missed the boat

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
It's on my Facebook page

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Hurry up and end the show so we can go play Mass Effect multiplayer

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Bye

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
1877 game

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
O-L-R username on Skype

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Is Orange Lounge Radio

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
If you want to give us a call

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Do we have any other last minute stories

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Or should I go over to Twitter

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I had Twitter up on the iPad

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Well there was something I was just going to mention real quick

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
That was kind of interesting

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Remember how well we were just talking about

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Pinball game during part A

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Where Twilight Zone was

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
The game of the week here

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Pinball Arcade the Twilight Zone

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
It's to get the Twilight Zone I guess on consoles

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Well it must have worked

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Hold on let's go to the phone

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
So we have another call coming in

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Oh my god is this Rob

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Oh my god it is

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Oh my god penis

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Oh hi

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Well yes I have one

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Would you like to see it

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
And unfortunately I've already seen it

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Ah to be 20

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Ah unicorns

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
What is up Miss Jessica Harper

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
From Understation Live Saturday nights at VOG

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Not much I thought that you know

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Since you've actually been

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Showing support for us these past two Saturdays

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
And stuff

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I would actually call in

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
And say hi guys

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Thank you so much you know being able to check in

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And get points really helps motivate me

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
To show no I've

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I mean obviously I do love the points

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
There's no other reason aside from

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Going and getting points

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
No the whole reason there's two reasons

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
And I can't honestly I won't be there next

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Saturday but neither will you

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Neither will I

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
There's two reasons one of them is disco disco

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Disco disco

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
And somebody was asking me when we were going to do

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Disco disco on Orange Lounge Radio I said you don't understand

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Travis already thinks I steal

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
All the bits from Understation Live

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
I'm not gonna

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Like further give him evidence

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
So no disco there's a ban on disco

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Disco the closest thing

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
You can go disco disco in PlayStation Home

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
That's as close as we're gonna get

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
But I will say

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
The second reason is recursive

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Travis

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Yes recursive Travis

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Always makes me giggle it doesn't matter

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
How pissed off I am how upset

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I am recursive Travis just every

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Single time I do love though

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
That you guys it looks like

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
I gotta say props to Travis and I don't know

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
If you're part of this effort as well you've gotta be cracking

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
The whip or something behind the scenes because

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Travis is now getting his podcast up

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Same day which is amazing

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
You know it's all

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Because of

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
The vog

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Aura it's like it got into his

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Veins or something and now he

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
He just he's part

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Of it you know he is in the

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Groove and I'm waiting for it

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
To start you know

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Calming down like after a month or two

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
But you know it's been well over a month

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Now it's like been what seven shows

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Now that he's been getting up there

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Every single week yeah yeah for real

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Yeah and um

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Not only that but it looks like

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Starting with this past week he now has

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Saved the archives on Ustream because

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
If you haven't tuned in to understation live on vog

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It actually flips

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
The radio station disappears

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I mean it's still there so if you want just the

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Audio like if you're driving in your car or something

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
You obviously can't watch understation live you can still listen

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
But if you're watching on your computer it

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Flips and you see the Ustream

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Well Travis is now saving the Ustreams

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
So if you're jvmon in our chat

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Room asking what is disco disco

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
You could go to Ustream

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And watch now you can

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Watch and watch you can actually

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Feel like you're there

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Watch me disco disco last week

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
With no pants yes

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
And watch his you know beard

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Get the dirty thoughts out of your head you didn't see anything

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Below the belt except my leg

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
But I have

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I've just

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Seen Robin very tight

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Lacy panties

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Lacy silky

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Is what I did you make it okay

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
You need to give some background to this

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Walking around in women's panties

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Or something like that yes it was rocky

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Horror there's a big difference

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
There's a difference still funny to say

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
There's a difference

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Is there any video games you've been playing lately

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Aquaticirl

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Well pretty much what I play

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Is over and over and over again

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Is lotro I am addicted to lotro

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Yeah you suck dark soccer into that whole thing

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
I'm trying to

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
I see her over there once in a while

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
And she's like oh it's so pretty I'm like

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Yeah that's why I keep trying to tell you people

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
It seems like it's working a little bit

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I'm trying to play it at least once a week

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
At least once a week

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Because I don't know if you know about

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
My guild druidia

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I was seeing something about that yeah

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
We now have an all druid guild

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Called druidia

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
It was either going to be that or the order of vespa

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
She has to fit in her time

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Between tumblr and facebook

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Too I'm just

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I've had design work to do

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
For reals that I've been getting paid for

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
I'm kidding lady lighten up

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
She just has such a busy gaming schedule

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
She has to fit everything in

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Yeah my mass effect and my fractal

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
And my wows and my lotors

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
And my stows

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
So yeah I only have time

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
In my life for one game

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
That's my MMO addiction right there

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Hey you know what getting addicted to an MMO

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Well I just

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
See here's how bad I am though

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
When it comes to console gaming

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I used to be right on top of it

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
You remember how I used to be

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
I don't own any modern system

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
The only thing I have is a PS2

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
You know what though

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Gaming can be an expensive hobby

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
And there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
We have a lot of people listen to this show

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
That's kind of in your boat

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Where it's like you know

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I'd love to have a 360 or a Playstation 3

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Or whatever but I just

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I have to buy stuff at you know

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Flee markets

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I like paying my rent

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Exactly

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I've gone through a lot of life changes

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Since my gaming days

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I now live in a place all by myself

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
And it's in downtown Sacramento

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
So it's a little bit more expensive

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
But you know

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
You do what you have to do

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
And so yeah I'm not sharing rent

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
So I can't go out and buy the pretty toys

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
And what have you but

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
You know what we could do?

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Typing of the dead

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Yeah well unfortunately

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
When I was going through all of my

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Very very difficult times

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
My Dreamcast was one of the things that went away

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
You girls can borrow mine anytime

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
If I can find it

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
If I can find it

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Yes I could

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
We can type zombies to death at my house

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Yeah

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And as mentioned in chat I do have Chewy

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
You do have a Chewy and that's very important

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And space

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
A lot of my attention yeah a lot of my space

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Alright I'm afraid again

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
The only roller coaster I will real roller coaster I'll ever do

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Is screaming okay Rob

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
I just want to read in chat real quick though

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Black Wolf is complaining

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
You guys just went I haven't been in

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Over a year yeah well

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Still two weeks is two weeks too long

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Alright caller hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Who's this? Hey what's up this is X-Link

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Hey X-Link I haven't heard from you in a while buddy

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
How you doing? Good good Black Wolf don't feel too bad

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I live right around the corner from

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Disney around here and I've been in here so

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Don't even remotely feel bad

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I haven't been able to get up there and be able to do

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Stuff in quite a while so

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I've been quite disappointed that they took

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Tron away from it but

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
You know something about that

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Rob I have a question for you

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
How do you feel now

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
That the Steam Workshop has now

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Has been available for Civ 5

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I haven't really

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Got to play around with it yet

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
But I'm excited about the potential

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
That's in there I mean there's always been some

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Great mods for Civ so

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
It just seems like a logical step and I'm kind of

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Glad that they're kind of embracing each other

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Steam and Civ I haven't

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Admittedly played a lot of Sim 5

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Ever since I got into the Mass Effect series

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
But I definitely want to go back and revisit it

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
I heard the game fell out of balance

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Bad with the last patch

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
That they did so my friends were like I don't really want to play

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
It kind of sucks right now but I'm imagining

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
They fixed it with God's I mean they had to

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Have with this Gods and Kings expansion so

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Yeah they did a lot of work on it

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
From what I understood from this last patch alone

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
When they were adding the Steam

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
The Steam Network workshop

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Onto it and then I'm hearing on top of that

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
They're also going to be doing a little more odds

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And ends to that when Gods and Kings does

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Come out in the following week here so

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Right right

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Which will be very interesting because knowing

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
That you can make your own religion is going to be kind of

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Interesting and intriguing to see what happens

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
That is a little bit scary but good

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
I was going to flip this question on you what do you think

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
About Steam Workshop and Civ integration

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Civ 5? Hey I think it's going to be pretty interesting

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
What they're going to do Sharks with lasers

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Or nuclear weapons or you know

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Or robotic robots you know

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
I mean the sky is the limit so

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
I mean it's going to be intriguing to see

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
What kind of different mods and stuff

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
People are going to come up with for the game so

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
It really is it's like little big Civ

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Pretty much yeah

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Hey this actually kind of ties into this

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I want to bring in this Twitter topic here real quick

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Because it sort of is related here and I'm sure

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
You're going to know this story when I start reading it

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
From SSJ100Matt who tweeted us saying

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
I saw this earlier this week

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Man plays same Civ 2 game

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
For 10 years

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Civ 2 is my favorite Civ game

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
So this made me smile

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
And Sid Meier even did a reaction to it

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
If you haven't heard basically

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And this was all over Reddit and all that stuff

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
So I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
But this man has been playing his Civ game for 10 years

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
He's now in the

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I mean not obviously like straight

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
He's been playing 10 years on and off

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
His world is in the world

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Is in the year 3991 AD

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
That's a long ways into the game

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Trust me

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
And basically his world has

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
The Celts, the Vikings and the Americans

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Stuck in thermo

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Sorry the Celts, the Vikings and the Americans

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Stuck in thermonuclear war

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
For 1700 in game years

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
That's crazy

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
They're saying

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Is it a strange reflection

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
On where society is headed

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
This week

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
No I did not actually

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
It's kind of intriguing hearing about that

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I'll definitely go back and reread that

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
But yeah that's crazy

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Though I thought they could have sworn

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
They stopped it like at some point they do

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Stop the game like if you get to a certain area

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
It's like you can't play it after that

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Unless it's Civ 3 or 4

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
It must be

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
It must be the later Civs

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
I thought the game always ended at a certain point

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
As well but maybe 2 had been left open ended

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
I can't remember

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Maybe his game was modded somehow

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
To let it go on forever

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I didn't read about the details on that

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
In 10 years that's a lot of time

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
I don't know

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Maybe turn a day or something

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Or turn a week

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I don't know

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
That's very intriguing but that's very cool

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
To hear about that

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Sid Meier's response was really interesting

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
He said

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
My first thought was wow

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
For so long

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
It's been more than 15 years since we released that game

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
And I don't think any of us expected

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
A decade long game would come out of it

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
It would be amazing if we could come back

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
In 2025 and find out if

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Someone's had a 10 year game of Civ 5

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Going

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Well you know it's kind of like

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
The way he's played and ran is kind of similar to

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Monopoly really

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
If you play it right

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
I could see it actually going on for that long period

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Of time

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
It's going back and forth type of deal

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
And you're not really making

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Ok I'm going to build up 50 units

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
And go in there and try to

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Massive wipe these

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Towns and cities in the short period

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Of time

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
If he's taking his time and just doing it

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Building day by day I could actually see

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Something like that happening probably

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Let me read this comment from JVmon in our chatroom

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Saying I know Civ 3 stops scoring

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Once you hit 2050 AD

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
But you can keep playing if you want

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
I think that's it

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
The game stops

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Yeah I think that's exactly what it is

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
But I will say this and I know I'm going to get shit for this

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Because he just said he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
That one's the worst one in the whole series

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I kind of agree

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Especially the way that it's advanced

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Over time

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Yeah I can actually see that

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
But all the games

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
If you go back you're like wow

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
It's kind of cool though

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
It's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
From the beginning and going through

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And it's kind of cool like even you said yourself

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
When you're playing Mass Effect

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Seeing the changes that have been done from part 1 to part 2

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
To part 3 to part 4

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
You know so on and so forth

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
It's kind of cool to see the

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Transactions and seeing what happens

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Throughout that time period

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And to get their own

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Their own thoughts and other people's thoughts

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
And theories behind it and putting it to work like that

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
If DarkSakura wanted to jump in here with a thought

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
And then we'll wrap things up

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
I was just going to use one of my grandmother's favorite quotes

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
To each their own said the blind woman

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Said the blind woman as she kissed the cow

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
That is very true

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Very very true

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Alright XLink I got to let you go

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Not really that I can think of at this time

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I'm probably going to go back and play some Rift now

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Alright good luck have fun with Rift

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Yeah thanks appreciate it

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I know him talking about MMOs and obviously I used to play

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
A lot of WoW with XLink

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
But I was playing some of the beta

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
This week and I got to say the beta's

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Come a long way and I was doing some panda

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Tanking and it was actually quite fun

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
1877 game

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
1877

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
GameOLR or a username

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
On Skype Orange Lounge Radio

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Meanwhile I got to get through some of these tweets

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Who said shout out, I actually retweeted it

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Shout out to OLR, long time

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Fan from many moons ago

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Rediscovered you recently

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Now listening to you live with my fiance

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Well thank you for tuning in

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
And I realize sometimes

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
People just don't have time

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
For OLR anymore or kind of fall out of

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
The habit of listening you know

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
It happens but it's really cool that you come back

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
At least you haven't fallen

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Asleep during the damn show

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Fair enough

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Jim Sally sent a tweet that said

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Hey guys can you tell me how to spend

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
You a tweet while you're live on air

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I wish I could figure this out

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
You kids and your twittering

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Well speaking of which, let's take this phone call

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
And see who might be there

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Hey baby

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
How funny, I was just talking about you

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Were your ears burning?

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
What did you say?

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
I was reading your tweet

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
I wrote a tweet to you? Oh yeah sorry about that

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Or somebody hacked your account

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
No that was me, I was a little bit

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Funny before and I thought I would tell that joke

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Did you like it?

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
I did, I did

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I was saying can you tell me how to spend a tweet

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
While you're live on the air

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
You kids and your twittering

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
You pretty much got

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Twitter in a nutshell right there

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Bad grammar and all

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
That's the Jim Salle way

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
That's the Jim Salle goy

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I'm making my own English

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
I was just going to say to what do we owe

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
This great phone call tonight

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
I got you another little present like you asked

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
I'm the 500th person to like your

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Facebook page

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Get out, that's awesome

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Thank you

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I said how come I haven't done this yet

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I felt a little ashamed

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
So I rectified my situation

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Thank you for the support

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
What kind of prize should we give Jim Salle

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
For being the 500th fan

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I think I should get 500

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
VOG points

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Jamie has a prize?

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Yeah

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
You got a round of applause

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I was using my slow clap processor

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
So I'm not going to get the 500

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
VOG points

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
And hearts, you get hearts

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
And you have VOG points

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Don't they go away at the end of the month

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
I think someone told me they go away at the end of the month

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Sort of, the main leaderboard

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Is monthly

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
But we are still going to keep track on a year

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Basis, but that one is

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Going to be a little more for fun

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
And let me tell you the reason behind that

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
We want, well just go back to the

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Tweet earlier where somebody said

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Hey I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
But I recently rediscovered you guys

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Well you know if somebody kind of comes into

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
VOG a little bit late

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Then you know we are going to be adding more shows

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
To the network soon so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
We don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Or they can't ever play the game

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Because they are never going to be able to beat the score

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
So that's

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
We are going to reset the boards every month for that reason

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
So people have a chance to win

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Every month

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Listen Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG network

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Knows they can't keep up with Jim Sally

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
So you might as well just give me the 500 points

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
First off, okay

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Second off, it's father's day

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
You're a good dad, I'm a stay at home dad

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
I work hard every day, keep my baby girl

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Clean and pretty and nice and put her in

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Dresses and stuff

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
All I ask for at the end of the day is

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Maybe some extra VOG points

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:50.000
And a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Alright, Jim Sally

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Just because you call in to the shows

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
And you do show your support

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
I will see what we can do, no promises

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
You're the boss, you can do it

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Here's the thing

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Bobby did all the coding work

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
And he's very

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Passionate about his game

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
I'll see what we can do

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Come on, Bobby

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Bobby, don't be a douche

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Give me my 500 points

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Listen, Bobby

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Douche wolf

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
You're not going to win fans that way

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Listen

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
This is not how you do it

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
You catch more flies with honey than vinegar

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Listen Bobby

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
I don't care about honey or vinegar

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
I care about my VOG points

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Act deaf, this Google plus loving mother fucker is ahead of me

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
And I won't have it

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
And I won't have it

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
I'll give him something to Google plus about

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Jeez, I deserve those points

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I work hard

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
I think without me, where would I be?

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
If anything

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
If anything

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG network enough

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Or too much

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Or too much

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Fine, I award you 500 points

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
For Gryffindor

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
For Gryffindor

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
What is it you were going to say, Rob?

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
It's a bummer the points aren't compatible

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
With each other

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
The conversion rates

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
You were looking at me funny

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Very loudly

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Oh, nothing

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
No

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
I'm just

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Bobby, make it happen

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Bobby, come on

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
A lot of people are

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Alright, take care of Jim Sally

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Have a good one

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Thanks for the points, Bobby

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Goodnight everybody

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Bye

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Alright, we got to close up the Skyline

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
I'm so sorry, I saw other people trying to get through

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
In fact, there was one caller I'd never seen before

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
That I really wanted to take

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
But it just didn't work out, I'm sorry

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Email us, mailbagoutorangeloungeradio.com

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
I'm using Chigurh's suggestion

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
By the way, we've actually awarded you

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
The 500 points

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
But we're taking it away for ranting

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
No, we are doing no such thing

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Bobby and I are already discussing

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Something in secret

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
That's all we can say, it's in secret

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
A couple more tweets, I got to get some of Tigerclaw's tweets

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I posted the best picture

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
In chat, by the way

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Tigerclaw tweets

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
But I posted the best picture in chat

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Of peekathulu

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Tigerclaw sends us a tweet

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Microsoft's first Android

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Title, Connectimals

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Remember Connectimals?

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
They're still around

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Apparently it's the first Android game

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
That they've launched on Google Play's

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Store, not to be confused with Google Plus

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Which we were talking about earlier

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
It is out now, it's also on

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
iOS, just saying

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
$2.99 on Google Play for Android

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
A little tie-in there to the

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Connect game that I know Loki's a big fan of

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
He gave me a big thumb

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
That was a gladiator moment

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Right there with the big thumbs down

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Alright, let me read

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
One more tweet here from Tigerclaw

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
PBS taking a look at

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Modern 8-bit culture

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
That's really cool

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
The evolution of 8-bit art, I guess it's like a

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
PBS special that's going on there

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
That's talking about, I imagine it's got to be things like the

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
8-bit exhibit and all that stuff

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
That's pretty cool

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Talking about some of the recent games like VVV

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Mega Man 9 and some of that

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Stuff that's really caught on, that's really cool

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
And murals and so forth, you know what?

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
And all that, so

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
I can totally see why it's in our

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Popular culture and all that

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Anyway, I gotta close up the tweeters

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Close up the mailbag, close up

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
The phone because it is about closing

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Time here at Orange Lounge

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Radio, we gotta wrap up the show and say

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Goodnight, I wanna check in with Loki

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
One more time to see if he has any other

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Last minute stories

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Alright, then we'll go around

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
And get everybody's final thought and wrap

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
About this, what is this that you brought?

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
The FP

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
It's basically

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
A movie where there's these two post

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Apocalyptic gangs that compete

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
And fight each other

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
By playing DDR

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Wasn't that in a Madonna video?

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Hated it, no

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
It's really cheesy

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
I don't know

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
It's a screener ahead

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I'll have to check that out at some point

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Alright

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Final thought

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
My final thought tonight is

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Dinner

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
Picatulu

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
And Loki

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Last but not least, your final thought tonight

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
My final thought is

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
This mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Zombie Playground looks too much

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Like Pedobear

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
It's Pedo Raccoon

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
That is

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Pedo Raccoon for sure

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
And Zombie Pedo Raccoon

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
But that is Pedo Raccoon

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Fun!

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Alright, hey before we

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Close up shop here

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
I just want to say thank you guys very much

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
For tuning into Orange Lounge Radio

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Thank you for your support over the past 9 years

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
And 51 weeks

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
All we ask, tell a friend or two about

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Orange Lounge Radio, help spread the word

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Hey, we got fans 499

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
And 500 tonight on Facebook

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
That's exactly what we're talking about

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
I know 500 was Jim Sally, I don't know where 499 came from

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
But thank you whoever that was

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
And whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Help us spread the word, word of mouth

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
And all that stuff especially

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
And as well

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
As you know from behind the scenes stuff

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
There will be easier and more ways

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
To spread that word soon enough

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Uh huh, very true, very true

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
We've seen things

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
And also I want to say

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Next week is

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
The 10 year anniversary

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Please help spread the word

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Such as the Twitter comment I read earlier

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Just I would really love to hear

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
From the folks from OLR's past

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
The Skype line will be open

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
In about an hour after the show

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
To take your calls and messages

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
Uh if you have anything you want to leave

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
For us to play next week

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
I'm really looking forward to it

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
And um

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
I kind of can't believe it

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
That's why we haven't said much about it

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
We kind of can't believe it, it's been 10 years

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Shit, we are old

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
It's our 10th anniversary

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
We'll be back next week to celebrate

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
10 years of Orange Lounge Radio

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Until then, don't be a dick

02:58:38.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Be safe, see you next time

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
See you next week

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
See you next time
