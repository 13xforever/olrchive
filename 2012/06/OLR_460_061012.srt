1
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:23,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 10th, 2012, E3 2012 has come to a close and we discussed the highlights, the lowlights, and everything in between with our live audience.

3
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Loki in the mid lights too.

4
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:50,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio live as we always are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at VOG Network, the Voice of Geeks Network.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,444
[SPEAKER_12]: VOGnetwork.com is where you can go and if you click on live chat, you can chat live with us, the hosts of

7
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:57,604
[SPEAKER_12]: of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,465
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:04,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and, of course, this week, the Big E3 Expo with my co-host.

10
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,468
[SPEAKER_12]: First up, Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura.

11
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:07,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

12
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you were giving my salad the sting eye.

13
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:12,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to figure out what was in it.

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, is that avocado?

15
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:14,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's avocado.

16
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:17,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I made, basically, avocado mango salsa.

17
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:17,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

18
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And put it over fresh greens.

19
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:23,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Just, you know, green things are always kind of the, hmm.

20
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:24,315
[SPEAKER_02]: with goat cheese on top.

21
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:25,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all raw.

22
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:25,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

23
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And delicious.

24
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I am back to eating raw food.

25
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,219
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Not vegan, mind you.

27
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:31,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Not vegan.

28
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,114
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you do raw food without being vegan?

29
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Sashimi.

30
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

31
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:36,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Fish.

32
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And beef tataki.

33
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:38,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

34
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:41,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And raw milk cheese and raw milk.

35
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,280
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And yogurt.

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have fermented things, too.

38
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:45,762
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

39
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's also go over to Tech Master Loki.

40
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:49,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

41
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:54,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Who will probably talk about his very non-raw food diet of McDonald's.

42
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I had pop chips, I think that falls somewhere in between the two of you

43
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:22,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had dinner before I came to this show, and then I picked that up on the way, because I was still kind of hungry.

44
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:32,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to stop at Burger King, but there was a bunch of car crashes right in front of the turn to turn into the shopping center with the Burger King.

45
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, ah, come on.

46
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:35,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Party at Burger King.

47
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,112
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's probably stupid people in the light rail.

48
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:42,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever happened to parties at Burger King?

49
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:48,095
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was young, and this might be dating myself a bit here, but people used to have their birthday parties at McDonald's and Burger King.

50
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:48,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that still a thing?

51
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

52
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:51,937
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all Chuck E. Cheese now?

53
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck E. Cheese was... That's not food either.

54
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:59,062
[SPEAKER_02]: However, sometimes they have good games.

55
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,024
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is the shittiest pizza anywhere.

56
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, it's still okay.

57
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know who started Pizza Time Theater, right?

58
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

59
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:08,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And crap, now I forgot his name.

60
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:09,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari dude.

61
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, Nolan Bushnell.

62
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

63
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't he start a place in Woodland Hills not that long ago?

64
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's still open.

65
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,294
[SPEAKER_12]: It was about a year or two ago.

66
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to the original Chuck E. Cheese way back.

67
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,337
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the coolest one, too.

68
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:20,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

69
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Like two stories?

70
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a two-story slide.

71
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,700
[SPEAKER_10]: It had the full animatronic band.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was great.

73
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:26,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

74
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:38,684
[SPEAKER_02]: In Mobile, where I'm from, we had a massive Chuck E. Cheese slash Showtime pizza that had the party room with the hippo girl in it who played a piano.

75
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

76
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alan said he remembered that.

77
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:54,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had the big party room with the full band and the room that you go into to go to the bathroom that's all LED lights on the wall that would give me a seizure.

78
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:54,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: and the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.

80
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

81
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:10,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Chuck E. Cheese in a way is almost responsible, I mean for real, for me being like so into video games because I remember, I distinctly remember going when I was three or four years old, it was my sister's wedding reception and

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:33,839
[SPEAKER_12]: for some reason was at Chuck E. Cheese that's awesome no no no wait no no I think it was like the after reception reception like it was like the real reception was at the Elk Lodge but then like the wedding party and the families was more for the kids so they I think my sister was like let's do something for Rob and the kids and so because my sister was is 16 years older than I am so that's why like I'm I'm four and she's like 20 getting married right

83
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,880
[SPEAKER_12]: We all went to Chuck E. Cheese.

84
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,741
[SPEAKER_12]: People ask, what is one of your earliest memories?

85
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:50,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I distinctly remember Crystal Castles and the trackball and the little box that they used to have to bring over that you could stand on so I could be a four-year-old playing Crystal Castles.

86
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,847
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to sit down pole position.

87
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:52,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

88
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:58,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they closed the big Chuck E. Cheese, they actually moved the same pole position cabinet to the newer Chuck E. Cheese.

89
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:04,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did, as an adult, go back and play the exact same one I played as a small kid.

90
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,163
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's go to our chat room.

91
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Travis last night, we have thevognetwork.com as well.

92
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:26,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

93
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,564
[SPEAKER_12]: You can also access at thevognetwork.com.

94
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:35,888
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe, I don't know, I might get a hand slap from Bobby for making this public, but I know you registered it.

95
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Voiceofgeeks.com also works.

96
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

97
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Several ways you can get to our website.

98
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:45,814
[SPEAKER_12]: We prefer vognetwork.com, but you can also do thevognetwork.com.

99
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:52,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to our chat room, Vince Raven is in our chat room saying, is this a pre-recorded show or live?

100
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:54,837
[SPEAKER_12]: It must be live because I just read your name.

101
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,377
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

102
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:56,978
[SPEAKER_12]: We are live tonight.

103
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it was taped last week.

104
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,139
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as pre-recording.

105
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,600
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just recording.

106
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,440
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they say.

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the buzzword.

108
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:08,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It's voiceofgeeks.com, not voiceofgeeksnetwork.com.

109
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, it's voiceofgeeks.com.

110
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:11,083
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

111
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:16,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And some folks in the chat room are hand slapping there for me.

112
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:17,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

113
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:23,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, some folks reminiscing about Showbiz Pizza, which I believe was the Chuck E. Cheese of the East Coast.

114
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,689
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of the same thing and they merge.

115
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Black Wolf is in there saying, Showbiz Pizza where a kid can be a kid.

116
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now it's where a kid can get shot.

117
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:37,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you read some of the crazy things that happened at Chuck E. Cheese on Yahoo and news and all that stuff, but they got an image problem.

118
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,496
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

119
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:03,881
[SPEAKER_12]: We have folks, I see Rob from Girls Gone Wow from the UK is listening tonight.

120
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:08,143
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw Clover Nikon, who I believe is from Australia, is listening tonight.

121
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,985
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got like an international group here tonight.

122
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:16,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Now here I am talking about our little hometown of Sacramento, but there used to be this place called the Mindshaft.

123
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,369
[SPEAKER_12]: That place was the shit.

124
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's like an abandoned RV.

125
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:22,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, now it's like a scary place.

126
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,831
[SPEAKER_12]: But you used to go underground to start the miniature golf.

127
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,691
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a two-story arcade.

128
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:29,772
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome.

129
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:34,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And then right before it closed, it had a dance club in the basement.

130
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:39,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was commonly known as the Mormon Dance Club because I guess the mineshaft was owned by Mormons.

131
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the Mormon Dance Club...

132
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know how that works, but I just know that's what everybody calls it.

133
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:54,764
[SPEAKER_10]: We did go there one summer, like, you know, just, ah, we'll go play miniature golf there, because I've never really been there before, like, and man, it was run down.

134
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,406
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty bad.

135
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,828
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Morpheus is reminding me about Samstown, too.

136
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:00,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Samstown was awesome.

137
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,891
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn, we had some great entertainment.

138
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:08,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure wherever you're from, in your hometown, you used to have these great entertainment places that have probably all shut down.

139
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan, were there any awesome ones in the Bay Area that I'm not thinking of?

140
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,470
[SPEAKER_12]: He's ignoring me.

141
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

142
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, he's shaking his head.

143
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we had in Mobile?

144
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still there and it's changed names, but it used to be called Mount Asia.

145
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:26,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a huge, like, multi-level mini-golf, but it had a great arcade.

146
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I played Trog for the first time.

147
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hooked on that game.

148
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:58,302
[SPEAKER_10]: the only thing notable I can remember in the East Bay was in Concord there was a big Malibu Grand Prix which had the RC cars and then a huge arcade but it closed when I was like 7 so I barely remember it they still have some in Scandia I love, not necessarily our Scandia our Scandia went, I don't know what happened to our Scandia it's just weird but like the other Scandias they still have the old arcades and stuff they're kind of cool, they still have that vibe they have the go-karts and miniature golf and that kind of stuff

149
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss retro arcades I wish that's why I loved Flynn's Arcade at Disneyland and we weren't here last week because I made another trip to Disneyland and so I got to see Electronica's replacement which is the Mad Tea Party now I didn't see the actual party because we were there on weekdays but I saw the decorations and it pained me to see Flynn's Arcade just gone just totally gone the front had been replaced with something else that wasn't even really themed for Alice in Wonderland just made me sad

150
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,718
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:48,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Vognetwork.com, our official site has launched.

152
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:59,208
[SPEAKER_12]: If you visited it back in May when we first established the network with Bobby and Understation Live, we had kind of a temporary site there that was just one page with the chat room taking up the whole page.

153
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:05,393
[SPEAKER_12]: The full site is now available and if you haven't been able to take a look at it, I really encourage you to go because...

154
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:11,798
[SPEAKER_12]: In one week, and I'm not just saying this because it's part of my idea, the whole site.

155
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,780
[SPEAKER_12]: But in one week, we've accomplished so much.

156
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really proud.

157
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:20,404
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of that is the very hard work that Bobby's been putting in on the programming side of it.

158
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,386
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's been a lot of hard work on the content side too.

159
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:29,271
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some great authors for editorials that we picked up thanks to Twitter shoutouts.

160
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeff, I know, is one of them, and Elliot.

161
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,133
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been writing some great stuff for the site.

162
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not just video game stuff, too.

163
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, it's the Voice of Geeks Network, so we have articles on Indiana Jones.

164
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,618
[SPEAKER_12]: We have articles on, of course, Minecraft, and there's some other things, too.

165
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:45,600
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a wide variety of things.

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, right before the show, I was asking Ramal, who are these people that are writing stuff for our site?

167
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:51,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know.

168
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't recognize these people.

169
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:55,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Twitter's a powerful thing.

170
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Elliot's been following me on Twitter for a while.

171
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:10,056
[SPEAKER_12]: He's based out of the UK and he sent me a direct message that took me like three weeks to respond to because my Twitter app was acting up but he already did some writing I think for either a high school or a college paper and I was like, alright, you want to write for us?

172
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool, let's see it.

173
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:12,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And he did that.

174
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:20,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeff came in from, this is really cool, Video Game Outsiders retweeted us when I put, or retweeted me I should say when I put the call out for...

175
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:39,887
[SPEAKER_12]: uh authors which by the way let me just really quick really quickly say the fact that we're all like supportive of each other I love video game outsiders and you know I know they they sent the retweet for me and everything I hope this dispels the whole there's an all games and VOG network war

176
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,408
[SPEAKER_12]: and they're a fightin' and it's civil frickin' war.

177
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:44,848
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

178
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:46,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Let it go and stop it.

179
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop spreading those rumors.

180
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Let them do their thing and be great.

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Let us do our thing and also be great because if we're both great, everybody wins.

182
00:11:56,211 --> 00:12:01,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, Jeff came in through that retweet and his stuff's been great.

183
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:05,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Loki, you say you've been reading that stuff and it's really funny and it's good.

184
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:05,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Good stuff.

185
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:13,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, going to our chat room again at live.vognetwork.com.

186
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:17,380
[SPEAKER_12]: A little more reminiscing there and some talk about E3 as well.

187
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:23,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft is teasing that some of the content from Orange Launch Radio, I love this song, is coming this week to VOG Network.

188
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,025
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, it's going to be growing.

189
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:28,508
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you haven't checked out vognetwork.com, please do.

190
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,329
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just the station.

191
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,509
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the articles.

192
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:39,172
[SPEAKER_12]: And most importantly, the big thing that was announced the Friday before was that it's all a game.

193
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,492
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually sign up.

194
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,773
[SPEAKER_12]: You can find loot places on the site.

195
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:48,975
[SPEAKER_12]: So EJ from Girls Gone Wow, continuing our conversation from a couple weeks ago, there's your loot.

196
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:53,757
[SPEAKER_12]: You can check it out over there on the site and you can get loot.

197
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:57,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't tell you how you get loot, but I'll tell you one of them is really easy.

198
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Like sign up for the website easy and you get loot.

199
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,902
[SPEAKER_12]: You can comment on articles, thumbs up.

200
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:09,364
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually, if you notice, Bobby posted a review of, I'm going to mess up the name of this.

201
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,425
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Jam Music Band or something like that.

202
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,986
[SPEAKER_12]: This just came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

203
00:13:13,346 --> 00:13:14,366
[SPEAKER_12]: He wrote a review of that.

204
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:18,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can actually write a review that agrees or disagrees.

205
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:27,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And your review, if approved by the original author, which they're not going to disapprove it just because you disagree with them, will show up right underneath the original review.

206
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:28,369
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty cool.

207
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:30,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can kind of have your own say.

208
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I disagree because X, Y, Z. So pretty cool.

209
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,571
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have more stuff like that come to the site in the next few weeks.

210
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,411
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah.

211
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:39,351
[SPEAKER_12]: VOG Network.com.

212
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:45,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, Orange House Radio listeners, if you haven't checked out the website since the placeholder that was there last month, so much has changed.

213
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:45,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Check it out.

214
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:50,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go back into games and talking about E3.

215
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:57,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And before we get into our own gaming week and the stuff we've been playing as we usually start the show off with, I know we're going to do a lot of recapping about E3 tonight.

216
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:04,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to talk about this topic that's been brought up that's kind of hovering over the air.

217
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:07,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is the question of, is E3 still relevant?

218
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:16,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, the ESA was very quick to defend that question, basically, that was asked by saying, of course it's still relevant.

219
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:21,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have the quote in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing, of course.

220
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:29,159
[SPEAKER_12]: But all the attention is on Los Angeles this week, and it's still the place to have games shown and be covered and be exposed to the world.

221
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,359
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the place to be.

222
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,001
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's a lot of people that are saying, well, you know, in this day and age of the Internet...

223
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:39,822
[SPEAKER_12]: and where everything kind of goes to Spike TV the first day or G4 hits the internet.

224
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:43,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it really that important to be there live and in person?

225
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:48,624
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to ask those in studio, especially considering this year E3 was a bit different for us personally.

226
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:51,804
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the first year at Orange Lounge Radio in quite some time.

227
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:52,965
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't really cover it.

228
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:54,605
[SPEAKER_12]: None of us went.

229
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,705
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me ask that question.

230
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Is E3 still relevant?

231
00:14:59,726 --> 00:14:59,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki?

232
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:12,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's still relevant because they have a lot of great games being shown there, but they've kind of made it really difficult for... Well, they've always made it kind of difficult for independent coverage of E3.

233
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:28,429
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of having to cover the... You don't get invited to the press events, so you cover the feed from Spike TV or something like that, and you make your comments off of that, which works just fine because it's...

234
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,189
[SPEAKER_10]: you get to see the same stuff pretty much except you don't get to actually play any of it

235
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:36,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

236
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:43,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for the gaming industry, I think it's not necessarily the greatest thing for them.

237
00:15:43,438 --> 00:16:02,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just because a lot of companies are being hit financially pretty hard and they can't afford to have these really huge booths and spend millions of dollars on the stuff like THQ, for example, not at E3 because they can't afford to spend money on that kind of stuff right now.

238
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,871
[SPEAKER_10]: They have jobs at stake and...

239
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,754
[SPEAKER_10]: and their own companies, so they can't do that.

240
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:19,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that as far as saying, oh, E3 is the place to go for game news and to see the games and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily the case.

241
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, it is a place to go.

242
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:25,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely something that people look forward to, but there's also other conventions out there.

243
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:29,548
[SPEAKER_10]: There's PAX, which is definitely getting a lot of coverage for games and stuff.

244
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:30,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I mean...

245
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:40,212
[SPEAKER_10]: You can scale down your booth size a bit and show the same type of stuff there, and I think still get the same kind of press coverage that they're getting with E3.

246
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:48,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, they're not doing these huge keynote events and stuff like that, but I still think it's a good way to get your game covered.

247
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:57,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, in the day and age of the internet, there's also companies just launching their own games on Kickstarter or through other means, and they can get press coverage that way or...

248
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:23,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I don't think press is necessarily a problem, because people were probably talking about Madden and Assassin's Creed and stuff like that beforehand, but now it's just, hey, look, we've got a bunch of people showing off Assassin's Creed at the Sony press conference, at the Ubisoft press conference, and at the Xbox press conference, and at the Nintendo press conference, because they only showed Ubisoft games...

249
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,363
[SPEAKER_10]: because a lot of them just thought they were so awesome.

250
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:31,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I could see how they could come to that conclusion.

251
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:31,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

252
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I just... I'm just jealous I didn't get to go.

253
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:51,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to play some more games, but honestly, digesting it through just reading other sites' covering and stuff, I feel that I kind of took in more information than if I were to be stumbling around because it seems like every time I'd go to E3, it would be like, oh, hey...

254
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:59,694
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this really cool game and I didn't get to see it because I completely was unaware that they had talked about it or it was announced or something like that.

255
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:04,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just never made it over to that booth because I wanted to go see something I was aware of beforehand.

256
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

257
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:10,451
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is important to be there in person if you can.

258
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I always enjoy the experience.

259
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:50,967
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live I'm reading like comments from other shows tonight but that's alright it's a network DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live says I said it during Bobby's show but I see South by Southwest becoming the dominant game showcase in a couple of years that's a very interesting prediction because South by Southwest is the place where things like Foursquare really took off and I don't know if you view Foursquare as a game but if you look at VOG Network as a game South by Southwest would probably be our show right?

260
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:54,649
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an interesting perspective, especially with the technology and everything.

261
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Except Foursquare kind of sucks.

262
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:59,852
[SPEAKER_12]: But think of all the clones that exist.

263
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:00,813
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, think of it this way.

264
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Facebook basically jacked Foursquare.

265
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

266
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:09,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then again, one could argue, okay, Grant, I better get this out or I'll get corrected.

267
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:13,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Google Latitude was kind of also before all of that, but...

268
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:20,884
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that was, if I got my tech history right, that was Dodgeball, and the Dodgeball guy started Foursquare.

269
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:22,445
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gone cross-eyed.

270
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,707
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, these big conventions just kind of seem pointless to me.

271
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:26,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

272
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:40,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they really wanted to get reviews and get the press information out there, they would go to like a virtual format, you know, VE3 or something, and send out demos directly to the press.

273
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just wasting time and money.

274
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:02,612
[SPEAKER_12]: WhatUpG in our chat says, the only thing you don't get from not being at E3 is any hands-on time.

275
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:13,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I remember a couple years ago when they did a lot of demos, not all of them, obviously, but quite a handful of demos were available on Xbox Live as they were there at the show.

276
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:13,878
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty awesome.

277
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:23,503
[SPEAKER_10]: 2006 was the year that they did that, and they had MotoGP and Lost Planet, and there was one other one, but I don't remember what it was.

278
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,704
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.

279
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,446
[SPEAKER_10]: E3 at home is basically, hey, you know what?

280
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:29,547
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that you can't go to E3.

281
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's some of the E3 demos that are available right now.

282
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't they do that anymore?

283
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:38,434
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good way to get information out about your game.

284
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,336
[SPEAKER_10]: But I understand people are like, oh, it's not finished.

285
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:41,916
[SPEAKER_10]: But who cares?

286
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:42,677
[SPEAKER_10]: You just put that up.

287
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:45,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, unfinished game, but you get to check out the demo for it.

288
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadownext, JenJuz bring up an interesting point in our chat.

289
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:50,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Sending out demos to the press wouldn't necessarily work.

290
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Not everyone has debug units that can play the early code.

291
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:56,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's a part of it that the code isn't ready for that live environment.

292
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:57,233
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a difference.

293
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually prepare demos that have taken care of hiding any errors and are programmed for certain time limits.

294
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:06,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Some companies are sick of doing that.

295
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:07,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember reading an article on that.

296
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:15,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Some companies are thinking that E3 demos are actually not a waste of their time, but it's taking away time from developing for the game.

297
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, why have E3 at all?

298
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't see it being relevant anymore.

299
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:26,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to other comments in our chatroom, Dartetsuya says, we totally need VOG Con.

300
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream big, maybe someday, dream big.

301
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:34,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, and Tigerclaw notices that I am on PlayStation Home right now.

302
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:35,766
[SPEAKER_12]: That is correct.

303
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:39,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Over there on the TV, look, I'm sitting next to Tigerclaw on the couch.

304
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:45,347
[SPEAKER_12]: I am in PlayStation Home, and I wanna pimp the new VOG Network Clubhouse.

305
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you have your PlayStation nearby, fire it up,

306
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:52,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Search in the clubhouses for VOG and you'll get VOG Network in all caps.

307
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,875
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully, oh, it looks like Blender left, but hopefully he'll be back and he can accept more apps into the clubhouse.

308
00:21:57,895 --> 00:21:59,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And I gotta say, Blender did a great job with the clubhouse.

309
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even know they had new ones now.

310
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:05,101
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got this whole desert, I think it's called the Desert Penthouse or something.

311
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,282
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a little pool.

312
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at all those arcade games he's got in there.

313
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And the couch totally looks like it's floating.

314
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

315
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:13,448
[SPEAKER_12]: So, anyhow.

316
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:17,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, notice Tigerclaw and I are sitting on the couch, but not too close together.

317
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:18,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Not too close.

318
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice doodly distance apart.

319
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

320
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not believe that that's actually home.

321
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:26,248
[SPEAKER_10]: No one is doing The Running Man.

322
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hey, DDR Machine.

323
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a DDR Machine?

324
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:30,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Get out.

325
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:34,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like a little DDR Machine over there.

326
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that is a DDR Machine.

327
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:43,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, speaking of home, they have the whole virtual, you know, not to, you know, I mentioned Xbox a minute ago, but they do their whole virtual Sony booth.

328
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Granted, it's not the same as being there, but it's kind of a neat little tie-in.

329
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:53,125
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it kind of, again, there's always that question of what the hell's the point of home?

330
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,647
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you see something like that, you kind of go, oh, that is pretty cool.

331
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

332
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you ever look at the virtual booth in home?

333
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen pictures of it.

334
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been to home for a long time.

335
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually haven't ever used home.

336
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you gotta check it out.

337
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:09,210
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of neat there.

338
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing on my PC.

339
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:15,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Tigerclaw is fulfilling the running man quota here.

340
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,860
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

341
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta say, this may be the reason to bring a live webcam back to the show.

342
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:26,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't have the cam on us, but put the cam in Sony Home.

343
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys can look at that while we broadcast.

344
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:31,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I seriously might do that.

345
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:32,703
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good idea.

346
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:33,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Go me.

347
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Brainstorming live on air.

348
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Mister, I'm gonna keep the webcam.

349
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:38,904
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have the webcam.

350
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:39,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, here's the webcam.

351
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:40,464
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

352
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:41,004
[SPEAKER_12]: All yours.

353
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a blast.

354
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought you had your video camera hooked up.

355
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,979
[SPEAKER_12]: That died, sadly.

356
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That $400 camera died.

357
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,683
[SPEAKER_12]: That's part of the reason we haven't had video in a while.

358
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:53,425
[SPEAKER_12]: That webcam isn't the best resolution.

359
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:53,705
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

360
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:56,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think that my camera still works.

361
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:56,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah?

362
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've never tried it as a webcam.

363
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to convert all of those Disneyland movies.

364
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think my Panasonic still works.

365
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an HD camcorder that I'm not using at all.

366
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:08,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

367
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

368
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll come back to E3 in just a moment.

369
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:17,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki's going to wrap up the whole thing for us and we're going to give our witty insight and commentary.

370
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:23,237
[SPEAKER_12]: First off though, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

371
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:24,158
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

372
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:24,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I played stuff.

373
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:25,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I played stuff.

374
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:26,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you did.

375
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am so proud of you.

376
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a bunch of Mass Effect until I decided that I really would rather play it on the PC.

377
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:38,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hate the targeting system so much.

378
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hurts my hand to try to retarget.

379
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kept dying when I found Counselor Troi.

380
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:44,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.

381
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: The matriarch.

382
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:46,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

383
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:51,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I swear, she must have been on some pretty nasty PMS.

384
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:56,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so yeah, all of the Asari commandos whooped my ass.

385
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to play on PC instead, and I've remade my FemShep and totally going after Garrus.

386
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:02,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

387
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:03,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't judge me.

388
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Another one indoctrinated, ladies and gentlemen.

389
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:06,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

390
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:08,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some WoW.

391
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

392
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:09,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Addict.

393
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:11,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Dealer.

394
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:11,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Dealer.

395
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you are the game pimp, okay?

396
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:17,708
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

397
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,290
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to kind of blame Shane for that, really, though.

398
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,676
[SPEAKER_12]: That was just like, that's like the whole, like, this is like, Mass Effect is now this Tupperware pyramid scheme.

399
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:31,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And Shane is kind of like the regional director, and he got me hooked.

400
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:37,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, in an attempt to, you know, get my free toaster, I got DarkSakura hooked.

401
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:38,728
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pyramid scheme.

402
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:39,288
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

403
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,149
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pyramid scheme.

404
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:44,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and I want to point out, Tigerclaw totally moved closer to me on that couch.

405
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:44,890
[SPEAKER_12]: You see that?

406
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still a doodly distance.

407
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:47,891
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a doodly distance.

408
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:53,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think that's the... That's the appropriate distance for dudes to be apart.

409
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,394
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the programmed distance away.

410
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:58,414
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where your hitbox is.

411
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I also played... I did play WoW.

412
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put a picture of this on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

413
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play WoW.

414
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:06,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

415
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:23,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started another MMO just because of Iguana Girl, of Jessica Harper, who has said, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, so finally I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try, you know, because I'm a little bored with WoW because other people are playing Diablo all the damn time, shut up.

416
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:26,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the Pyramid Head scheme, pfft.

417
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:56,702
[SPEAKER_02]: um so I started playing Lord of the Rings online and it's actually not bad um it's very pretty I actually prefer it graphically to well um lots of lots of fun in-depth stuff I really like how it more mirrors the books and you know without Tolkien's horrible horrible writing I'm sorry you spend we spend five pages describing the landscape and like half a paragraph describing the people you're talking about that's not good writing

418
00:26:57,943 --> 00:27:03,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm probably going to hell in the minds of lots of Tolkien fans, but I don't care.

419
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:07,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play a little Diablo, by the way.

420
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:14,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually, you know, I've only played, I'm only a level 8 character right now in Lord of the Rings.

421
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: it's enough that I've gotten kind of a grasp that number one I like the camera in WoW better but I like the scenery and the graphics in Lord of the Rings better I do have to say that WoW has better water effects just saying um

422
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:35,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, when I had it optimized, it basically lets me run the game at full settings.

423
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:39,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had some lag today, but for the most part, it actually runs pretty smoothly.

424
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:54,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I've basically had some problems with some kill stealing, so I don't like that my targets aren't locked, but you know, what can you do?

425
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:55,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

426
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the free part.

427
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:57,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The free's good.

428
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:00,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played some STO this week, by the way.

429
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to play Dabo at Deep Space Nine.

430
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:07,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been MMOing it up.

431
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been.

432
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:09,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like a little whore here.

433
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not a whore because I'm paying.

434
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:15,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody clip that little phrase and send it to Travis.

435
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:16,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Momo slut.

436
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:18,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Momo slut.

437
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing the field.

438
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:28,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if guys can do it and are lauded for it, then a woman should be able to be lauded for spreading herself out a little bit too.

439
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:29,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

440
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:31,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Double standard here.

441
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:32,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Double standard.

442
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,747
[SPEAKER_10]: He was writing his show for him.

443
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:33,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like,

444
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitches.

445
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So... And I have also decided... I played the Minecraft demo.

446
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,534
[SPEAKER_02]: The freebie version that's on the website.

447
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:47,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Hated it!

448
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

449
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,694
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm playing it in windowed mode and it gives me a little bit more to focus on other things.

450
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Turned off the motion blur, turned off the fill grain.

451
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:19,318
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that, it still made me sick.

452
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to say it, but I do get motion sickness with Lord of the Rings because of the camera.

453
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:28,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like, you know how in WoW the camera auto-adjusts when you're running?

454
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:36,494
[SPEAKER_02]: In Lord of the Rings, you can actually turn your camera around, you can watch yourself sideways, but you're still moving forward with W. Right?

455
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:54,160
[SPEAKER_02]: if that makes sense so I'll try to hit sideways because that's the direction on my screen is trying to run and my camera is oriented the other way so it's more or less I guess a little bit of user error but I still would prefer that auto orienting and I don't know if I have a way to turn that on

456
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,541
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's got this full cosmetic thing.

457
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:00,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, not necessarily like transmogging.

458
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, I really like the transmogging system.

459
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:06,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really have to think about what you want.

460
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:10,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like the cosmetic system.

461
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get clothes dye and everything.

462
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:15,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And crafting is better.

463
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, crafting is so much easier.

464
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:19,806
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

465
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm about even.

466
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, WoW is still, thanks, sorry, you know, I still like WoW.

467
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I signed the blood pact, I'm not quitting.

468
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:35,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And Pandaria may kind of, you know, WoW is really a lull for a lot of people now.

469
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:37,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a goat monk so bad.

470
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:51,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the one thing that really, and I decided this today, the really big thing that Lord of the Rings does not have going for it, no true caster DPS class.

471
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,933
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a hunter, that's your only real dedicated DPS class.

472
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:56,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know me, I like the pew-pew.

473
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:57,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I have what?

474
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: A mage, a druid, a shadow priest, you know, on WoW.

475
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I play Caster Pew Pew.

476
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:09,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if that popped up on Lord of the Rings, I'll know that might, that might pull me over permanently.

477
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

478
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:12,141
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

479
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like free.

480
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:13,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say I like free?

481
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I like free.

482
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,062
[SPEAKER_12]: The MMO queen has spoken.

483
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:17,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming?

484
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ragnarok Online.

485
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:20,204
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your gaming week?

486
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I played mostly Minecraft.

487
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:26,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I started by building an artificial volcano.

488
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:35,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I took the largest mountain in this one area and then I built on top of it all the way up to the top of the skybox.

489
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I covered the whole thing with obsidian because I had duped a bunch of obsidian.

490
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:46,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I poured some lava over the top of that.

491
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,345
[SPEAKER_10]: and got too much lava.

492
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:50,305
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a ton of lava on there.

493
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:54,627
[SPEAKER_10]: You put that in the wrong spot and it'll just spread like crazy.

494
00:31:55,027 --> 00:32:00,409
[SPEAKER_10]: So I finally took care of that and got it a little bit more situated to how I like it.

495
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,051
[SPEAKER_10]: And then started to hollow the whole inside off.

496
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:10,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually it's kind of cool because the whole thing is actually the Shrine of Fire because there is fire all over the place.

497
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:12,554
[SPEAKER_10]: There's lava fountains on the inside.

498
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,055
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just ridiculous.

499
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:14,695
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

500
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:44,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So you had the shrine to fire in your basement in Animal Crossing.

501
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,390
[SPEAKER_12]: You had the shrine to fire in Minecraft.

502
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,411
[SPEAKER_12]: What game do I make the shrine to fire in?

503
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:49,652
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I need to figure out.

504
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:50,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Also Minecraft?

505
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:51,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

506
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:52,113
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

507
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:53,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that just reminds me of something.

508
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:57,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have a house in Lord of the Rings and I might build a shrine to fire there.

509
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:58,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

510
00:32:58,897 --> 00:32:59,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Just don't burn down your house.

511
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss MOG houses.

512
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Rob, I miss MOG houses.

513
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too.

514
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow needs houses.

515
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:04,782
[SPEAKER_12]: They do.

516
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:05,223
[SPEAKER_12]: They do.

517
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:05,543
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

518
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:09,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than me just pretending that my goat lives in the back room of the tavern.

519
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the man finish his game in a week so we can get to E3.

520
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:12,829
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to get the rest of the damn show.

521
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:18,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, so other than, yeah, I've just been playing Minecraft for the most of it.

522
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:28,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cool, though, because unbeknownst to me, there was a dungeon in the middle of that mountain that I built the volcano on.

523
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have this dungeon that's going to be in the bottom of this giant fortress to fire.

524
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll be able to fight mobs down there.

525
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:37,445
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of cool.

526
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:39,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll be playing a little bit more of that this week.

527
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:39,586
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

528
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:11,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I do find it funny that sometimes I'll be inside the volcano thing like hollowing it out and I'll hear a cow catching fire because it was stupid and walked into the lava.

529
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:12,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of funny.

530
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:18,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other game I played, ironically, was an Atari 2600 game.

531
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:25,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's an Atari 2600 game that's exclusive to the contest I'm playing, which is for Ready Player One.

532
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:32,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if everyone heard, but Ready Player One, the wonderful book they keep talking about, they have an Easter egg hidden in the book.

533
00:34:33,306 --> 00:35:01,032
[SPEAKER_10]: and they have a contest now that goes along with that easter egg you find the easter egg, takes you to a website you play this Atari 2600 game you find the easter egg in that, takes you to the next website which the game unlocks there July 1st and then you play through that game, then you get increasingly harder and the next game unlocks August 1st, kind of like the real hunt except there is a real prize the real prize is a DeLorean a DeLorean with a replica flux capacitor inside it that is being given away

534
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:03,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Which sounds all kinds of amazing.

535
00:35:03,456 --> 00:35:03,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

536
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,477
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes me want to get into this book series.

537
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:12,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So I found the Easter egg after a little bit of a hint from online.

538
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone mentioned that you have to look for a certain... Because I was looking through the book.

539
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really get a chance to look at it the first day and stuff.

540
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:23,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I'm looking for a URL, but I didn't quite catch it.

541
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:27,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they mentioned, oh, well, you have to look for this type of thing that's with the letters.

542
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:28,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm like,

543
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:29,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, there it is.

544
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:29,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it.

545
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:34,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went and played the game, beat the game after Josh went to bed.

546
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:38,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't even make the top 100, though, on leaderboard.

547
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:43,176
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, it doesn't matter because each game is time unlocked.

548
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:46,038
[SPEAKER_10]: So the next game is not going to start until July 1st.

549
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,980
[SPEAKER_10]: and then the final game is August 1st.

550
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And really the contest is whoever has all three games completed first is the winner.

551
00:35:55,323 --> 00:36:02,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So how fast you are at the first game and second game doesn't really matter as long as you get the third game after completing the first two.

552
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:05,049
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as you're first in that.

553
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,890
[SPEAKER_10]: But Stax was kind of neat.

554
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,411
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a throwback to Pitfall.

555
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,432
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty hard.

556
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:12,012
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to...

557
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

558
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:36,848
[SPEAKER_10]: You're supposed to find six puzzle pieces, and then once you find the six puzzle pieces, you have to find the Easter egg in the game, which is very reminiscent to Adventure.

559
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:45,051
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once you find that, you go back to a certain room, and you find a QR code that unlocks the third place.

560
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:49,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's eventually where the game's going to unlock next.

561
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently people were aware of the website.

562
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:56,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been talking to Tetsuya about the whole thing since he's into the whole...

563
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:59,281
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Gamma kind of tried to help him out with the game.

564
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:03,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's like, oh, hey, I knew about that website way a long time ago.

565
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,714
[SPEAKER_10]: But it wasn't necessarily because of the Easter egg in the book.

566
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:08,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just it's kind of obvious what the website is.

567
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:12,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it was fun.

568
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,560
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of fun to get to play an old game.

569
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also fun to kind of participate in this real-life hunt thing.

570
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:23,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, if I win a DeLorean, I don't really know what I'm going to do with it since I don't know how to drive stick.

571
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:31,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's all the other stuff you don't think about, like paying taxes, registration, and all that stuff, and shipping the car to you.

572
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's expensive.

573
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:33,974
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a fucking DeLorean.

574
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,095
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have a fucking DeLorean.

575
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:35,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

576
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things are worth it.

577
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:43,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll that window down, fucking pop in the CD because it does have a CD player that the guy put in it.

578
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all Back to the Future soundtrack right there.

579
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:49,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Just blast that shit up the radio.

580
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,720
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

581
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:14,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't, you know, spend too much time talking about all of that since there wasn't a whole lot of gaming involved.

582
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:19,825
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will say that mummy ride at Universal Studios is fucking amazing.

583
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:20,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved it.

584
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:22,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Xtfer and I were screaming like girls.

585
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:25,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish somebody got a YouTube of it because you guys would have got a kick out of it.

586
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, on to games.

587
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:29,432
[SPEAKER_12]: When I got home, I did play some games.

588
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:39,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I played multiplayer Mass Effect a little bit this weekend because Osfer from our chat room and Acidic Vampire from our chat room and Shane from Horde House is also in chat room.

589
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,242
[SPEAKER_12]: We all are playing now and there's an event going on this weekend.

590
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:46,846
[SPEAKER_12]: We were having fun last night trying to survive a gold map.

591
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:47,566
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't go very well.

592
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:50,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, we got to wave five, maybe.

593
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:55,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Also did some multiplayer over on PlayStation 3 with another listener, Stan.

594
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:59,378
[SPEAKER_12]: We had kind of a crappy connection in Soul Calibur, so we were trying to do that.

595
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:02,152
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a dude with a lightsaber doing the Running Man.

596
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,693
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's Black Wolf.

597
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:05,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

598
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:07,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I got more dancing now.

599
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:09,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, two Running Men.

600
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:10,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's home!

601
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:15,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Blender signed into the clubhouse and I guess accepted all these new people, so there you go.

602
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,602
[SPEAKER_12]: We got VX, Jason, XV.

603
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:18,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyhow.

604
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, back to me.

605
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:27,289
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was multiplayer Soul Calibur, which sadly was too laggy, but Stan makes some hilarious characters.

606
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved his Mr. Slave.

607
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, people can get away with that in Soul Calibur.

608
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,353
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty risque, we'll just leave it at that.

609
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:41,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Then played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, which I, that's really Alan's game, not my game, so I was pretty much button mashing.

610
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:43,449
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, I was having some fun.

611
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:44,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Also on PlayStation.

612
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to the whole PlayStation Plus.

613
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:51,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Sony, for all those free freaking games this week.

614
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I realized... Are you borrowing my copy of LittleBigPlanet 2?

615
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:54,497
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

616
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:55,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

617
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:56,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

618
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,059
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

619
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have it anywhere.

620
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I didn't loan that to you yet.

621
00:39:59,301 --> 00:39:59,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think you did.

622
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:03,184
[SPEAKER_12]: So... What the hell is that shirt?

623
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:05,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like... Sorry, I'm distracted by... It's a DDR shirt.

624
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,087
[SPEAKER_12]: This is terrible radio.

625
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:07,607
[SPEAKER_12]: What...

626
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,819
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like he's not wearing pants or is that like a Minecraft bottom?

627
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,604
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I don't know.

628
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Blender, what the hell are you wearing?

629
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:20,846
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like he's not wearing pants and it's like a censored butt.

630
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:24,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, PlayStation games.

631
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:27,349
[SPEAKER_12]: LittleBigPlanet 2 was one of the free games.

632
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:32,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So finally, what, about two years late, I'm finally getting into LittleBigPlanet 2.

633
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,772
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great, obviously.

634
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:37,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the mini games.

635
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:40,134
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a great platformer.

636
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:50,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I've barely scratched the surface of the game to be honest but it's everything I loved about the first one now with you know grappling hooks from the very start and more cutscene stuff.

637
00:40:50,780 --> 00:41:17,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say the only thing I kind of didn't like is that the story is really weird in the beginning I like the more ambiguous nature of the first game which relied a lot heavier on the narrator and so forth now in this one they're trying to like build a different story and I'm not really into it but that's my one tiny tiny little bitch about it otherwise it's a little big planet and it's great and I really don't know why it took me so long to get into part two I really don't I don't have an excuse

638
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I was too busy playing Mass Effect.

639
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:20,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't really gotten into Part 2.

640
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I played maybe one level of it.

641
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:26,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just like, other game.

642
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was pretty much my gaming week.

643
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,745
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the free LittleBigPlanet 2, Mass Effect, wow, Diablo.

644
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:39,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a little Diablo with Shane, started a Witch Doctor, got it up to level like 6 or something.

645
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:40,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Enough to beat the beta.

646
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,592
[SPEAKER_12]: We got up to the Skeleton King and then I was like, I gotta go eat.

647
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:46,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed the crap out of the Skeleton King.

648
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:47,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually was hard.

649
00:41:48,328 --> 00:41:48,688
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.

650
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:49,328
[SPEAKER_12]: A little.

651
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:50,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

652
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Housekeeping real quick and then we'll get into E3 news.

653
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Join us on Facebook.

654

00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:00,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell friends about the show.

658
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:01,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Word of mouth.

659
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:03,893
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, again, we're not attached to a big magazine.

660
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:12,636
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope VOG Network.com will become all the rage someday and geeks everywhere will visit it and then we can say we have a big website behind us supporting us.

661
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,336
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell is that?

662
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:16,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

663
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:42,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It is one of the aliens.

664
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:57,619
[SPEAKER_12]: and Plenty more to come soon.

665
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:18,493
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's get into E3 news.

666
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:24,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki is going to be taking this over since I was away at Disneyland and not paying attention to my TV.

667
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:29,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to follow the news best I could, but Loki, you were on top of everything.

668
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:32,584
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's run down the various press conferences.

669
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,106
[SPEAKER_10]: The first people up were Microsoft.

670
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:43,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so Microsoft had their press conference, and it was kind of weird because they started off really strong because they showed Halo 4.

671
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you start off a fucking press conference.

672
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:45,495
Boom.

673
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:46,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 4!

674
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:47,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is!

675
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:48,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Get excited!

676
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other cool stuff that they showed off besides Halo.

677
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, there was the unveiling of Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was an Ubisoft game.

678
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:22,998
[SPEAKER_10]: That looked pretty awesome, so they had a little clip of that.

679
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, talking a little bit more about arcade games.

680
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:32,804
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the summer of arcade stuff.

681
00:44:33,024 --> 00:44:36,425
[SPEAKER_10]: They were talking about some of the games we can expect for that.

682
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:37,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, some interesting things.

683
00:44:37,986 --> 00:44:41,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Some that we already knew about and some that were kind of on the way.

684
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:47,629
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, they were talking Deadlight, which is going to be a new side-scroller game.

685
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:48,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be coming out.

686
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,171
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked kind of like a zombie survival horror type thing.

687
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:57,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, which is supposed to be out, I think, in a couple weeks.

688
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:11,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Dust and Elysian Tale was something that was actually supposed to be an indie game a while back but they ended up getting it published because it looks fucking amazing and

689
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:16,856
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

690
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:50,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Other things that they were talking about, of course, you know, entertainment was a big focus for Xbox since, you know, they were talking, you know, about making this like the center of entertainment for your household and stuff.

691
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, more app announcements, including, you know, partnerships with Nickelodeon, Paramount, Machima, or Machinima, I guess.

692
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:03,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Univision, Televiso, yes.

693
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:06,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah, until somebody on Twitter told me they were ending Sabado Gigante this year.

694
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:08,373
[SPEAKER_12]: That's sad.

695
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:15,077
[SPEAKER_10]: NHL and ESPN, of course, is getting some new stuff.

696
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:16,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Other game announcements.

697
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:20,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 4, Forza Horizon, Fable, Gears of War Judgment, Dance Central 3, Usher,

698
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:43,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, a new Nike fitness game is going to be coming out.

699
00:46:43,983 --> 00:46:46,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting, I guess.

700
00:46:47,444 --> 00:46:48,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Partnership with them.

701
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:53,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, Xbox Music was another big thing.

702
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:54,586
[SPEAKER_10]: They were talking about the entertainment thing.

703
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,027
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have 30 million tracks with that.

704
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:03,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, it's going to support some of the new features like Smart Glass, which was another big unveiling.

705
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:17,198
[SPEAKER_10]: SmartGlass is basically this technology where they can use any iOS, Android, I'm assuming Windows Phone, tablet, device, anything that you may have already.

706
00:47:18,158 --> 00:47:26,804
[SPEAKER_10]: You download an app for it and it becomes a second screen just like the Wii U or the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

707
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:33,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I was floored, personally, hearing that that's not exclusive to a Windows device.

708
00:47:33,545 --> 00:47:36,066
[SPEAKER_12]: That they are going to open that up to iPads and stuff.

709
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:36,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's smart.

710
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,326
[SPEAKER_12]: More people will adopt it.

711
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:41,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think, finally, Microsoft had to admit, you know what?

712
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:43,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Apple's got a big bite here.

713
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:48,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've seen Microsoft take little... Like, they dipped their foot in the pool.

714
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:52,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there's a fully functional Xbox Live app for iPhone and iPad.

715
00:47:53,129 --> 00:48:12,858
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a universal app that's actually quite good it's very similar to the xbox.com website you can manage your friends list from it you see your avatars like it's a full-fledged app so Microsoft doing stuff with Apple products is not unheard of but I did not think they were gonna just jump in the pool full in so this was a pleasant surprise

716
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:14,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones

717
00:48:35,485 --> 00:48:36,025
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

718
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:07,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, you'll be able to control your console using this as well.

719
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:09,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

720
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:16,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, long-awaited, finally announced, Internet Explorer is coming to the Xbox.

721
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:18,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will now have an Internet browser.

722
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:20,358
[SPEAKER_10]: It will support the smart glass stuff.

723
00:49:20,778 --> 00:49:28,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It will also be Kinect-enabled, and you'll be able to use voice commands to do searches and stuff like that.

724
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:31,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty cool.

725
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, but hey, whatever.

726
00:49:39,732 --> 00:49:41,914
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it's an option to browse the internet.

727
00:49:44,055 --> 00:49:45,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

728
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:48,297
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll get porn on my 360, so yay for that.

729
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:50,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox porn.

730
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:51,798
[SPEAKER_12]: What about emulators?

731
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:56,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we know if it's going to support Flash or Java or any of that?

732
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:57,401
[SPEAKER_12]: No idea.

733
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:03,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it isn't complete until you get Super Mario Brothers running on your Xbox.

734
00:50:03,444 --> 00:50:18,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they already technically have that reset glitched Xboxes and they have now the dual NAND reset glitch chips you can get where you have one mode that you can boot in that's, you know, hacked and one that's stock, so...

735
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Go into some comments from our chatroom at vognetwork.com.

736
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Osfer says, I can't wait for Halo 4.

737
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:30,571
[SPEAKER_12]: The Metroid atmosphere and look to it really pulled me in, and Cortana looks better and more emotionally charged than ever.

738
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:33,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard a lot of good things about it from people who were on the show floor.

739
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:36,135
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I gotta admit, I feel the same way.

740
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:40,958
[SPEAKER_12]: As much as I wasn't super-duper into the first-person Metroid games—well, that's not true, I did love Metroid Prime 3—

741
00:50:41,798 --> 00:51:06,909
[SPEAKER_12]: but I mean like just seeing that gameplay footage of Halo 4 for me sorry I'm going backwards but that's fine blame the chat room um I I was really into it I mean I and I haven't really cared about Halo since Halo 3 which you know once I played Halo 3 wasn't you know it didn't throw me the same way Halo 2 did but watching the Halo 4 I was like you know maybe the change in developers wasn't necessarily a bad thing because it forces them to kind of

742
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:09,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Start over with some new ideas.

743
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,911
[SPEAKER_12]: And you do see some of this other influence.

744
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,472
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's no disrespect towards Bungie.

745
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,472
[SPEAKER_12]: They made a great game.

746
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:17,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure whatever they've got, this Destiny thing is going to kick ass too.

747
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:19,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at it this way.

748
00:51:19,174 --> 00:51:21,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, look, you had people making Need for Speed games.

749
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:24,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And granted, the Need for Speed games are pretty good.

750
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:31,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you have another company, Criterion, making these Need for Speed games or making sequels to these Need for Speed games.

751
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:32,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're better.

752
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

753
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:40,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Not saying that the old ones weren't good, but now they have a fresh take on them, and so it's a little bit better.

754
00:51:43,665 --> 00:52:00,254
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing, kind of a rumor, but now those $99 contract Xboxes or whatever are coming to more retailers other than Microsoft stores because Microsoft, they kind of figured, hey, we don't have a lot of stores out there, so

755
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:18,173
[SPEAKER_10]: best buys and also select GameStop locations and from what I hear also from my boss meeting with Microsoft there's actually anybody's going to be able to do it as long as you're willing as long as you fit the criteria that they are looking for and there's like specific things that they need so

756
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:20,725
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, this was on the OLR Twitter last week.

757
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:21,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Just saying.

758
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:23,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes you get the secrets.

759
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:24,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Little secrets.

760
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:25,667
[SPEAKER_12]: What we can.

761
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:26,927
[SPEAKER_12]: What little secrets we get.

762
00:52:27,568 --> 00:52:28,228
[SPEAKER_10]: We will let you know.

763
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:31,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is all that stuff.

764
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, I think they had a decent press conference.

765
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:41,213
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of the people that were kind of... Oh, some other announcements that they made, of course.

766
00:52:41,853 --> 00:52:42,974
[SPEAKER_10]: and some of the stuff.

767
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, they showed Black Ops 2, a little bit of that.

768
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,418
[SPEAKER_10]: They announced that they're getting DLC first for that.

769
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:49,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with South Park.

770
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,342
[SPEAKER_10]: The Stick of Truth is getting DLC for it first.

771
00:52:53,382 --> 00:52:54,503
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming out March 5th now.

772
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:57,005
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have Kinect support as well on the 360.

773
00:52:57,426 --> 00:53:02,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomb Raider is getting the DLC first on Xbox and also Resident Evil 6 is getting DLC first on there.

774
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to say though, South Park, The Stick of Truth, fucking amazing looking.

775
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,654
[SPEAKER_10]: It is just, I cannot wait for that game.

776
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:10,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That game looks perfect.

777
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:10,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

778
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:16,018
[SPEAKER_12]: I really hope I'm not let down because sometimes trailers look good.

779
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks great.

780
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks great.

781
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, a lot of the complaints about the press conference were, hey, the whole entertainment stuff, hey, I'm here to see the games.

782
00:53:26,722 --> 00:53:33,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to see all this garbage about Nickelodeon and Paramount and Xbox music.

783
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:37,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't fucking care about Xbox music, but an okay press conference.

784
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:39,007
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

785
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:43,746
[SPEAKER_12]: So next up, how do you think overall Microsoft did?

786
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:48,012
[SPEAKER_12]: There were a lot of people online kind of razzing Microsoft, not fans of the press conference.

787
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:52,499
[SPEAKER_12]: But in a way, I was kind of like, well, what the hell did you expect this year?

788
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:54,662
[SPEAKER_12]: You knew you weren't going to be seeing the new Xbox.

789
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:55,303
[SPEAKER_12]: They said that.

790
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:56,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people were saying.

791
00:53:57,265 --> 00:53:58,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, because Destiny isn't being shown anymore.

792
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:01,249
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to have to give us hints about the new... No, they don't.

793
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,410
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to do it.

794
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,153
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll just show more Halo, which is probably what they did.

795
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:08,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they did show a Halo, and they showed some third-party stuff.

796
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:13,521
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I'm kind of surprised they didn't show anything for was Fable the Journey.

797
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:18,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much other than announcing that it's going to be coming out fourth quarter.

798
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:19,586
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't really show anything.

799
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:20,808
[SPEAKER_12]: That is interesting.

800
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:25,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, you know, I was hardcore thinking there was going to be something with Windows 8.

801
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:27,993
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess I was wrong there.

802
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:30,355
[SPEAKER_12]: But the smart glass thing, kind of.

803
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:32,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Smart glass is going to be... I get like a half point.

804
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:39,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I think smart glass... Well, smart glass also supports... Not only does it support tablet... Because not... Let's be honest.

805
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:40,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everybody has a tablet or a smartphone.

806
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:44,466
[SPEAKER_10]: It also does support computers, like PCs and laptops.

807
00:54:44,506 --> 00:54:47,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have a laptop, you can also control your Xbox.

808
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:48,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Although...

809
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:54,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked then, why the fuck do I need to view my content on the Xbox if I have my laptop in front of me?

810
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: But whatever.

811
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:56,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's another option.

812
00:54:57,036 --> 00:54:58,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes you have that party environment.

813
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,977
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to show multiple people at once.

814
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:06,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember that one New Year's Eve party where we were looking up on the Wii.

815
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:09,600
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to see the dinosaur porn.

816
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Or what was that?

817
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,821
[SPEAKER_12]: The pterodactyl porno.

818
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

819
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:14,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Wii Browser.

820
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:16,361
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fantastic.

821
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:23,792
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those websites, yes, it was a chick and some dude in a pterodactyl suit and it was the most hilarious thing.

822
00:55:23,812 --> 00:55:24,873
[SPEAKER_12]: It was ridiculous.

823
00:55:24,893 --> 00:55:26,115
[SPEAKER_10]: It was ridiculous.

824
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:29,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, from Microsoft to pterodactyl porn.

825
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the chatters.

826
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:35,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Live.VogNetwork.com A lot of props for South Park.

827
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:37,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Acidic Vampire says, South Park looks great.

828
00:55:38,326 --> 00:55:39,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Stan says, I think it will be good.

829
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,849
[SPEAKER_12]: The South Park creators are really involved in this game.

830
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:47,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Tiger Claw says, I liked how Trey Parker and Matt Stone trolled the Microsoft press conference when they showed up for their game.

831
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:48,594
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fantastic.

832
00:55:49,594 --> 00:55:51,476
[SPEAKER_12]: And Degenerate Johnny says, I'm calling it.

833
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:55,018
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the South Park's DLC will be Cartman's Ass.

834
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:57,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Could be Ass of Fire.

835
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:01,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have, you know, it's very cool the way they're doing it.

836
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:04,066
[SPEAKER_12]: The Lemmy Winks or whatever that was.

837
00:56:05,106 --> 00:56:13,909
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have a Lemmy Winks tie and one of the summons you get is Mr. Slave and Mr. Slave sucks the enemy into his ass.

838
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:16,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally.

839
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that was that whole Paris Hilton episode or whatever it was.

840
00:56:19,523 --> 00:56:21,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's basically that.

841
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:23,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing is off limits or sacred.

842
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:24,445
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting.

843
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:28,007
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's kind of cool, though, because you get to play as your own character in there.

844
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:29,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So you design your own character.

845
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:31,109
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of neat.

846
00:56:31,297 --> 00:56:32,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like Tomb Raider.

847
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:53,956
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a reboot, you never know.

848
00:56:54,116 --> 00:56:54,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't like Tomb Raider.

849
00:56:55,377 --> 00:57:07,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still looking forward to that, although the delay, you know, having to see it two years in a row is a little bit like... But I suppose it's not the first game, it won't be the last, that gets shown across multiple years.

850
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I can lock the butler in the fridge and break her neck.

851
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not interested.

852
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:15,042
[SPEAKER_10]: It's technically a prequel, so I don't think there's a butler.

853
00:57:15,522 --> 00:57:16,863
[SPEAKER_10]: You crash on an island.

854
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:18,683
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Uncharted, Tomb Raider.

855
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:19,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like Uncharted.

856
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:20,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks good.

857
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:24,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it looks good.

858
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:25,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad they showed it again.

859
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:26,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

860
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:27,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you kind of forget about it.

861
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so next was Nintendo.

862
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:31,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo...

863
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand how they're able to pull something like this off.

864
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:41,975
[SPEAKER_10]: They had three press conferences because one was not enough.

865
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a conference that was a pre-E3 conference that talked a little bit about the Wii U. Then they had the regular conference which talked mostly about the Wii U. Then they had a 3DS conference the following day.

866
00:57:55,276 --> 00:57:56,317
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

867
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:12,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Interface, I guess.

868
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,249
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be the Miiverse.

869
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And what Miiverse is, it's kind of an upgrade of the Mi Plaza.

870
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: You basically see all your Mi's congregating Mi's from friends, Mi's of people playing different games.

871
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:26,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see them playing the different games.

872
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:31,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And plus, you can talk to each other, not only in text chat, but you can picto chat with them as well.

873
00:58:32,072 --> 00:58:33,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's Facebook for me?

874
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

875
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:39,914
[SPEAKER_10]: You basically can interact with people in a really elaborate way.

876
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:40,654
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got, you know,

877
00:58:42,242 --> 00:58:47,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess spoiler stuff that you can do in there where you can make it so that people don't see your post.

878
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:48,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to get spoiled on the game.

879
00:58:49,308 --> 00:59:01,339
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have this whole like kind of like you can post in different spots in games and stuff like for example oh I'm having trouble in this area in the game can anybody help me and then like you know hey I got through this part of the game like this.

880
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:02,980
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great and all but

881
00:59:04,713 --> 00:59:07,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's kind of like what GameFAQs is for or something like that.

882
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:14,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's neat that they have this feature and that they showed all this stuff, but I don't know, whatever.

883
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:28,559
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the other things they are showing off also is a brand new controller for the Wii U, the Wii U Pro Controller, which looks like an Xbox 360 controller with the analog stick and the face buttons flip-flopped.

884
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:31,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

885
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:41,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that'll be used also in conjunction with the Wii Pad and stuff if you want to play regular games instead of using the Wii Remote.

886
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:44,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Although it will support a Wii Remote and all the Wii accessories as well.

887
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:47,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

888
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:49,527
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

889
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:14,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, they have a TV button on there.

890
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:22,861
[SPEAKER_10]: What the TV button is for is for actually using the tablet as a remote for your TV, like a universal remote.

891
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:30,682
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually launch the system and everything from the pad before you even turn the system on, or you can just switch the channel on your TV.

892
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:33,863
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do that with my Xbox controller.

893
01:00:34,283 --> 01:00:37,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Good question from SheHulk in our chat room, and I didn't catch this either.

894
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,044
[SPEAKER_12]: No Blu-ray or DVD for the Wii U?

895
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,531
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't say what they're using.

896
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

897
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:43,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

898
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:44,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

899
01:00:45,153 --> 01:00:47,474
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't say what kind of discs they're using.

900
01:00:47,674 --> 01:00:56,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they feel it's not needed because I noticed Reggie did emphasize, and the way he said it too was very interesting.

901
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:59,140
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, you know, Netflix, Amazon.

902
01:01:00,515 --> 01:01:25,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Hulu it's there you know he's like it's all there yes of course it's there but we want you to experience me you know it's kind of interesting yeah so let's talk about stuff that people aren't gonna care about and let's talk more in great detail about something else but to his credit what else are you gonna say about Netflix and Amazon and Hulu everybody knows that stuff already you know they're there yay that's that's really all there is to say

903
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:26,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

904
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:27,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You rhymed.

905
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:31,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma in our chatroom says Wii U will support Blu-ray storage.

906
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:32,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

907
01:01:32,992 --> 01:01:38,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I haven't seen anything yet, but I would assume it's Blu-ray, unless they're going to come out with their own proprietary format, which, whatever.

908
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:44,800
[SPEAKER_10]: One, of course, the big game, the first game that they unveiled was Pikmin 3.

909
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:52,165
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something that has been rumored to be coming to the Wii or the Wii U at some point, and it is a launch title.

910
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:53,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So they showed off Pikmin 3, and it looks pretty...

911
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:58,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Scribblenauts Unlimited was another game that they showed off that's pretty awesome.

912
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It does use the tablet and stuff.

913
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,030
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually...

914
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:18,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Wii U.

915
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not hear these rumors.

916
01:02:41,922 --> 01:02:44,044
[SPEAKER_10]: We would have never heard them on our show.

917
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,926
[SPEAKER_10]: We would never have known about that a few weeks ago.

918
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:55,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course, surprise, they're trying to director's cut coming to the Wii U, which is neat.

919
01:02:55,991 --> 01:03:10,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I might have missed this because I was playing in a home over there for a second, checking out the awesome backyard that Blender built for the clubhouse, but Mass Effect 3, Wii U, which has a lot of us kind of wondering, how is that going to work?

920
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:12,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I mean, you can't...

921
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you target on your little monitor.

922
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah.

923
01:03:16,552 --> 01:03:23,536
[SPEAKER_12]: That part, I figure maybe the biotics and the gun stuff is on the monitor or whatever, but I'm kind of like, how can you just skip Mass Effect 2?

924
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:28,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, Mass Effect 1, I can see people skipping, although I don't recommend it.

925
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see you skipping that, but you can't skip Mass Effect 2.

926
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,541
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't.

927
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:39,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So Mass Effect 3 is going to have to really have something special to separate it from the other versions to get me to want to buy it.

928
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:45,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Although Mass Effect 3 does have a pretty awesome multiplayer, so it'll be interesting to see if that's pulled off as well on the Nintendo system.

929
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, microtransaction hell.

930
01:03:47,726 --> 01:03:52,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I wonder if that's going to be pulled off as seamlessly on the Wii U. They must think so.

931
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:58,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that tells us a lot right there about Nintendo's online structure if EA is willing to put Mass Effect 3 on.

932
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:23,731
[SPEAKER_10]: another title that they announced was Sing which is being developed by the DJ Hero developers and Sing is your generic karaoke game with the words on the Wii pad whoopty shit that's what I have to say about that and admit it Call Me Maybe was stuck in your head all week long after that and it's the number one song on iTunes it was not I've never heard of that before

933
01:04:25,538 --> 01:04:27,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play it for you, but you'd slap me.

934
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:28,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that bad?

935
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:30,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty bad.

936
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,701
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS stuff, they talked a little bit about Paper Mario.

937
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:34,142
[SPEAKER_10]: That's supposed to be coming out this season.

938
01:04:34,943 --> 01:04:35,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday season.

939
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:37,444
[SPEAKER_10]: New Super Mario Bros.

940
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:40,525
[SPEAKER_10]: 2, which is headed to 3DS August 19th.

941
01:04:41,426 --> 01:04:44,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon for the 3DS this holiday.

942
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:46,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

943
01:04:48,032 --> 01:04:53,775
[SPEAKER_10]: They, of course, announced... I thought it was going to be New Super Mario Bros.

944
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:54,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Me.

945
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:58,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but they had to trump me, and it's now called New Super Mario Bros.

946
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:03,900
[SPEAKER_10]: You, which is announced, and it will have multiplayer... Gotcha!

947
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

948
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo!

949
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:08,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they have that coming.

950
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:16,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman Arkham City Armored Edition is headed to the Wii U, and basically the Game of the Year edition with some extra bells and whistles in there.

951
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:17,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

952
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:19,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

953
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:27,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say real quick, because some of the folks in the chat room are commenting, you know, we're about a minute lagged from when we say things to when they get encoded and people hear them.

954
01:05:27,442 --> 01:05:29,705
[SPEAKER_12]: So people in chat right now are talking about Mass Effect 3.

955
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:34,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Acidic Vampire says no Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the Wii U equals fail.

956
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:38,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And Actdeft reminds us PlayStation 3 skipped Mass Effect 1.

957
01:05:38,795 --> 01:05:41,677
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I'm saying Mass Effect 1 is okay to skip.

958
01:05:41,757 --> 01:05:43,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't recommend it, but it's okay.

959
01:05:43,138 --> 01:05:45,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They had, though, to be fair, they had a motion comic.

960
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and WhatUpG reminds us that they did have that bridge.

961
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:55,286
[SPEAKER_12]: So Technus says BioWare will just do another interactive graphic comic, and that's certainly kind of the likely thing.

962
01:05:55,606 --> 01:06:08,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, DarkTetsuya linked us in chat to the story on MyNintendoNews that mentions that Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back, which I guess is what they're calling the Wii U version, will include an enhanced storyline from the original game.

963
01:06:09,115 --> 01:06:12,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no, this says PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

964
01:06:12,157 --> 01:06:15,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he got the stuff mixed up.

965
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:23,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I was going to say, Take Earth Back, I heard, was a DLC expansion that's possibly coming in the future.

966
01:06:23,204 --> 01:06:27,567
[SPEAKER_12]: So never mind, I guess that's not about the Wii U. That's what I get for trying to do stories live.

967
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:33,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, and I'm surprised that they did this because I didn't think it's that popular anymore, but I guess it is.

968
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:36,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

969
01:06:36,214 --> 01:06:37,656
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it said the original game.

970
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:39,818
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is about the Wii U version.

971
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:43,202
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the original game on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

972
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:46,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm seeing this for the first time, so I'm trying to process this myself here.

973
01:06:46,987 --> 01:06:52,434
[SPEAKER_12]: EA hasn't spoken about the enhanced content, and they're saying hopefully it's not just going to be the reworked ending.

974
01:06:52,734 --> 01:06:53,956
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

975
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:11,458
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a lot of their launch lineup.

976
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:28,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll be able to interact with that.

977
01:07:29,724 --> 01:07:38,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also, some of these Wii U games, they showed that you can play them without actually having the system on the TV.

978
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:42,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can exercise and stuff like that without looking at the TV.

979
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:49,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it just looks stupid if you're working with the Wii Fit balance board and Wii tablet.

980
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just come on.

981
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:52,428
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just whatever.

982
01:07:53,309 --> 01:08:10,110
[SPEAKER_10]: and then finally also the Wii U will support two different Wii gamepads however there will be a hit in frames per second they'll actually be halved so the upper limit will be 30 frames per second on both Wii U tablets which whatever honestly

983
01:08:12,597 --> 01:08:13,858
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

984
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:34,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a different developer now because before it looked like Grand Theft Auto.

985
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:39,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It still has that kind of sandbox thing to it, but it definitely doesn't look like Grand Theft Auto anymore.

986
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks pretty amazing.

987
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely one of the launch games to have on that.

988
01:08:44,922 --> 01:08:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it doesn't sell me a system.

989
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:53,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And I still am worried that they didn't talk enough about what their online plan is.

990
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we know about Miiverse and I can talk with people, leave them little notes about shit in-game, but...

991
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:01,169
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

992
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:24,773
[SPEAKER_10]: which are going to have already been out for a few months by the time the system launches.

993
01:09:25,413 --> 01:09:41,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Assassin's Creed 3 looks pretty cool, but why should I buy another system to play a game that I can already play on my system right now and look pretty much the same, but it's going to have a few extra gimmicks with it with this new controller.

994
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:43,858
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the problem that doesn't sell me on this stuff.

995
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:44,658
[SPEAKER_10]: For the Wii...

996
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Mario Bros.

997
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:46,039
[SPEAKER_10]: U

998
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:08,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, how am I forgetting about Nintendo Land?

999
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:09,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, I haven't heard of Nintendo Land yet.

1000
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:14,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo Land, basically the Wii Sports, Wii Play, whatever, Tech Demo Land.

1001
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,393
[SPEAKER_12]: The giant cocktease land, because there's my F-Zero.

1002
01:10:17,774 --> 01:10:18,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see that?

1003
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It is basically Tech Demo Land.

1004
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,939
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1005
01:10:42,139 --> 01:11:10,374
[SPEAKER_12]: which is great maybe they'll have two they might have two SKUs where one is the kind of like remember the old old school NES how they actually had three versions of that when that first came out there was the robot pack that came with Rob the Robot and like Gyromite and then there was the action pack that came with the Zapper and Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt and then there was the vanilla ass pack I don't remember what it was called the core the core did they call things core back then I think it was called the core system well whatever it was just the NES and Super Mario Brothers basically

1006
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:34,897
[SPEAKER_12]: so I wonder if the Wii U won't launch with a similar type of thing where you could have just the plain Jane system or you get the extra maybe the extra Wii U controller since we hear that they will support two players yeah here's the thing though they're going to support two players but not any of the launch titles are going to support two players on those pads don't so it's something that's coming way down the line um

1007
01:11:36,423 --> 01:11:38,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1008
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:03,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you've got New Super Mario Bros.

1009
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:05,374
[SPEAKER_10]: for the 3DS, New Super Mario Bros.

1010
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:05,374
2.

1011
01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:07,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you have New Super Mario Bros.

1012
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:11,198
[SPEAKER_10]: U. The problem is, that game looks last gen.

1013
01:12:11,318 --> 01:12:12,799
[SPEAKER_10]: That game looks like a Wii game.

1014
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:18,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, I know it's a great game and you're launching it on the system, but I think you need...

1015
01:12:19,784 --> 01:12:28,475
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to show off this game system, you need to come out with something big, like a Super Mario Galaxy type of game, or a Mario 64.

1016
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:32,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like, holy shit, I did not expect to see Mario like that.

1017
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:35,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of, hey look, it's slightly prettier New Super Mario Bros.

1018
01:12:35,924 --> 01:12:36,805
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't look...

1019
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:38,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

1020
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:45,461
[SPEAKER_12]: As much as I do want that Mario Brothers Wii U game, but I'm not sure I'm totally sold on this system yet.

1021
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:51,102
[SPEAKER_12]: But just to be devil's advocate for a minute, doesn't Pikmin 3 kind of show off some of those capabilities a little better?

1022
01:12:51,162 --> 01:12:55,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Pikmin 3 is not a game I think that's going to appeal to everybody.

1023
01:12:56,124 --> 01:13:01,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it... Pikmin doesn't have... It has a following, but it doesn't have a huge following.

1024
01:13:01,366 --> 01:13:02,127
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a niche game.

1025
01:13:02,747 --> 01:13:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be honest.

1026
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a niche game.

1027
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:05,748
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't sell that great.

1028
01:13:05,788 --> 01:13:07,189
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a Super Mario Brothers.

1029
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:10,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma's reminding me of a couple other Nintendo packs that I forgot earlier.

1030
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,831
[SPEAKER_12]: There was the Power Pack when the Power Pad came out.

1031
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:13,471
[SPEAKER_12]: That was later.

1032
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,012
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt World Class Track Meet.

1033
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,894
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says that there was one that was Hogan's Alley in Duck Hunt.

1034
01:13:19,314 --> 01:13:24,456
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember Hogan's Alley ever being a pack-in game, but maybe it was like... Maybe it wasn't very well distributed.

1035
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:25,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Hogan's Alley

1036
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:33,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lawn Trader reporting the news from 25 years ago.

1037
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:40,960
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, that's just my problem, though, is they don't have... There's still a lot of information that we need from Nintendo.

1038
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,341
[SPEAKER_10]: A price and a date, for God's sake.

1039
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:45,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but they did that with the Wii.

1040
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:53,363
[SPEAKER_12]: They came out later around Tokyo Game Show time, because they don't do Tokyo Game Show, but they'll do their own little thing, and that's when they'll announce it.

1041
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:59,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, cool, but I need to know more about the system, and right now, as it stands, I'm not buying one.

1042
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:01,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even buying one near launch.

1043
01:14:01,846 --> 01:14:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I just... I don't want it.

1044
01:14:03,448 --> 01:14:14,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't... I'm kind of with you, but the price will... I mean, A, the price, and B, my disposable income, which I may or may not have at that end of the year, will really factor into my decision.

1045
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:16,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and here's the other thing, too, is just...

1046
01:14:17,345 --> 01:14:19,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I learned my lesson with the Wii.

1047
01:14:19,586 --> 01:14:20,367
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii was awesome.

1048
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I had fun.

1049
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:26,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, the Wii, compared to what was already currently available, was very, very different.

1050
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just, hey, look, I have a traditional controller with a goddamn screen on it.

1051
01:14:31,653 --> 01:14:32,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my problem with it.

1052
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:35,074
[SPEAKER_10]: You know all these cool things that you're talking about with that controller?

1053
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:35,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, guess what?

1054
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: You've had two screens for fucking years now with the DS.

1055
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:43,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And how many really, truly unique games have you seen come out of it?

1056
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:44,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably a handful.

1057
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:45,400
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably can count them on one hand.

1058
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:50,104
[SPEAKER_10]: of games that are really using both screens just in an amazing way.

1059
01:14:50,924 --> 01:15:01,853
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think we're going to get a lot of these really big games because you've had time to do something unique with this and you're just not going to use these two screens.

1060
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:02,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a gimmick.

1061
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:14,058
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say this, though, to Nintendo's credit, is that even though the Wii U lineup left me feeling, and I think a lot of us feeling a little, eh, especially when they ended with Nintendo Land, I think that was a big, eh.

1062
01:15:14,258 --> 01:15:16,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that was just kind of, that's it?

1063
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:17,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was too bad.

1064
01:15:17,299 --> 01:15:18,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda or something?

1065
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,901
[SPEAKER_12]: But the 3DS lineup looked great.

1066
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:26,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta say, that new, you know, the Golden Coins Mario game looked great.

1067
01:15:27,197 --> 01:15:29,878
[SPEAKER_12]: The Castlevania game especially looked great.

1068
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:42,183
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I feel like the 3DS, I kind of wish they'd show, I mean, I realize they did that whole second press conference where they showed more, but I was kind of hoping for a little more at the big show because there's a lot of good stuff going on.

1069
01:15:42,223 --> 01:15:43,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know something that was missing?

1070
01:15:44,184 --> 01:15:45,525
[SPEAKER_10]: The redesign of the 3DS?

1071
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:47,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that too, but Animal Crossing.

1072
01:15:48,846 --> 01:15:49,506
[SPEAKER_10]: No Animal Crossing.

1073
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It was missing, wasn't it?

1074
01:15:51,877 --> 01:15:53,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Delayed Delayed Delayed Delayed Delayed

1075
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:25,207
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a very... I gotta say, I mean, you're gonna have a hard time selling somebody on... Let's just, you know, an average parent or whatever, okay?

1076
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:26,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I can buy the system now.

1077
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:29,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, who knows what the Wii's gonna be, you know, dropping down to.

1078
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:34,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, let's say it goes down to, you know, 99 bucks or something.

1079
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:34,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man, $99 Wii?

1080
01:16:34,853 --> 01:16:35,473
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be crazy.

1081
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:36,074
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

1082
01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:56,632
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know you've got the Wii system right now and I can buy new Super Mario Brothers and it's pretty awesome I mean the people aren't gonna know oh hey oh that's the Wii U version you know and honestly the Wii U stuff aside from oh cool I you know I can play on my Wii pad or whatever when um you know someone's on the TV or

1083
01:16:57,032 --> 01:16:59,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck, that's not how you're supposed to be selling your system.

1084
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:06,394
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to be selling your system, hey, when someone wants to watch TV, you can play your game system on this pad.

1085
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:13,896
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're supposed to say, hey, when someone's playing something on the TV, you bop out your fucking 3DS and you play New Super Mario Bros.

1086
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,516
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 on there.

1087
01:17:14,536 --> 01:17:16,296
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you fucking solve that situation.

1088
01:17:16,576 --> 01:17:18,957
[SPEAKER_10]: You sell them on the portable system and the regular system.

1089
01:17:18,977 --> 01:17:23,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't say, hey, you don't fucking need the portable system because, hey, you got the stupid tablet now.

1090
01:17:24,358 --> 01:17:25,599
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fucking stupid.

1091
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just dumb.

1092
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:32,323
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at an hour 18, so before we move on to this, let me read some comments from chat on this whole thing.

1093
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:42,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, at vognetwork.com, live chat, says, I would like a new platformer of Black Tiger for the Wii U and that would help convince me to buy one.

1094
01:17:42,409 --> 01:18:11,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the Playstation 2 compilation pack with Black Tiger and Dungeon Buster chimes in saying I'd snatch one up day one if it had something like that everybody's got their dream game you know I've been sitting here saying F-Zero F-Zero F-Zero god damn it F-Zero you know everybody's got their game that they want to have let's see Acidic Vampire says screw a 3DS Castlevania give me a next gen Castlevania a la Symphony of the Night amen to that Shadow Next Gen who is at the show chimes in most of the Wii U titles shown at E3 are launch titles so

1095
01:18:14,059 --> 01:18:15,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1096
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:16,902
[SPEAKER_10]: True and not true.

1097
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:18,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Launch window titles.

1098
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:20,265
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm serious.

1099
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:22,847
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not launch day titles.

1100
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:36,941
[SPEAKER_12]: They're launch window, and that's... And although what he's saying is mostly true, Nintendo doesn't... I mean, Nintendo certainly doesn't project, let's say, quite as badly as Sony, last Guardian, or Microsoft, Halo 4 last year and Tomb Raider,

1101
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:42,484
[SPEAKER_12]: do, but Nintendo did troll us what?

1102
01:18:42,705 --> 01:18:42,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1103
01:18:43,725 --> 01:18:44,506
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't project?

1104
01:18:45,026 --> 01:18:45,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Not as bad.

1105
01:18:45,927 --> 01:18:57,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying, but I am saying, Nintendo did do that whole Smash Brothers thing last year, and we know that that's a good three years away, but they didn't show anything.

1106
01:18:57,374 --> 01:19:01,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And they said, we're announcing it, it'll come out eventually.

1107
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Rob, Bagenator's calling on you.

1108
01:19:03,478 --> 01:19:03,719
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1109
01:19:03,799 --> 01:19:04,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1110
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:04,359
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1111
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:06,140
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero is overrated.

1112
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:06,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out!

1113
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:10,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone smack him with a fish.

1114
01:19:10,102 --> 01:19:10,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he in the home?

1115
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:11,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he in the home?

1116
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:14,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm going to go bop him in the head in Sony Home right now.

1117
01:19:14,725 --> 01:19:15,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on the hunt.

1118
01:19:15,325 --> 01:19:16,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's Ragenator?

1119
01:19:16,906 --> 01:19:17,746
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go smack him.

1120
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:20,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, speaking of Sony.

1121
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk a little bit about Sony.

1122
01:19:22,928 --> 01:19:25,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony had some pretty interesting things.

1123
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:34,114
[SPEAKER_10]: They came out talking about their Sony mascot Battle Royale.

1124
01:19:34,194 --> 01:19:36,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony All-Stars Battle Royale game.

1125
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:42,640
[SPEAKER_10]: did announce two new characters for it and kind of confirming that there are going to be some third-party characters in there.

1126
01:19:43,922 --> 01:19:50,328
[SPEAKER_10]: They announced Big Daddy's going to be one of the playable characters and also Nathan Drake, which is kind of a duh.

1127
01:19:50,808 --> 01:19:52,690
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are going to be available as well.

1128
01:19:53,951 --> 01:19:57,014
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure they've got a lot more to unveil there.

1129
01:19:58,876 --> 01:20:00,497
[SPEAKER_10]: They did talk a little bit about...

1130
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:05,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Some interesting ideas, I guess.

1131
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:13,594
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them was this, I don't even know why, a wonder book.

1132
01:20:15,117 --> 01:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_10]: J.K.

1133
01:20:15,197 --> 01:20:15,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Rowling's Book of Spells

1134
01:20:41,691 --> 01:21:07,217
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know they're kind of sending it on oh hey she she wrote it and it's all this all new stuff and hey check it out it's pretty sweet it was pretty fucking boring it was probably the worst thing that they had of their whole here's the thing though now keep in mind we weren't watching the press conference we were only reading the tweets because we were in line for Indiana Jones or something at the time and

1135
01:21:07,837 --> 01:21:30,396
[SPEAKER_12]: so while you guys were kind of like seeing that and I guess bored with the presentation those of us were kind of reading about it and we actually sat there going that is a brilliant move by Sony because the part there that you glossed over that I think is crucial they have fucking JK Rowling in their back pocket now don't underestimate the power of that woman

1136
01:21:31,496 --> 01:21:33,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Pottermore ain't that great either.

1137
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:35,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Pottermore's actually pretty neat.

1138
01:21:35,962 --> 01:21:37,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But I suck at mixing spells.

1139
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:41,249
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of people going crazy over it.

1140
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Pottermore is also very age-broad.

1141
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:45,655
[SPEAKER_12]: True.

1142
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:47,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think...

1143
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:58,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a lot more to this, especially with the whole, you know, Sony does have a family friendly thing that they need to try to get a little bit of that Nintendo audience.

1144
01:21:58,245 --> 01:22:00,426
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the Wonder Book is a way to kind of push that.

1145
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:02,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't underestimate it.

1146
01:22:02,327 --> 01:22:02,908
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I'm saying.

1147
01:22:02,928 --> 01:22:03,388
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1148
01:22:03,568 --> 01:22:06,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand where you're coming from there, but it's...

1149
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:24,364
[SPEAKER_10]: you're asking someone to purchase if they don't own a Playstation 3 you're asking them to purchase a Playstation 3 a Playstation Move set up and then this Wonder Book on top of it like a $400 investment for a fucking lame ass looking game I keep saying Wonder Book and I think of Superbook right?

1150
01:22:24,844 --> 01:22:25,124
[SPEAKER_12]: I might...

1151
01:22:43,581 --> 01:22:44,622
[SPEAKER_12]: buy that one instead.

1152
01:22:57,771 --> 01:23:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but to buy that for that specific thing, it looks terrible.

1153
01:23:05,576 --> 01:23:06,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks fucking terrible.

1154
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:14,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you think about it, Rob, they also have Harry Potter for Kinect, so if you want to go that bullshit route of, well, they have J.K.

1155
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:15,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Rowling's in this book of things.

1156
01:23:16,022 --> 01:23:20,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I could read a fucking book and pretend to do magic or I could become fucking Harry Potter.

1157
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:20,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1158
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I think becoming Harry Potter wins.

1159
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine, you made your point.

1160
01:23:24,487 --> 01:23:25,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in fucking Hogwarts.

1161
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:28,549
[SPEAKER_10]: My creepy face is on that stupid avatar.

1162
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:29,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine.

1163
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:30,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you made your point.

1164
01:23:31,491 --> 01:23:32,452
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1165
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:59,191
[SPEAKER_10]: and, of course, you know, full free games if you're a subscriber of PlayStation Plus and they're going to be adding more as time goes on.

1166
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:02,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, PlayStation 1 Classics are coming back to the Vita.

1167
01:24:03,173 --> 01:24:03,713
[SPEAKER_10]: No duh there.

1168
01:24:03,754 --> 01:24:06,175
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of, you know, been leaked out already.

1169
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:14,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to slowly roll those out starting with, I think, Final Fantasy VII and maybe Tomb Raider, some other stuff.

1170
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,241
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty amazing.

1171
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:18,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, some Vita titles...

1172
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:29,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whole lot of first-party Vita titles that are going to be coming out for the... I was also shocked at the lack of Vita.

1173
01:24:29,866 --> 01:24:34,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically... I mean, all the stuff that was coming out this fall is pretty much stuff we already knew about.

1174
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:39,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, LittleBigPlanet carding and LittleBigPlanet.

1175
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,771
[SPEAKER_12]: To be fair, some of that may show up at Tokyo Game Show.

1176
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,872
[SPEAKER_12]: After all, Sony is a Japanese company.

1177
01:24:44,892 --> 01:24:45,312
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

1178
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of that may be in their back pocket for Tokyo Game Show.

1179
01:24:47,653 --> 01:24:49,234
[SPEAKER_12]: At least I hope to hell that's what happens.

1180
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:57,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, also there's the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which is going to be on the Vita as well.

1181
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Another pretty cool thing.

1182
01:24:59,253 --> 01:24:59,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to say this.

1183
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:02,714
[SPEAKER_12]: ShadowNextGen in our chatroom says, where is the Vita price drop?

1184
01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:04,735
[SPEAKER_12]: That was made up by the internet.

1185
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:09,458
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people assumed just because the 3DS had a price drop, the Vita was going to get one too.

1186
01:25:09,878 --> 01:25:10,878
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too soon.

1187
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,039
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to announce a price drop yet.

1188
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,060
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of agree.

1189
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:18,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the tech in the Vita, it would be a bigger loss to Sony to do something like that.

1190
01:25:18,862 --> 01:25:24,047
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to announce a price drop three months after it's come out.

1191
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:26,409
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be like, oh yeah, we failed.

1192
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:27,350
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to do that.

1193
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:32,514
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to announce, hey, we're going to drop the price in October.

1194
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:41,822
[SPEAKER_12]: That being said, however, now that they've kind of ignored it at this show, now they might have painted themselves in a corner to have to do that.

1195
01:25:42,242 --> 01:26:09,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Tokyo Game Show is going to be critical to the future of the Vita believe it they did talk about you know some games that are kind of big does Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified not necessarily going to be the same Black Ops 2 games so it's a little disappointing to me but we'll see what it is and then Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which is going to be its own kind of unique game with its own character which is kind of cool that launches October 30th as well

1196
01:26:12,466 --> 01:26:40,346
[SPEAKER_10]: and then of course the big big reveal that they had was the brand new Quadric Dream game which is Beyond Two Souls and just such an amazing looking game basically kind of taking everything that you liked from Heavy Rain and just amping it up just the motion capture in it now is just ridiculous how well that looks um

1197
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:45,816
[SPEAKER_10]: and big name stars behind it as well.

1198
01:26:47,177 --> 01:26:48,038
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool.

1199
01:26:48,098 --> 01:26:50,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely got to check it out.

1200
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,963
[SPEAKER_10]: They have now... God, who's the fucking actress?

1201
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:55,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate myself.

1202
01:26:55,665 --> 01:26:56,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Ellen Page.

1203
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:56,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Ellen Page, yes.

1204
01:26:57,026 --> 01:27:01,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Ellen Page is now doing the mocap and... Kitty Pryde.

1205
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:03,031
[SPEAKER_10]: That too.

1206
01:27:03,271 --> 01:27:03,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitty Pryde.

1207
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:05,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the screens from it.

1208
01:27:06,113 --> 01:27:07,694
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really good.

1209
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:24,981
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat.

1210
01:27:25,182 --> 01:27:26,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked pretty cool.

1211
01:27:27,203 --> 01:27:29,924
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't like the quick time event stuff, then maybe not for you.

1212
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:32,446
[SPEAKER_10]: But you probably didn't like Heavy Rain either.

1213
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:34,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to go watch that trailer.

1214
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,008
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard a lot of excitement about it.

1215
01:27:36,068 --> 01:27:37,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Granted, I kind of missed the boat on Heavy Rain.

1216
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely watch the demo footage.

1217
01:27:40,551 --> 01:27:41,712
[SPEAKER_10]: They have 20 minutes for the game.

1218
01:27:41,752 --> 01:27:42,272
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks awesome.

1219
01:27:42,312 --> 01:27:43,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to check it out for sure.

1220
01:27:43,433 --> 01:27:43,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Really cool.

1221
01:27:44,654 --> 01:27:46,076
[SPEAKER_12]: So overall, Sony's conference?

1222
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:47,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1223
01:27:47,498 --> 01:27:47,938
[SPEAKER_10]: How'd you feel?

1224
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:48,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and one more thing.

1225
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,986
[SPEAKER_10]: A little Big Planet 2 is getting some DLC that's going to turn the Vita into a controller for the game.

1226
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:54,927
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

1227
01:27:54,988 --> 01:27:55,448
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

1228
01:27:55,789 --> 01:27:56,329
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very cool.

1229
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:57,791
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of cross-play stuff there.

1230
01:27:58,552 --> 01:27:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I think...

1231
01:27:59,313 --> 01:28:02,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, out of the three, I think they have the strongest.

1232
01:28:02,715 --> 01:28:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they showed off this really amazing game, a new property for them, a new IP.

1233
01:28:08,397 --> 01:28:12,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, they were showing off some of the stuff that they had.

1234
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:14,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Third Party was pretty awesome.

1235
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,401
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't seem like there was a lot that bored me too much.

1236
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:18,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonder Book was pretty eh.

1237
01:28:18,522 --> 01:28:25,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like Nintendo's press conference was just like, okay, when we get into the good stuff, when we get into the good stuff, it's over?

1238
01:28:26,572 --> 01:28:27,053
[SPEAKER_10]: It's over?

1239
01:28:27,313 --> 01:28:35,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's like, when are we getting to these like, holy crap, holy crap, I need to buy the system for this game, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool, and I mean...

1240
01:28:35,803 --> 01:28:57,811
[SPEAKER_12]: I think next year's Nintendo's press conference it better be anyway it's gonna be a lot like that one a couple years ago remember that year I think this was two years ago where Reggie came out on stage and was basically like you want games fine here's some games bam bam bam bam he showed like eight of them off in a row and he's like there's all your fucking games good night

1241
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:00,364
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1242
01:29:22,635 --> 01:29:26,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Zappy in our chatroom says Nintendo needs to learn the magic of one more thing.

1243
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Harness the Steve Jobs.

1244
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:30,824
[SPEAKER_10]: They did that with fucking Metroid.

1245
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:31,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that?

1246
01:29:31,525 --> 01:29:31,905
[SPEAKER_12]: One more thing.

1247
01:29:31,925 --> 01:29:33,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking Metroid game!

1248
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:40,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Metroid game by Team Ninja that sounds awesome and will be okay when it comes out.

1249
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:42,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyhow.

1250
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:45,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that, I think that might have been the same year.

1251
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:47,560
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that was the year before, I think.

1252
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:56,086
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the year that that Metroid game was actually coming out that I think was the year where Reggie was like, we got this, and we got this, and we got this.

1253
01:29:56,387 --> 01:30:01,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And if any of you fuckers write that no games are coming out for the Wii, I will personally come to your house and beat your ass.

1254
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,311
[SPEAKER_12]: At least that's what I heard.

1255
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,332
[SPEAKER_10]: My body is ready to kick some ass.

1256
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:10,253
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, quickly the third-party crest conferences because we're already an hour and a half.

1257
01:30:10,273 --> 01:30:10,693
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, real quick.

1258
01:30:10,713 --> 01:30:13,496
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have them any this year, but Ubisoft did.

1259
01:30:14,177 --> 01:30:14,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry off of them, of course.

1260
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:22,367
[SPEAKER_12]: But Konami had the online one that showed lots and lots of Metal Gear Rising, which, granted, if you like violence, looks great.

1261
01:30:24,028 --> 01:30:24,889
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds cool.

1262
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:26,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't watch that one, unfortunately.

1263
01:30:27,231 --> 01:30:29,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Ubisoft, they had Just Dance 4.

1264
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:30,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Duh.

1265
01:30:30,914 --> 01:30:36,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to have some Wii U specific features including a puppet master mode where you can change up the dance moves on the fly.

1266
01:30:36,939 --> 01:30:39,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's kind of fun if you're in a party environment, I guess.

1267
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:43,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth, which is coming to the Wii U and Kinect.

1268
01:30:44,245 --> 01:30:44,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1269
01:30:47,118 --> 01:30:57,814
[SPEAKER_10]: and it also supposed to be like kind of they said drawing from the secret invasion universe that has like scrolls posing as superheroes and stuff but it looks terrible.

1270
01:30:57,834 --> 01:30:59,416
[SPEAKER_10]: The secret invasion thing was crap.

1271
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,058
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks fucking terrible.

1272
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:02,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It was even worse than Civil War.

1273
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:06,523
[SPEAKER_10]: The gameplay looks bad, just saying.

1274
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:12,084
[SPEAKER_10]: They have like the X-Men in there, so I don't understand how that's Avengers, but whatever.

1275
01:31:12,224 --> 01:31:15,105
[SPEAKER_02]: They were involved in Wolverines and every team in the Marvel Universe ever.

1276
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:16,345
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

1277
01:31:17,045 --> 01:31:18,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, he's got to work.

1278
01:31:19,466 --> 01:31:22,187
[SPEAKER_02]: He even hung out with Power Pack.

1279
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:25,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, time for a total tangent where I derail the show.

1280
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:28,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I finally saw the Avengers this weekend.

1281
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:28,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it good?

1282
01:31:29,011 --> 01:31:29,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you save for the whole thing?

1283
01:31:29,892 --> 01:31:30,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

1284
01:31:30,493 --> 01:31:31,914
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing?

1285
01:31:31,954 --> 01:31:36,961
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we thought once we saw the dude, we thought it was over.

1286
01:31:37,061 --> 01:31:37,341
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1287
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:42,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we realized in the car on the way home, wasn't Jamie talking about a scene with blah, blah, blah?

1288
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:43,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God damn it.

1289
01:31:43,549 --> 01:31:44,891
[SPEAKER_12]: There must have been more after the...

1290
01:31:45,191 --> 01:31:55,178
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you always, always, always, always, always stay through the entire credits of a Marvel movie because they will fuck with you.

1291
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:59,701
[SPEAKER_02]: One does not simply leave a movie before the end of the credits.

1292
01:31:59,721 --> 01:32:00,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I made a mistake.

1293
01:32:00,861 --> 01:32:01,902
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on YouTube.

1294
01:32:02,302 --> 01:32:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we're going to go back and see it.

1295
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:10,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Rayman Legends was another game that they showed off and that was a sequel to Rayman Origins.

1296
01:32:11,512 --> 01:32:11,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty awesome.

1297
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:19,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have 5 player co-op with the Wii U and also the Pro Controller and Wiimote are supported and the gameplay looks just

1298
01:32:20,522 --> 01:32:20,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1299
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:25,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Just really, really cool stuff that they've got going there with that.

1300
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:27,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

1301
01:32:27,991 --> 01:32:40,346
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the games that I thought was a joke when they were showing it originally on the Wii U pre-E3 conference, which was a zombie game that this really dorky guy was just kind of being all cliche about and like,

1302
01:32:40,706 --> 01:32:41,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I need help!

1303
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:42,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Help me, internet!

1304
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:45,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to know how to beat this boss!

1305
01:32:45,891 --> 01:32:48,153
[SPEAKER_02]: That commercial is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

1306
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:49,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a real game.

1307
01:32:50,115 --> 01:32:52,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Zombie U is the name of it.

1308
01:32:52,337 --> 01:32:53,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fucking stupid name.

1309
01:32:54,279 --> 01:33:00,986
[SPEAKER_10]: It was originally Killer Freaks from Outer Space, which was going to be a neat looking game that had almost like evil rabbits looking characters.

1310
01:33:01,426 --> 01:33:02,888
[SPEAKER_10]: But now it's a generic zombie shooter game.

1311
01:33:03,648 --> 01:33:23,684
[SPEAKER_10]: but they're going to have some interesting uses of the Wii controller and honestly to me this game looks like it's going to be another Red Steel which some people may like Red Steel but Red Steel ended up being one of those games hey it looked pretty cool at E3 and then when it came out it was not very cool.

1312
01:33:24,164 --> 01:33:25,765
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just kind of ehhh.

1313
01:33:27,006 --> 01:33:28,850
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, we'll see.

1314
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, um, zombie game, neat.

1315
01:33:31,515 --> 01:33:35,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, um, of course, they talked a little bit about, um, Far Cry 3, which...

1316
01:33:37,706 --> 01:33:41,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that trailer they showed was a bit graphic.

1317
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:43,769
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just, boobies!

1318
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:45,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, boobies!

1319
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:48,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, you know, I know Bobby was talking a little bit about it.

1320
01:33:48,192 --> 01:33:54,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even asked him, like, hey, were you watching this online or were you watching this on, like, Spike or G4 or something like that?

1321
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they censor those fucking tits on TV?

1322
01:33:57,396 --> 01:33:58,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, they did not.

1323
01:33:58,657 --> 01:34:01,138
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a little... Boobie soft.

1324
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,759
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little problem, yes.

1325
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:03,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And boobie soft.

1326
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:04,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sad I missed it.

1327
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobysoft hashtag was launched from there.

1328
01:34:09,702 --> 01:34:12,424
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I love Aisha Tyler.

1329
01:34:13,284 --> 01:34:15,766
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's great that she got to emcee.

1330
01:34:15,846 --> 01:34:19,227
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny because what do her and Joel McHale have in common?

1331
01:34:20,068 --> 01:34:22,689
[SPEAKER_12]: They've both hosted The Soup on E!

1332
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Aisha Tyler was the host before.

1333
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:26,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I love her.

1334
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:27,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I think she's great.

1335
01:34:27,552 --> 01:34:28,612
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a podcast too.

1336
01:34:29,012 --> 01:34:29,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Girl...

1337
01:34:30,534 --> 01:34:33,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I almost said Girls Gone Wow, but that's not her show.

1338
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:34,761
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not her show.

1339
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:38,447
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Girl on Guy, I think is the name of the show, and it's pretty good.

1340
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:39,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan's a really big fan.

1341
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:42,073
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's actually a gamer, so that's kind of cool.

1342
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:44,117
[SPEAKER_12]: She is, and she has a big lady boner for Halo.

1343
01:34:45,652 --> 01:34:46,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I like her a lot.

1344
01:34:46,934 --> 01:34:47,374
[SPEAKER_12]: She's funny.

1345
01:34:47,414 --> 01:34:48,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I've met her.

1346
01:34:48,095 --> 01:34:49,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to have her on the show.

1347
01:34:50,358 --> 01:34:53,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that will never happen because she does the talk on CBS.

1348
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,385
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would just love to chat with Aisha Tyler.

1349
01:34:56,465 --> 01:34:56,985
[SPEAKER_10]: She was funny.

1350
01:34:57,246 --> 01:34:58,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I met her in person once.

1351
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:00,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1352
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:00,650
[SPEAKER_10]: It's...

1353
01:35:02,455 --> 01:35:06,557
[SPEAKER_10]: She was not that annoying, but the other guy, oh my fucking god.

1354
01:35:06,977 --> 01:35:08,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Why was he there?

1355
01:35:08,418 --> 01:35:09,758
[SPEAKER_10]: He was so fucking annoying.

1356
01:35:09,798 --> 01:35:10,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And the banter was just annoying.

1357
01:35:11,459 --> 01:35:15,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, they were talking a little bit about their service that they've got.

1358
01:35:16,381 --> 01:35:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: They have some free games that you can play, including they've added Trials Evolution and Beyond Good and Evil HD, I Am Alive, and some more stuff to their free play service.

1359
01:35:26,286 --> 01:35:28,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty awesome that they've got that as well.

1360
01:35:28,927 --> 01:35:30,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch Dogs Watch Dogs

1361
01:35:49,258 --> 01:35:50,019
[SPEAKER_10]: That game looked rad.

1362
01:35:50,179 --> 01:35:51,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks fantastic.

1363
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:52,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I did watch that.

1364
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:52,902
[SPEAKER_12]: That looked rad.

1365
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:53,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

1366
01:35:53,984 --> 01:35:58,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Most people were going around saying Ubisoft won E3.

1367
01:35:58,168 --> 01:35:59,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, whatever the hell that means.

1368
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:01,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations, you win an E3.

1369
01:36:01,652 --> 01:36:02,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did pretty good.

1370
01:36:03,074 --> 01:36:06,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Based on that, almost single-handedly, that.

1371
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:08,880
[SPEAKER_12]: That had more people talking than anything else.

1372
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,120
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an amazing game.

1373
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:22,208
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically this kind of futuristic game where you play this guy who has hijacked control of, it's in the future, Chicago, and basically this computer runs the whole city.

1374
01:36:22,349 --> 01:36:22,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything.

1375
01:36:22,929 --> 01:36:26,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Every telephone network, street lights, whatever.

1376
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:32,755
[SPEAKER_10]: He has this almost like a magic phone that he can dial in and hack anything.

1377
01:36:32,775 --> 01:36:36,318
[SPEAKER_10]: You find out information about people and it's just this whole espionage.

1378
01:36:37,138 --> 01:36:38,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Stealth kind of action game.

1379
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:40,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a shooter element in there as well.

1380
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:43,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And just the integration with your phone.

1381
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:45,584
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to kind of use the smart glass stuff.

1382
01:36:46,705 --> 01:36:47,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Really cool looking thing.

1383
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:52,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Nintendo, but A, was that game announced for Wii U?

1384
01:36:52,209 --> 01:36:52,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

1385
01:36:52,509 --> 01:36:53,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't think it was.

1386
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:56,212
[SPEAKER_12]: And B, I think that's a real problem.

1387
01:36:57,193 --> 01:36:58,394
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a real problem.

1388
01:36:58,434 --> 01:37:05,078
[SPEAKER_12]: When more people are talking about somebody else's game that's not coming to your system more so than your brand new system.

1389
01:37:05,339 --> 01:37:05,819
[SPEAKER_12]: That is very...

1390
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:06,800
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki,

1391
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:29,922
[SPEAKER_12]: However, to be fair, yet, we never know what might ultimately pan out before the launch.

1392
01:37:30,702 --> 01:37:32,202
[SPEAKER_12]: It may not be a launch window.

1393
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:35,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, Reggie was focusing on launch window games.

1394
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,103
[SPEAKER_12]: This may not be until 2013.

1395
01:37:36,143 --> 01:37:37,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this definitely isn't a launch window.

1396
01:37:38,004 --> 01:37:38,924
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be the problem.

1397
01:37:39,144 --> 01:37:40,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, here's the other thing, too.

1398
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:44,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadow Next Gen says it wasn't announced for any system.

1399
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:45,987
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't announced for 360 or PS3 either.

1400
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:50,508
[SPEAKER_10]: The press site they have listed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1401
01:37:50,928 --> 01:37:52,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone thinks it's for Next Gen, though.

1402
01:37:52,769 --> 01:37:52,909
[SPEAKER_10]: And I...

1403
01:37:53,889 --> 01:37:54,390
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be.

1404
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:56,311
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks very next-gen, that's for sure.

1405
01:37:56,951 --> 01:38:03,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Another game that was not at Ubisoft at all, which is kind of surprising, was Rainbow Six Patriots.

1406
01:38:03,056 --> 01:38:03,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was that?

1407
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:04,637
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just missing.

1408
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:10,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So who knows where that's been, but I don't know.

1409
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:13,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty exciting lineup.

1410
01:38:13,784 --> 01:38:14,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's quickly do EA.

1411
01:38:14,725 --> 01:38:17,206
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running long for Part A, but we knew we would.

1412
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:17,507
[SPEAKER_12]: It's E3 week.

1413
01:38:18,446 --> 01:38:20,968
[SPEAKER_10]: EA, real quick, they had lots of sports games to show off.

1414
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:25,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, brand new Madden now.

1415
01:38:25,391 --> 01:38:26,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a brand new engine that's going to be running.

1416
01:38:26,972 --> 01:38:30,834
[SPEAKER_10]: The new Infinity Engine has really awesome physics and stuff, so that looks pretty cool.

1417
01:38:32,135 --> 01:38:33,636
[SPEAKER_10]: They talked a little bit about some new games.

1418
01:38:33,696 --> 01:38:36,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Space 3, which is kind of a duh that's coming out in February.

1419
01:38:36,558 --> 01:38:38,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Need for Speed Most Wanted being rebooted by Criterion.

1420
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:41,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like Burnout with cops.

1421
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:43,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Burnout Paradise with cops, great.

1422
01:38:43,943 --> 01:38:45,724
[SPEAKER_10]: SimCity that's going to be now online online.

1423
01:38:46,204 --> 01:38:47,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Only, which is kind of annoying.

1424
01:38:48,425 --> 01:38:48,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo.

1425
01:38:49,446 --> 01:38:51,867
[SPEAKER_12]: That decision is going to tank that franchise.

1426
01:38:52,068 --> 01:38:52,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch.

1427
01:38:52,788 --> 01:39:01,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what they're saying, and Bobby went into this a little bit on his show tonight, and I totally am agreeing with his sentiment, is that it's getting away from that whole sandbox thing.

1428
01:39:01,533 --> 01:39:05,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember how you could unleash Godzilla and a nuclear strike and all that on your city?

1429
01:39:05,836 --> 01:39:07,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, okay, just go back and load your save file.

1430
01:39:08,097 --> 01:39:08,958
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do that.

1431
01:39:09,358 --> 01:39:11,279
[SPEAKER_12]: When it's online only, there's no save files now.

1432
01:39:11,499 --> 01:39:12,960
[SPEAKER_12]: People like doing that in The Sims.

1433
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you do that to your franchise?

1434
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:18,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that is a really bad decision.

1435
01:39:19,383 --> 01:39:19,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch.

1436
01:39:19,923 --> 01:39:21,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It worked for Diablo.

1437
01:39:21,404 --> 01:39:24,885
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to work for UEA.

1438
01:39:25,846 --> 01:39:34,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Diablo being online only, not that everybody's okay with that anyway, but so many people were already playing that game online that it wasn't a deal-breaker.

1439
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:57,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But SimCity, you don't play that online, ever And it's sad too because that's a game that I would like to play offline And it looks like an amazing game, it's just Unless you do have a local file Because for some online franchises they do pull your data off a local file So that could work But, not likely

1440
01:39:57,828 --> 01:40:03,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that they're going to because Diablo 3, if you think about it, could have done that as well but they didn't go that route.

1441
01:40:04,173 --> 01:40:06,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they just shot the franchise in the foot with that decision.

1442
01:40:06,796 --> 01:40:07,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch.

1443
01:40:07,857 --> 01:40:08,617
[SPEAKER_10]: They can always change it.

1444
01:40:08,637 --> 01:40:09,238
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got time.

1445
01:40:09,658 --> 01:40:10,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they're going to.

1446
01:40:10,359 --> 01:40:14,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the whole thing is they're trying to combat piracy and they think that online only is the way to go.

1447
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1448
01:40:17,961 --> 01:40:20,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, you're hurting the legitimate users of it.

1449
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:22,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Medal of Honor Warfighter looks amazing.

1450
01:40:22,925 --> 01:40:25,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Very realistic-looking game.

1451
01:40:25,347 --> 01:40:26,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Crysis 3 is just kind of weird.

1452
01:40:26,908 --> 01:40:30,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand why I need to use a bow and arrow in this game, but neat.

1453
01:40:30,911 --> 01:40:33,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a beautiful-looking game, that's for sure.

1454
01:40:35,575 --> 01:40:38,217
[SPEAKER_10]: SimCity Social for Facebook they announced, which...

1455
01:40:39,258 --> 01:40:39,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1456
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:44,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Battlefield 3, of course, the Battlefield 3 Premium service, they announced that.

1457
01:40:45,783 --> 01:40:51,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's out on PS3 first, and then PC and Xbox, kind of opposite of Call of Duty Elite.

1458
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:54,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars Old Republic is sort of going free-to-play.

1459
01:40:55,009 --> 01:41:00,033
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going free-to-play up to level 15, and they're going to also be adding new content as well.

1460
01:41:02,353 --> 01:41:06,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Also Madden NFL kind of jumping on the social bandwagon that they have with FIFA.

1461
01:41:07,475 --> 01:41:09,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually have some interesting stuff now.

1462
01:41:09,575 --> 01:41:13,016
[SPEAKER_10]: The new game has like a fake Twitter feed that's on there.

1463
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:18,797
[SPEAKER_10]: It comments on your performance and stuff like you're having real fans comment on your game, which is kind of cool.

1464
01:41:18,817 --> 01:41:19,738
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got that going.

1465
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus a lot of other presentation perks that they added with that.

1466
01:41:25,559 --> 01:41:53,425
[SPEAKER_10]: and last but not least the big one EA has secured the UFC franchise so that's going to be coming to EA now and they bought it from THQ for an unsaid amount of money and basically the reasoning behind that was UFC 3 which was the last UFC game to come out from THQ didn't make their money so they have to cut it and that's what they did they cut the franchise and sold it to EA

1467
01:41:54,685 --> 01:41:58,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'm worried now that if it's going to be like EA Sports MMA, which is kind of terrible.

1468
01:42:00,246 --> 01:42:00,807
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1469
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:02,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you.

1470
01:42:02,527 --> 01:42:04,808
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a lot of news from E3.

1471
01:42:05,468 --> 01:42:09,569
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we kind of covered it all there and gave our feedback as well as you guys there in our chat room.

1472
01:42:09,729 --> 01:42:11,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do have some more to talk about.

1473
01:42:11,129 --> 01:42:12,270
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not done with the show yet.

1474
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,190
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to get into some of the little stuff in the next half.

1475
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:17,331
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of sad that we didn't see was No Dead Rising 3 announcement.

1476
01:42:18,447 --> 01:42:19,407
[SPEAKER_12]: That is interesting.

1477
01:42:19,448 --> 01:42:20,548
[SPEAKER_12]: That didn't end up happening.

1478
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:21,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think that is?

1479
01:42:22,209 --> 01:42:26,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's one of those things, you know, like I've been hearing from a lot of different developers and publishers.

1480
01:42:26,951 --> 01:42:27,972
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not ready to show.

1481
01:42:28,072 --> 01:42:29,212
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not ready to show it yet.

1482
01:42:29,332 --> 01:42:31,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they're not ready to talk about that yet.

1483
01:42:31,153 --> 01:42:32,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is the whole excuse behind Last Guardian.

1484
01:42:33,254 --> 01:42:34,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Last Guardian.

1485
01:42:35,695 --> 01:42:37,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Capcom had a few things that they were showing off.

1486
01:42:37,876 --> 01:42:38,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, Street Fighter...

1487
01:42:39,945 --> 01:43:00,881
[SPEAKER_10]: you know I don't really well Street Fighter X Tekken for the Vita and then they also had Lost Planet 3 which was a big thing Devil May Cry they're kind of focusing on those franchises if you think about it those are coming out quarter one so this might be a fourth quarter game might be something for next E3 or maybe something that they announced at Tokyo Game Show who knows so it may just not be ready yet hmm interesting

1488
01:43:01,761 --> 01:43:07,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, we're running a bit long, but we do have a few more segments we want to get in here before we get to Part B tonight.

1489
01:43:07,025 --> 01:43:08,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people prefer it long.

1490
01:43:10,048 --> 01:43:15,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out a little sooner than any of the games we just talked about.

1491
01:43:16,984 --> 01:43:23,046
[SPEAKER_10]: This week, we don't have a whole ton, but we've got Lollipop Chainsaw on PS3 and 360, and that's sometimes all you need.

1492
01:43:24,787 --> 01:43:32,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Dirt Showdown is supposed to be coming out this week, although I'm not sure if it's actually going to be coming out on Tuesday because they're having production problems, but sometime hopefully this week.

1493
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:33,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's on PS3 and 360.

1494
01:43:35,171 --> 01:43:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And then not a whole lot else.

1495
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:44,555
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a fan of the Nickelodeon series iCarly, there's a Groovy Foodie game coming out on Nintendo DS.

1496
01:43:45,175 --> 01:43:49,359
[SPEAKER_10]: on the Vita, getting a couple games, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and Gravity Rush.

1497
01:43:50,039 --> 01:43:53,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Gravity Rush looks pretty awesome, so hopefully that'll be pretty cool.

1498
01:43:53,462 --> 01:43:57,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, I believe that's it.

1499
01:43:58,274 --> 01:43:59,475
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1500
01:44:17,193 --> 01:44:20,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Persona 4 The Golden comes out in Japan this week.

1501
01:44:20,635 --> 01:44:23,557
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a whole little accessory set as well that you can get for the Vita.

1502
01:44:23,577 --> 01:44:30,081
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also a Super Monkey Ball game called Tokumori Asobita comes out this week as well on the PlayStation Vita.

1503
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:32,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a feeling more people will be crazy about the Persona 4.

1504
01:44:33,463 --> 01:44:35,084
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of fans of that here in the U.S.

1505
01:44:35,905 --> 01:44:45,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to the PlayStation 3, Lollipop Chainsaw in Japan as well, and also a game called Lord of Sorcery, as well as some new joystick adapters coming from Hori.

1506
01:44:45,775 --> 01:44:48,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Lord of Sorcery from Sony?

1507
01:44:48,799 --> 01:44:51,001
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that is just Sorcery here.

1508
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:52,683
[SPEAKER_12]: It is from Sony.

1509
01:44:53,544 --> 01:44:55,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a Move integrated game.

1510
01:44:56,107 --> 01:45:00,151
[SPEAKER_12]: FIFA 12 gets a price reduction as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1511
01:45:00,612 --> 01:45:04,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Quickly taking a look at the Xbox 360.

1512
01:45:05,177 --> 01:45:14,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Akai Katana Shin gets a price reduction this Friday as well as Shatos gets a price reduction as well and Lollipop Chainsaw on the 360 as well.

1513
01:45:14,488 --> 01:45:15,129
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's Japan.

1514
01:45:15,389 --> 01:45:15,810
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura?

1515
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:23,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a few things in the UK and I would tell everybody if my thing would pull up.

1516
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:23,695
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1517
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:30,159
[SPEAKER_02]: We have coming up on the 13th, Doctor Who, The Eternity Clock and Gravity Rush.

1518
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:41,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the 15th, we have Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, Heroes of Ruin, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier and Lollipop Chainsaw.

1519
01:45:42,768 --> 01:45:54,743
[SPEAKER_12]: and that would do it for the UK alright well let's go way back back past E3 and past what's coming out this week and go way back in time to when things were a little bit simpler

1520
01:45:57,403 --> 01:46:00,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Back when you had to read about E3 and Nintendo Power.

1521
01:46:00,885 --> 01:46:03,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, maybe not that long ago, but still pretty far back.

1522
01:46:03,347 --> 01:46:09,130
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week, where DarkSakura's gonna go into the gaming vault and pull out an old-ass video game.

1523
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:14,713
[SPEAKER_12]: She thinks, hey, while you guys are waiting for all this stuff to come out, respect a classic.

1524
01:46:15,234 --> 01:46:18,356
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one literally from the vault, which is how I decided.

1525
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:23,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked a box of PS games, and this was the second one on them.

1526
01:46:24,099 --> 01:46:26,081
[SPEAKER_12]: and what is this week's classic game of the week?

1527
01:46:26,242 --> 01:46:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Policenauts Policenauts is one of the cinematic adventure games that was done by Hideo Kojima it has yeah it was a Konami game the old Konami logo

1528
01:46:39,896 --> 01:46:41,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, I miss that.

1529
01:46:42,517 --> 01:46:52,720
[SPEAKER_02]: It was initially released for the PC-9821 in 1994, and then they remade versions for the 3DO, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn in 96.

1530
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:59,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It has never officially been released outside of Japan, although they were going to localize it on the Saturn.

1531
01:47:00,062 --> 01:47:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on August 24th, in honor of the 46th birthday of Hideo Kojima,

1532
01:47:05,683 --> 01:47:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1533
01:47:20,982 --> 01:47:33,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting game because it really refers back to different references like to Lethal Weapon and Urashima Taro, which is an old Japanese tale.

1534
01:47:34,048 --> 01:47:42,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is about a detective who travels to a space colony to investigate his ex-wife's murder and her new husband's disappearance.

1535
01:47:43,453 --> 01:47:56,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is first person point and click interface and you play as the protagonist Jonathan Ingram who is a police not basically former police officer trained to be a police officer in space.

1536
01:47:57,685 --> 01:48:07,814
[SPEAKER_02]: With the console you use the mouse but on the Saturn version you can use the light gun for shooting parts of the game so it's actually a little bit more rich in terms of play.

1537
01:48:10,697 --> 01:48:30,215
[SPEAKER_02]: but on the other consoles it's basically point and click first person shooter type stuff and you know with random saves and everything and it actually has an easter egg that if you've got a save file of Tokimeki Memorial it refers back to it so pretty funny

1538
01:48:31,176 --> 01:48:34,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course that came up in Metal Gear Solid where it read your save files on your PlayStation card.

1539
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you are a careful man who saves often.

1540
01:48:40,703 --> 01:48:51,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, again, like I said, Jonathan Ingram is a police knot who is assigned to Beyond Coast, which is the first functional space colony in 2013.

1541
01:48:51,912 --> 01:48:54,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So next year, we're apparently colonizing space.

1542
01:48:55,274 --> 01:49:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes to see what happened to Lorraine, who was his ex-wife, and her husband's vanished, so he has to find out what's going on.

1543
01:49:02,941 --> 01:49:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So he works with his buddy from the LAPD, Ed Brown, who is helping him with the investigation.

1544
01:49:11,227 --> 01:49:30,156
[SPEAKER_02]: and so it really is just that point-and-click now for different versions that came out I did mention it originally was on the NEC PC 9821 and it was one CD-ROM that had an installation floppy disk and the cutscenes were rendered were rendered in hand-drawn pixel art instead of full-motion video

1545
01:49:33,057 --> 01:49:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It also is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games.

1546
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it came out on the 3DO on September 29th, 1995.

1547
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It was two CD-ROMs and had animated cutscenes.

1548
01:49:44,061 --> 01:49:45,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It was CG animation.

1549
01:49:46,442 --> 01:49:48,322
[SPEAKER_02]: All the graphics were completely redrawn for it.

1550
01:49:48,822 --> 01:49:52,844
[SPEAKER_02]: PS version came out in January 1996 on two discs.

1551
01:49:53,304 --> 01:49:54,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the version I have.

1552
01:49:54,424 --> 01:49:56,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have the Best Hits version of that, just to say.

1553
01:49:58,045 --> 01:50:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it came out on the Sega Saturn on September 13th, 1996.

1554
01:50:00,066 --> 01:50:02,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And it used, like I said, the light gun.

1555
01:50:03,088 --> 01:50:15,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Other versions that have been out is that there was the Policenauts Pilot Disc for 3DO that had a playable demo of the backstory of the game, featurettes, and information on the voice actors and developers.

1556
01:50:15,653 --> 01:50:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was the Policenauts Private Collection that came out on the PlayStation February 9th, 1996.

1557
01:50:20,555 --> 01:50:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of the same content and an earlier version of the game script the PlayStation 1 has been reissued twice there is the Konami the best version which is the one that I have and then it came out for the PlayStation store making it downloadable for PlayStation Portable and for PS3

1558
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a plan to localize it on the Saturn there actually is cover art that exists for this and there's a fan translation that was done for the PlayStation which you can actually use through what's the word I'm thinking of?

1559
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:04,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Emulator and I've seen a bunch of it through that I've played through half of it in Japanese with a copy of that script so

1560
01:51:05,467 --> 01:51:15,290
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a soundtrack that was released, and then Policenauts FN, which is arranged versions of the music from the soundtrack.

1561
01:51:16,151 --> 01:51:23,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was the MIDI Power Pro 3, so there was a MIDI arrangement of Policenauts music, and the Snatcher Policenauts music disc.

1562
01:51:24,013 --> 01:51:27,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Music Collection of Hideo Kojima Black Disc.

1563
01:51:27,815 --> 01:51:29,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go, Policenauts.

1564
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if I may say so.

1565
01:51:33,761 --> 01:51:37,162
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also references to Policenauts and Snatcher in the Metal Gear games.

1566
01:51:38,383 --> 01:51:40,304
[SPEAKER_11]: When it detects your save files and all that?

1567
01:51:40,624 --> 01:51:40,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

1568
01:51:42,765 --> 01:51:44,266
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, here's an obvious one.

1569
01:51:44,746 --> 01:51:51,909
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a scene where Otacon is flashbacked to being a big nerd.

1570
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:57,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's scenes from Policenauts and Snatcher in his flashbacks.

1571
01:51:57,994 --> 01:52:02,077
[SPEAKER_12]: BaconBits in our chatroom asks, is there an official release on the US PlayStation Network?

1572
01:52:02,177 --> 01:52:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1573
01:52:02,477 --> 01:52:02,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

1574
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:03,698
[SPEAKER_12]: But maybe someday.

1575
01:52:04,578 --> 01:52:06,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Bug them enough.

1576
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you can find Policenauts, I think, relatively inexpensive if you're getting the re-release.

1577
01:52:14,324 --> 01:52:16,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you can play it on an emulator with an English patch.

1578
01:52:17,006 --> 01:52:17,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1579
01:52:17,466 --> 01:52:18,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to go to the trouble.

1580
01:52:18,967 --> 01:52:22,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Or if you happen to be able to read and understand Japanese, you can play it on a PS3.

1581
01:52:22,739 --> 01:52:24,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the way I played it.

1582
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat down with a freaking script that gave me my options.

1583
01:52:29,362 --> 01:52:30,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pain in the ass.

1584
01:52:30,963 --> 01:52:31,483
[SPEAKER_12]: But you did it.

1585
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:32,183
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did it.

1586
01:52:33,584 --> 01:52:38,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We beat the freaking Rurouni Kenshin game, the RPG, with a copy of the script.

1587
01:52:39,767 --> 01:52:41,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And we beat Grandia.

1588
01:52:41,267 --> 01:52:44,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We played through half of Grandia with my friend Krista there because she could read everything.

1589
01:52:45,869 --> 01:52:48,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you this right now.

1590
01:52:48,731 --> 01:52:51,132
[SPEAKER_02]: My Japanese reading is like a literate five-year-old.

1591
01:52:52,114 --> 01:52:54,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I know maybe 30 kanji.

1592
01:52:54,769 --> 01:52:55,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1593
01:52:57,117 --> 01:52:57,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep trying.

1594
01:52:57,798 --> 01:52:59,198
[SPEAKER_12]: You might get up to a six-year-old soon.

1595
01:52:59,218 --> 01:53:00,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when I move.

1596
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:01,440
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1597
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:02,580
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to take a break.

1598
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,161
[SPEAKER_12]: We're almost two hours with no break here.

1599
01:53:04,181 --> 01:53:09,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And I need to go check into the show tonight at vognetwork.com and get my VOG points so I can get more loot.

1600
01:53:10,185 --> 01:53:11,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully you guys will do the same thing.

1601
01:53:11,686 --> 01:53:13,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you might join us in the VOG Network Clubhouse.

1602
01:53:13,987 --> 01:53:16,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, just search for VOG in the PlayStation Home.

1603
01:53:16,328 --> 01:53:17,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's VOG Network all in caps.

1604
01:53:18,189 --> 01:53:19,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're going to fill this place tonight.

1605
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:21,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Blender's already like, do we need a second clubhouse?

1606
01:53:23,413 --> 01:53:23,873
[SPEAKER_12]: We might.

1607
01:53:24,754 --> 01:53:31,142
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyhow, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1608
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 460 for this June the 10th of 2012.

1609
01:53:43,184 --> 01:53:46,226
[SPEAKER_12]: We are live at vognetwork.com.

1610
01:53:46,266 --> 01:53:50,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Be sure to check into the show, get your points, and maybe some hidden loot there.

1611
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:54,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, we're live in the PlayStation Network Clubhouse.

1612
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:57,032
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where most people have left, honestly.

1613
01:53:58,613 --> 01:54:01,535
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to convince Sony somehow to give us more than 30 people.

1614
01:54:01,895 --> 01:54:02,235
Yeah.

1615
01:54:02,695 --> 01:54:21,682
[SPEAKER_12]: to get in that clubhouse but I was checking out Blender put in all these little like arcade games you can play and I was playing Electro Kid which I didn't realize I mean I knew there were some mini games like I remember there was like a Arkanoid clone breakout type thing that was kind of basic and some other little things that were in there when home first launched like that Electro Kid I was just playing was kind of like a old school 8-bit platformer

1616
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:22,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, wow.

1617
01:54:23,463 --> 01:54:25,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of behind the times on home.

1618
01:54:25,124 --> 01:54:27,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have the Namco games or something that you could do?

1619
01:54:27,206 --> 01:54:33,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they tied into the... All it would do is a launcher for the Namco collection game.

1620
01:54:33,431 --> 01:54:33,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's lame.

1621
01:54:34,172 --> 01:54:35,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.

1622
01:54:35,633 --> 01:54:37,274
[SPEAKER_12]: But still kind of neat.

1623
01:54:37,394 --> 01:54:39,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks like they are building more and more games into home.

1624
01:54:40,196 --> 01:54:41,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty cool.

1625
01:54:41,577 --> 01:54:43,199
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was checking that out a little bit during the break.

1626
01:54:43,839 --> 01:54:43,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Also...

1627
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:46,642
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1628
01:55:04,615 --> 01:55:06,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

1629
01:55:25,282 --> 01:55:27,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I got my start on college radio too.

1630
01:55:27,344 --> 01:55:34,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to DJ for KCSE 95.5 in Chico, California even though that wasn't a real radio frequency.

1631
01:55:34,472 --> 01:55:35,754
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to have this little thing.

1632
01:55:35,794 --> 01:55:37,135
[SPEAKER_12]: It was cable radio.

1633
01:55:37,475 --> 01:55:39,438
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to hook up the cable to your radio.

1634
01:55:40,118 --> 01:55:40,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1635
01:55:43,104 --> 01:55:43,725
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1636
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:29,407
[SPEAKER_12]: also at vognetwork.com be sure to participate in the forums we are running forums again they look very generic right now but I know that's on the plate for Bobby to expand this week Bobby has been working non-stop on the site you have to remember VOG Network has only been up in its full form for a week and for a while about a month before that he was coding the version that you saw on Friday when it launched and he's been still coding non-stop that week and I'm always like Bobby you should like take a break Bobby you should go to Disneyland like I did Bobby you should like get away from your computer he's like

1637
01:56:29,927 --> 01:56:30,788
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta do a mobile site.

1638
01:56:31,268 --> 01:56:33,590
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta do this other thing, you know, things I can't talk about.

1639
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,811
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta do this other thing, this other thing.

1640
01:56:34,831 --> 01:56:35,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just like, Bobby.

1641
01:56:36,492 --> 01:56:38,413
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's working very, very hard behind the scenes.

1642
01:56:38,753 --> 01:56:41,115
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, DarkSakura, you did some of the graphic stuffs.

1643
01:56:41,695 --> 01:56:42,916
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of the pretty colors.

1644
01:56:43,377 --> 01:56:44,577
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's other things coming up.

1645
01:56:44,758 --> 01:56:45,218
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1646
01:56:45,758 --> 01:56:46,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Content-wise.

1647
01:56:46,979 --> 01:56:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That directly involves our listeners.

1648
01:56:49,761 --> 01:56:51,062
[SPEAKER_02]: But should I?

1649
01:56:51,682 --> 01:56:52,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I should.

1650
01:56:52,203 --> 01:56:52,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop a hint.

1651
01:56:53,744 --> 01:56:55,105
[SPEAKER_02]: VOG10 and VOGBLOG.

1652
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,438
[SPEAKER_12]: E3 Rapid Fire News

1653
01:57:11,136 --> 01:57:15,441
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1654
01:57:31,898 --> 01:57:44,880
[SPEAKER_10]: and so there is currently a beta right now which they have not accepted me very disappointed there but that will be hopefully very soon we'll get to play the full thing and I will definitely be picking it up and I may actually get into a game that's not you know

1655
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Minecraft for a little bit.

1656
01:57:48,097 --> 01:57:49,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1657
01:57:50,038 --> 01:57:53,520
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a sequel announced to Dead Rising, Dead Rising Riptide.

1658
01:57:54,061 --> 01:57:59,724
[SPEAKER_10]: It is coming out soon, probably this fall, I imagine.

1659
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:02,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Consoles and PC.

1660
01:58:02,385 --> 01:58:08,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't really say when, but there's supposed to be an extensive reveal this summer, so probably fall.

1661
01:58:09,429 --> 01:58:25,801
[SPEAKER_10]: and last but not least was a game that wasn't shown during the press conferences but Project P100, a Wii U launch title which is going to be coming to us from Platinum Games and it kind of looks like a cross between Beautiful Joe and Pikmin

1662
01:58:27,506 --> 01:58:36,330
[SPEAKER_10]: and you basically play like these superheroes that get other superheroes and other citizens to kind of form together to attack monsters that are attacking Earth.

1663
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:41,092
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw somebody in chat, and I'm sorry I forget who, said that that was their game of the show.

1664
01:58:41,473 --> 01:58:43,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So some people are already excited about this.

1665
01:58:43,754 --> 01:58:44,274
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty cool.

1666
01:58:46,345 --> 01:58:46,926
[SPEAKER_12]: WarioWare WarioWare

1667
01:59:08,727 --> 01:59:27,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, the description says Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action Game in Wario features a collection of games that use only the Wii U gamepad controller The games retain the original flair and character of the micro games from the WarioWare series So it sounds like it's maybe a more fleshed out version of WarioWare which could be very interesting

1668
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:33,570
[SPEAKER_12]: some games called Arrow and Ski and Shudder sound a lot like, you know, one word WarioWare games.

1669
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:35,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, unfortunately it's not WarioWare.

1670
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:39,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if it was WarioWare... It's not, but it sounds like it kind of might be.

1671
01:59:39,111 --> 01:59:41,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it might be the spiritual successor, you know that term?

1672
01:59:41,752 --> 01:59:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want a spiritual successor.

1673
01:59:43,072 --> 01:59:44,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I want an actual successor.

1674
01:59:44,652 --> 01:59:47,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Screw the spiritual successor stuff.

1675
01:59:47,893 --> 01:59:49,313
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need a spiritual successor.

1676
01:59:49,853 --> 01:59:52,014
[SPEAKER_10]: That's if your franchise didn't do very well.

1677
01:59:52,054 --> 01:59:54,254
[SPEAKER_10]: This is WarioWare that we're talking about.

1678
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:55,549
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.

1679
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:22,364
[SPEAKER_12]: That is kind of cool, you know, and I realize especially she's a good role model for women because she's in there doing a boy sport that has a lot of, you know, and she's, well, you're kind of giving me stank face a little bit.

1680
02:00:22,685 --> 02:00:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, well, I hate the term men's sport when...

1681
02:00:26,889 --> 02:00:27,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1682
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It's driving a car.

1683
02:00:29,451 --> 02:00:32,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like it either, but let's say male dominated.

1684
02:00:33,154 --> 02:00:33,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that works.

1685
02:00:33,854 --> 02:00:34,174
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1686
02:00:34,294 --> 02:00:41,499
[SPEAKER_12]: And she kind of kicks a lot of ass and has done very well for herself being a spokesperson for various sites and so forth.

1687
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:43,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And now she's going to be playable in a video game.

1688
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So that'll be pretty cool.

1689
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:49,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, I want Alex Kidd to be playable.

1690
02:00:49,861 --> 02:00:51,743
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the return of Alex Kidd?

1691
02:00:51,923 --> 02:00:53,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Where the hell has he been?

1692
02:00:53,364 --> 02:00:55,145
[SPEAKER_13]: We need Alex Kidd in Shinobi World 2.

1693
02:00:55,865 --> 02:00:56,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream on.

1694
02:00:56,605 --> 02:01:00,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the first game had a lot of old Sega characters.

1695
02:01:00,668 --> 02:01:03,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

1696
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:05,671
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some Danica haters.

1697
02:01:05,911 --> 02:01:07,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Cue the Danica haters in our chat room.

1698
02:01:08,532 --> 02:01:16,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you want to talk about a franchise that could, you know, or a company that could use one of those, like, oh, hey, our mascots are fighting in a battle royale type thing.

1699
02:01:16,815 --> 02:01:18,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Sega would be pretty amazing.

1700
02:01:18,556 --> 02:01:18,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I would.

1701
02:01:19,757 --> 02:01:20,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't they do something like that?

1702
02:01:20,757 --> 02:01:21,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought they tried.

1703
02:01:21,297 --> 02:01:22,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

1704
02:01:23,898 --> 02:01:24,559
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sorry.

1705
02:01:24,579 --> 02:01:25,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Ubisoft.

1706
02:01:25,419 --> 02:01:26,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me read the haters.

1707
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:27,240
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the internet.

1708
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,140
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always going to be haters.

1709
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,942
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Morpheus says, great, another avenue that shows Danica can't drive.

1710
02:01:32,662 --> 02:01:34,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Blender says, Danica sucks.

1711
02:01:34,263 --> 02:01:34,663
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ho.

1712
02:01:35,904 --> 02:01:39,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So every fandom has their haters.

1713
02:01:39,245 --> 02:01:39,485
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1714
02:01:41,275 --> 02:01:43,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching.

1715
02:01:43,416 --> 02:01:44,516
[SPEAKER_12]: See you next time.

1716
02:02:08,266 --> 02:02:10,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they can get hired at EA.

1717
02:02:11,428 --> 02:02:13,390
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the tiny little silver lining in this.

1718
02:02:13,870 --> 02:02:14,310
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1719
02:02:15,311 --> 02:02:16,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to some more rapid fire news.

1720
02:02:16,852 --> 02:02:17,373
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

1721
02:02:18,253 --> 02:02:19,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we've got.

1722
02:02:20,435 --> 02:02:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, the Humble Indie Bundle 5 has three new additions to it.

1723
02:02:24,177 --> 02:02:30,122
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pay above the minimum, which is right now at $8.14, you get Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Lone Survivor.

1724
02:02:33,884 --> 02:02:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think this is pretty cool, you know, for the Minecraft fan in the room, that Marcus Pearson actually paid $9,999.99.

1725
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:43,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1726
02:02:50,512 --> 02:02:50,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1727
02:02:51,453 --> 02:02:54,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And next up, Portal 2 in motion.

1728
02:02:54,395 --> 02:02:56,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is going to use the PlayStation Move.

1729
02:02:57,698 --> 02:02:58,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1730
02:02:58,338 --> 02:03:00,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a crap about that because I play it on the PC.

1731
02:03:02,222 --> 02:03:03,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's basically the stuff that they had.

1732
02:03:03,943 --> 02:03:09,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that was, I think it was like Sixth Sense or N-Sense or some weird like...

1733
02:03:10,508 --> 02:03:39,791
[SPEAKER_12]: it uses the same from the Razer Hydra yeah Razer Hydra I was just gonna keep naming random names yeah you know the motion controller sucks or well not suck but no one's buying it for the you know right so why not recycle the content here I just it pissed me off because Sony showed that in one of their little compilations of footage and we were like holy shit a new portal game holy shit yay yay yay and then it's oh it's move DLC whatever right DLC is DLC I guess I don't give a shit I guess

1734
02:03:40,743 --> 02:03:42,505
[SPEAKER_02]: and well, how about Sony stuff anyway?

1735
02:03:42,845 --> 02:03:43,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Tokyo Jungle.

1736
02:03:43,926 --> 02:03:44,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it.

1737
02:03:44,526 --> 02:03:45,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it.

1738
02:03:45,167 --> 02:03:46,628
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to import it.

1739
02:03:46,748 --> 02:03:48,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be a gazelle.

1740
02:03:48,329 --> 02:03:52,092
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the game we lost our shit on last week and said it should be the new President Cat.

1741
02:03:52,112 --> 02:03:53,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that didn't take long.

1742
02:03:53,433 --> 02:03:54,955
[SPEAKER_12]: They are bringing it to North America.

1743
02:03:55,055 --> 02:03:55,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay!

1744
02:03:56,976 --> 02:04:03,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in fact, this actually was... I'm trying to find the guy's name.

1745
02:04:05,059 --> 02:04:10,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Road, who was the Sony VP of Product Development and Worldwide.

1746
02:04:12,021 --> 02:04:14,362
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, it'll ship here, it'll ship everywhere.

1747
02:04:15,443 --> 02:04:18,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And to him, I'm going to read this directly from the article.

1748
02:04:18,804 --> 02:04:24,446
[SPEAKER_02]: To him, Tokyo Jungle's worldwide release is emblematic of Sony's crazy innovative approach.

1749
02:04:25,966 --> 02:04:31,788
[SPEAKER_02]: He says the game is just wacky but in a good way because we like to show that there's still an art form and you can still experiment.

1750
02:04:33,368 --> 02:04:35,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the hell out of this game.

1751
02:04:35,869 --> 02:04:36,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1752
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:36,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1753
02:04:36,729 --> 02:04:37,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want it too.

1754
02:04:37,989 --> 02:04:38,589
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be awesome.

1755
02:04:38,789 --> 02:04:40,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lusting in my heart after it.

1756
02:04:41,170 --> 02:04:41,550
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1757
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And lusting in your heart is lusting for real.

1758
02:04:45,111 --> 02:04:49,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now we're to the part of the show where we're going to get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1759
02:04:51,453 --> 02:04:52,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Radio Quote Room.

1760
02:04:53,175 --> 02:04:55,096
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is a foogle you might be asking?

1761
02:04:55,136 --> 02:04:57,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's Facebook and Google Plus combined.

1762
02:04:57,277 --> 02:04:58,977
[SPEAKER_12]: You get a foogle.

1763
02:04:59,337 --> 02:05:02,078
[SPEAKER_12]: We ask a question on Facebook and Google Plus and you guys answer it.

1764
02:05:02,799 --> 02:05:04,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And we read some of the answers.

1765
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:05,360
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of answers tonight.

1766
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:06,120
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't read them all.

1767
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:06,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I just can't.

1768
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:09,221
[SPEAKER_12]: We read some of the answers here live on the show.

1769
02:05:09,261 --> 02:05:12,162
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you want to see all the answers, check us out on Google Plus.

1770
02:05:12,622 --> 02:05:13,683
[SPEAKER_12]: The link is on our website.

1771
02:05:13,703 --> 02:05:16,424
[SPEAKER_12]: This is because you can't get a short URL on Google Plus yet.

1772
02:05:16,804 --> 02:05:21,388
[SPEAKER_12]: You just go to OrangeLawnTrader.com and in the upper right hand corner is a box that says Extended Play.

1773
02:05:21,448 --> 02:05:23,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Just click on that Google Plus logo and you can add us there.

1774
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:28,594
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, there are people using Google Plus because we got a couple responses over there.

1775
02:05:28,954 --> 02:05:35,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight we have Michael D. answering our question of the week which was What, in your opinion, was the highlight of E3 this year?

1776
02:05:36,361 --> 02:05:38,963
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the thing you are looking forward to most of all?

1777
02:05:39,723 --> 02:05:43,086
[SPEAKER_12]: And Michael D. says from the press conferences Oh, excuse me, he did sign it.

1778
02:05:43,126 --> 02:05:43,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Techness, my bad.

1779
02:05:44,187 --> 02:05:49,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Technus says, from the press conferences, I'd say what Ubisoft announced pretty much blew the big three away.

1780
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:56,353
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a great combination of going in strong with their existing IPs and finishing with Watch Dogs, a game that sounds as amazing as it looks.

1781
02:05:56,854 --> 02:06:00,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I would also like to mention that the tech demos for the new next-gen engines, i.e.

1782
02:06:00,415 --> 02:06:05,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Unreal Engine 4, CryEngine 3, Final Fantasy tech demo, look extremely impressive.

1783
02:06:05,598 --> 02:06:07,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Overall, I was pleased with this E3.

1784
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:12,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for Microsoft, in which I ask, please stick to the game, save the multimedia info for CES.

1785
02:06:14,603 --> 02:06:18,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Good point there about the tech demos for the next-gen stuff.

1786
02:06:19,289 --> 02:06:20,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of that stuff was really impressive.

1787
02:06:20,871 --> 02:06:23,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, you know, just when you think the graphics can't get any better...

1788
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:25,350
[SPEAKER_12]: There they go.

1789
02:06:25,811 --> 02:06:26,351
[SPEAKER_12]: They get better.

1790
02:06:27,792 --> 02:06:35,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, going to a comment from Robaba on Google Plus says, I think the understated highlight was Smart Glass.

1791
02:06:35,558 --> 02:06:38,740
[SPEAKER_12]: If they use its potential, it will pretty much derail the Wii U tablet controller.

1792
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:43,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong, I want the Wii U to succeed, but it will have to be truly awesome to be successful.

1793
02:06:43,363 --> 02:06:49,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still waiting for the delay in release to 2013 because their marketing should be almost full swing by now to release in the fall.

1794
02:06:49,688 --> 02:06:51,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Predicting that Wii U may just delay.

1795
02:06:52,089 --> 02:06:53,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think Nintendo can afford it.

1796
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:54,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Their stock

1797
02:06:54,411 --> 02:06:55,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't like too many shooters.

1798
02:07:08,206 --> 02:07:11,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1799
02:07:11,229 --> 02:07:19,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Picaruno answered and said, probably going to get some shit from someone for this, but apart from Assassin's Creed 3, none of the games on offer wowed me.

1800
02:07:19,897 --> 02:07:23,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonder Book is a great idea, but its implementation on the PlayStation 3 is stupid.

1801
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,502
[SPEAKER_12]: It would sell a lot better on iOS.

1802
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:27,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I'm going to say about Wonderbook.

1803
02:07:27,881 --> 02:07:29,784
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to bomb as bad as I have judgment.

1804
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:43,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, where the fuck were the Vita games, Sony?

1805
02:07:45,364 --> 02:07:48,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Flaco Jones says... Again, the thing that most excited you about E3.

1806
02:07:48,467 --> 02:07:49,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment says...

1807
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:02,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Quantic Dreams Beyond Two Souls stood out for me.

1808
02:08:02,922 --> 02:08:03,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved Heavy Rain.

1809
02:08:03,883 --> 02:08:05,744
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought a PlayStation Move just to play again.

1810
02:08:06,104 --> 02:08:09,187
[SPEAKER_12]: When I saw Beyond Two Souls, I made a mental note to buy this game.

1811
02:08:09,507 --> 02:08:13,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I made a note on my Droid that reads, buy Beyond Two Souls the day that it comes out.

1812
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:16,272
[SPEAKER_12]: That's two people in a row excited about Beyond Two Souls.

1813
02:08:16,492 --> 02:08:21,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Metal Gear Solid game, or it's not Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising game actually is pretty awesome.

1814
02:08:22,154 --> 02:08:26,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Shane from Horde House commented and said, I'd have an addition to my previous statement, which was about Mass Effect 3.

1815
02:08:27,158 --> 02:08:33,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say Mass Effect 3, Wii U, Beyond Two Souls, here it is again, Watch Dogs, and Last of Us were the only things I cared about at E3.

1816
02:08:34,084 --> 02:08:35,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm super hyped for those games.

1817
02:08:35,885 --> 02:08:41,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, completely forgot about Last of Us, one of the big games that they showed, and that was one of their two IPs that they introduced.

1818
02:08:41,309 --> 02:08:43,010
[SPEAKER_12]: But granted, we knew about that one already.

1819
02:08:43,371 --> 02:08:43,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1820
02:08:44,091 --> 02:08:45,572
[SPEAKER_12]: The Last Ofus.

1821
02:08:45,633 --> 02:08:47,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sad it's no longer the Last Ofus.

1822
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:57,277
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerCaw says, I think the highlights for this year's E3 was Ubisoft with their accidental nip slips up courtesy of Far Cry 3 and the unveiling of the new game Watch Dogs.

1823
02:08:57,638 --> 02:09:02,021
[SPEAKER_12]: The new game from the creators of Heavy Rain called Beyond Two Souls during the Sony press conference.

1824
02:09:02,502 --> 02:09:04,283
[SPEAKER_12]: As for Nintendo, Zombie Reggie.

1825
02:09:04,784 --> 02:09:05,224
[SPEAKER_12]: That is all.

1826
02:09:08,033 --> 02:09:11,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you happen to watch the video of the pre-E3 conference?

1827
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:11,916
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit.

1828
02:09:11,976 --> 02:09:17,300
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is up with Miyamoto holding a banana?

1829
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:19,841
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of bananas for no reason.

1830
02:09:19,861 --> 02:09:20,842
[SPEAKER_10]: He wanted to be a gif.

1831
02:09:21,803 --> 02:09:23,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Ronnie B says, I agree with Picaruno.

1832
02:09:23,724 --> 02:09:27,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Assassin's Creed 3 and the concept for Beyond were the only games that stood out for me, really.

1833
02:09:27,567 --> 02:09:28,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate what they've done with Dead Space.

1834
02:09:29,708 --> 02:09:32,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Stan says, hate on me all you want, but Pikmin 3 looks so fun.

1835
02:09:33,213 --> 02:09:36,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I almost went out and bought Pikmin 1 and 2 just from watching 3's trailer.

1836
02:09:36,718 --> 02:09:41,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now would be a great time to rebuy 2, because didn't the new control version come out, Loki?

1837
02:09:41,686 --> 02:09:42,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that out here in the States?

1838
02:09:42,547 --> 02:09:44,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikmin 2, yeah, just came out today.

1839
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:45,010
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1840
02:09:46,592 --> 02:10:00,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Acidic Vampire says I'm stoked for South Park RPG, Tomb Raider, Beyond Two Souls, The Last of Us, Pikmin 3 and Dead Space 3 Oh and the upcoming PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 with a gimmicky controller aka the Wii U Actually I'm not enthralled by it

1841
02:10:01,929 --> 02:10:04,951
[SPEAKER_12]: RedTheHaze says Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising.

1842
02:10:05,071 --> 02:10:06,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Screw the haters saying that they're similar.

1843
02:10:07,252 --> 02:10:11,375
[SPEAKER_12]: They should shut up about games that aren't out and that they haven't played before.

1844
02:10:11,555 --> 02:10:16,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and the Ellen Page waifu simulators, which is the new emerging video game genre.

1845
02:10:17,338 --> 02:10:20,740
[SPEAKER_12]: That's because Ellen Page is heavily inspired in The Last of Us, right?

1846
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:22,721
[SPEAKER_12]: In one of the characters based off her?

1847
02:10:23,081 --> 02:10:23,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of?

1848
02:10:23,501 --> 02:10:24,942
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the characters looks like her.

1849
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:29,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let me do one more comment here.

1850
02:10:30,124 --> 02:10:30,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, two more.

1851
02:10:31,246 --> 02:10:37,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Critical Myth said, Highlight was the Square Enix next-gen demo, but for right now, I'm most looking forward to The Last of Us.

1852
02:10:38,315 --> 02:10:39,998
[SPEAKER_12]: At least we have a good idea when it's hitting the shelves.

1853
02:10:40,058 --> 02:10:41,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And lastly, from DarkCharger,

1854
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:43,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing particularly stood out.

1855
02:10:44,662 --> 02:10:47,984
[SPEAKER_12]: E3 this year is about the whole show being greater than the sum of its parts.

1856
02:10:48,345 --> 02:10:57,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Despite the lack of a single bombshell, the many games, mostly third parties, were enough to keep it not only my attention, but have me checking the calendar for several important releases.

1857
02:10:57,391 --> 02:11:03,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps entering E3 with tempered expectations ensures that I, or the gamer in general, always wins.

1858
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:06,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting final note, but a good one I think.

1859
02:11:07,678 --> 02:11:09,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

1860
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:30,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of pressure would be off.

1861
02:11:47,688 --> 02:11:50,570
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1862
02:12:08,866 --> 02:12:09,988
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's going to be interesting.

1863
02:12:10,608 --> 02:12:17,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really curious to see what happens because, you know, when the Wii first came out, there was a lot of us going, what the hell is that name?

1864
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:20,062
[SPEAKER_12]: But it worked, so we'll see.

1865
02:12:20,183 --> 02:12:20,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Wii U.

1866
02:12:23,423 --> 02:12:24,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you know what?

1867
02:12:25,004 --> 02:12:28,586
[SPEAKER_10]: At the very least, we still have the Kung Pao jokes.

1868
02:12:28,786 --> 02:12:36,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And any attention given back to Kung Pao is more attention and possibility for a sequel to that movie.

1869
02:12:36,849 --> 02:12:38,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadow Next Gen brings up a good point.

1870
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:40,891
[SPEAKER_12]: The DVD format on the 360 is becoming a serious issue.

1871
02:12:42,192 --> 02:12:45,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it can't afford to be DVD only much longer.

1872
02:12:45,753 --> 02:12:49,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I guess there is always digital, but it's not really going to help.

1873
02:12:51,196 --> 02:12:54,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there's always a possibility that they'll have game installs.

1874
02:12:55,119 --> 02:13:00,362
[SPEAKER_10]: They have it on the PlayStation 3, so just have it now where it comes with chips on three disks, but you only need one.

1875
02:13:00,962 --> 02:13:01,943
[SPEAKER_10]: You can install the other two.

1876
02:13:02,123 --> 02:13:06,086
[SPEAKER_12]: But technically, you can buy an Xbox 360 without a hard drive, so that shit shouldn't be required.

1877
02:13:06,846 --> 02:13:08,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, it still has four gigs.

1878
02:13:09,027 --> 02:13:10,909
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not enough for some games.

1879
02:13:11,549 --> 02:13:11,909
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1880
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,450
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1881
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:14,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on with some more stories.

1882
02:13:14,151 --> 02:13:17,032
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to get to the mailbag of the FU's of the week, and of course, your phone calls.

1883
02:13:17,052 --> 02:13:18,734
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's try to get through these stories kind of quick here.

1884
02:13:18,894 --> 02:13:19,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1885
02:13:19,894 --> 02:13:21,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so real quick.

1886
02:13:22,155 --> 02:13:30,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently Vivendi is looking to sell part or all of their stock in Activision.

1887
02:13:30,318 --> 02:13:37,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course Vivendi owns 61% of the controlling stake in Activision.

1888
02:13:37,960 --> 02:14:06,378
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently they're holding a meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss the potential for the sale of part or all of its holdings and basically I think they're trying to drum up some more money and basically they're saying some people believe that Vividi is worth more if it's split up into various parts and the potential split doesn't really mean anything for Activision other than a lot of shares on the market all at once.

1889
02:14:08,809 --> 02:14:21,413
[SPEAKER_10]: so yeah I don't really think it means a whole lot other than you know one company is not really going to own anything although it is kind of sad when you think about Vivendi did purchase all these other companies when they bought Activision and

1890
02:14:22,583 --> 02:14:24,444
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like a weird time to sell it off.

1891
02:14:45,498 --> 02:14:45,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Get rid of it.

1892
02:14:46,018 --> 02:14:52,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they're a little worried about some of this Diablo 3 fallout, and maybe they're worried about the next WoW expansion, and maybe this new Blizzard product.

1893
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:54,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm focusing on Blizzard, but I can't help myself.

1894
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's... I think they just want money.

1895
02:14:57,961 --> 02:14:58,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Sell off some shares.

1896
02:14:58,921 --> 02:14:59,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And who doesn't?

1897
02:15:00,081 --> 02:15:00,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Retire.

1898
02:15:00,982 --> 02:15:11,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Sega doesn't want money, clearly, because they took Hatsune Miku Project Diva F for the Vita to E3 to show it off, and then said, oh, it's not coming out in North America.

1899
02:15:11,824 --> 02:15:12,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is very weird.

1900
02:15:12,965 --> 02:15:13,905
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very weird.

1901
02:15:14,045 --> 02:15:17,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually games don't show up at E3 that aren't coming out in North America.

1902
02:15:17,387 --> 02:15:22,089
[SPEAKER_12]: But according to a Sega rep, it was a sneak peek of a game coming to Japan.

1903
02:15:22,389 --> 02:15:25,251
[SPEAKER_12]: There are many Project D.Va fans out there, like DarkSakura.

1904
02:15:26,211 --> 02:15:28,733
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is disappointing to hear that this will not be coming out.

1905
02:15:28,953 --> 02:15:30,673
[SPEAKER_12]: However, Vita is region free, right?

1906
02:15:30,714 --> 02:15:31,094
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

1907
02:15:31,234 --> 02:15:33,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could always just import it.

1908
02:15:33,275 --> 02:15:35,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this is all hint, hint, hint.

1909
02:15:35,676 --> 02:15:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming to America.

1910
02:15:37,137 --> 02:15:37,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Hint, wink.

1911
02:15:38,778 --> 02:15:39,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Import.

1912
02:15:40,357 --> 02:15:41,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1913
02:15:41,538 --> 02:15:49,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here on the show.

1914
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:50,881
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag.

1915
02:15:51,221 --> 02:15:55,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Head first again at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and pick out some of our favorite emails to read right now.

1916
02:15:56,303 --> 02:15:58,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to read all the ones that are in there.

1917
02:15:58,565 --> 02:15:59,305
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not very long.

1918
02:16:00,206 --> 02:16:02,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey OLR, quick question for all three hosts.

1919
02:16:02,067 --> 02:16:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all the games you saw presented at this year's E3, which ones are you planning to buy on day one, if any?

1920
02:16:07,631 --> 02:16:12,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I'm interested in Beyond Two Souls, and I want to play Tank, Tank, Tank.

1921
02:16:14,055 --> 02:16:16,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm sorry, that game is freaking addictive as hell.

1922
02:16:17,357 --> 02:16:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'm not super interested in hardly anything, so...

1923
02:16:21,538 --> 02:16:42,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little behind still I feel but I definitely want that new Tomb Raider game I'll probably end up getting the Wii U I don't know to be determined that Ubisoft game Watch Dogs looks really good too I might check that out Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U

1924
02:16:44,758 --> 02:16:53,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Borderlands 2 for sure, South Park, The Sick of Truth, and... Oh yeah, I totally want that South Park game too.

1925
02:16:53,529 --> 02:16:53,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1926
02:16:57,432 --> 02:16:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really know, those are the only two that jumped out right now.

1927
02:16:59,533 --> 02:17:01,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto V, whenever the hell that fucking comes out.

1928
02:17:01,833 --> 02:17:02,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, where was that?

1929
02:17:03,173 --> 02:17:03,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh, it's not ready yet.

1930
02:17:04,394 --> 02:17:04,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Jerks.

1931
02:17:04,894 --> 02:17:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably think, hey, well, Take-Two's not really at, you know, they aren't really at E3.

1932
02:17:10,175 --> 02:17:11,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Their booth always has an electric fence.

1933
02:17:11,875 --> 02:17:15,736
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they probably, you know, maybe it's just not ready to show off yet.

1934
02:17:15,756 --> 02:17:19,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, if you think about it, it's probably about a year away from being released, so...

1935
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:21,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Osfer P.S.

1936
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:25,121
[SPEAKER_10]: All my love goes to the Krogan, but I guess I can spare some for my fellow Mass Effect gamers

1937
02:17:43,848 --> 02:17:47,770
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, actually, speaking of titties, Far Cry 3 actually looks pretty awesome.

1938
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:49,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually may pick that up day one.

1939
02:17:49,890 --> 02:17:51,611
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what game looked ridiculous?

1940
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:57,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan made me watch the trailer last night, that Hitman Absolution.

1941
02:17:57,553 --> 02:17:58,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, the trailer was ridiculous.

1942
02:17:58,894 --> 02:18:02,895
[SPEAKER_12]: The trailer was totally ridiculous with the stripper nuns and guns.

1943
02:18:03,315 --> 02:18:05,676
[SPEAKER_12]: They're trying to think, like, this is all the things that boys like.

1944
02:18:05,896 --> 02:18:16,797
[SPEAKER_10]: don't forget exploding toilets well even like a lot of people in the industry are just like what the fuck was that trailer that just makes no sense the game looks pretty good anyhow

1945
02:18:19,162 --> 02:18:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert M here you guys mentioned Retro City Rampage's Meat Boy minigame on last week's pre-taped hate that word taped show last month's Nintendo Power had a feature on the game for WiiWare including Explosion Man minigame as well not sure how that works license wise I get the impression that this will join Meat Boy and Spelunky as unreleased especially this late in the Wii's life cycle for what other consoles is it scheduled?

1946
02:18:47,290 --> 02:19:09,096
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the voice of Geeks Network, how practical do you expect it will be for shows doing video content, under Sedation Live in particular, to have a video podcast feed?

1947
02:19:09,737 --> 02:19:14,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when he was doing Friday Night Gaming, Bobby said such a feed would be three gigabytes an episode.

1948
02:19:16,317 --> 02:19:21,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the problem is you have to compress the video and then it's tricky.

1949
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:23,421
[SPEAKER_12]: It's tricky to do something like that.

1950
02:19:25,042 --> 02:19:29,684
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, yeah, video podcasts are hard and there haven't been a lot of successful ones that are over.

1951
02:19:29,944 --> 02:19:32,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, most of them are like five minutes long.

1952
02:19:32,685 --> 02:19:39,269
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how they deliver the video podcast because five minutes worth of HD video is like our three-hour show.

1953
02:19:39,289 --> 02:19:40,909
[SPEAKER_12]: They're about the same size.

1954
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of them that you just post them to YouTube.

1955
02:19:44,091 --> 02:19:44,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's true.

1956
02:19:45,992 --> 02:19:50,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Travis has been putting clips on YouTube and so forth, and I'd certainly encourage him to continue doing that.

1957
02:19:50,574 --> 02:19:57,737
[SPEAKER_12]: But for now, I think him particularly is very about getting people in for the live experience.

1958
02:19:58,317 --> 02:20:04,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think he's going to take a whole lot of effort to try and get the video up when he is putting the audio out there at least.

1959
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:05,600
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will say this.

1960
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:06,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Give mad props to Travis.

1961
02:20:07,441 --> 02:20:26,020
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got that shit on same day turnaround now Like forever we were like Travis get season 5 up Travis get season 5 up He's worked out a system where he's on same day turnaround now So props to him I think that is important too I finally saw the disco thing Disco disco Good lord It made me glad I didn't have a webcam at the time

1962
02:20:28,142 --> 02:20:29,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God, did he put that on YouTube?

1963
02:20:29,843 --> 02:20:30,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1964
02:20:30,584 --> 02:20:32,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1965
02:20:32,866 --> 02:20:33,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't look.

1966
02:20:34,667 --> 02:20:35,247
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say this.

1967
02:20:35,708 --> 02:20:41,132
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking at doing more type of like vlog content because like Travis did that studio tour that went up during the week.

1968
02:20:41,252 --> 02:20:46,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to do one that's a little more talking head, but I've got one coming up in the next week.

1969
02:20:48,437 --> 02:20:49,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Should I spoil it?

1970
02:20:49,898 --> 02:20:50,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Spoil!

1971
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:51,561
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll say this much.

1972
02:20:51,581 --> 02:20:52,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll drop a hint.

1973
02:20:53,123 --> 02:20:57,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to explain why I am not doing a particular podcast.

1974
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:03,199
[SPEAKER_12]: People have been asking me to do a podcast on a certain topic and I'm going to explain in depth why that's not going to happen and sorry.

1975
02:21:04,902 --> 02:21:05,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1976
02:21:07,508 --> 02:21:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So to continue with the email.

1977
02:21:09,149 --> 02:21:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the Voice of Geeks Network, how... Oh, never mind.

1978
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:12,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I already read that.

1979
02:21:12,109 --> 02:21:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah.

1980
02:21:12,830 --> 02:21:14,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1981
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:15,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.

1982
02:21:15,850 --> 02:21:16,831
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you're sexist.

1983
02:21:17,291 --> 02:21:17,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1984
02:21:18,691 --> 02:21:23,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just finished watching the E3 press conferences.

1985
02:21:23,713 --> 02:21:32,095
[SPEAKER_02]: While I was really looking forward to what Microsoft and Nintendo had to offer and didn't really expect much from Sony, I ended up liking the fact that Sony focused on games for the most part.

1986
02:21:32,635 --> 02:21:38,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really considering the Wii U since I thought it would be next-gen system that would get all the new games that other systems shared.

1987
02:21:39,278 --> 02:21:40,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus Mario and Zelda.

1988
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:46,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, after their press conference, it seemed like they were focusing too much on the gimmicks and the multi-console games were all out of date.

1989
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:49,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'll have to pass on that.

1990
02:21:49,682 --> 02:21:53,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I did think the new Kinect features and the smart glass that Microsoft presented were cool.

1991
02:21:54,026 --> 02:22:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when it comes to games, I just don't care about getting into Halo or Gears of War after all this time, and they didn't offer anything new game-wise.

1992
02:22:02,833 --> 02:22:04,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony still won me over with their exclusives.

1993
02:22:05,015 --> 02:22:08,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved Heavy Rain, so I will be buying Beyond right away.

1994
02:22:09,298 --> 02:22:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: The Last of Us looked like a great way to tell a different kind of story with the already proven Uncharted game engine.

1995
02:22:15,643 --> 02:22:22,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I don't care much about God of War or PlayStation All-Source It's All-Stars, not All-Source All-Source?

1996
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:26,544
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the amazing game where you fight STDs

1997
02:22:28,789 --> 02:22:29,429
[SPEAKER_05]: That is important.

1998
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh God, it's Herpes Man.

1999
02:22:31,331 --> 02:22:31,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Power up.

2000
02:22:32,391 --> 02:22:33,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Bed sores.

2001
02:22:33,632 --> 02:22:35,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Herpes Man versus Mrs. Gonorrhea.

2002
02:22:35,553 --> 02:22:36,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Ringworm gun.

2003
02:22:37,894 --> 02:22:38,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Ringworm gym.

2004
02:22:38,955 --> 02:22:40,136
[SPEAKER_02]: No, ringworm gun.

2005
02:22:41,536 --> 02:22:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2006
02:22:43,577 --> 02:22:44,398
[SPEAKER_02]: All stars.

2007
02:22:45,579 --> 02:22:49,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still nice that Sony is delivering for fans of those types of games as well.

2008
02:22:50,141 --> 02:22:53,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish Wii U wasn't trying to ram this new controller down our throats.

2009
02:22:53,602 --> 02:22:54,503
[SPEAKER_02]: More like up your ass.

2010
02:22:56,043 --> 02:22:59,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's not just swallow it, it's take it as a suppository, too.

2011
02:23:00,505 --> 02:23:08,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I had high hopes when I saw the Pro Controller that there would be an alternative, but they aren't even getting the awesome-looking Watch Dogs game.

2012
02:23:09,168 --> 02:23:10,429
[SPEAKER_02]: At least not when it comes out.

2013
02:23:10,469 --> 02:23:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: That means no Mario or Zelda for me, as long as they keep pushing gimmicky controls.

2014
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:15,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from FlacoJones.

2015
02:23:16,364 --> 02:23:17,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the other thing, too.

2016
02:23:17,705 --> 02:23:27,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, it gets me thinking about the Wii U. Their biggest features that they were pimping out... This system can be played when someone wants to watch TV.

2017
02:23:28,608 --> 02:23:30,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't understand that.

2018
02:23:30,829 --> 02:23:33,830
[SPEAKER_10]: This system is supposed to be so awesome that you want to play it on your TV.

2019
02:23:34,250 --> 02:23:36,691
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of people probably have multiple TVs they can play it on.

2020
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:40,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand why that's necessarily a feature that we need to be pimping out.

2021
02:23:40,933 --> 02:23:41,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And, once again...

2022
02:23:42,213 --> 02:23:46,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the Wii was, they're pimping it as like this party environment.

2023
02:23:46,255 --> 02:23:51,557
[SPEAKER_10]: That all these party games, you know, like Just Dance has this, you know, Puppet Master mode.

2024
02:23:51,657 --> 02:23:52,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, guess what?

2025
02:23:53,078 --> 02:23:57,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I hardly ever have people over to my house to play games nowadays because I have a kid.

2026
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't just be getting the party going and, you know, oh, hey, we gotta be quiet because we have the kid there.

2027
02:24:04,444 --> 02:24:05,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have that.

2028
02:24:05,766 --> 02:24:11,294
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that New Super Mario Bros.

2029
02:24:11,795 --> 02:24:19,206
[SPEAKER_10]: U or Rayman Legends has five-player co-op, I can't get two-player co-op in my household, let alone five people.

2030
02:24:19,833 --> 02:24:25,557
[SPEAKER_12]: BlackWolf says, you know, if they didn't spend all that time discussing the new controller, we would have been like, wait, why did you not give us more information on the controller?

2031
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:49,051
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we wouldn't have.

2032
02:24:49,211 --> 02:24:49,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they would have.

2033
02:24:50,412 --> 02:24:51,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with them.

2034
02:24:51,633 --> 02:24:53,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're just in the same boat that I am.

2035
02:24:53,674 --> 02:24:54,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't care.

2036
02:24:54,615 --> 02:24:56,636
[SPEAKER_10]: What more information did we get about their controller?

2037
02:24:57,837 --> 02:25:03,721
[SPEAKER_12]: The quote-unquote final design and the whole fact that you can use two of them now, which was a big thing people were bitching about last year.

2038
02:25:03,741 --> 02:25:04,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not important, though.

2039
02:25:04,422 --> 02:25:09,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you think about it, that's not important because we didn't see any games that used two of them, so who knows how that's going to be utilized.

2040
02:25:09,445 --> 02:25:10,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And we already saw the final design.

2041
02:25:10,506 --> 02:25:11,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It got leaked out already.

2042
02:25:12,287 --> 02:25:15,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So what did we need to know about the controller that we didn't know already?

2043
02:25:15,509 --> 02:25:16,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to the email.

2044
02:25:16,169 --> 02:25:16,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read the last email?

2045
02:25:18,359 --> 02:25:19,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, OLR.

2046
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:20,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2047
02:25:21,222 --> 02:25:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd say hi and keep up the good work.

2048
02:25:23,585 --> 02:25:25,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Your show helps make my Mondays bearable at work.

2049
02:25:26,748 --> 02:25:29,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions of E3.

2050
02:25:29,411 --> 02:25:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing.

2051
02:25:29,992 --> 02:25:36,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought my first smartphone and was wondering if there are any apps and or games do you think I'd be crazy not to get?

2052
02:25:36,459 --> 02:25:38,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace and chicken grease, Serious Turtle.

2053
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:38,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2054
02:25:40,575 --> 02:25:42,538
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what kind of phone you have too.

2055
02:25:42,598 --> 02:25:43,519
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know what kind of phone.

2056
02:25:43,539 --> 02:25:45,802
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a big difference between Android and iOS.

2057
02:25:46,183 --> 02:25:47,665
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some games that are between both.

2058
02:25:49,587 --> 02:25:51,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Cut the Rope.

2059
02:25:52,972 --> 02:25:53,593
[SPEAKER_12]: And Temple Run.

2060
02:25:53,653 --> 02:25:55,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so addicted to Temple Run recently.

2061
02:25:55,975 --> 02:25:59,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Bubble Bobble, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble, best move.

2062
02:26:00,277 --> 02:26:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Played the crap out of it.

2063
02:26:02,317 --> 02:26:15,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, it is, you know, that, I actually really liked Espagobluta 2, and I really, you know, as far as, you know,

2064
02:26:16,414 --> 02:26:17,375
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy

2065
02:26:43,712 --> 02:26:44,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Both are worth getting.

2066
02:26:44,833 --> 02:26:45,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

2067
02:26:45,093 --> 02:26:46,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Robot Unicorn Attack, Peggle.

2068
02:26:46,734 --> 02:26:47,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Plants vs. Zombies.

2069
02:26:47,874 --> 02:26:49,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat Hazard is on iOS now.

2070
02:26:49,615 --> 02:26:51,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants vs. Zombies I don't really like so much on the iPhone.

2071
02:26:52,256 --> 02:26:53,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It would need a larger thing.

2072
02:26:54,758 --> 02:26:59,280
[SPEAKER_02]: R-Type actually, believe it or not, R-Type is one of the few shooters that works very well on the iPhone.

2073
02:27:00,801 --> 02:27:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just seeing what else I have.

2074
02:27:01,741 --> 02:27:04,743
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as regular apps, I've got Facebook.

2075
02:27:05,143 --> 02:27:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: For Twitter I use Echo Phone.

2076
02:27:07,004 --> 02:27:08,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid for Echo Phone and it's worth it.

2077
02:27:08,685 --> 02:27:09,585
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're on iOS, Flipboard.

2078
02:27:09,826 --> 02:27:10,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Flipboard.

2079
02:27:11,764 --> 02:27:15,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have the Tumblr app, Goodreads, because I like to share my books.

2080
02:27:15,529 --> 02:27:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The Steam app, AIM, Pinterest.

2081
02:27:17,572 --> 02:27:19,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got all the usual stuff.

2082
02:27:19,555 --> 02:27:21,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And then... Xtube?

2083
02:27:21,157 --> 02:27:21,978
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that, Jamie?

2084
02:27:22,119 --> 02:27:22,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Just kidding.

2085
02:27:23,618 --> 02:27:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got a program that when I go to eat out I use called Check Please that actually splits your meal, includes or disincludes tip and lets you go up to 30% tip.

2086
02:27:34,923 --> 02:27:35,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, downloading that right now.

2087
02:27:36,683 --> 02:27:42,686
[SPEAKER_02]: QR Reader because of all the stuff using QR codes now and actually a really neat little clock program called Nuka.

2088
02:27:43,226 --> 02:27:50,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuka does all these interesting different digital watches and the Nuka app is actually pretty fun to play with and has neat timers and everything and

2089
02:27:51,989 --> 02:27:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Secret Garden that Ikuma JP did.

2090
02:27:55,451 --> 02:27:57,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Shazam all the time.

2091
02:27:57,132 --> 02:27:59,073
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to go through all seven pages of your phone, are you?

2092
02:27:59,093 --> 02:27:59,353
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.

2093
02:27:59,373 --> 02:28:00,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picking the best ones.

2094
02:28:01,414 --> 02:28:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Kindle app.

2095
02:28:02,695 --> 02:28:09,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Shazam because I go to Pinkberry and like the music, so I'll tag the music at Pinkberry and then I usually go and download albums.

2096
02:28:10,399 --> 02:28:12,940
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're playing Mass Effect 3, get the data pad.

2097
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,801
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just lots of good stuff.

2098
02:28:15,961 --> 02:28:20,484
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to Disneyland, use Mouse Wait so that you know how long you have to wait for

2099
02:28:21,164 --> 02:28:41,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Space Mountain but really those are just some good ones and that was the last email awesome just root your phone and download them all for free alright let's move on with the FUs of the week because some things at E3 might have made us angry or maybe stuff IRL we're going to find out right now

2100
02:28:57,133 --> 02:29:03,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really upset about anything except for my nail polish deciding that it all wouldn't come off tonight and my nails are kind of brittle.

2101
02:29:06,793 --> 02:29:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, fucking to my throat for being sore.

2102
02:29:09,916 --> 02:29:11,778
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really, I don't know, it's like a weird thing.

2103
02:29:11,798 --> 02:29:14,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's allergies or if it's cold or strep throat or what.

2104
02:29:15,301 --> 02:29:20,305
[SPEAKER_10]: But for, like, the last two weeks, my throat's just been, like, I'll get sharp pains every now and then.

2105
02:29:20,645 --> 02:29:25,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And you might, I feel really raspy right now because I talk a lot, you know?

2106
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, like, I'll just all of a sudden I'll be, like, talking and I'm like...

2107
02:29:31,493 --> 02:29:43,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to keep all my body parts intact, even the unnecessary ones.

2108
02:29:45,056 --> 02:29:45,836
[SPEAKER_02]: They are necessary.

2109
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:48,137
[SPEAKER_02]: They do serve a purpose until they get infected.

2110
02:29:50,437 --> 02:29:52,858
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still have everything I was born with except for my wisdom teeth.

2111
02:29:54,275 --> 02:29:54,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Lucky you.

2112
02:29:55,255 --> 02:29:56,316
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm missing a gallbladder.

2113
02:29:56,376 --> 02:29:57,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm missing wisdom teeth.

2114
02:29:57,596 --> 02:29:58,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

2115
02:29:58,976 --> 02:29:59,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on.

2116
02:30:00,497 --> 02:30:04,758
[SPEAKER_12]: My FU of the week goes to, believe it or not, this is going to shock you, Disneyland.

2117
02:30:05,378 --> 02:30:05,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

2118
02:30:05,878 --> 02:30:07,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Disneyland on Wednesday was a fucking hot mess.

2119
02:30:08,219 --> 02:30:08,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.

2120
02:30:09,499 --> 02:30:15,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess all those people were there for the Cars Land preview, the cast members, and that must have been all the veteran cast members because the noobs were running the place.

2121
02:30:16,281 --> 02:30:19,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And, yeah, just so crowded, especially for a Wednesday.

2122
02:30:20,021 --> 02:30:21,342
[SPEAKER_12]: And I get that it's summer.

2123
02:30:22,182 --> 02:30:27,465
[SPEAKER_12]: But I've gone E3 week the last like three years and I've never had an experience as terrible as last week.

2124
02:30:27,505 --> 02:30:29,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Like every other year has been relatively good.

2125
02:30:29,505 --> 02:30:30,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Rob.

2126
02:30:30,146 --> 02:30:31,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know because I didn't get to go.

2127
02:30:31,466 --> 02:30:33,787
[SPEAKER_02]: How bad did the Mad Tea Party blow?

2128
02:30:34,048 --> 02:30:37,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't, it wasn't running weeknights, but I did see the decorations.

2129
02:30:37,469 --> 02:30:38,710
[SPEAKER_12]: The decorations look great.

2130
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:40,891
[SPEAKER_12]: They spent a lot of money on them, which kind of pissed me off.

2131
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:42,431
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends were there this past weekend.

2132
02:30:43,012 --> 02:30:45,413
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it was the worst thing to ever happen.

2133
02:30:46,133 --> 02:30:46,613
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

2134
02:30:46,873 --> 02:30:47,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2135
02:30:47,813 --> 02:30:49,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically, what did he call it?

2136
02:30:49,594 --> 02:30:50,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The mad suck party or something?

2137
02:30:50,994 --> 02:30:51,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The mad flop party.

2138
02:30:52,095 --> 02:30:52,995
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a mad flop party.

2139
02:30:53,015 --> 02:30:54,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to call it the mad flop party.

2140
02:30:55,195 --> 02:31:05,318
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, the one thing that bugged me most of all is that Disney don't give celebrities the royal treatment and shut down the entire fucking ride just because one celebrity wants to ride it.

2141
02:31:05,658 --> 02:31:14,483
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to... I'm not saying... Look, I get if you want to have the little ushers, bring them up the exit and give them a little bit of special treatment, but you don't stop the entire fucking ride because the celebrity's on it.

2142
02:31:14,563 --> 02:31:16,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if it's Barack Obama.

2143
02:31:17,164 --> 02:31:18,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care who it is.

2144
02:31:18,065 --> 02:31:18,745
[SPEAKER_12]: That is kind of lame.

2145
02:31:19,086 --> 02:31:20,786
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't stop for everybody else.

2146
02:31:21,347 --> 02:31:23,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was the celebrity?

2147
02:31:23,308 --> 02:31:25,069
[SPEAKER_12]: David Beckham and his wife, Posh Spice.

2148
02:31:25,669 --> 02:31:26,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame.

2149
02:31:27,470 --> 02:31:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they could do it at least for like a real celebrity like Neil Patrick Harris.

2150
02:31:32,915 --> 02:31:34,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, that just kind of ticked me off.

2151
02:31:34,757 --> 02:31:43,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So, meanwhile, let's get back into... I know, I know, I just did not have a good experience on Wednesday and that ticked me off because it was like Extifer and Matt's first experience at Disneyland.

2152
02:31:44,106 --> 02:31:46,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And they enjoyed themselves because we had a really good time on Monday.

2153
02:31:46,748 --> 02:31:47,989
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't nearly as bad.

2154
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:51,012
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to fit in a lot of the good stuff, but Wednesday was a mess.

2155
02:31:53,614 --> 02:31:55,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I could go on and on, but I won't.

2156
02:31:55,775 --> 02:31:58,316
[SPEAKER_12]: So meanwhile, Loki, let's get back into the gaming news.

2157
02:31:59,116 --> 02:32:02,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Twitter topics, a few, and then Skype line most of all in a little bit.

2158
02:32:03,138 --> 02:32:11,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the rumors that we were supposed to get out of E3 was that one of these streaming companies is supposed to be partner of a console, but we didn't see that.

2159
02:32:11,681 --> 02:32:15,083
[SPEAKER_10]: No on live or no Gaikai teaming up with consoles, but...

2160
02:32:16,083 --> 02:32:27,247
[SPEAKER_10]: OnLive did say that they are going to be teaming up with smart TV manufacturers including LG smart TVs with Google TV and internet browsers as well.

2161
02:32:28,227 --> 02:32:43,713
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be allowing the online servers to be used in browser which is kind of neat and of course if you have one of those smart TVs you can download an app that will allow you to stream stuff and then you just have to buy the controller as well.

2162
02:32:46,038 --> 02:32:46,598
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of neat.

2163
02:32:47,019 --> 02:32:49,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

2164
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:54,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen smart TVs, you know, take off yet, but I mean, I'm sure in the future we're going to see that.

2165
02:32:54,743 --> 02:32:59,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, everything's fucking connected to the internet now, so pretty cool.

2166
02:32:59,785 --> 02:33:02,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, one of the games they're showing on there is Borderlands and it looks sexy.

2167
02:33:03,487 --> 02:33:09,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo is working on the system to figure out how Wii owners are going to transfer their content to the Wii U

2168
02:33:27,043 --> 02:33:42,923
[SPEAKER_12]: designer Katsuya Iguchi said we are readying the system yes to transfer saves and everything you've bought so the good news is if you bought virtual console stuff and WiiWare stuff they're going to transfer over to the Wii U and it doesn't sound like they're going to charge you more for it or try to sell it to you again

2169
02:33:45,026 --> 02:33:45,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

2170
02:33:45,987 --> 02:33:46,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good.

2171
02:33:46,868 --> 02:33:47,749
[SPEAKER_12]: That is very good.

2172
02:33:48,009 --> 02:33:49,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a cookie, Nintendo.

2173
02:33:49,631 --> 02:33:53,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if it's being done with the friend code, because that would be tied to the console.

2174
02:33:54,075 --> 02:33:54,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

2175
02:33:54,676 --> 02:33:54,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

2176
02:33:55,397 --> 02:34:00,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, while there's good news, we have to, of course, follow that up with a little bit of WTF news.

2177
02:34:01,463 --> 02:34:05,027
[SPEAKER_12]: That whole Miiverse thing, it came out after the show that...

2178
02:34:05,507 --> 02:34:08,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Miiverse, which will allow you to kind of like post messages.

2179
02:34:08,788 --> 02:34:11,609
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like the Nintendo Social Network, I guess, for lack of a better term.

2180
02:34:12,409 --> 02:34:16,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Satoru Iwata said there will be filtering on the Miiverse content.

2181
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:18,811
[SPEAKER_12]: The first will be automatic content filtering.

2182
02:34:18,871 --> 02:34:25,573
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you post something that's like, fuck you and your fucking dog, it's going to hit that filter because it says the F word and won't post.

2183
02:34:25,973 --> 02:34:31,515
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the second, there will be a moderator reading all posts before they're published.

2184
02:34:33,888 --> 02:34:45,335
[SPEAKER_12]: That seems crazy, but yes, live people will be screening all the messages and they say it may take about 30 minutes between the time you post something and the time it's actually visible because of that delay.

2185
02:34:45,716 --> 02:34:49,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, users can also flag if something is missed, which we know will happen at some point.

2186
02:34:50,999 --> 02:34:53,803
[SPEAKER_10]: That is extreme.

2187
02:34:54,103 --> 02:34:58,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that it's kind of like a forum so you can post stuff.

2188
02:34:58,589 --> 02:35:00,311
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be moderators for that stuff.

2189
02:35:00,351 --> 02:35:00,872
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

2190
02:35:02,214 --> 02:35:07,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a problem with them going all 1984 and just let's monitor every single thing.

2191
02:35:08,214 --> 02:35:14,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, being an adult owning a console, I don't give a fuck if the word fuck is in, you know, something.

2192
02:35:14,677 --> 02:35:17,899
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're like, fuck this boss, I hate it, I fucking died nine times.

2193
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:19,360
[SPEAKER_10]: That's acceptable to me.

2194
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a fucking little child, I don't need to be, oh, let's start.

2195
02:35:23,682 --> 02:35:24,422
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's you.

2196
02:35:24,462 --> 02:35:25,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Little children will be using it.

2197
02:35:25,763 --> 02:35:27,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that, but you know what?

2198
02:35:27,464 --> 02:35:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: They have wonderful parental technology that you can block this stuff.

2199
02:35:33,368 --> 02:35:36,630
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can put content filtering for those age groups if you want.

2200
02:35:36,650 --> 02:35:38,411
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll figure out how to override by themselves.

2201
02:35:38,671 --> 02:35:41,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then you've got to be smart in your fucking kids.

2202
02:35:41,693 --> 02:35:43,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe this system will get overridden too.

2203
02:35:44,455 --> 02:35:47,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to be able to go post in Loki's Miiverse, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

2204
02:35:48,378 --> 02:35:51,420
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what Xbox is for, Rob.

2205
02:35:53,317 --> 02:35:55,419
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's for saying far worse words.

2206
02:35:55,679 --> 02:35:57,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Frisbee, everyone learn Leet.

2207
02:35:57,781 --> 02:36:00,322
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, probably moderators will know Leet.

2208
02:36:00,363 --> 02:36:01,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go on a little tangent here.

2209
02:36:02,244 --> 02:36:03,125
[SPEAKER_10]: What about FIFA?

2210
02:36:03,625 --> 02:36:05,066
[SPEAKER_10]: FIFA and the whole Kinect thing?

2211
02:36:05,146 --> 02:36:07,348
[SPEAKER_10]: If you fucking swear, you get flagged.

2212
02:36:08,249 --> 02:36:09,510
[SPEAKER_10]: That shit is funny.

2213
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:11,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, that is funny.

2214
02:36:12,903 --> 02:36:14,104
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's funny.

2215
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:18,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, to me, the whole fact that the Kinect will pick it up if you're saying like, fuck you, flag.

2216
02:36:19,149 --> 02:36:19,849
[SPEAKER_12]: That's funny.

2217
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:21,811
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't like it, unplug the Kinect.

2218
02:36:21,971 --> 02:36:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they have that technology, why don't we apply it to the goddamn Xbox Live service?

2219
02:36:26,555 --> 02:36:28,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's a little too big brother.

2220
02:36:28,857 --> 02:36:37,341
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I want to say, like, if we're playing Mass Effect Online and I want to be like this fucking Banshee bitch, Kinesma D, you know, then I should be able to say that.

2221
02:36:37,361 --> 02:36:38,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I should be able to swear on my TV.

2222
02:36:38,642 --> 02:36:39,902
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, here's the thing.

2223
02:36:39,942 --> 02:36:45,945
[SPEAKER_10]: If I were to ever play FIFA, which is not going to happen, I'm not going to fucking use Kinect.

2224
02:36:46,725 --> 02:36:47,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck that shit.

2225
02:36:49,887 --> 02:36:51,328
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that's my Wii U news.

2226
02:36:53,209 --> 02:36:53,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Esperanto?

2227
02:36:56,548 --> 02:36:56,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2228
02:36:57,048 --> 02:36:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's a great idea.

2229
02:36:59,049 --> 02:36:59,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2230
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:05,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The average person actually can look at a page written in Esperanto and figure out what it says because that's the purpose of the language.

2231
02:37:06,513 --> 02:37:15,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who knows any little bit of Latin, which just about every English speaker does know a little bit of Latin and Greek is part of the basis of our language and the romance languages.

2232
02:37:15,978 --> 02:37:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: No Esperanto.

2233
02:37:18,119 --> 02:37:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read a page in Esperanto and I've never learned it.

2234
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:21,360
[SPEAKER_12]: How do I say fuck you?

2235
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,761
[SPEAKER_12]: You fucking fucking Esperanto.

2236
02:37:23,987 --> 02:37:24,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2237
02:37:25,574 --> 02:37:26,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look it up, actually.

2238
02:37:27,341 --> 02:37:28,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, read a story first.

2239
02:37:29,537 --> 02:37:31,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that.

2240
02:37:32,638 --> 02:37:33,798
[SPEAKER_02]: EA's being bitches.

2241
02:37:34,859 --> 02:37:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my official title of this.

2242
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:45,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to copy Steam's 75% off sales because they think it cheapens the IP and they don't want to copy that practice.

2243
02:37:46,762 --> 02:37:50,463
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quote from David DeMartini, the origin boss.

2244
02:37:51,524 --> 02:37:54,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they think it's the right thing to do after a certain amount of time.

2245
02:37:54,905 --> 02:37:57,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it cheapens your intellectual property.

2246
02:38:00,307 --> 02:38:02,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, Steam is successful.

2247
02:38:03,468 --> 02:38:04,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It clearly works.

2248
02:38:04,928 --> 02:38:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are still forking out the money to buy the games.

2249
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about it is cheapening the IP if it's bringing it to a wider audience?

2250
02:38:13,612 --> 02:38:16,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not like Steam's just going, okay, we're going to charge less for your game.

2251
02:38:16,453 --> 02:38:21,995
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coordinating with these different developers and publishers and saying, okay, hey, we want to mark it down to...

2252
02:38:22,595 --> 02:38:44,101
[SPEAKER_10]: drive up some you know business and you drive up some sales for you guys as well as maybe bring a little bit of you know exposure to your product and then EA saying ah fuck it we don't care you know well you know what no one has to purchase stuff through Origin just saying you know there are other services out there so if you don't want to put your stuff on sale then fine someone else will

2253
02:38:44,605 --> 02:38:49,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and here's another thing that he's saying is what Steam does might be teaching the customer.

2254
02:38:49,109 --> 02:38:56,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I might not want it in the first month, but if I look at it in four or five months, I'll get one of those weekend sales and I'll buy it at that time at 75% off.

2255
02:38:56,635 --> 02:39:02,199
[SPEAKER_02]: What he's not realizing is that people who are into the game will buy it when it comes out.

2256
02:39:02,299 --> 02:39:04,921
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about waiting for a sale.

2257
02:39:04,981 --> 02:39:06,443
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get it when it comes out.

2258
02:39:07,083 --> 02:39:16,226
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when Portal 2 came out, now true, I didn't buy it for myself because I knew I was getting it for Christmas slash Hanukkah slash Kwanzaa slash Festivus, whatever.

2259
02:39:16,666 --> 02:39:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I did.

2260
02:39:18,227 --> 02:39:20,808
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was all hot and bothered to buy it when it came out.

2261
02:39:21,308 --> 02:39:25,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I've bought, like I bought Fractal when it came out.

2262
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've bought tons of games when they've come out.

2263
02:39:28,130 --> 02:39:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I knew, like for example, okay, here's a good example of

2264
02:39:33,633 --> 02:39:34,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

2265
02:39:35,816 --> 02:39:37,357
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Marvel vs. Capcom.

2266
02:39:37,678 --> 02:39:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bought it right when it came out.

2267
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dan bought it right when it came out.

2268
02:39:41,202 --> 02:39:45,286
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as Ultimate Marvel, and we knew Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 would be out, and guess what?

2269
02:39:45,326 --> 02:39:46,167
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought that too.

2270
02:39:47,709 --> 02:39:49,371
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone wants it, they don't care.

2271
02:39:49,491 --> 02:39:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go get it.

2272
02:39:50,731 --> 02:39:56,453
[SPEAKER_10]: The sheer amount of games I've purchased on Steam, well, mostly through the Humble Indie Bundles, but I have not played most of them.

2273
02:39:57,333 --> 02:40:03,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a lot of people, you know, my co-workers and stuff that buy stuff on Steam that say, yeah, I'll see this game for like five bucks.

2274
02:40:03,975 --> 02:40:07,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, fuck, I'm going to pick that up because I may play it eventually.

2275
02:40:07,956 --> 02:40:14,578
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of really quick, just spontaneous purchases because of these sales.

2276
02:40:14,678 --> 02:40:15,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's, you know...

2277
02:40:16,679 --> 02:40:23,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, keep your game at $20 and someone may pick it up or drop it to $5 and you make a ton of money.

2278
02:40:23,724 --> 02:40:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the check stand purchase.

2279
02:40:25,085 --> 02:40:28,267
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when you're in line at the grocery store and go, oh man, I love Twix!

2280
02:40:29,027 --> 02:40:29,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Two for a buck!

2281
02:40:29,828 --> 02:40:32,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's usually a lot of these independent games that most people aren't aware of.

2282
02:40:33,971 --> 02:40:35,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure, I'll try it.

2283
02:40:36,012 --> 02:40:37,673
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's a buck, if it sucks, whatever.

2284
02:40:37,733 --> 02:40:39,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I've paid five bucks for a game.

2285
02:40:40,535 --> 02:40:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played The Binding of Isaac for like five minutes.

2286
02:40:44,137 --> 02:40:45,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, which was another game I played this week.

2287
02:40:45,919 --> 02:40:46,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

2288
02:40:46,919 --> 02:40:58,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, it's good, it's something I can go back, you know, if I'm feeling kinda, eh, I'm bored, I don't have anything to do, then I can go in and play Cave Story, which I, you know, bought on the Hundle Indie Bundle before too.

2289
02:40:59,149 --> 02:41:08,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's, he's not, he's using business, the business mentality and not real world common sense.

2290
02:41:08,357 --> 02:41:08,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Well,

2291
02:41:09,317 --> 02:41:10,218
[SPEAKER_12]: The end of story.

2292
02:41:10,458 --> 02:41:14,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Origin is not as big of a deal as Steam is at the end of the day.

2293
02:41:14,659 --> 02:41:16,160
[SPEAKER_12]: What brought people into Steam?

2294
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:17,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Those sales.

2295
02:41:18,221 --> 02:41:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh!

2296
02:41:18,821 --> 02:41:21,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and here's another thing that he says.

2297
02:41:21,622 --> 02:41:27,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't believe in the drop it down, spring it up 75% off approach, which is not necessarily what Steam is doing.

2298
02:41:27,944 --> 02:41:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got something else that we do believe in that we'll be rolling out.

2299
02:41:32,206 --> 02:41:33,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is.

2300
02:41:33,347 --> 02:41:37,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't care because I'm only going to ever play one game on Origin if I have to.

2301
02:41:37,550 --> 02:41:38,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy 10, get one free.

2302
02:41:38,991 --> 02:41:43,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're stupid anyways because they're like, oh, we don't believe in marking stuff down and bringing it back up in price.

2303
02:41:44,014 --> 02:41:45,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You clearly don't believe in making money.

2304
02:41:45,575 --> 02:41:58,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently you have no idea what your, you know, iOS team is doing because there's a lot of EA games that go down the 99 cents when those properties are like $7 or whatever.

2305
02:41:58,144 --> 02:41:58,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Well said.

2306
02:41:59,264 --> 02:42:01,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, I mean, hey, you,

2307
02:42:02,266 --> 02:42:03,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, two more stories and then the Skype line, Loki.

2308
02:42:21,815 --> 02:42:22,095
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX GOLD

2309
02:42:45,154 --> 02:42:47,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently you can enter different tournaments.

2310
02:42:47,535 --> 02:42:50,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Some are free, some are with a paid entry.

2311
02:42:50,896 --> 02:42:54,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can compete in a variety of different games through their service.

2312
02:42:54,978 --> 02:42:58,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they actually do this right now through their website, Virgin Gaming.

2313
02:42:58,339 --> 02:43:03,901
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess right now they're going to be partnering with EA Sports, 2K Sports, and Ubisoft.

2314
02:43:05,121 --> 02:43:09,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to have different matchmaking stuff and also...

2315
02:43:12,245 --> 02:43:14,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, some different services.

2316
02:43:18,250 --> 02:43:21,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay to Have Game is their tagline for Virgin Gaming.

2317
02:43:22,891 --> 02:43:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to see what it is.

2318
02:43:25,111 --> 02:43:32,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious on how that's really going to work and how we can leverage it to have tournaments for OLR and VOG Network and so forth.

2319
02:43:33,053 --> 02:43:44,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad they didn't do this shit back in the day when Grand Theft Auto wasn't modded the fucking hell because I kicked a lot of ass in vanilla Grand Theft Auto and episodes from Liberty City.

2320
02:43:44,235 --> 02:43:45,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's always Grand Theft Auto 5.

2321
02:43:46,235 --> 02:43:48,178
[SPEAKER_10]: There is, and I will fucking own that shit again.

2322
02:43:48,218 --> 02:43:48,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Get ready.

2323
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:50,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I am ready.

2324
02:43:50,601 --> 02:43:51,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Your body is ready.

2325
02:43:51,622 --> 02:43:58,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to play Max Payne 3 because that's supposed to be pretty awesome, but Grand Theft Auto 5, I will dedicate my life to that game.

2326
02:43:58,922 --> 02:44:00,743
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's move on to one last story here.

2327
02:44:00,863 --> 02:44:04,946
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to end on a good note with the stories tonight, and this is a great note.

2328
02:44:04,986 --> 02:44:18,896
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked a little bit last week about Curt Schilling's studio and all the closures and all that, but Big Huge Games, one of the studios that was closed in that whole 38 studios debacle from a couple weeks ago, has basically been...

2329
02:44:19,716 --> 02:44:21,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Gobbled up by Epic Games.

2330
02:44:21,959 --> 02:44:26,584
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is good news because Epic Games is going to open a brand new studio called Epic Baltimore.

2331
02:44:26,984 --> 02:44:29,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's made up of the folks from Big Huge Games.

2332
02:44:30,148 --> 02:44:34,032
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's quite awesome that basically they've helped them find jobs.

2333
02:44:34,073 --> 02:44:38,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, not everybody's going to go because some people might decide to do something else.

2334
02:44:38,458 --> 02:44:40,400
[SPEAKER_12]: But most of them sounds like are going over to this.

2335
02:44:40,820 --> 02:44:44,623
[SPEAKER_12]: The official quote on this from Epic Games President Michael Capps, quote,

2336
02:45:07,498 --> 02:45:08,499
[SPEAKER_12]: So there they go.

2337
02:45:08,659 --> 02:45:10,260
[SPEAKER_12]: They are going to be working on a big IP.

2338
02:45:10,701 --> 02:45:11,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows what it is?

2339
02:45:12,082 --> 02:45:19,828
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be Reckoning 2, though, unless Epic ends up buying that IP, because I believe the state of Maryland owns that now.

2340
02:45:20,409 --> 02:45:21,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Rhode Island, excuse me, Rhode Island.

2341
02:45:21,589 --> 02:45:24,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, their thing was, we make IP, we don't buy IP.

2342
02:45:25,252 --> 02:45:26,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're not going to buy the IP.

2343
02:45:27,794 --> 02:45:32,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackwolf ventures a guess that Epic Baltimore could be making Infinity Blade for consoles.

2344
02:45:32,970 --> 02:45:38,034
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a pretty big Epic IP that wouldn't surprise me.

2345
02:45:38,314 --> 02:45:47,081
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what would fit right with Epic in that it's something that kind of got canceled a long time ago even though it looked really awesome?

2346
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:49,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Project Offset would have been fucking amazing.

2347
02:45:50,143 --> 02:45:56,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It was that first person fantasy RPG game that was like a first person shooter almost, but with giant dragons and shit.

2348
02:45:57,025 --> 02:45:57,966
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked really amazing.

2349
02:45:58,506 --> 02:46:02,267
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be cool, like a project offset game, but developed by Epic.

2350
02:46:02,307 --> 02:46:06,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Like an RPG fantasy game, but like Gears of War, I guess.

2351
02:46:06,969 --> 02:46:08,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's open up the Skype line.

2352
02:46:08,310 --> 02:46:12,913
[SPEAKER_12]: It is open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2353
02:46:12,973 --> 02:46:15,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly you have something to say about the news tonight.

2354
02:46:15,635 --> 02:46:19,938
[SPEAKER_12]: So give us a call and we will talk E3 or whatever it is that's on your mind tonight.

2355
02:46:20,298 --> 02:46:24,581
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, quickly, let's try to fit in a couple last minute stories here, Loki.

2356
02:46:25,815 --> 02:46:29,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so yes, let's, uh, I don't have anything pulled up again.

2357
02:46:29,496 --> 02:46:29,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you don't?

2358
02:46:29,916 --> 02:46:30,316
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right.

2359
02:46:30,616 --> 02:46:31,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I can go to Twitter.

2360
02:46:31,457 --> 02:46:32,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to Twitter.

2361
02:46:32,317 --> 02:46:33,477
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let me go to Twitter real quick.

2362
02:46:33,517 --> 02:46:34,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me bring it up.

2363
02:46:35,738 --> 02:46:37,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I wasn't prepared for that either.

2364
02:46:37,758 --> 02:46:38,238
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.

2365
02:46:38,298 --> 02:46:41,479
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we do have some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

2366
02:46:42,099 --> 02:46:43,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and how convenient.

2367
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:44,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Skypline's already going off.

2368
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:47,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you have some time to pull up the other stuff.

2369
02:46:47,521 --> 02:46:48,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

2370
02:46:48,601 --> 02:46:49,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2371
02:46:49,661 --> 02:46:50,301
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Shane.

2372
02:46:50,421 --> 02:46:51,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Shane.

2373
02:46:51,822 --> 02:46:52,362
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing?

2374
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:55,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to talk to you when you're on drugs.

2375
02:47:18,776 --> 02:47:22,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, that will be why you should tune in to Horde House on Tuesday.

2376
02:47:22,420 --> 02:47:25,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Which, by the way, gets... Well, they don't hear it on Tuesday.

2377
02:47:25,804 --> 02:47:26,745
[SPEAKER_12]: They hear it on Wednesday.

2378
02:47:26,765 --> 02:47:27,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I meant Wednesday.

2379
02:47:27,787 --> 02:47:28,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Live.

2380
02:47:28,708 --> 02:47:29,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Not live.

2381
02:47:29,609 --> 02:47:29,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it.

2382
02:47:30,229 --> 02:47:30,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Premiered.

2383
02:47:31,150 --> 02:47:31,851
[SPEAKER_12]: It's new for us.

2384
02:47:31,931 --> 02:47:33,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Should I just hang up and we could start this over?

2385
02:47:34,614 --> 02:47:40,240
[SPEAKER_12]: premiered at VOGnetwork.com on Warcraft Wednesdays and then on the podcast feed Wednesday night.

2386
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:42,462
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, anyhow, they don't need to know it's taped Tuesdays.

2387
02:47:42,843 --> 02:47:43,824
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so Shane.

2388
02:47:43,964 --> 02:47:44,765
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you talking about?

2389
02:47:44,785 --> 02:47:45,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not taped on Tuesdays.

2390
02:47:45,946 --> 02:47:46,466
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

2391
02:47:46,526 --> 02:47:48,629
[SPEAKER_12]: It's taped really quickly live.

2392
02:47:48,649 --> 02:47:48,909
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2393
02:47:48,989 --> 02:47:52,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane's been playing guru for me in private messages.

2394
02:47:52,613 --> 02:47:53,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, for Mass Effect?

2395
02:47:53,934 --> 02:47:56,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I actually will not go to Noveria first.

2396
02:47:58,931 --> 02:47:59,551
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what I do.

2397
02:48:00,212 --> 02:48:03,513
[SPEAKER_12]: To what did you want to call on the show about tonight, Shane?

2398
02:48:03,593 --> 02:48:04,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2399
02:48:04,614 --> 02:48:05,054
[SPEAKER_12]: No, wait.

2400
02:48:05,134 --> 02:48:06,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to hear what you have to say.

2401
02:48:06,815 --> 02:48:08,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to talk about your corgi.

2402
02:48:08,756 --> 02:48:09,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to talk about your corgi.

2403
02:48:10,657 --> 02:48:13,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, my corgi that I will have this weekend.

2404
02:48:14,098 --> 02:48:15,319
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's not your corgi yet.

2405
02:48:16,099 --> 02:48:16,920
[SPEAKER_12]: He's my corgi.

2406
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:19,261
[SPEAKER_12]: You put a deposit down on the corgi.

2407
02:48:19,601 --> 02:48:19,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2408
02:48:20,682 --> 02:48:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: That specific one that I showed you a picture of.

2409
02:48:22,923 --> 02:48:26,244
[SPEAKER_12]: The corgi can't exactly help you recover from surgery.

2410
02:48:26,284 --> 02:48:27,485
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, that might make things worse.

2411
02:48:29,211 --> 02:48:30,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably, but I don't care.

2412
02:48:30,993 --> 02:48:33,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to share with everyone what I shared with Shane earlier.

2413
02:48:33,374 --> 02:48:33,554
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2414
02:48:33,714 --> 02:48:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what Corgi means?

2415
02:48:35,135 --> 02:48:36,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheepdog in Welsh.

2416
02:48:36,797 --> 02:48:37,597
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're getting a sheep.

2417
02:48:37,957 --> 02:48:39,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, but you're afraid of sheep.

2418
02:48:39,699 --> 02:48:41,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it will run it away, clearly.

2419
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:42,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what sheepdogs are for.

2420
02:48:42,861 --> 02:48:43,922
[SPEAKER_02]: They herd sheep.

2421
02:48:44,522 --> 02:48:45,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Away from me.

2422
02:48:45,563 --> 02:48:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2423
02:48:46,343 --> 02:48:47,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, fair enough.

2424
02:48:47,544 --> 02:48:49,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, okay, now I'll hear what you have to say.

2425
02:48:49,546 --> 02:48:51,327
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you really want to call in about tonight?

2426
02:48:51,787 --> 02:48:56,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to gloat because clearly I won that list list from a couple weeks ago.

2427
02:48:58,161 --> 02:48:59,041
[SPEAKER_12]: What makes you say that?

2428
02:48:59,141 --> 02:49:02,103
[SPEAKER_08]: The segment on the show where we come up with a definitive list, yes.

2429
02:49:02,623 --> 02:49:11,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we had to say what we wanted on Wii U. And of everything we all said, me talking about Mass Effect was the only thing that came true.

2430
02:49:13,171 --> 02:49:15,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, congratulations, Shane.

2431
02:49:15,572 --> 02:49:18,414
[SPEAKER_12]: You get a no prize.

2432
02:49:18,434 --> 02:49:20,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you get a new version of Mass Effect on the Wii.

2433
02:49:20,295 --> 02:49:20,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2434
02:49:20,435 --> 02:49:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane can have a Raspberry.

2435
02:49:24,317 --> 02:49:28,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I can someday give you a free piece of loot on vognetwork.com.

2436
02:49:28,539 --> 02:49:29,259
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that sound?

2437
02:49:29,679 --> 02:49:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I want something worth something.

2438
02:49:32,441 --> 02:49:33,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, now.

2439
02:49:33,421 --> 02:49:33,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, now.

2440
02:49:34,002 --> 02:49:36,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't devalue the loot at vognetwork.com.

2441
02:49:37,043 --> 02:49:40,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't sell it or make money off of it.

2442
02:49:41,164 --> 02:49:45,325
[SPEAKER_12]: You can soon post it on your profile like you're supposed to be able to do at home.

2443
02:49:45,345 --> 02:49:47,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a profile?

2444
02:49:47,385 --> 02:49:52,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can have one night alone with Caden.

2445
02:49:52,346 --> 02:49:52,846
[SPEAKER_12]: How about that?

2446
02:49:55,387 --> 02:49:55,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2447
02:49:57,587 --> 02:49:58,528
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like, just one?

2448
02:50:04,014 --> 02:50:14,305
[SPEAKER_12]: What if they decide in Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U, they're just going to not have Kaden in it because they're just going to say, you know what, we're going to just go with this storyline from the first game.

2449
02:50:14,805 --> 02:50:18,990
[SPEAKER_10]: What if, because it's on a Nintendo console, they cut out all the sex scenes?

2450
02:50:19,450 --> 02:50:19,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

2451
02:50:19,650 --> 02:50:19,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

2452
02:50:21,792 --> 02:50:23,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't know if I could get it then.

2453
02:50:24,699 --> 02:50:27,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still waiting for the Garrus nookie, so.

2454
02:50:27,321 --> 02:50:29,003
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to wait till, well, I shouldn't spoil.

2455
02:50:29,023 --> 02:50:29,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2456
02:50:29,383 --> 02:50:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the second one.

2457
02:50:30,604 --> 02:50:31,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2458
02:50:31,105 --> 02:50:31,485
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2459
02:50:31,926 --> 02:50:35,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the first one, I've decided that I am going to bang the hell out of Kayden.

2460
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:37,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of support for Shane.

2461
02:50:37,791 --> 02:50:38,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

2462
02:50:38,331 --> 02:50:38,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2463
02:50:40,794 --> 02:50:42,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the right way to play the game.

2464
02:50:42,235 --> 02:50:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Ashley's a bitch.

2465
02:50:44,577 --> 02:50:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2466
02:50:45,918 --> 02:50:46,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I've taught you well.

2467
02:50:46,499 --> 02:50:47,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like her.

2468
02:50:48,961 --> 02:50:51,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Tali, but she's kind of dumb.

2469
02:50:53,294 --> 02:51:19,743
[SPEAKER_08]: the other thing I was calling in about because I care so other people should care the new DJ Max game on Vita while it doesn't have a release date I guess PentaVision confirmed that there will be a collector's edition in America and they announced three of the licenses already which are just songs from the previous games but it's still something important because we actually get a real honest to goodness K-pop license

2470
02:51:20,379 --> 02:51:20,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

2471
02:51:21,043 --> 02:51:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So what bands are we expecting to see under the...

2472
02:51:26,709 --> 02:51:47,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now we've only got a K-pop group called Kara with their song Step from Technica and then a guy named Mr. Funky who does a lot of music for the later DJ Maxx games with Rockstar and Signalize by Paul Bazooka who again does a lot of music for the later games.

2473
02:51:47,738 --> 02:51:51,280
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting is that I don't know where Step is from.

2474
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:53,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's from a Technica game but

2475
02:51:53,701 --> 02:51:58,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockstar and Signalize are both from the latest Technica game that came out, Technica 3.

2476
02:51:59,524 --> 02:52:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might see more transplants from current music instead of stuff from way back when.

2477
02:52:06,668 --> 02:52:07,468
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me happy.

2478
02:52:08,949 --> 02:52:11,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like it would be worthy, I believe.

2479
02:52:12,438 --> 02:52:16,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just need to know how many hundreds of dollars I'm going to spend on this collector's edition.

2480
02:52:17,061 --> 02:52:18,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that will happen.

2481
02:52:19,042 --> 02:52:22,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably only be like $10 or $20 more than retail.

2482
02:52:23,185 --> 02:52:24,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably.

2483
02:52:24,846 --> 02:52:26,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And it won't come with anything that's worth anything.

2484
02:52:26,788 --> 02:52:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they haven't in a while.

2485
02:52:28,188 --> 02:52:31,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to get awesome puzzles and face masks.

2486
02:52:32,091 --> 02:52:36,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the last one, I got a CD and a crappy book.

2487
02:52:37,455 --> 02:52:37,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2488
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:38,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Might not actually be worth it.

2489
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:40,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just download the game instead.

2490
02:52:41,261 --> 02:52:41,941
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Shane.

2491
02:52:41,961 --> 02:52:43,422
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to let you go so we can get more calls.

2492
02:52:44,322 --> 02:52:44,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

2493
02:52:44,823 --> 02:52:45,223
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

2494
02:52:45,463 --> 02:52:45,803
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2495
02:52:45,943 --> 02:52:47,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk to you later in the week.

2496
02:52:47,664 --> 02:52:47,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2497
02:52:48,024 --> 02:52:48,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck with surgery.

2498
02:52:49,224 --> 02:52:49,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2499
02:52:49,784 --> 02:52:51,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

2500
02:52:51,865 --> 02:52:55,366
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2501
02:52:55,847 --> 02:52:56,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that, guys.

2502
02:52:56,467 --> 02:52:58,648
[SPEAKER_12]: We just had Bugmageddon here in the studio.

2503
02:53:00,269 --> 02:53:01,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why, like tons of bugs.

2504
02:53:01,711 --> 02:53:02,793
[SPEAKER_12]: They just love the light.

2505
02:53:03,594 --> 02:53:07,459
[SPEAKER_12]: And Alan's trying to do laundry outside and had to run in and all the bugs followed him.

2506
02:53:07,579 --> 02:53:08,100
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gross.

2507
02:53:09,041 --> 02:53:10,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Raid everywhere.

2508
02:53:11,817 --> 02:53:13,098
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-KAMOLR 1-877-KAMOLR 1-877-KAMOLR

2509
02:53:34,025 --> 02:53:36,106
[SPEAKER_10]: They got Gabe Newell in there.

2510
02:53:36,406 --> 02:53:40,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, he is quite handy with blacksmithing.

2511
02:53:41,848 --> 02:53:47,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, of course, he was in there to poke fun at the fact that Half-Life 3 is not out and he was... Jerk.

2512
02:53:47,430 --> 02:53:49,030
[SPEAKER_10]: He was forging a new crowbar.

2513
02:53:49,330 --> 02:53:49,590
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2514
02:53:49,931 --> 02:53:50,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me go to the phones.

2515
02:53:50,651 --> 02:53:51,711
[SPEAKER_12]: We got another call on the line.

2516
02:53:51,771 --> 02:53:52,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2517
02:53:52,872 --> 02:53:53,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2518
02:53:54,072 --> 02:53:56,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Chugga-chugga-choo-choo, motherfuckers.

2519
02:53:56,133 --> 02:53:56,993
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Drew Salley.

2520
02:53:57,273 --> 02:53:57,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey.

2521
02:53:58,173 --> 02:54:00,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, and you can say that word on this show.

2522
02:54:00,174 --> 02:54:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

2523
02:54:00,594 --> 02:54:01,595
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that right, man.

2524
02:54:01,635 --> 02:54:02,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sick of being...

2525
02:54:03,799 --> 02:54:05,100
[SPEAKER_01]: held back on Bobby's show.

2526
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:08,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, he's just taking the Nintendo approach.

2527
02:54:08,861 --> 02:54:09,361
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.

2528
02:54:09,901 --> 02:54:10,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.

2529
02:54:10,261 --> 02:54:10,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this.

2530
02:54:10,862 --> 02:54:16,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I love this new Nintendo approach with the moderating everyone's shit.

2531
02:54:16,243 --> 02:54:22,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I know most people are complaining about this bullshit that they're going to monitor everything before you post it up or whatever.

2532
02:54:22,526 --> 02:54:24,506
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking cha-ching, cha-ching, motherfuckers.

2533
02:54:24,866 --> 02:54:25,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent my resume off.

2534
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:29,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably weed through that shit at home all day.

2535
02:54:29,768 --> 02:54:38,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe there will actually be some type of Nintendo reality show where people audition to be one of the moderators and they'll call it The Moderator.

2536
02:54:39,134 --> 02:54:40,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a genius idea.

2537
02:54:40,595 --> 02:54:41,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And it'll be on the Nintendo Network.

2538
02:54:42,936 --> 02:54:46,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like something a Japanese company would do for sure.

2539
02:54:46,358 --> 02:54:47,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could compete.

2540
02:54:48,379 --> 02:54:49,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking right I can.

2541
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:51,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, friggin' right I can.

2542
02:54:51,721 --> 02:54:55,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so what are your thoughts on E3 this week, Jim Salley?

2543
02:54:56,411 --> 02:54:58,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all next to nothing.

2544
02:54:58,773 --> 02:55:05,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I watch E3, I don't want to say I'm depressed afterwards, but I feel like I was let down the last couple of years.

2545
02:55:05,998 --> 02:55:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't say you're depressed because you look for the cyanide?

2546
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:12,002
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't make the Kool-Aid.

2547
02:55:12,042 --> 02:55:13,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I did make Kool-Aid with Vodka in it.

2548
02:55:13,903 --> 02:55:17,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I thought we were going to get some crazy shit to see, but nope.

2549
02:55:17,645 --> 02:55:18,506
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get nothing.

2550
02:55:19,631 --> 02:55:21,272
[SPEAKER_01]: That Wii U is pretty weird, though.

2551
02:55:21,592 --> 02:55:22,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strange.

2552
02:55:22,513 --> 02:55:24,934
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the stuff that everybody's going crazy about?

2553
02:55:24,974 --> 02:55:27,856
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the Watch Dogs and the Beyond Two Swords?

2554
02:55:28,957 --> 02:55:31,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's all garbage to Jim Sally.

2555
02:55:31,058 --> 02:55:35,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, if it's not Halo 4, it's everything else.

2556
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:36,661
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm going to say.

2557
02:55:37,001 --> 02:55:37,822
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're a Halo 4 fan?

2558
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:40,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Who isn't a Halo game?

2559
02:55:40,521 --> 02:55:41,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Who doesn't love Halo?

2560
02:55:41,881 --> 02:55:51,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I have fallen out of love with Halo a bit since all the stuff after 3, but I will say Halo 4 looks pretty darn interesting.

2561
02:55:51,646 --> 02:55:53,387
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think about the different look?

2562
02:55:53,427 --> 02:55:54,687
[SPEAKER_12]: It has kind of a different look to it.

2563
02:55:54,727 --> 02:55:55,308
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think of it?

2564
02:55:56,988 --> 02:55:59,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's about time we change it up a little bit anyway.

2565
02:55:59,209 --> 02:56:02,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting kind of drab before, almost redundant before.

2566
02:56:03,671 --> 02:56:05,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not change it up a little bit?

2567
02:56:05,372 --> 02:56:06,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really concerned, though, with the...

2568
02:56:08,317 --> 02:56:10,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how well they'll do, because Bungie kind of babied us.

2569
02:56:11,678 --> 02:56:12,898
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it right for a long time.

2570
02:56:13,138 --> 02:56:14,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think the change in studio was a good thing?

2571
02:56:17,299 --> 02:56:20,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because to be honest with you, I don't think Bungie could keep it up.

2572
02:56:20,439 --> 02:56:26,861
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it themselves that they were getting kind of sick of, I don't want to say sick, but they were getting kind of bored with doing Halo, right?

2573
02:56:26,901 --> 02:56:34,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not going to have that same drive to build the great Halos like they did in the past, then it is time to pass the torch on to someone new.

2574
02:56:36,096 --> 02:56:37,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I can agree with that.

2575
02:56:37,798 --> 02:56:41,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has to do with anything that one is working on.

2576
02:56:41,582 --> 02:56:44,025
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have the enthusiasm, it's going to show in the end product.

2577
02:56:45,386 --> 02:56:46,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, right?

2578
02:56:46,107 --> 02:56:50,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why we see a lot of Obsidian games when they know they're only getting the sequel, right?

2579
02:56:50,552 --> 02:56:54,416
[SPEAKER_01]: They just pump it out as quick as they can because they just need to get their money and they want to be done with it.

2580
02:56:54,837 --> 02:56:55,217
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.

2581
02:56:55,257 --> 02:56:55,938
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to move on.

2582
02:56:56,779 --> 02:56:56,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2583
02:56:57,802 --> 02:56:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.

2584
02:56:58,242 --> 02:56:59,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an error though, man.

2585
02:57:00,783 --> 02:57:04,443
[SPEAKER_12]: So what else does the Jim Sally train want to share with us tonight here on OLR?

2586
02:57:04,523 --> 02:57:06,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Loki there or is he eating pizza right now?

2587
02:57:06,364 --> 02:57:06,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right here.

2588
02:57:07,704 --> 02:57:09,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'm really ashamed of myself.

2589
02:57:10,505 --> 02:57:11,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to admit this to you.

2590
02:57:12,205 --> 02:57:22,007
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been at the very last mission of Grand Theft Auto 4 for about a year and I can't fly a fucking helicopter to save my life.

2591
02:57:22,907 --> 02:57:23,367
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

2592
02:57:23,387 --> 02:57:24,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Their controls are kind of terrible.

2593
02:57:25,168 --> 02:57:27,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like a cheat though or something I can do?

2594
02:57:27,148 --> 02:57:27,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Like

2595
02:57:28,777 --> 02:57:31,178
[SPEAKER_10]: To control the helicopter better?

2596
02:57:31,198 --> 02:57:34,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like a helicopter doesn't die mode or something?

2597
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:41,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can put in your god mode code and just bring up your phone.

2598
02:57:42,183 --> 02:57:45,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you have the phone up, you can just keep hitting the health.

2599
02:57:45,684 --> 02:57:46,264
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the...

2600
02:57:47,805 --> 02:57:57,010
[SPEAKER_10]: GTA 555-0100 is the number and then basically you just keep hitting that and you'll keep replenishing the health on the helicopter.

2601
02:57:57,951 --> 02:58:04,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Really though, it's difficult to keep shooting down the bad guy in the game.

2602
02:58:04,474 --> 02:58:10,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So really my best bet is to go get a kid from the elementary school to come over and just do it for me.

2603
02:58:11,863 --> 02:58:14,046
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have to type that in as I'm falling to my death?

2604
02:58:24,881 --> 02:58:46,869
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, you just type it into your phone beforehand so you have that cheat up and then you bring it up on your cheats menu in the phone and then you can just keep hitting A over and over or X or whatever and just, you know, each time you hit it it'll recover the health in your helicopter or you can just wait until your helicopter starts smoking or whatever and just hit that and it'll replenish the health on the helicopter.

2605
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:50,770
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my best friend.

2606
02:58:51,437 --> 02:58:51,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

2607
02:58:53,639 --> 02:58:54,219
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

2608
02:58:54,380 --> 02:58:55,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Friends are made.

2609
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:57,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you have something to do right after the show.

2610
02:58:58,143 --> 02:58:59,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Right after the show, baby.

2611
02:58:59,944 --> 02:59:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: GTA 5, 5, 5.

2612
02:59:02,066 --> 02:59:02,386
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2613
02:59:02,707 --> 02:59:04,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Jim, Sally, I got to let you go so we can get into some more calls.

2614
02:59:04,788 --> 02:59:06,129
[SPEAKER_12]: But thanks so much for stopping in tonight.

2615
02:59:06,149 --> 02:59:07,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, man.

2616
02:59:07,310 --> 02:59:09,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to dedicate this call to my buddy Birdman.

2617
02:59:09,813 --> 02:59:18,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Bird, if you've been drinking too much and I got to call your brother to come over and take you home at the party, then maybe you've had too many beers, Birdie, or not enough.

2618
02:59:19,477 --> 02:59:38,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't drink and drive, ever Don't drink and drive, that's why I called your brother You drunk fuckbird Jesus Christ, man Don't drive your car to my house and drink a six pack of beers Get the fuck out of here, bird, go with your brother I love you, Sky Alright, love you too, take care Thanks, Loki No problem Oh, I see how it is

2619
02:59:39,651 --> 02:59:44,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say bye, Darky, but I guess not now.

2620
02:59:44,338 --> 02:59:45,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, sweet Darky.

2621
02:59:45,260 --> 02:59:45,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart face.

2622
02:59:46,121 --> 02:59:46,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bum.

2623
02:59:46,942 --> 02:59:48,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the little bum thing for you with a three.

2624
02:59:49,947 --> 02:59:51,108
[SPEAKER_12]: With a number three.

2625
02:59:51,589 --> 02:59:52,651
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hanging up now.

2626
02:59:52,771 --> 02:59:53,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye, Jim Sally.

2627
02:59:54,233 --> 02:59:55,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody look at my bum.

2628
02:59:59,431 --> 03:00:02,354
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a great note to end on.

2629
03:00:02,374 --> 03:00:07,058
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2630
03:00:07,118 --> 03:00:09,381
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think you can follow that call, good luck to you.

2631
03:00:11,334 --> 03:00:14,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, I'm going to try to do Twitter topics here.

2632
03:00:14,916 --> 03:00:17,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time I've done it, though, I've been derailed, though.

2633
03:00:17,458 --> 03:00:19,159
[SPEAKER_12]: But we'll go to a couple tweets here.

2634
03:00:19,979 --> 03:00:27,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Tigerclaw305 sent us a tweet about Nexon pays $685 million for 14.7% of NCSoft.

2635
03:00:28,484 --> 03:00:30,665
[SPEAKER_12]: NCSoft, they've made games like Guild Wars.

2636
03:00:30,725 --> 03:00:31,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's one of their big titles.

2637
03:00:32,106 --> 03:00:34,588
[SPEAKER_12]: ION, they've done a couple other MMOs as well.

2638
03:00:35,248 --> 03:00:38,130
[SPEAKER_12]: They are now the largest shareholder in NCSoft.

2639
03:00:38,530 --> 03:00:39,490
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

2640
03:00:40,691 --> 03:00:41,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Very cool.

2641
03:00:41,151 --> 03:00:45,772
[SPEAKER_12]: That's part of a two-year agreement between these two South Korean gaming companies.

2642
03:00:46,772 --> 03:00:51,314
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see what is born of that partnership later on.

2643
03:00:51,734 --> 03:00:57,255
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerClaw sent us another tweet about Kojima seeing social and core games converging together.

2644
03:00:58,356 --> 03:01:01,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is kind of some of what she saw in some of the Nintendo's presentation.

2645
03:01:01,597 --> 03:01:03,077
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what Kojima said.

2646
03:01:03,437 --> 03:01:05,958
[SPEAKER_12]: In an interview with CVG, he said, quote,

2647
03:01:06,878 --> 03:01:36,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think social and core games are separate both will evolve together and at some point I feel the social side of things will converge with the core gamers I think in the future maybe Metal Gear will change in certain ways to integrate social aspects if you look at other games on the market now you can see it's already happening so Metal Gear may at some point get involved how do you guys feel about that do you think he's on to something there or do you think maybe too far casual Metal Gear game

2648
03:01:38,028 --> 03:01:39,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't know about that.

2649
03:01:39,089 --> 03:01:40,890
[SPEAKER_12]: That's very interesting.

2650
03:01:43,092 --> 03:01:48,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I thought what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network did was already kind of social.

2651
03:01:48,937 --> 03:01:51,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And not that it's always showing the best parts of society.

2652
03:01:51,919 --> 03:01:54,961
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I kind of thought that was the social gaming.

2653
03:01:55,281 --> 03:01:58,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what used to be social gaming, arcades.

2654
03:01:58,944 --> 03:02:01,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And look what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network has done to arcades.

2655
03:02:02,046 --> 03:02:02,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't...

2656
03:02:02,927 --> 03:02:03,347
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2657
03:02:03,447 --> 03:02:07,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think... I mean, when I hear this, I think Facebook games.

2658
03:02:07,970 --> 03:02:10,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's very few Facebook games I get excited about.

2659
03:02:10,751 --> 03:02:11,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Very, very few.

2660
03:02:11,512 --> 03:02:14,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I will say, you don't know Jack is pretty fucking awesome on Facebook.

2661
03:02:14,393 --> 03:02:14,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Just saying.

2662
03:02:18,897 --> 03:02:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft

2663
03:02:36,855 --> 03:02:51,626
[SPEAKER_12]: The Noobuo Summer Bundle Kickstarter So it's a Kickstarter that he's linked us to It's music inspired by video games And it's a Kickstarter They're trying to raise $8,000 And why are they doing this?

2664
03:02:51,706 --> 03:02:55,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Well they're trying to do video game music information in English and Japanese

2665
03:02:56,409 --> 03:03:22,089
[SPEAKER_12]: A two CD original and arranged soundtrack album for the browser game Roko-Chan And doing some different design work there Proceeds of the Kickstarter will benefit the bundle's eight participating musicians And will be the first source of funding for the Roko-Chan team So I guess it's kind of like a little bit of a startup company here Slash get a cool little soundtrack album I will say this though, some of the albums that are included in this Super Meat Boy Choice Piano Cuts

2666
03:03:22,469 --> 03:03:51,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Splatterhouse Volume 1, Volume 2 and Splatterhouse Butchered so if you're a Splatterhouse fan also in there in the arranged pack looks like our friend MegaRan who was on the show a few weeks ago is involved there with Black Materia the remixes as well as some stuff by Metroid Metal so those are some groups you should know of so go on to Kickstarter and search for N-U-B-U-W-O N-U-B-U-W-O N-U-B-U-W-O there it is that's it for tweets the phone ain't going off so I'm thinking the show's about over

2667
03:03:53,530 --> 03:03:55,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight to our little program.

2668
03:04:15,655 --> 03:04:20,477
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an app in the App Store, and it's also, it's iOS and it's Android, called Stitcher Radio.

2669
03:04:20,997 --> 03:04:25,579
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can give us thumbs up and likes and stuff, and there actually is like a chart that ranks shows.

2670
03:04:25,619 --> 03:04:28,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think last I looked, we were number 40 or something in games.

2671
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:30,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can go a little higher, right?

2672
03:04:30,581 --> 03:04:32,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us some thumbs up.

2673
03:04:32,582 --> 03:04:34,403

2676
03:04:36,763 --> 03:04:40,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to get the link for the website or Tiger Claw will beat me to it in about five seconds here.

2677
03:04:40,525 --> 03:04:43,286
[SPEAKER_12]: We could definitely use your thumbs up and your likes over there on Stitcher Radio.

2678
03:04:43,306 --> 03:04:44,427
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd really appreciate that.

2679
03:04:46,268 --> 03:04:47,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Or just tell a friend.

2680
03:04:47,188 --> 03:04:51,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Word of mouth is how we spread the good word of Orange Launch Radio and grow the OL Army.

2681
03:04:52,590 --> 03:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we conclude tonight, though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2682
03:04:56,772 --> 03:04:58,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark Sakura, we'll start you tonight.

2683
03:04:58,093 --> 03:04:58,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies first.

2684
03:04:58,653 --> 03:04:59,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm changing the fortune cookie.

2685
03:05:00,979 --> 03:05:01,760
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do that.

2686
03:05:01,800 --> 03:05:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can.

2687
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:03,061
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, fine.

2688
03:05:03,081 --> 03:05:03,922
[SPEAKER_12]: You can change the fortune.

2689
03:05:04,943 --> 03:05:06,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2690
03:05:06,604 --> 03:05:08,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to get off Kickstarter.

2691
03:05:08,506 --> 03:05:09,727
[SPEAKER_12]: It's dangerous.

2692
03:05:10,107 --> 03:05:11,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Spending too much money?

2693
03:05:11,108 --> 03:05:12,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no.

2694
03:05:12,089 --> 03:05:17,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been luckily not spending too much money, but I'll talk to you after about stuff.

2695
03:05:18,663 --> 03:05:18,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2696
03:05:19,484 --> 03:05:22,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just seeing some of these ideas that people come up with.

2697
03:05:22,506 --> 03:05:23,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, really?

2698
03:05:23,486 --> 03:05:25,087
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're not doing a Kickstarter.

2699
03:05:25,408 --> 03:05:26,949
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no.

2700
03:05:27,049 --> 03:05:28,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

2701
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

2702
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,892
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely not what I'm getting at.

2703
03:05:32,873 --> 03:05:40,698
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to eating what's in that crock pot right over there in the corner of the room.

2704
03:05:41,398 --> 03:05:45,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And all those bugs can go die of raid poisoning.

2705
03:05:46,702 --> 03:05:47,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Stupid bugs.

2706
03:05:48,430 --> 03:05:48,890
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

2707
03:05:49,150 --> 03:05:49,631
[SPEAKER_12]: We're done.

2708
03:05:49,791 --> 03:05:50,411
[SPEAKER_12]: We're out of here.

2709
03:05:50,771 --> 03:05:54,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you everybody so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll see you again next week.

2710
03:05:55,394 --> 03:06:07,080
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't mention it all tonight surprisingly just because E3's kind of dominated everything but I will mention now we are two weeks away from the 10 year Orange Lounge Radio anniversary show if you can believe it.

2711
03:06:07,580 --> 03:06:08,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a long time.

2712
03:06:08,420 --> 03:06:09,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Two weeks away.

2713
03:06:11,008 --> 03:06:12,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be here?

2714
03:06:13,169 --> 03:06:13,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll be here.

2715
03:06:13,830 --> 03:06:14,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2716
03:06:14,250 --> 03:06:15,431
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a week you weren't going to be here.

2717
03:06:15,531 --> 03:06:16,331
[SPEAKER_12]: That was supposed to be this week.

2718
03:06:16,511 --> 03:06:17,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but you made it anyway.

2719
03:06:17,612 --> 03:06:17,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2720
03:06:17,972 --> 03:06:18,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

2721
03:06:19,153 --> 03:06:19,413
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2722
03:06:19,493 --> 03:06:19,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

2723
03:06:20,093 --> 03:06:21,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you really giving me the webcam?

2724
03:06:22,075 --> 03:06:24,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'm giving you the... Well, technically, that was from AkumaJP.

2725
03:06:24,496 --> 03:06:27,698
[SPEAKER_12]: So AkumaJP gave you, then gave me, then gave you back the webcam.

2726
03:06:28,058 --> 03:06:28,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

2727
03:06:28,218 --> 03:06:29,719
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2728
03:06:30,179 --> 03:06:30,560
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

2729
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:31,180
[SPEAKER_12]: We're done.

2730
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:31,660
[SPEAKER_12]: We're out of here.

2731
03:06:31,700 --> 03:06:32,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great night, everybody.

2732
03:06:32,901 --> 03:06:35,703
