00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,960
Tonight, June 10th, 2012, E3 2012 has come to a close and we discuss the highlights,

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:31,720
the lowlights, and everything in between with our live audience.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,280
Yes, Loki in the mid-lights too.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,640
every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live as we always are, every Sunday night

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,800
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,720
Network or the Voice of Geeks Network.

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,200
VOGnetwork.com is where you can go and if you click on live chat, you can chat live

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,640
with us, the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,580
I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and of course this week

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,240
the big E3 expo with my co-host.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,400
First up, Jamie Summers or Dark Sakura.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hi.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
It looks like you were giving my salad the sting guy.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,480
I was trying to figure out what was in it.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
I was like, is that avocado or is that?

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It's avocado.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,760
I made basically avocado mango salsa.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Okay.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,160
And put it over fresh greens.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,440
Just, you know, green things are always kind of the...

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,600
With goat cheese on top.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
It's all raw.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Okay.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,880
And delicious because I am back to eating raw food.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,960
There you go.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Not vegan.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Mind you, not vegan.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,120
How do you do raw food without being vegan because it doesn't...

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Sashimi.

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Fish.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
And beef tataki.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Oh, there you go.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
And raw milk cheese and raw milk.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
That works.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
And yogurt.

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I can have fermented things too.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,020
All right.

41
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,960
Let's also go over to tech master Loki.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Hi.

43
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Who will probably talk about his very non-raw food diet of McDonald's.

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,160
You couldn't have two more polar opposites.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,200
That's actually not food though.

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
She does have a point.

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,960
It is definitely not even close to food.

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,320
It is the show where every gamer, no matter what you eat, has a voice.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,440
If there was a fast food place on the way here that serves sashimi, then I'd probably

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
be getting that.

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,600
Although it is quite expensive.

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,680
I had pop chips.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I think that falls somewhere in between the two of you.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,800
I actually had dinner before I came to this show and then I picked that up on the way

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
because I was still kind of hungry.

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,440
I wanted to stop at Burger King, but there was a bunch of car crashes right in front

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,480
of the turn to turn into the shopping center with the Burger King.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,840
I was like, ah, come on.

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Party at Burger King.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,200
No, it's probably stupid people on the light rail.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Whatever happened to parties at Burger King?

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Like when I was young and this might be dating myself a bit here, but like people used to

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,120
have their birthday parties at McDonald's and Burger King.

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Is that still like a thing or did they?

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I don't think so.

66
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Yeah.

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,760
It's all Chuck E Cheese now.

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,480
Chuck E Cheese was a little, that's not food either.

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
However sometimes they have good games.

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,120
It really is the shittiest pizza anywhere.

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Anyway.

72
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
It's still okay.

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,960
You know, but you know who started Pizza Time Theater, right?

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Huh?

75
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
Um, and crap, I forgot his name.

76
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Atari dude.

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Oh yeah.

78
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Nolan Bushnell.

79
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Yeah.

80
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Oh, Woodland Hills.

81
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Not that long ago.

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know if it's still open.

83
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
It was about a year or two ago.

84
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
I went to the original Chuck E Cheese way back.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
That was the coolest one too.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Really?

87
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Like two stories?

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Had two story slide.

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,720
It had the full animatronic band.

90
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,900
Oh, it was great.

91
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:34,480
In Mobile, where I'm from, we had a massive Chuck E Cheese slash Showtime pizza that had

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,800
the party room with the hippo girl in it who played a piano and, and Alan said he remembered

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
that.

94
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,520
And then we had, um, the big party room with the full band and like the room that you go

95
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
into to go to the bathroom that's all like LED lights on the wall that would give me

96
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,280
like a seizure and, um, the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I remember that.

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
Chuck E Cheese in a way is almost responsible.

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,280
I mean, for real, for me being like so into video games because I remember, I distinctly

100
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,160
remember going when I was three or four years old, it was my sister's wedding reception

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,960
for some reason was at Chuck E Cheese.

102
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,400
I think it was like the after reception reception.

104
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Like it was like the real reception was at the Elk Lodge, but then like the wedding party

105
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,120
and the families was more for the kids.

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,360
So they, I think my sister was like, let's do something for Rob and the kids.

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
And so, cause my sister was 16 years older than I am.

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,880
So that's why like I'm, I'm four and she's like 20 getting married.

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Right.

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
So we all went to Chuck E Cheese.

111
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,720
I distinctly remember I have like people ask, what is one of your earliest memories?

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,760
I distinctly remember Crystal Castles and the track ball and the little box that they

113
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,440
used to have to bring over that you can stand on so I could be a four year old playing Crystal

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Castles.

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,200
We had the sit down pole position.

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Nice.

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,820
And when they closed the big Chuck E Cheese, they actually moved the same pole position

118
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,680
cabinet to the newer Chuck E Cheese.

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
And I did as an adult go back and play the exact same one I played as a small kid.

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,200
All right, let's go to our chat room.

121
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,680
And the always present, present fourth guest on our show at vognetwork.com.

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Click on live chat.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,680
I believe you can also use the URL live.vognetwork.com.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,480
A lot has changed in vognetwork since our last live show and I'll talk about that in

125
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
a minute.

126
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Oh, don't forget.

127
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
What?

128
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Thanks to Travis last night.

129
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
We have the vognetwork.com as well.

130
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
That's right.

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,460
You can also access at the vognetwork and I believe, I don't know, I maybe, I might

132
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,280
get a hand slap from Bobby for making this public, but I know you registered at voiceofgeeks.com

133
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
also works.

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
So there you go.

135
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,720
Several ways you can get to our website.

136
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,000
We prefer vognetwork.com, but you can also do the vognetwork.com.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,280
Going to our chat room.

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,200
Vince Raven is in our chat room saying, is this a prerecorded show or live?

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
It must be live because I just read your name.

140
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
There you go.

141
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
We are live tonight.

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,200
I know it was taped last week.

143
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
There's no such thing as prerecording.

144
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,700
There's just recording.

145
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,760
That's what they say.

146
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
That's the buzzword.

147
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,820
It's voiceofgeeks.com not voiceofgeeksnetwork.com, right?

148
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,820
It's voice, right?

149
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Yeah.

150
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Voiceofgeeks.com.

151
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,280
All right.

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,600
And some folks in the chat room are hand slapping there for me.

153
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
Uh, let's see.

154
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,360
Also some folks reminiscing about showbiz pizza, which I believe was the Chuck E Cheese

155
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
of the East coast.

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
It's kind of the same thing.

157
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,280
And they merge like a black Wolf is in there saying showbiz pizza where a kid can be a

158
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
kid.

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,740
Well now it's where a kid can get shot.

160
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,280
I don't know if you read some of the crazy things that happened at Chuck E Cheese on

161
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,240
Yahoo and news and all that stuff, but they got an image problem.

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
They're not what they used to be.

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
I used to like, um, Bullwinkles.

164
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,920
That was the knockoff Chuck E Cheese.

165
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh yes.

166
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
Bullwinkles was the shit.

167
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
It was awesome.

168
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Oh my God.

169
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,880
Water show that you could, you know, watch while you eat pizza.

170
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Here in Sacramento too, there was the best place.

171
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,960
I know this is like, so like nobody in our audience will understand this cause we're

172
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,320
international and all.

173
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
We have folks.

174
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,080
I see Rob from girls gone.

175
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Wow.

176
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
From the UK is listening tonight.

177
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,560
I saw Clover Nikon, who I believe is from Australia is listening tonight.

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,760
We've got like an international group here tonight.

179
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,620
Now here I am talking about our little hometown of Sacramento, but there used to be this place

180
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,800
called the mine shaft place was the shirt.

181
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
Now it's like an abandoned RV.

182
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Yeah.

183
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Now it's like a scary place, but like you used to go underground to start the miniature

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
golf.

185
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
They had a two story arcade.

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,100
It was awesome.

187
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,280
And then right before it closed, it had like a dance club in the basement and it was commonly

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
known as the Mormon dance club because I guess the mine shaft was owned by Mormons.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,360
And so the Mormon dance club, I don't even know how that works, but I just know that's

190
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
what everybody did.

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Go there one summer.

192
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,060
Like, you know, just, ah, we'll go play miniature golf there cause I've never really been there

193
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
before.

194
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,280
Like, and man, it was, it was run down.

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
It was pretty bad.

196
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh, DJ Morpheus is reminding me about Sam's town too.

197
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
That was awesome.

198
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Damn.

199
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,240
We had some great entertainment and I'm sure wherever you're from in your hometown, you

200
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,320
used to have these great entertainment places that have probably all shut down.

201
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,520
Alan, were there any awesome ones in the Bay area?

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,240
I'm not thinking of he's ignoring.

203
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, okay.

204
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Oh, he's shaking his head.

205
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,640
You know what we had in mobile and it's still there and it's changed names, but it used

206
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
to be called mount Asia.

207
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,000
It was a huge like multi level, um, uh, mini golf, but it had a great arcade.

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,560
That's where I played truck for the first time.

209
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,440
I was hooked on that game.

210
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,360
The only thing notable I can remember in the East Bay was in Concord.

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
There was a big Malibu grand Prix, which had the RC cars and then a huge arcade, but it

212
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,960
closed when I was like seven.

213
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,480
So I barely remember it.

214
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,480
They saw some of that Scandi is like, you know, I love, not necessarily our Scandi,

215
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,840
our Scandi went, I don't know what happened to our Scandi.

216
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,400
It's just weird.

217
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,800
But like the other Scandi is, you know, they still have like the old arcades and stuff.

218
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
They're kind of cool.

219
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,000
They saw that vibe, you know, they have the go-karts and miniature golf and that kind

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
of stuff.

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I miss retro arcades.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,280
I wish that's why I loved Flynn's arcade at Disneyland and we weren't here last week because

223
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,680
I made another trip to Disneyland and so I got to see electronic as replacement, which

224
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,960
is the mad tea party.

225
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,080
Now I didn't see the actual party cause we were there on weekdays, but I saw the decorations

226
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
and it pained me to see Flynn's arcade just gone, just totally gone.

227
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,280
The front had been replaced with something else that wasn't even really themed for Alice

228
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
in Wonderland.

229
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,960
Just made me sad as I've been calling it the mad flop party.

230
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,080
I've had some friends that have gone that did not enjoy themselves, but we'll see.

231
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
We'll see.

232
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
You never know.

233
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,280
I think we're all just very bitter about the whole Tron thing being gone.

234
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,560
Anyhow, let's talk about what's changed real quick.

235
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,480
I will get into video games and E3, but I want to talk about some big things for us

236
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,280
that happened during this last week that we weren't here.

237
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,720
Vognetwork.com, our official site has launched.

238
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,020
If you visited it back in May when we first, you know, established the network with Bobby

239
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,080
and understation live, we had kind of a temporary site there that was just one page with the

240
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,520
chat room taking up the whole page.

241
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,760
The full site is now available and if you haven't been able to take a look at it, I

242
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
really encourage you to go because in one week, and I'm not just saying this cause you

243
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,760
know, it's like part my idea, the whole site, but in one week we've accomplished so much.

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm like really proud and a lot of that is the very hard work that Bobby's been putting

245
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,120
in on the programming side of it, but there's been a lot of hard work on the content side

246
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
too.

247
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,900
We have some great authors for editorials that we picked up, thanks to Twitter shout

248
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
outs.

249
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,520
Jeff, I know is one of them and Elliot, they've been writing some great stuff for the site

250
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,040
and it's not just video game stuff too.

251
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,160
Remember it's the voice of geeks network, so we have articles on Indiana Jones, we have

252
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,100
articles on of course, you know, Minecraft and there's some other things too, but it's

253
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,640
a wide variety of things.

254
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,840
Yes, right before the show I was asking Raul, who are these people that are, you know, writing

255
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
stuff for our site?

256
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,280
Oh my God, I don't recognize these people.

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Well, Twitter's a powerful thing.

258
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,200
I know Elliot's been following me on Twitter for a while.

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,000
He's based out of the UK and he sent me a direct message that took me like three weeks

260
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,600
to respond to cause my Twitter app was acting up, but he already did some writing, I think

261
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,760
for either a high school or a college paper and I was like, all right, you want to write

262
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
for a school?

263
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Let's, let's see it.

264
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
And he did that.

265
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Uh, Jeff came in from, this is really cool, video game outsiders retweeted us when I put

266
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,920
or retweeted me, I should say when I put the call out for, um, uh, authors, which by the

267
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,480
way, let me just really quick, really quickly say the fact that we're all like supportive

268
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
of each other.

269
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
I love video game outsiders and you know, I know they, they sent the retweet for me

270
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
and everything.

271
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,520
I hope this dispels the whole, there's an all games and vog network war and they're

272
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,840
a fighting and they're, they, they split, it's civil fricking war.

273
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,080
No, let it go and stop it.

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
Stop spreading those rumors.

275
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Let them do their thing and be great.

276
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,800
Let us do our thing and also be great because if we're both great, everybody wins.

277
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
Anyway, Jeff came in through that retweet and his stuff's been great.

278
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Yeah.

279
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,720
Loki, you say you've been reading that stuff and it's really funny and it's good, good

280
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
stuff.

281
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Anyhow.

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm going to our chat room again at live.vognetwork.com a little more reminiscing there and some

283
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,560
talk about E3 as well.

284
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,120
Act Def is teasing that the, some of the content from orange launch radio, I love this song

285
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,040
is coming this week to vog network.

286
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
That's right.

287
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
It's going to be growing.

288
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Um, so if you haven't checked out vognetwork.com, please do.

289
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,060
It's not just the station, it's the articles.

290
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,040
And most importantly, the big thing that was announced the Friday before was that it's

291
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,720
all a game.

292
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,840
You can actually sign up.

293
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,800
You can find a loot places on the site.

294
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
So EJ from girls gone wow, continuing our conversation from a couple of weeks ago, there's

295
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
your loot.

296
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,040
You can check it out over there on the site and you can get loot.

297
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I can't tell you how you get loot, but I'll tell you one of them is really easy.

298
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Like sign up for the website.

299
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Easy.

300
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
And you get loot.

301
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,280
Um, you can comment on articles, thumbs up.

302
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,000
You can actually, if you notice Bobby posted a review of, I'm going to mess up the name

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
of this.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,520
It's jam music band or something like that.

305
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,320
This just came out on Xbox live arcade.

306
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,960
He wrote a review of that and you can actually write a review that agrees or disagrees and

307
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,480
your review, if approved by the original author, which you know, they're not going to disapprove

308
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,800
it just cause you disagree with them, will show up right underneath the original review.

309
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
It's pretty cool.

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,720
So you can like kind of like have your own say like I disagree because XYZ.

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
So pretty cool.

312
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,160
We'll have more stuff like that come to the site in the next few weeks.

313
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,440
So yeah, vognetwork.com again, Orange House Radio listeners, if you haven't checked out

314
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,200
the website since the placeholder that was there last month, so much has changed.

315
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Check it out.

316
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,560
Uh, let's go back into games and talking about E3 and before we get into our own gaming week

317
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,520
and the stuff we've been playing as we usually start the show off with, I know we're going

318
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,840
to do a lot of recapping about E3 tonight and I want to talk about this topic that's

319
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,000
been brought up that's kind of hovering over the air.

320
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,920
And that is the question of, is E3 still relevant?

321
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,560
Now, the ESA was very quick to defend the, that question basically that was asked, uh,

322
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,480
by saying, of course it's still relevant, you know, where this is the, all the, I don't

323
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
have the quote in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing of course, but you know, all the attention

324
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,160
is on Los Angeles this week and it's still the place to have games shown and be covered

325
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,000
and be exposed to the world.

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,700
It is the place to be, but there's a lot of people that are saying, well, you know, in

327
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,360
this day and age of the internet and where everything kind of goes to spike TV the first

328
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,760
day or G4 hits the internet, is it really that important to be there live and in person?

329
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,720
So I want to ask those in studio, especially considering this year E3 was a bit different

330
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
for us personally.

331
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,880
This is the first year at Orange Lawns Radio in quite some time.

332
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,380
We didn't really cover it.

333
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,780
We didn't, none of us went and you know, let me ask that question.

334
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,480
Is E3 still relevant?

335
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Loki?

336
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,000
Um, I think it's still relevant because they have a lot of great games being shown there,

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,120
but they've kind of made it really difficult for, well, they've always made it kind of

338
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,920
difficult for independent coverage of E3.

339
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,120
It's more of having to, you know, cover the, you know, you don't get invited to the press

340
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,080
events so you cover the feed from Spike TV or something like that, you know, and you

341
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:30,440
make your comments off of that, which you know, works just fine because it's, you know,

342
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
you get to see the same stuff pretty much except you don't get to actually play any

343
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,480
of it.

344
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I don't know.

345
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,360
I think for the gaming industry, I think it's not necessarily the greatest thing for them.

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,720
I mean, just because a lot of companies are being hit financially pretty hard and they

347
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,200
can't afford to have these really huge booths and spend millions of dollars on the stuff

348
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,680
like THQ, for example, not at E3 because they can't afford to spend money on that kind of

349
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
stuff right now.

350
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,360
They have jobs at stake and properties and, you know, their own company, so they can't

351
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,240
do that.

352
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,280
So I think that, you know, as far as saying, oh, E3 is the place to go for game, you know,

353
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,800
news and to see the games and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily the case.

354
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,080
I mean, yeah, it is a place to go.

355
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,080
It's definitely something that people look forward to, but there's also other conventions

356
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
out there.

357
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,920
There's PAX, which is definitely getting a lot of coverage for games and stuff.

358
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,600
And honestly, I mean, you can scale down your booth size a bit and show the same type of

359
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,280
stuff there and I think still get the same kind of press coverage that they're getting

360
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
with E3.

361
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,560
Granted, they're not doing these huge keynote events and stuff like that, but I still think

362
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,760
it's a good way to get your game covered.

363
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,560
Plus, you know, in the day and age of the internet, there's also companies just launching

364
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,360
their own games on Kickstarter or, you know, through other means and they can get press

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,960
coverage that way or, I don't know.

366
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't think press is necessarily a problem because people were probably talking about

367
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,760
Madden and Assassin's Creed and stuff like that beforehand, but now it's just, hey, look,

368
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,520
we've got, you know, a bunch of people showing off Assassin's Creed at the Sony, you know,

369
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,920
press conference, at the Ubisoft press conference and at the Xbox press conference and at the

370
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,680
Nintendo press conference because they only showed Ubisoft games because a lot of them

371
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
just thought they were so awesome.

372
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,280
So yeah, I can see how, you know, they could come to that conclusion.

373
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I don't know.

374
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,480
I just, I'm just jealous I didn't get to go.

375
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,320
I would like to play some more games, but honestly, you know, digesting it through just,

376
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,640
you know, reading, you know, other sites covering and stuff, I feel that I kind of took in more

377
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,080
information than if I were to be stumbling around because it seems like every time I'd

378
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,680
go to E3, it would be like, oh, hey, you know, there's this really cool game and I didn't

379
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,960
get to see it because I completely was unaware that they had talked about it or was announced

380
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
or something like that.

381
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,320
And I just never made it over to that booth because I wanted to go see something I was,

382
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
you know, aware of beforehand.

383
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't know.

384
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,800
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shadownextgen, who is actually at the show

385
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,980
and was talking about it extensively on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight said, I think it is

386
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,920
important to be in, be there in person if you can.

387
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I always enjoy the experience.

388
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,080
DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live, I'm reading like comments from other

389
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
shows tonight, but that's all right.

390
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
It's a network.

391
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,880
DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live says, I said it during Bobby's show,

392
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,760
but I see South by Southwest becoming the dominant game showcase in a couple of years.

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,180
That's a very interesting prediction because South by Southwest is the place where things

394
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,840
like Foursquare really took off.

395
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,620
And I don't know if you view Foursquare as a game, but if you look at VOG Network as

396
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,680
a game, South by Southwest would probably be our show, right?

397
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,680
That's an interesting perspective, especially with the technology and everything.

398
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,880
Except Foursquare kind of sucks.

399
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,840
But think of all the clones that exist.

400
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,240
I mean, think of it this way, Facebook basically jacked Foursquare.

401
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
You know?

402
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,920
So, you know, well then again, one could argue, okay, Grant, I better get this out or I'll

403
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
get corrected.

404
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,080
Google Latitude was kind of, you know, also before all of that, but I believe that was,

405
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,400
if I got my tech history right, that was Dodgeball and the Dodgeball guy started Foursquare.

406
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I've gone cross-eyed.

407
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,040
At this point, these big conventions just kind of seem pointless to me because if they

408
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,920
really wanted to get reviews and get the press information out there, they would go to like

409
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:42,560
a virtual format, you know, VE3 or something, and send out demos directly to the press,

410
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,800
you know, especially since they've been cracking down so hard on, you know, the non-press,

411
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,080
you know what I mean?

412
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,680
The people who are their version of not industry.

413
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,960
I think they're just wasting time and money.

414
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,680
What Up G in our chat says, the only thing you don't get from not being at E3 is any

415
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
hands-on time.

416
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, I remember a couple of years ago when they did the whole, a lot of demos, not all

417
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,400
of them obviously, but quite a handful of demos were available on Xbox Live as they

418
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
were there at the show.

419
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
That was pretty awesome.

420
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
2006 was the year that they did that.

421
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,920
And they had like, you know, MotoGP and Lost Planet and there was one other one, but I

422
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,760
don't remember what it was.

423
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
That was awesome.

424
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
E3 at home is basically like, hey, you know what?

425
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,680
We know that you can't go to E3.

426
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,840
Here's some of the E3 demos that are available right now.

427
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
Why don't they do that anymore?

428
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,200
I really, I mean, that's a good way to get, you know, information out about your game.

429
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
But I understand people are like, oh, well, it's not finished, but who cares?

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You just put that up.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,560
Hey, unfinished game, but you get to check the demo for it.

432
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,480
MotoNext Gen just bring up an interesting point in our chat, sending out demos to the

433
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
press wouldn't necessarily work.

434
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Not everyone has debug units that can play the early code.

435
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Maybe that's a part of it that the code isn't ready for that live environment.

436
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
You know, there is a difference.

437
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,660
They usually prepare demos, you know, that have taken care of, you know, hiding any errors

438
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,880
and are programmed for certain time limits.

439
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,360
Some companies are sick of doing that.

440
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,800
I remember reading an article on that.

441
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Some companies are thinking there's the E3 demos are actually kind of not a waste of

442
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,680
their time, but it's taking away from time from developing for the game.

443
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,640
So, again, why have E3 at all?

444
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
All right.

445
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,680
I really don't see it being relevant anymore.

446
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,640
Going to other comments in our chat room, Dark Tetsuya says, we totally need VOGCON.

447
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Dream big.

448
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Maybe someday.

449
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Dream big.

450
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Let's see.

451
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,020
And Tigerclaw notices that I am on PlayStation Home right now.

452
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,280
That is correct.

453
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Over there on the TV, look, I'm sitting next to Tigerclaw on the couch.

454
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,800
I am in PlayStation Home and I want to pimp the new VOG Network Clubhouse.

455
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,520
So if you have your PlayStation nearby, fire it up, search in the clubhouses for VOG and

456
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,360
you'll get VOG Network in all caps.

457
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,840
And hopefully, oh, it looks like Blender left, but hopefully he'll be back and he can accept

458
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
more apps into the clubhouse.

459
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,040
And I got to say, Blender did a great job with the clubhouse.

460
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,800
I didn't even know they had new ones now.

461
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,160
He's got this whole, like, desert, I think it's called the Desert Penthouse or something.

462
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
There's like a little pool.

463
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,420
Look at all those arcade games he's got in there.

464
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
It's pretty neat looking.

465
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,000
It totally looks like it's floating.

466
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,320
So anyhow, now you'll notice Tigerclaw and I are sitting on the couch, but not too close

467
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
together.

468
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Not too close.

469
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
There's...

470
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
It's a nice doodly distance apart.

471
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,480
I do not believe that that's actually home.

473
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,360
No one is doing the running man.

474
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
So, you know.

475
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Oh, hey, DDR machine.

476
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,180
Is that a DDR machine?

477
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Get out.

478
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
It's a...

479
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah, it's like a little DDR machine over there.

480
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,320
I believe that is a DDR machine.

481
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,480
Well, speaking of home, they have the whole virtual, you know, not to...

482
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,680
I mentioned Xbox a minute ago, but they do their whole virtual Sony booth.

483
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,000
Granted, it's not the same as being there, but it's kind of a neat little tie-in, you

484
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
know.

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It kind of...

486
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,640
Again, there's always that question of, what the hell's the point of home?

487
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,200
But when you see something like that, you kind of go, oh, that is pretty cool.

488
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Did you ever look at the virtual booth in home?

489
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,920
I've seen pictures of it, but I haven't been the home for a long time.

490
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,840
I actually haven't ever used home.

491
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,320
Oh, you got to check it out.

492
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,480
It's kind of neat there.

493
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,720
I've been playing on my PC.

494
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,440
I believe Tiger Claw is fulfilling the running man quota here.

495
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
You know what?

496
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,920
I got to say, this may be the reason to bring a live webcam back to the show.

497
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Don't have the cam on us, but put the cam in Sony home, and you guys can look at that

498
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,460
while we broadcast.

499
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,040
I seriously might do that.

500
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
That's a good idea.

501
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Go me.

502
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm going to be storming live on air.

503
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
Mister, I'm going to keep the webcam.

504
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
You can have the webcam.

505
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Look, here's the webcam.

506
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
There you go.

507
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
All yours.

508
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Have a blast.

509
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,840
Well, I thought you had your video camera hooked up.

510
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
That died, sadly.

511
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,480
That $400 camera died.

512
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,040
That's part of the reason we haven't had video in a while, and that webcam isn't the best

513
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
resolution.

514
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
You know what?

515
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I actually think that my camera still works.

516
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Oh, yeah?

517
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,120
I mean, I've never tried it as a webcam, and I have to convert all of those Disneyland

518
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,360
movies, but I think my Panasonic still works.

519
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,080
I have an HD camcorder that I'm not using at all.

520
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
All right.

521
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Anyways.

522
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

523
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
We'll come back to E3 in just a moment.

524
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Loki's going to wrap up the whole thing for us, and we're going to give our witty insight

525
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,080
and commentary.

526
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,720
First off, though, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

527
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Dark Sakura.

528
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
I played stuff.

529
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I played stuff.

530
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Yes, you did.

531
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
And I am so proud of you.

532
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Anyway, talk.

533
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,200
I played a bunch of Mass Effect until I decided that I really would rather play it on the

534
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,560
PC, because I hate the targeting system so much, and it hurts my hand to try to retarget,

535
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,120
and I kept dying when I found Counselor Choi.

536
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
You know what I mean?

537
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
The matriarch.

538
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Yes.

539
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,520
So, I swear, she must have been on some pretty nasty PMS, but anyway.

540
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,040
So yeah, all of the Asari commandos, like, whooped my ass.

541
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,220
So I decided to play it on PC instead, and I've remade my femshep, and totally going

542
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
after Garrus.

543
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Shut up.

544
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't judge me.

545
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,440
Another one indoctrinated, ladies and gentlemen.

546
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Shut up.

547
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
I played some well.

548
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

549
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Addict.

550
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Dealer.

551
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Rob, you are the game pimp, okay?

552
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
You know what?

553
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
You have to kind of blame Shane for that, really, though.

554
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,160
That was just like, that's like the whole, like, this is like, Mass Effect is now this

555
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,840
Tupperware pyramid scheme, and Shane is kind of like the regional director, and he got

556
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,720
me hooked, and now, in an attempt to, you know, get my free toaster, I got Dark Sakura

557
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
hooked.

558
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,000
It's a pyramid scheme.

559
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,280
That's right, it's a pyramid scheme.

560
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,840
Oh, and I want to point out, Tigerclaw totally moved closer to me on that couch, you see

561
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
that?

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
That's still a dudely distance.

563
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
It is a dudely distance.

564
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,920
Well, I think that's the, uh...

565
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,640
That's the appropriate distance for dudes to be apart.

566
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,480
That is the, um, programmed distance away.

567
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,280
That's where your hitbox is.

568
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,640
Well, I also played, I did play WoW.

569
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120
I'll put a picture of this on orangehonestready.com.

570
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,040
I did play WoW, duh, and I started another MMO just because of Iguana Girl, of Jessica

571
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,080
Harper, who has said, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, so finally I'm like,

572
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,020
okay, I'll give it a try, you know, because I'm a little bored with WoW because other

573
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,480
people are playing Diablo all the damn time, shut up.

574
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,280
So, um, the pyramid head scheme, um, so I started playing Lord of the Rings online,

575
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,800
and it's actually not bad, um, it's very pretty, I actually prefer it graphically to WoW, um,

576
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,120
lots of, lots of fun in-depth stuff, I really like how it more mirrors the books, and you

577
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,320
know, without Tolkien's horrible, horrible writing, I'm sorry, you spend, when you spend

578
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,900
five pages describing the landscape, and like half a paragraph describing the people you're

579
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,000
talking about, that's not good writing.

580
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,080
And I'm probably going to hell in the minds of lots of, uh, Tolkien fans, but I don't

581
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
care.

582
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,200
Um, I did play a little Diablo, by the way, um, but I actually, you know, I'm, I've only

583
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,520
played, I'm only a level 8 character right now in Lord of the Rings, it's enough that

584
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,000
I've gotten kind of a grasp that, number one, I like the camera in WoW better, but I like

585
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,160
the scenery in, the graphics in, um, Lord of the Rings better.

586
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,400
I do have to say that WoW has better water effects, just saying, um, I actually, when

587
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,840
I had it optimized, it basically lets me run the game at full settings, and I had some

588
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:45,040
lag today, but for the most part, it actually runs pretty smoothly, um, I've, uh, I've basically

589
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:53,440
had some problems with, uh, some kill stealing, so I don't like that my targets aren't locked,

590
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,400
but, you know, what can you do?

591
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,600
It's free, I don't, I like the free part, the free's good, and I played some STO this

592
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,280
week, by the way, um, just to, uh, play Dabo at Deep Space Nine.

593
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
And um...

594
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
You've been MMOing it up!

595
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,680
I have been, I'm like a little whore here.

596
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,800
No, I'm not a whore, because I'm paying.

597
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,720
Somebody clip that little, clip that little phrase and send it to Travis.

598
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm a Momo slut.

599
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,920
I'm being, I'm a Momo slut.

600
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm playing the field.

601
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,440
Hey, if guys can do it and are, you know, lauded for it, then a woman should be able

602
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,320
to be lauded for spreading herself out a little bit too.

603
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,080
Just saying.

604
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
Double standard here, double standard.

605
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,760
It was right in his show forums.

606
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,320
Bitches.

607
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:45,840
So um, and uh, I have also decided, I'd played the Minecraft demo, the freebie version that's

608
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
on the website.

609
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Hated it!

610
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Wait.

611
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
No.

612
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
There's no waiting.

613
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,040
I hated the demo too.

614
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,360
There's no waiting, I thought it was boring as shit.

615
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,080
And actually it made me motion sick, it did make me, now the one, actually going back

616
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,080
to uh, um, the reason why, the other reason I shifted to playing Mass Effect on PC is

617
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,960
because the Xbox version made me motion sick, and I haven't had that yet with the PC version.

618
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,160
Because I'm playing it in windowed mode, and it gives me a little bit more to focus on

619
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
other things.

620
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,680
Turned off the motion blur, turned off the fill grain, all of that, it still made me

621
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,840
sick.

622
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,440
And I hate to say it, but I do get motion sickness with Lord of the Rings because of

623
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,740
the camera.

624
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,040
Because it's like, okay, you know how in WoW the camera auto adjusts when you're running?

625
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,480
In Lord of the Rings you can actually turn your camera around, you can watch yourself

626
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,880
sideways, but you're still moving forward with W. If that makes sense.

627
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,520
So, I'll try to hit sideways because that's the direction on my screen is trying to run.

628
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,840
And my camera is oriented the other way, so it's more or less, I guess, a little bit of

629
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,320
user error, but I still would prefer that auto orienting, and I don't know if I have

630
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,520
a way to turn that on.

631
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,920
However, it's got this full, um, cosmetic thing, so you, it's kind of like, not necessarily

632
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,120
like transmogging, because honestly I really like the transmogging system, and you really

633
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,160
have to think about what you want, but, um, I do like the cosmetic system and, you know,

634
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,120
the dye, you know, you can get clothes dye and everything.

635
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,760
And crafting is better, oh my god, crafting is so much easier, the end.

636
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:29,000
So I'm about even, I mean, WoW is still, thanks, sorry, you know, I still like WoW, I'm not,

637
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,840
I signed the blood pact, I'm not quitting.

638
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,760
And Pandaria may kind of, you know, WoW is really a lull for a lot of people now.

639
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
I like monks.

640
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
I want a goat monk so bad.

641
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,920
But, you know, the one thing that really, and I decided this today, the really big thing

642
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,360
that Lord of the Rings does not have going for it, no true caster DPS class.

643
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,320
You have a hunter, that's your only real dedicated DPS class.

644
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,240
And you know me, I like the pew pew.

645
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,080
I have, what, a mage, a druid, a shadow priest, you know, on WoW, I play caster pew pew.

646
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,720
So you know, if that popped up on Lord of the Rings, oh no, that might, that might pull

647
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
me over permanently.

648
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
It's the same.

649
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
And I like free.

650
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Did I say I like free?

651
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I like free.

652
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,200
The MMO queen has spoken.

653
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,040
Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?

654
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
And Ragnarok Online.

655
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,600
How was your gaming week?

656
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
I played mostly Minecraft.

657
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,600
I started by building an artificial volcano.

658
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Took the largest mountain that was in the game, well, largest mountain in this one area,

659
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,880
and then I built on top of it, all the way up to the top of the skybox, and then I covered

660
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,280
the whole thing with obsidian, because I had duped a bunch of obsidian, and then I poured

661
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,640
some volcano, or some lava over the top of that, and got too much lava.

662
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,680
There was a ton of lava on there, man.

663
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,080
You put that in the wrong spot, and it'll just spread like crazy.

664
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:01,000
So I finally took care of that, and got it a little bit more situated to how I like it,

665
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,760
and then started to hollow the whole inside off.

666
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,600
And actually it's kind of cool, because the whole thing is actually the shrine of fire,

667
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,280
because there is fire all over the place, there's lava fountains on the inside.

668
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
It's just ridiculous.

669
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,360
Didn't you do a shrine of fire in Animal Crossing?

670
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Oh no, that was Jamie.

671
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
That was Jamie.

672
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
That was Jamie that did that.

673
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,240
We did the shrine to fire, and we had lesbians.

674
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Remember, we had lesbians.

675
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
Yeah, I do remember the lesbians in your neighborhood.

676
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,280
With the rainbow sign in front of her house.

677
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
It was the one that was the gym teacher.

678
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,320
She had the gym themed, and the short hair.

679
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,000
I swear she was the biggest lesbian ever.

680
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,760
The only thing that kept her from being the ultimate lesbian was by having multiple girlfriends

681
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,620
live with her in succession.

682
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,640
So you had the shrine to fire in your basement in Animal Crossing.

683
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,840
You had the shrine to fire in Minecraft.

684
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,760
What game do I make the shrine to fire in?

685
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,220
That's what I need to figure out.

686
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,800
Just a Minecraft, I don't know.

687
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
We'll see.

688
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
Oh, oh, oh, that just reminds me of something.

689
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,600
I can have a house in Lord of the Rings, and I might build a shrine to fire there.

690
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Just saying.

691
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
Just don't burn down your house.

692
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,320
I miss Mog houses.

693
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,480
You know, Rob, I miss Mog houses.

694
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
I do too.

695
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Wowney's houses.

696
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
They do.

697
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
They do.

698
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Alright, alright.

699
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Rather than me just pretending that my goat lives in the back room of the tavern.

700
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
The man finishes gaming week so we can get to E3.

701
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
He's gonna get the rest of the damn show.

702
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,760
So anyways, so other than, yeah, I've just been playing Minecraft for the most of it.

703
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,400
It's kinda cool though, because it, unbeknownst to me, there was a dungeon in the middle of

704
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,920
that mountain that I built the volcano on.

705
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:35,280
So now I have this dungeon that's gonna be in the bottom of this giant fortress to fire.

706
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,640
And you'll be able to fight mobs down there.

707
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,700
So that's kinda cool.

708
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,320
So I'll be playing a little bit more of that this week.

709
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,760
Did you build an arena down there?

710
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm going to.

711
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,880
I'm going to build an arena.

712
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
Does Minecraft have PvP yet?

713
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
No.

714
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,640
You can lock a bunch of those ugly things in an arena and make them kill each other.

715
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
You can do the chickens.

716
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,440
You can lock a bunch of, yeah, cause you, if you take the egg and throw it, it makes

717
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
a new chicken.

718
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,680
Yeah, it doesn't do that every time though.

719
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,080
You could have chicken fighting, illegal chicken fighting in your arena.

720
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,540
I did find it funny though, sometimes I'll be inside the volcano thing like hollowing

721
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,000
it out and I'll hear a cow catching fire cause it was stupid and walked into the lava.

722
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,240
So that's kinda funny.

723
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,480
And then the other game I played, ironically, was an Atari 2600 game.

724
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,120
And it's an Atari 2600 game that's exclusive to the contest I'm playing which is for Ready

725
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Player One.

726
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,580
I don't know if everyone heard, but Ready Player One, you know the wonderful book they

727
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,340
keep talking about, they have an Easter egg hidden in the book.

728
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,860
And they have a contest now that goes along with that Easter egg.

729
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,960
You find the Easter egg, takes you to a website, you play this Atari 2600 game.

730
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,600
You find the Easter egg in that, takes you to the next website which the game unlocks

731
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
there.

732
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,080
July 1st and then you play through that game, then you get increasingly harder.

733
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,360
And then the next game unlocks August 1st, kinda like the real hunt, except there is

734
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
a real prize.

735
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,240
The real prize is a DeLorean.

736
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,800
A DeLorean with a replica flux capacitor inside it that, you know, is being given away.

737
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,360
Which sounds all kinds of amazing.

738
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Yes, so I...

739
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,680
It makes me want to get into this book series.

740
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,400
I, um, so I found...

741
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Or book.

742
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I found the Easter egg after a little bit of a hint from online.

743
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,120
Someone mentioned that you have to look for a certain...

744
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,640
Because I was looking through the book, I didn't really get a chance to look at it the

745
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
first day and stuff.

746
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,720
And I'm like, eh, I'm looking for a URL, but I didn't quite catch it.

747
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,400
And then they mentioned, oh, well you have to look for this type of thing that's with

748
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
the letters.

749
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
And then I'm like, oh, okay, there it is, I see it.

750
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,580
So I went and played the game, beat the game, um, you know, after Josh went to bed.

751
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,400
And I didn't even make the top 100, though, on Leaderboard, but then again, it doesn't

752
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,280
matter because each game is time-unlocked, so it's not...

753
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,120
The next game's not gonna start until July 1st, and then the final game's August 1st,

754
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,400
and really the contest is whoever has all three games completed first is the winner.

755
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,800
So how fast you are at the first game and second game doesn't really matter as long

756
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,600
as you get the third game after completing the first two, as long as you're first in

757
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
second.

758
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
So, I don't know.

759
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
But Stax was kind of neat.

760
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,620
It was like a throwback to, like, Pitfall.

761
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
It was pretty hard.

762
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,640
You had to, you know, it was weird, you have to jump over these, like, static charge things

763
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,900
and avoid these things that look like squids, and then there's flashers.

764
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,800
There's people trying to flash you like old dirty men.

765
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I don't really understand what that has to do with anything.

766
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,040
But you're supposed to find, like, six puzzle pieces, and then once you find the six puzzle

767
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,440
pieces, you have to find the Easter egg in the game, which is very reminiscent to Adventure,

768
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,720
and then once you find that, you go back to, you know, a certain room and you find a QR

769
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,680
code that unlocks the third place, and that's eventually where the game's gonna unlock next.

770
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,520
And apparently people were aware of the website, like, I've been talking to Dark Tetsuya about

771
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,720
the whole thing since, you know, he's into the whole, you know, game and kind of tried

772
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,360
to help him out with the game, but, you know, he's like, oh hey, I knew about that website

773
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,760
way a long time ago, but it wasn't necessarily because of the Easter egg in the book, it's

774
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,560
just, you know, it's kind of obvious what the website is.

775
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,200
But yeah, it was fun, it was kind of fun to get to play, like, an old game, and it's also

776
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,220
fun to kind of participate in this, like, real life hunt thing.

777
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,760
Although if I win a DeLorean, I don't really know what I'm gonna do with it since I don't

778
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,760
know how to drive stick, and, you know, and then there's all the other stuff you don't

779
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,000
think about, like, paying taxes, registration, and all that stuff, and shipping the car to

780
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,320
you, I mean, that's expensive.

781
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
But it's a fucking DeLorean.

782
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
But you have a fucking DeLorean.

783
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Exactly.

784
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm like, I rolled that window down, fucking pop in the CD, because it does have a CD player

785
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,760
that the guy put in it, and it's all Back to the Future soundtrack right there.

786
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,680
Just blast that shit up the radio.

787
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,360
Awesome.

788
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,520
My gaming week, um, not too terribly thrilling, because I was gone for most of the week.

789
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,000
I went to Los Angeles, I was not at E3, I always take E3 week off, but I went with Extifer

790
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,880
from Hoard House and his significant other, Matt.

791
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,800
We all went down to LA and went to, like, Universal Studios in Disneyland.

792
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,760
I won't, you know, spend too much time talking about all of that, since there wasn't a whole

793
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,280
lot of gaming involved, but I will say, that Mummy ride at Universal Studios is fucking

794
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
amazing.

795
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I loved it.

796
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,160
Extifer and I were screaming like girls, I wish somebody got a YouTube of it, because

797
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,080
you guys would have got a kick out of it.

798
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,720
Anyway, on to games.

799
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,480
When I got home, I did play some games.

800
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,160
I played multiplayer Mass Effect a little bit this weekend, because Osfer from our chat

801
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,760
room, and Acidic Vampire from our chat room, and Shane from Hoard House is also in chat.

802
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,320
We all are, like, playing now, and there's an event going on this weekend.

803
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,360
We were having fun last night, trying to survive a gold map, it didn't go very well.

804
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Actually, we got to, like, wave five, maybe.

805
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,880
Also did some multiplayer over on PlayStation 3 with another listener, Stan.

806
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,040
We had kind of a crappy connection, Soul Calibur, so we were trying to do that.

807
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,160
We have a dude with a lightsaber doing the Running Man.

808
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
I think that's Black Wolf.

809
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Anyway.

810
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,240
Yeah, more dancing now.

811
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,680
Ah, two Running Man.

812
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Now it's home!

813
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Yeah, Blender signed into the clubhouse, and I guess he accepted all these new people,

814
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
so there you go.

815
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
We got VX, Jason, XV.

816
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
Alright, anyhow, hello, back to me.

817
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,040
So there was multiplayer Soul Calibur, which sadly was too laggy, but Stan makes some hilarious

818
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
characters.

819
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
I loved his Mr. Slave.

820
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,360
I was like, people can, like, get away with that in Soul Calibur.

821
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,760
It was pretty risqué, we'll just leave it at that.

822
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,000
Then played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, which I, that's really Alan's game, not my

823
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,040
game, so I was pretty much button mashing, but hey, was having some fun.

824
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,920
Also on PlayStation, thanks to the whole PlayStation Plus, thank you Sony, for all those free freaking

825
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
games this week.

826
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
I realize they're-

827
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,040
Are you borrowing my copy of Little Big Planet 2?

828
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
No.

829
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Oh, okay.

830
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Nevermind.

831
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
I don't think so.

832
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I don't have it anywhere.

833
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Maybe I didn't loan that to you yet.

834
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
I don't think you did.

835
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,240
So, um, what the hell is that shirt?

836
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
It's like glowing, sorry, I'm distracted by hope.

837
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
It's a DVR shirt.

838
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,520
This is terrible radio!

839
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
What?

840
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,440
It looks like he's not wearing pants, or is that like a Minecraft bottom?

841
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It's like, I don't know.

842
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,720
Blender, what the hell are you wearing?

843
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,640
It looks like he's not wearing pants, and it's like a censored butt.

844
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Anyway.

845
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
PlayStation.

846
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Games.

847
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,520
Little Big Planet 2 was one of the free games.

848
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,480
So finally, what, about two years late, I'm finally getting into Little Big Planet 2.

849
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,100
It's great, obviously.

850
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,680
I love the minigames.

851
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,760
It's just a great platformer.

852
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,720
I've barely scratched the surface of the game, to be honest, but it's everything I loved

853
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,880
about the first one, now with, you know, grappling hooks from the very start, and more cutscene

854
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
stuff.

855
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,720
I will say the only thing I kind of didn't like is that the story is really weird in

856
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
the beginning.

857
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,100
I like the more ambiguous nature of the first game, which relied a lot heavier on the narrator

858
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
and so forth.

859
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,880
Now in this one, they're trying to like build a different story, and I'm not really into

860
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
it.

861
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,600
But that's my one tiny, tiny little bitch about it.

862
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,560
Otherwise, it's Little Big Planet, and it's great, and I really don't know why it took

863
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,520
me so long to get into part two.

864
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I really don't.

865
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,800
I don't have an excuse.

866
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,880
I was too busy playing Mass Effect.

867
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
We'll say that.

868
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
I still haven't really gotten into part two.

869
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:29,360
I mean, I played maybe one level of it, and I was just like, other game.

870
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,080
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

871
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,520
You know, the free Little Big Planet 2, Mass Effect, wow, Diablo, I played a little Diablo

872
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,280
with Shane, started a witch doctor, got it up to level like six or something.

873
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,960
Not too, enough to kill, enough to beat the beta.

874
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,360
We got up to the Skeleton King, and then I was like, I gotta go eat, so.

875
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,280
I killed the crap out of the Skeleton King.

876
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
It actually was hard.

877
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
A little.

878
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
A little.

879
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,080
All right, housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into E3 news.

880
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,240
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

881
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,280
Tell friends about the show, word of mouth, you know, again, we're not attached to a big

882
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
magazine.

883
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,920
We hope vognetwork.com will become all the rage someday, and geeks everywhere will visit

884
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,680
it, and then we can say we have a big website behind us supporting us.

885
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,960
What the hell is that?

886
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,560
Is that one of those aliens from Men in Black or something?

887
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,940
Blender is in home a lot.

888
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,280
He's like the home expert, like look, he started the clubhouse, and look at how well decorated

889
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,080
that is compared to the shitty one I made for OLR, which had like an airplane seat and

890
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,280
a Pac-Man cabinet.

891
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,080
So clearly if there's any weird shit in home, he has it.

892
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,600
Anyway, stop getting distracted with the visual.

893
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,640
It's terrible radio.

894
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,200
It is one of the aliens.

895
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,140
Hopefully vognetwork.com will be the shit someday, and geeks everywhere will be visiting

896
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,160
it, but until then, we don't have a multimillion dollar website backing us or any of that stuff,

897
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,120
so please tell friends about Orange Launch Radio and about VOG Network, because maybe

898
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,700
if they hate Orange Launch Radio, they'll love one of the new shows on VOG Network's

899
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:08,760
radio station, including Pod Culture on Monday nights, Anime Jam Session on Tuesday nights,

900
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,740
Warcraft Wednesdays with Girls Gone Wow and Hoard House on Wednesdays, and plenty more

901
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
to come soon.

902
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,080
All right, let's get into E3 news.

903
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,320
Loki is going to be taking this over.

904
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,360
Since I was away at Disneyland and not paying attention to my TV, I was trying to follow

905
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:31,200
the news best I could, but Loki, you were on top of everything, so let's run down the

906
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,640
various press conferences.

907
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,840
The first people up were Microsoft.

908
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,440
Okay, so Microsoft had their press conference, and it was kind of weird, because they started

909
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,320
off really strong, because they showed Halo 4.

910
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
That's how you start off a fucking press conference.

911
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,880
Halo 4.

912
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,320
Here it is.

913
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Get excited.

914
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,040
And yeah, it was pretty exciting.

915
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,160
It's a pretty awesome looking game, and just going into a little bit more detail about

916
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,360
what to kind of expect for it, and man, it looks nice.

917
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,200
I mean, actually kind of excited about Halo again, since the last one I was excited about

918
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,640
was Halo 3, so it might be interesting to pick up.

919
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,320
Some other cool stuff that they showed off besides Halo.

920
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Of course, there was the unveiling of Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was an Ubisoft game.

921
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,080
That looked pretty awesome, so they had a little clip of that.

922
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,120
Of course, talking a little bit more about arcade.

923
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,120
They had the summer of arcade stuff.

924
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,800
They're talking about some of the games we can expect for that, and actually some interesting

925
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
things.

926
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,480
Some that we already knew about, and some that were kind of on the way.

927
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,560
For example, they were talking Deadlight, which is going to be a new side scroller game.

928
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,080
It's supposed to be coming out.

929
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,880
It looked kind of like a zombie survivor horror type thing.

930
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,160
Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, which is supposed to be out, I think, in a couple weeks.

931
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,840
Dust and Elysian Tail was something that was actually supposed to be an indie game a while

932
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:13,680
back, but they ended up getting it published because it looks fucking amazing.

933
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,240
Let's see, also, Recettear, which is going to be the new Kinect game that's kind of like...

934
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,160
People are kind of saying it's a little bit like Angry Birds.

935
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:29,520
I think it's more of like, was it that, the blockbusting game that they had for the Wii.

936
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,440
That looked, eh, it's okay.

937
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
It's a Kinect game.

938
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,480
I'm always kind of hesitant about those Kinect games.

939
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,400
Other things that they were talking about, of course, entertainment was a big focus for

940
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,040
Xbox since they were talking about making this center of entertainment for your household

941
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
and stuff.

942
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,960
Of course, more app announcements, including partnerships with Nickelodeon, Paramount,

943
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,440
Makima, or Machinima, I guess, Univision, Televiso, yes.

944
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,480
Hell yeah, until somebody on Twitter told me they were ending Sabato Higante this year.

945
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,960
That's sad.

946
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,200
NHL and ESPN, of course, is getting some new stuff.

947
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,600
Other game announcements, other than Halo 4, Forza Horizon, which I knew was coming

948
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,640
out, they announced a date, October 23rd for that.

949
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,560
Fable the Journey is coming out this fall.

950
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,460
Of course, we knew about Gears of War Judgment from the whole Game Informer thing.

951
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,040
That's now coming in 2013.

952
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,640
Dance Central 3 coming out, with a partnership with Usher in there.

953
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,280
He's doing some of the choreography and some of his songs are in there.

954
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,200
Also a new Nike Fitness game is going to be coming out.

955
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,360
Kind of interesting, I guess, partnership with them.

956
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,480
Then, of course, Xbox Music was another big thing that they were talking about, the entertainment

957
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
thing.

958
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,200
You're going to have 30 million tracks with that.

959
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,440
Of course, it's going to support some of the new features like Smart Glass, which was another

960
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,960
big unveiling.

961
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:12,160
Smart Glass is basically this technology where they can use any iOS, Android, I'm assuming,

962
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Windows Phone, tablet, device, anything that you may have already.

963
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,360
You download an app for it and it becomes a second screen, just like the Wii U or the

964
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,240
Vita and the PlayStation 3.

965
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,720
I was floored, personally, hearing that that's not exclusive to a Windows device, that they

966
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,040
are going to open that up to iPads and so forth.

967
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,200
I mean, it's smart.

968
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,000
More people will adopt it because I think finally Microsoft had to admit, you know what,

969
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,880
Apple's got a big bite here.

970
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,640
We've seen Microsoft take little, like they dip their foot in the pool because there's

971
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,160
a fully functional Xbox Live app for iPhone and iPad.

972
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,980
It's a universal app that's actually quite good.

973
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,680
It's very similar to the Xbox.com website.

974
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,020
You can manage your friends list from it.

975
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,720
You see your avatars.

976
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,320
It's a full-fledged app.

977
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,040
Microsoft doing stuff with Apple products is not unheard of, but I did not think they

978
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,960
were going to just jump in the pool full in, so this was a pleasant surprise.

979
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,080
Yeah, and this is not just for games.

980
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,720
I mean, they did announce that Halo 4 and Madden are going to both support this technology,

981
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,280
but it's pretty much for everything, including they're talking about some support for some

982
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
of the apps that they had.

983
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,000
One of the examples they gave was Game of Thrones.

984
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,920
You could be watching Game of Thrones and getting supplemental information about the

985
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,840
series on your tablet while you're watching the series.

986
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,000
For example, they'd be showing different locations and it'll zoom in on a map to where those

987
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,960
locations are in the whole world.

988
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,960
Honestly, it reminds me a lot of the tie-in stuff that they have with some of these Blu-rays.

989
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,740
I don't know if you've seen a lot of Blu-rays that have iPod apps or iPad apps that you

990
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,240
can watch with the movie and it will have that supplemental information.

991
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,720
This technology's been around out there, but now they're adopting it for the console.

992
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,760
Plus, you'll be able to control your console using this as well.

993
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
That's kind of neat.

994
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,480
Of course, long-awaited finally announced Internet Explorer is coming to the Xbox.

995
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,520
We will now have an internet browser.

996
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,880
It will support the smart glass stuff.

997
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,560
It'll also be connect-enabled and you'll be able to use voice commands to do searches

998
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,160
and stuff like that.

999
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,660
That's pretty cool.

1000
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, but hey, whatever, at least it's an option to

1001
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
browse the internet.

1002
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Cool.

1003
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,040
Honestly.

1004
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,560
It'll get porn on my 360, so yay for that.

1005
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,920
Xbox porn.

1006
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,640
What about emulators?

1007
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,760
Do we know if it's going to support Flash or Java or any of that?

1008
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
No idea.

1009
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,760
Because you know, it isn't complete until you get Super Mario Brothers running on your

1010
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,760
Xbox.

1011
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,760
They already technically have that reset glitch Xboxes and they have the dual NAND reset glitch

1012
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,860
chips you can get where you have one mode that you can boot in that's hacked and one

1013
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,680
that's stock.

1014
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,800
Going to some comments from our chatroom at vognetwork.com, Osfer says, I can't wait for

1015
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,920
Halo 4.

1016
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,040
The Metroid atmosphere and look to it really pulled me in and Cortana looks better and

1017
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,840
more emotionally charged than ever.

1018
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,200
I've heard a lot of good things about it from people who were on the show floor.

1019
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,960
You know, I got to admit, I feel the same way as much as I wasn't super duper into the

1020
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,440
first person Metroid games.

1021
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Well, that's not true.

1022
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,440
I did love Metroid Prime 3, but I mean, like just seeing that gameplay footage of Halo

1023
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,360
4 for me, sorry, I'm going backwards, but blame the chatroom.

1024
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,480
I was really into it.

1025
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,800
I mean, I, and I haven't really cared about Halo since Halo 3, which, you know, once I

1026
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,640
played Halo 3 wasn't, you know, it didn't throw me the same way Halo 2 did, but watching

1027
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,400
the Halo 4, I was like, you know, maybe the change in developers wasn't necessarily a

1028
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,400
bad thing because it forces them to kind of start over with some new ideas and you do

1029
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,400
see some of this other influence and I, you know, and that's no disrespect towards Bungie.

1030
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,160
They made a great game and I'm sure whatever they've got, this destiny thing is going to

1031
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,160
kick ass too.

1032
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,160
Well, let's look at it this way.

1033
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,160
I mean, look at you had people making need for speed games and granted the need for speed

1034
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,600
games are pretty good and now you have, you know, another company criterion making these

1035
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,800
need for speed games, you know, or making sequels to these need for speed games and

1036
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
they're better.

1037
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,640
You know, not saying that the old ones weren't good, but now they're, you know, they have

1038
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,680
a fresh take on them and so it's a little bit better.

1039
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:50,860
One other thing of, you know, kind of, it was a bit of a rumor, but now those $99 contract

1040
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,720
Xboxes or whatever are coming to more retailers other than Microsoft stores because Microsoft,

1041
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,320
they kind of figured, hey, we don't have a lot of stores out there, so best buys and

1042
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,760
also select GameStop locations and from what I hear also from my boss meeting with Microsoft,

1043
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,560
there is actually, anybody's going to be able to do it as long as you're willing, as long

1044
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:17,480
as you fit the criteria that they are looking for and there's like specific things that

1045
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,480
they need, so.

1046
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,720
By the way, this was on the OLR Twitter last week, just saying.

1047
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,640
Sometimes you get the secrets, little secrets, what we can, what little secrets we get, we

1048
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,080
will let you know.

1049
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,040
So there was all that stuff.

1050
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:38,240
Overall, I think they had a decent press conference just, you know, and I know a lot of the people

1051
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,280
that were kind of, oh, some other announcements that they made, of course, and some of the

1052
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,520
stuff, of course, they showed Black Ops 2, a little bit of that and they announced that

1053
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,920
they're getting DLC first for that.

1054
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,720
Game with South Park, The Stick of Truth is getting DLC for it first, it's coming out

1055
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
March 5th now.

1056
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,480
It's going to have Kinect support as well on the 360.

1057
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,240
Tomb Raider is getting the DLC first on Xbox and also Resident Evil 6 is getting DLC first

1058
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
on there.

1059
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,660
I got to say, the South Park, The Stick of Truth, fucking amazing looking, is just, I

1060
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,780
cannot wait for that game.

1061
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,280
That game looks perfect.

1062
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:17,760
I really hope I'm not let down because sometimes trailers look good.

1063
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,760
It looks great.

1064
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,160
But yeah, a lot of the complaints about the press conference were, you know, hey, the

1065
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,520
whole entertainment stuff, hey, I'm here to see the games.

1066
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,440
I don't want to see, you know, all this garbage about Nickelodeon and Paramount and Xbox music.

1067
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,240
I don't fucking care about Xbox music.

1068
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,600
But eh, no K-Press conference.

1069
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,880
All right.

1070
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
So next up.

1071
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,760
How do you think overall Microsoft did?

1072
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,060
There were a lot of people online kind of razzing Microsoft, not fans of the press conference,

1073
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,600
but in a way I was kind of like, well, what the hell did you expect this year?

1074
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,680
You knew you weren't going to be seeing the new Xbox.

1075
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
They said that.

1076
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,040
I know people were saying, oh, because Destiny isn't being shown anymore.

1077
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,640
They're going to have to give us hints about the new.

1078
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,640
No, they don't.

1079
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,640
They're not going to do it.

1080
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,160
They'll just show more Halo, you know, which is probably what they did.

1081
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,440
Yeah, they did show a Halo and they showed some third party stuff.

1082
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,400
One of the things I'm kind of surprised they didn't show anything for was Fable The Journey.

1083
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,200
Not much other than announcing that it's going to be coming out fourth quarter.

1084
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,120
They didn't really show anything.

1085
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,360
That is interesting.

1086
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,720
I was, you know, I was hardcore thinking there was going to be something with Windows 8.

1087
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
And I guess I was wrong there.

1088
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,720
The smart glass thing kind of is going to be, I get like a half point.

1089
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,840
I think smart glass, well smart glass also supports, not only does it support tablet

1090
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,220
because not, let's be honest, not everybody has a tablet or smartphone.

1091
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,500
It also does support computers, like PCs and laptops.

1092
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:50,580
So if you have a laptop, you can also control your Xbox, although I asked then why the fuck

1093
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:54,920
do I need to, you know, view my content on the Xbox if I have my laptop in front of me,

1094
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,920
but whatever.

1095
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Hey, it's another option.

1096
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,400
Sometimes, you know, sometimes you have that party environment.

1097
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,980
You want to show multiple people at once, like, you know, remember, remember that one

1098
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,700
New Year's Eve party where we were looking up on the Wii.

1099
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,480
We had to see the dinosaur porn or what was that?

1100
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,200
The pterodactyl porno.

1101
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,960
Thank you, Wii browser.

1102
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,400
That's fantastic.

1103
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,000
One of those websites, yes, it is, it was a chick and some dude in a pterodactyl suit

1104
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
and it was the most hilarious thing.

1105
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Ridiculous.

1106
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,640
Anyhow, from Microsoft to pterodactyl porn.

1107
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,120
Let's go to the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.

1108
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,320
A lot of props for South Park, Acidic Vampire says South Park looks great.

1109
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,600
Stan says, I think it will be good.

1110
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,280
The South Park creators are really involved in this game.

1111
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,480
Tiger Claw says, I liked how Trey Parker and Matt Stone trolled the Microsoft press conference

1112
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,800
when they showed up for their game.

1113
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
That was fantastic.

1114
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,800
Mm-hmm.

1115
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,880
And Degenerate Johnny says, I'm calling it.

1116
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,480
One of the South Park's DLC will be carbon's ass.

1117
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,800
Could be ass of fire.

1118
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,720
Well, they have, you know, it's very cool the way they're doing it.

1119
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,120
The Lemmywinks or whatever that was.

1120
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,920
They do have a Lemmywinks tie and one of the finishing or one of the summons you get is

1121
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,520
Mr. Slave and Mr. Slave sucks the enemy into his ass.

1122
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Literally.

1123
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,640
Well, that was, that was that whole Paris Hilton episode or whatever it was.

1124
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Yes.

1125
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
It's basically that.

1126
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,920
So, you know, nothing is off limits or sacred.

1127
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,660
It's interesting, but it's kind of cool though because you get to play as your own character

1128
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,660
in there.

1129
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,320
So you design your own character and that's kind of neat.

1130
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,680
Let me ask Dark Sakura.

1131
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,240
I know you're the classic gamer of the bunch, but is there anything on the Microsoft press

1132
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,080
conference that has you excited at all?

1133
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,080
Any halos or South Park's or no.

1134
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,160
I mean Halo 4, I guess Dan's going to get it, you know, cause he's Mr. Halo of the house,

1135
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,480
but I don't give a crap about South Park.

1136
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,800
What about the Tomb Raider reboot cause I don't like Tomb Raider.

1137
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
But it's a reboot.

1138
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,800
You never know.

1139
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
But I don't like Tomb Raider.

1140
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,840
I'm still looking forward to that.

1141
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:02,000
Although the delay, you know, having to see it two years in a row is a little bit like,

1142
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,320
but I suppose not the, it's not the first game that won't be the last that gets shown

1143
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,320
across multiple years.

1144
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,320
Unless I can lock the butler in the fridge and break her neck.

1145
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,320
I'm not interested.

1146
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,840
It's technically a prequel, so I don't think there's a butler.

1147
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,920
You crash on an island.

1148
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,440
It's uncharted Tomb Raider.

1149
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,060
I don't like uncharted anyway, so.

1150
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,060
It looks good.

1151
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,060
Go for it.

1152
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,400
I mean, it looks good.

1153
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
I'm glad they showed it again.

1154
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Yeah.

1155
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Cause you kind of forget about it.

1156
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:36,280
Okay, so next was Nintendo, and Nintendo, gotta love them, but I don't understand how

1157
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,080
they're able to pull something like this off.

1158
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,360
They had three press conferences, cause one was not enough.

1159
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,560
They had a conference that was a pre-E3 conference that talked a little bit about the Wii U.

1160
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,360
Then they had their regular conference, which talked mostly about the Wii U, and then they

1161
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,300
had a 3DS conference the following day.

1162
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,760
You have three press conferences, and yet you still don't show a lot of shit.

1163
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,080
I just don't understand how that works.

1164
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,120
But okay, so let's start off with the pre-press conference thing that they had, or pre-E3

1165
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,120
press conference.

1166
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:12,460
They talked some of the key features of the Wii U, and including this brand new interface,

1167
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
I guess.

1168
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,400
It's gonna be the Miiverse, and what Miiverse is, it's kind of an upgrade of the Mi Plaza.

1169
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:24,320
You basically see all your Mi's congregating Mi's from friends, Mi's of people playing

1170
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,660
different games, and you see them playing the different games, and plus you can talk

1171
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,120
to each other, not only in text chat, but you can picto chat with them as well.

1172
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,080
So it's Facebook for me?

1173
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Something like that.

1174
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,000
You basically can interact with people in a really elaborate way.

1175
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,120
They've got, you know, I guess spoiler stuff that you can do in there where you can make

1176
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,520
it so that people don't see your post, don't want to get spoiled on the game, but they

1177
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,360
have this whole kind of, like you can post in different spots in games and stuff, like

1178
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,640
for example, oh, I'm having trouble in this area in the game, can anybody help me?

1179
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,000
And then like, you know, hey, I got through this part of the game like this.

1180
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,360
That's great and all, but I mean, that's kind of like what Game Facts is for, or something

1181
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
like that.

1182
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,200
I just, I guess it's neat that they have this feature and that they showed all this stuff,

1183
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,640
but I don't know, whatever.

1184
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,040
One of the other things they are showing off also is a brand new controller for the Wii

1185
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,960
U, the Wii U Pro Controller, which looks like an Xbox 360 controller with the analog stick

1186
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,920
and the face buttons flip flopped.

1187
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,480
Cool.

1188
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:37,480
I guess that'll be used also in conjunction with, you know, the Wii Pad and stuff if you

1189
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,000
want to play like regular games instead of using the Wii Remote, although it will support

1190
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,280
a Wii Remote and all the Wii accessories as well.

1191
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
So that's kind of neat.

1192
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,840
And then of course, you know, they talked about some of the revisions to the Wii Pad

1193
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,280
is what they're calling it now, the Wii Game Pad.

1194
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:02,140
And basically, you know, the mysterious buttons that were shown there, the one below the directional

1195
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,200
pad is the near field communication thing, which is weird because I thought it would

1196
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,640
be like on the screen.

1197
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,920
It seems to make more sense to me, but I guess they had to put it on the side or something.

1198
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,720
So they have a TV button on there.

1199
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:21,880
What the TV button is for is for actually using the tablet as a remote for your TV,

1200
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
like a universal remote.

1201
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,000
You can actually launch the system and everything from the pad before you even turn the system

1202
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,160
on you or you can just switch the channel on your TV.

1203
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,360
I could do that with my Xbox controller.

1204
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,360
Good question from She-Hulk in our chat room.

1205
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,480
And I didn't catch this either.

1206
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,860
No Blu-ray or DVD for the Wii U?

1207
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,240
They didn't say what they're using.

1208
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,240
Huh.

1209
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Interesting.

1210
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
OK.

1211
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,680
They didn't say what kind of discs they're using.

1212
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:54,080
Maybe they feel it's not needed because I noticed Reggie did emphasize, and the way

1213
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,240
he said it too is very interesting.

1214
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:03,280
He said, you know, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, it's there.

1215
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,600
You know, he's like, it's all there.

1216
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,200
Yes, of course it's there, but we want you to experience Miiverse, you know, it's kind

1217
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
of interesting.

1218
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,680
Well, let's talk about stuff that people aren't going to care about, and let's talk more in

1219
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,000
great detail about something else.

1220
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,800
But to his credit, what else are you going to say about Netflix and Amazon and Hulu?

1221
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,920
Everybody knows that stuff already, you know?

1222
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
They're there.

1223
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Yay!

1224
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,520
That's really all there is to say.

1225
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,520
Yeah.

1226
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,520
You rhymed.

1227
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,640
Rama in our chat room says Wii U will support Blu-ray storage.

1228
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
OK.

1229
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,760
Well, I haven't seen anything yet, but I would assume it's Blu-ray unless they're going to

1230
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,160
have their own proprietary format, which, you know, whatever.

1231
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:45,000
One, of course, the big game, the first game that they unveiled was Pikmin 3.

1232
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,480
You know, something that has been rumored to be coming to the Wii or the Wii U at some

1233
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,120
point, and it is a launch title, so they showed off Pikmin 3, and it looks pretty, except

1234
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:59,120
I don't care about Pikmin, so, you know, whatever.

1235
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:03,220
And as you mentioned, you know, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Instant Video

1236
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,720
coming to the Wii U, hopefully at launch, because they like to announce things that

1237
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,960
aren't necessarily going to be ready.

1238
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,480
Scribblenauts Unlimited was another game that they showed off that's pretty awesome.

1239
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:22,600
It does use the tablet, so you can actually create your own words in this, so that's kind

1240
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
of cool.

1241
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,280
That's the neat feature there, and it can be played exclusively on the tablet if you

1242
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,280
want.

1243
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,720
And then they announced some stuff from Namco, which I honestly have never heard of before

1244
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,080
today, but Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tank Tank Tank, where did that come from?

1245
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,200
I'm getting a Wii U.

1246
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,920
I did not hear these rumors.

1247
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,360
I would have never heard them on our show.

1248
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,880
We would never have, you know, known about that a few weeks ago.

1249
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,880
Yeah.

1250
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,960
And then of course, a surprise, they're trying to Director's Cut coming to the Wii U, which

1251
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,960
is neat.

1252
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,760
Now, I might have missed this because I was playing in a home over there for a second

1253
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,320
checking out the awesome backyard that Blender built for the clubhouse, but Mass Effect 3,

1254
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,320
Wii U?

1255
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,600
Mass Effect 3 is turned to the Wii U.

1256
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,960
Which has a lot of us kind of wondering, how is that going to work, because, I mean, you

1257
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,960
can't...

1258
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,480
Maybe you target on your little monitor.

1259
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,280
Well, yeah, no, that part I figure maybe the biotics and the gun stuff is on the monitor

1260
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,380
or whatever, but I'm kind of like, how can you just skip Mass Effect 2?

1261
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,080
Like Mass Effect 1, I can see people skipping, although I don't recommend it.

1262
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,100
I could see you skipping that, but you can't skip Mass Effect 2.

1263
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,480
You can't.

1264
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,120
So Mass Effect 3 is going to have to really have something special to separate it from

1265
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,660
the other versions to get me to want to buy it.

1266
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,400
Although Mass Effect 3 does have a pretty awesome multiplayer, so it'll be interesting

1267
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,440
to see if that's pulled off as well on the Nintendo system.

1268
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,480
Plus, microtransaction hell, again, I wonder if that's going to be pulled off as seamlessly

1269
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,480
on the Wii U.

1270
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,800
They must think so.

1271
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,160
So I think that tells us a lot right there about Nintendo's online structure.

1272
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,000
If EA's willing to put Mass Effect 3 on it.

1273
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,760
Another title that they announced was Sing, which is being developed by the DJ Hero developers,

1274
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,200
and Sing is your generic karaoke game with the words on the Wii pad.

1275
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Whoopty shit.

1276
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,740
That's what I have to say about that.

1277
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,400
And admit it, Call Me Maybe was stuck in your head all week long after that, and it's the

1278
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,400
number one song on iTunes.

1279
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Nope.

1280
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
It was not.

1281
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Honestly.

1282
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,400
I've never heard of that before.

1283
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,680
I would play it for you, but you'd slap me.

1284
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,680
Is it that bad?

1285
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,680
It's pretty bad.

1286
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,320
3DS stuff, they talked a little bit about Paper Mario, that's supposed to be coming

1287
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,400
out this season, holiday season.

1288
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,560
New Super Mario Brothers 2, which is headed to the 3DS on August 19th.

1289
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:48,000
Also Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon for the 3DS this holiday.

1290
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,060
They of course announced, I thought it was going to be New Super Mario Brothers Me, oh,

1291
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:01,680
but they had to trump me, and it's now called New Super Mario Brothers U, which is announced,

1292
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,200
and it will have multiplayer games.

1293
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Gotcha.

1294
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Oh!

1295
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Nintendo.

1296
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,840
And so they have that coming.

1297
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:14,000
Batman Arkham City Armored Edition is headed to the Wii U, and basically the Game of the

1298
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,120
Year edition with some extra bells and whistles in there.

1299
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,120
Let's see.

1300
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,800
I just want to say real quick, because some of the folks in the chat room are commenting,

1301
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,640
we're about a minute lagged from when we say things to when they get encoded and people

1302
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,640
hear them.

1303
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,360
So people in chat right now are talking about Mass Effect 3.

1304
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,300
Acidic Vampire says, no Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the Wii U equals fail.

1305
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,820
And Act Deft reminds us, PlayStation 3 skipped Mass Effect 1.

1306
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,640
But again, I'm saying Mass Effect 1 is okay to skip.

1307
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
I don't recommend it, but it's okay.

1308
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,760
But they had though, to be fair, they had a motion comic.

1309
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,000
Yes, and What Up G reminds us that they did have that bridge.

1310
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,080
So Technus says Bioware will just do another interactive graphic comic.

1311
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,580
And that's certainly kind of the likely thing.

1312
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:00,620
Now Dark Tetsuya linked us in chat to the story on MyNintendoNews that mentions that

1313
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:04,880
Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back, which I guess is what they're calling the Wii U version,

1314
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,920
will include an enhanced storyline from the original game on PlayStation, oh no, this

1315
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,800
says PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1316
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,540
I think he got the stuff mixed up, because I was going to say Take Earth Back I heard

1317
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:23,160
was a DLC expansion that's possibly coming in the future.

1318
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,000
So never mind, I guess that's not about the Wii U.

1319
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,660
That's what I get for trying to do stories live.

1320
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,920
And of course, and I'm surprised that they did this, because I didn't think it's that

1321
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,360
popular anymore, but I guess it is, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no, it said the original game,

1322
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,720
so this is about the Wii U version, it's the original game on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1323
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
and PC.

1324
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,400
Sorry, I'm just, I'm seeing this for the first time, so I'm trying to process this myself

1325
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,400
here.

1326
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,360
Because it hasn't spoken about the enhanced content, and they're saying hopefully it's

1327
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,720
not just going to be the reworked ending.

1328
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,960
But I had heard a rumor previously that Take Earth Back was supposed to be some type of

1329
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,480
expansion for the multiplayer game that had more maps, and more human classes.

1330
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,760
It's just probably the game of the year edition of Mass Effect 3 is what they're getting.

1331
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,800
And I mean, that's pretty much what it is, and with some extra bells and whistles, that's,

1332
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,880
that is a lot of their launch line up.

1333
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:12,880
Whatever.

1334
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,880
Anyhow, move on.

1335
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,560
So then of course, you know, there was also talk, well they announced also Wii Fit U,

1336
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,880
which is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, and they showed that it had like a pedometer

1337
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:29,840
attachment that's available as well, so you'll be able to interact with that.

1338
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,320
And then also, you know, some of these Wii U games, they showed that you can play them

1339
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:40,680
without actually having the system on the TV, so you can exercise and stuff like that

1340
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,960
without looking at the TV, I don't know, it just looks stupid if you're working with the

1341
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:53,320
Wii Fit balance board and Wii U tablet, I mean just, come on, it's just, whatever.

1342
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,840
And then finally also, the Wii U will support two different Wii gamepads, however there

1343
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,560
will be a hit in frames per second, it will actually be halved, so the upper limit will

1344
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:09,920
be 30 frames per second on both Wii U tablets, which, eh, whatever.

1345
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:18,440
Finally, I guess, you know the big thing for me with the Wii U, oh, oh, I forgot my most

1346
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:25,920
favorite one unveiled that they had, Lego City Stories, which is now Lego City Undercover,

1347
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,040
is coming to the 3DS and the Wii U, and it looks pretty awesome.

1348
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,600
I think it's a different developer now, because before it looked like Grand Theft Auto, it

1349
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,240
still has that kind of sandbox thing to it, but it definitely doesn't look like Grand

1350
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,480
Theft Auto anymore, but it looks pretty amazing, definitely one of the launch games to have

1351
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,720
on that.

1352
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,340
However, it doesn't sell me a system, and I still am worried that they didn't talk enough

1353
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,360
about what their online plan is.

1354
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,560
Yeah, we know about Miiverse and I can talk with people, leave them little notes about

1355
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,700
shit in-game, but that doesn't tell me what your infrastructure is, or how you're playing

1356
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,440
to do all this stuff.

1357
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,320
You know, in the games that they announced for launch, half of them are stuff that's

1358
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,320
already been out.

1359
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:20,960
You have Ninja Gaiden 3, you've got Batman Arkham City, and Darksiders 2, which are going

1360
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,840
to have already been out for a few months by the time the system launches.

1361
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:32,000
You know, Assassin's Creed 3 looks pretty cool, but why should I buy another system

1362
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,040
to play a game that I can already play on my system right now, and it will look pretty

1363
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,840
much the same, but it's going to have a few extra gimmicks with it, with this new controller.

1364
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,180
That's the problem that doesn't sell me on this stuff.

1365
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,040
For the Wii, for the people that own a Wii, yes, it's a great upgrade to the system that

1366
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,760
you already have, but you can also get that same kind of upgrade with an Xbox or PlayStation

1367
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,560
3.

1368
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
That's the problem I have.

1369
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,960
There's just not a lot to launch, you know, the lineup is not that great for me.

1370
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,000
Also, new Super Mario Brothers U.

1371
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,600
You mean you don't want Nintendo Land?

1372
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,240
Oh yeah, how am I forgetting about Nintendo Land?

1373
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Nintendo Land.

1374
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,240
I was going to say, I haven't heard of Nintendo Land yet.

1375
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,240
Nintendo Land.

1376
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,080
Um, basically the Wii Sports Wii Play, whatever, Tech Demo Land.

1377
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,400
The giant cocktease land, because there's my F-Zero, did you see that?

1378
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,960
It is basically Tech Demo Land, that is what it is, it's their fucking spinning tech demos

1379
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,960
together.

1380
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,960
Well.

1381
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,080
I will bet you anything that will be a fucking packing game.

1382
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,240
It has to be.

1383
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,840
What was Wii Sports?

1384
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,960
What was Wii Sports?

1385
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,640
It was Tech Demo Land.

1386
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,840
And it was the pack-in game.

1387
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,920
So of course Nintendo Land is the pack-in game.

1388
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,440
They might not necessarily have a pack-in game, but I think it might be the pack-in

1389
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,440
game.

1390
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
Which is great.

1391
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,480
Maybe they'll have two, they might have two SKUs where one is the, kind of like, remember

1392
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,360
the old old school NES, how they actually had three versions of that when that first

1393
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,360
came out.

1394
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,700
There was the robot pack that came with Rob the Robot and like Gyromite.

1395
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,800
And then there was the action pack that came with the Zapper and Super Mario Brothers Duck

1396
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Hunt.

1397
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,040
And then there was the vanilla ass pack, I don't remember what it was called.

1398
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,040
The core.

1399
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,040
The core?

1400
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,040
Did they call things core back then?

1401
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
I think it was called the core system.

1402
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,040
Hmm.

1403
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,880
Well whatever, it was just the NES and Super Mario Brothers basically.

1404
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,680
So I wonder if the Wii U won't launch with a similar type of thing where you could have

1405
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:22,680
just the plain Jane system or you get the extra, maybe the extra Wii U controllers since

1406
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,640
we hear that they will support two players.

1407
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,240
Yeah, here's the thing though, they're gonna support two players, but not any of the launch

1408
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,520
titles are gonna support two players on those pads.

1409
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,360
So it's something that's coming way down the line.

1410
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:42,080
But I'm sorry, it just doesn't, you have a brand new system that you're launching and

1411
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,560
then you, like your Mario game, New Super Mario Brothers U, don't get me wrong, New

1412
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,640
Super Mario Brothers is probably an awesome game.

1413
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,440
I didn't play much of the first game, but you know what, I played New Super Mario Brothers

1414
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,160
on the DS and it was great.

1415
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,560
It was a great game.

1416
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,380
And I'm sure Wii, New Super Mario Brothers was pretty awesome.

1417
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:06,320
And then you've got New Super Mario Brothers for the 3DS, New Super Mario Brothers 2.

1418
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,340
And now you have New Super Mario Brothers U.

1419
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,120
The problem is, that game looks last gen.

1420
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,240
And that game looks like a Wii game.

1421
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:17,680
And yes, I know, you know, it's a great game and you're launching it on the system, but

1422
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:22,960
you, I think you need, if you want to show off this game, this system, you need to like

1423
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,660
come out with something big, like a Super Mario Galaxy type of game or a Mario 64.

1424
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:33,200
Something like, holy shit, I did not expect to see Mario like that instead of, hey look,

1425
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,880
it's slightly prettier New Super Mario Brothers.

1426
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,120
It just doesn't look good.

1427
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,440
As much as I, like, I do want that Mario Brothers Wii U game, but I'm not sure I'm totally sold

1428
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,840
on this system yet.

1429
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,800
But just to be devil's advocate for a minute, doesn't Pikmin 3 kind of show off some of

1430
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,320
those capabilities a little better?

1431
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,320
Tank.

1432
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,320
Yeah, but Pikmin.

1433
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,080
Pikmin 3 is not a game I think that's going to appeal to everybody.

1434
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,080
I don't think it, Pikmin doesn't have, it has a following, but it doesn't have a huge

1435
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
following.

1436
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,080
It's a niche game.

1437
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,080
Let's be honest, it's a niche game.

1438
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,840
It didn't sell that great.

1439
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,320
It's not a Super Mario Brothers.

1440
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,560
Rama's reminding me of a couple other Nintendo packs that I forgot earlier.

1441
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,960
There was the Power Pack when the Power Pad came out.

1442
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,960
That was later.

1443
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,440
But yeah, the MarioBrothers.com world class track meet.

1444
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,240
And he says that there was one that was Hogan's Alley in Duck Hunt.

1445
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,600
I don't remember Hogan's Alley ever being a pack-in game, but maybe it was like, it

1446
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,680
wasn't very well distributed.

1447
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,280
I remember Hogan's Alley as a launch game, and that would make sense as like a zapper

1448
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,240
pack or something, but anyway.

1449
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,000
Orange Launch Radio reporting the news from 25 years ago.

1450
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,180
But I mean, that's just my problem though, is they don't have, there's still a lot of

1451
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,040
information that we need from Nintendo.

1452
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,600
A price and a date, for God's sake.

1453
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,920
Well, but they did that with the Wii.

1454
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,320
They came out later around Tokyo Game Show time, because they don't do Tokyo Game Show,

1455
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,840
but they'll do their own little thing, and that's when they'll announce it.

1456
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,240
Well, cool, but I need to know more about the system.

1457
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,840
And right now, as it stands, I'm not buying one.

1458
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,760
I'm not even buying one near launch.

1459
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,320
I just, I don't want it.

1460
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,320
I don't...

1461
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,440
I'm kind of with you, but the price will, I mean, A, the price, and B, my disposable

1462
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,040
income, which I may or may not have at that end of the year, will really factor into my

1463
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,040
decision.

1464
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:19,560
One other thing too is just, I don't, I learned my lesson with the Wii.

1465
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,680
The Wii was awesome, I had fun, but see, the Wii compared to what was already currently

1466
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,480
available was very, very different.

1467
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,960
This is just, hey look, I have a traditional controller with a goddamn screen on it.

1468
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,880
Here's my problem with it.

1469
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,400
You know all these cool things that you're talking about with that controller?

1470
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,400
Well guess what?

1471
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,620
You've had two screens for fucking years now with the DS, and how many really truly unique

1472
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,520
games have you seen come out of it?

1473
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
Probably a handful.

1474
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,880
You can count them on one hand.

1475
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:51,040
Of games that are really using both screens, just in an amazing way.

1476
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:57,520
But I don't think we're gonna get a lot of these really big games, because you just,

1477
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,240
I mean you've had time to do something unique with this, and you're just not gonna use these

1478
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,240
two screens.

1479
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,240
It's gonna be a gimmick.

1480
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,280
I will say this though to Nintendo's credit, is that even though the Wii U lineup left

1481
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,320
me feeling, and I think a lot of us feeling a little, eh, especially when they ended with

1482
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,760
Nintendo Land, I think that was a big, eh.

1483
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,760
Oh, yeah.

1484
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,760
That was just kinda, that's it?

1485
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Yeah, that was too bad.

1486
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,760
There was no Zelda or something?

1487
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,000
But, the 3DS lineup looked great.

1488
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I gotta say.

1489
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,160
That new, you know, the Golden Coins Mario game looked great.

1490
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,440
The Castlevania game especially looked great.

1491
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,320
So I feel like the 3DS, I kinda wish they'd shown, I mean I realize they did that whole

1492
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,680
second press conference where they showed more, but I was kinda hoping for a little

1493
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,400
more at the big show, because there's a lot of good stuff going on in the 3DS.

1494
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,160
Was there something that was missing?

1495
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,560
The redesign of the 3DS?

1496
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,840
Well, that too, but, Animal Crossing.

1497
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,840
No Animal Crossing.

1498
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,640
It was missing, wasn't it?

1499
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,640
Delayed.

1500
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,440
Don't think it's coming out this year.

1501
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,600
Delayed!

1502
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Not coming out this year.

1503
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Swept under the rug.

1504
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Delayed.

1505
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
I betcha.

1506
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,760
I, you know what, I guarantee that's not coming out this year.

1507
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,400
Too many, there's too many games that they have first party that are coming out that

1508
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,400
they won't put out this year.

1509
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,600
It's not ready.

1510
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,360
I think the Wii U might end up suffering a little bit like the 3DS did.

1511
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,440
Not a strong enough launch, and next year they cut the price.

1512
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:21,500
It is a very, I gotta say, I mean, you're gonna have a hard time selling somebody on,

1513
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:26,640
let's just, you know, an average parent or whatever, okay, I can buy this system now,

1514
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,720
well who knows what the Wii's gonna be, you know, dropping down to, I mean, let's say

1515
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:37,200
it goes down to, you know, 99 bucks or something, oh man, 99 dollar Wii, that'd be crazy, but,

1516
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,800
you know, you've got the Wii system right now, and I can buy new Super Mario Brothers,

1517
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,360
and it's pretty awesome, I mean, the people aren't gonna know, oh hey, oh that's the Wii

1518
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:51,200
U version, you know, and honestly, the Wii U stuff, aside from, oh cool, I, you know,

1519
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:57,640
I can play on my Wii pad or whatever when, um, you know, someone's on the TV, fuck, that's

1520
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,000
not how you're supposed to be selling your system.

1521
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,800
You're not supposed to be selling your system, hey, when someone wants to watch TV, you can

1522
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,000
play your game system on this pad, no, you're supposed to say, hey, when someone's playing

1523
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,800
something on the TV, you bop out your fucking 3DS and you play New Super Mario Brothers

1524
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,960
2 on there, that's how you fucking solve that situation, you sell them on the portable system

1525
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,560
and the regular system, you don't say, hey, you don't fucking need the portable system

1526
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,280
because, hey, you got the stupid tablet now, they're fucking stupid, I mean, it's just

1527
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,280
dumb.

1528
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,160
Let's, we're at an hour 18, so, before we move on this, let me read some comments from

1529
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:36,400
chat on this whole thing, um, Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, at, um, vognetwork.com

1530
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,920
live chat says, I would like a new platformer of Black Tiger for the Wii U and that would

1531
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,480
help convince me to buy one, I have the PlayStation 2 compilation pack with Black Tiger and Dungeon

1532
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:49,080
Buster chimes in saying, I'd snatch one up day one if it had something like that, everybody's

1533
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,560
got their dream game, you know, I've been sitting here saying F-Zero, F-Zero, F-Zero,

1534
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,960
god damn it, F-Zero, you know, everybody's got their game that they want to have, um,

1535
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,040
let's see, uh, Acidic Vampire says, screw a 3DS Castlevania, give me a next gen Castlevania

1536
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:07,080
a la Symphony of the Night, amen to that, shadow next gen, who is at the show, chimes

1537
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:16,600
in, most of the Wii U titles shown at E3 are launch titles, so, no, no, no, no, no, true,

1538
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:22,960
true and not true, launch window titles, no, I'm serious, they're not launch day titles,

1539
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,720
they're launch window and that's, and although what he's saying is mostly true, Nintendo

1540
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:33,400
doesn't, I mean, Nintendo certainly doesn't project, let's say, quite as badly as Sony,

1541
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:41,160
Last Guardian, or Microsoft, Halo 4 last year and Tomb Raider, do, but, Nintendo did, really,

1542
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:47,240
troll us, what, really, they, they don't project, not as bad, I'm not saying, but I will, I

1543
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,480
am saying, Nintendo did do that whole Smash Brothers thing last year, and we know that

1544
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,640
that's a good three years away, but, but, but, but, they didn't show anything, and they

1545
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:02,800
said, we're announcing it, it'll come out eventually, ooh, Rob, Raginator's calling

1546
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:10,920
on you, what, why, what, F-Zero is overrated, get out, someone smack him with a fish, is

1547
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,460
he in the home, is he in the home, cause I'm gonna go bop him in the head and Sony home

1548
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:19,900
right now, I'm on the hunt, where's Raginator, I'm gonna go smack him, meanwhile, speaking

1549
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:27,160
of Sony, let's talk a little bit about Sony, Sony had some pretty interesting things, they

1550
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:35,800
came out talking about, you know, their Sony mascot Battle Royale, Sony All Stars Battle

1551
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,620
Royale game, did announce two new characters for it, and kind of confirming that there

1552
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,700
are gonna be some third party characters in there, they announced Big Daddy's gonna be

1553
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:51,080
one of the playable characters, and also Nathan Drake, which is kind of a duh, but those are

1554
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:59,360
gonna be available as well, I'm sure they've got a lot more to unveil there, they did talk

1555
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:11,080
a little bit about some interesting ideas, I guess, one of them was this, I don't even

1556
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:17,600
know why, a Wonder Book, it kind of makes me wonder why they would come out with this,

1557
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:24,440
Wonder Book is basically this paper book that has AR tags in it, and it interacts with,

1558
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,440
not necessarily, well the move, it does interact with that, but it interacts with the Playstation

1559
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:35,600
I, and it's supposed to make reading more like TV, and one of the first games, if you

1560
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:42,400
will, that's gonna use it is JK Rowling's Book of Spells, and you know, they're kind

1561
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:49,320
of selling it on, oh hey, she wrote it, and it's all this all new stuff, and hey, check

1562
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:55,880
it out, it's pretty sweet, it was pretty fucking boring, it was probably the worst thing that

1563
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,880
they had of their whole.

1564
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,300
Here's the thing though, now keep in mind, we weren't watching the press conference,

1565
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,760
we were only reading the tweets, because we were in line for Indiana Jones, or something

1566
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:12,800
at the time, so while you guys were kind of like seeing that, and I guess bored with the

1567
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,480
presentation, those of us were kind of reading about it, and we actually sat there going,

1568
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,480
that is a brilliant move by Sony, because the part there that you glossed over that

1569
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:29,080
I think is crucial, they have fucking JK Rowling in their back pocket now, don't underestimate

1570
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:34,440
the power of that woman, Pottermore ain't that great either, Pottermore is actually

1571
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,580
pretty neat, and people, but I suck at mixing spells, MC people, there's a lot of people

1572
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:50,400
going crazy over it, Pottermore is also very age broad, true, I just think, I think there's

1573
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,920
a lot more to this, especially with the whole, you know, Sony does have a family friendly

1574
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,640
thing that they need to try to get a little bit of that Nintendo audience, and I think

1575
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,000
the Wonder Book is a way to kind of push that, don't underestimate it, that's all I'm saying,

1576
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,800
you know what, I understand where you're coming from there, but it's, you're asking someone

1577
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,120
to purchase, if they don't own a Playstation 3, you're asking them to purchase a Playstation

1578
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:18,440
3, a Playstation Move set up, and then this Wonder Book on top of it, like a $400 investment

1579
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,960
for a fucking lame ass looking game, but, I keep saying Wonder Book and I think of Super

1580
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:28,120
Book, but, right, what if you're the soccer mom sitting there deciding which one of those

1581
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:33,660
three systems to put under the tree at Christmas, the Playstation 3, the 360, or the Wii U,

1582
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:39,240
and you've got a decision to make, one of them has JK Rowling in it, oh, well, I enjoy

1583
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,800
the Harry Potter books myself, being a soccer mom, I might buy that one instead.

1584
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,160
Well, you know what, that's fine, because at least they'll be disappointed and they'll

1585
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,520
still have a capable gaming system when they're done wasting their time with Book of Spells,

1586
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:04,440
but honestly, I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but to buy that for that specific thing,

1587
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:09,680
it looks terrible, it looks fucking terrible, and if you think about it, Rob, they also

1588
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,840
have Harry Potter for Kinect, so if you want to go that bullshit route of, well, they have

1589
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,960
JK Rowling to this Book of Things, yeah, I could read a fucking book and pretend to do

1590
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,360
magic or I could become fucking Harry Potter!

1591
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,360
Alright.

1592
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,400
I think becoming Harry Potter wins!

1593
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,400
Fine, you made your point.

1594
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,640
I'm in fucking Hogwarts, my creepy face is on that stupid avatar!

1595
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,200
Fine, you made your point, let's move on, we're spending more time talking about Wonder

1596
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,880
Book than they did at the conference.

1597
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,540
So anyways, other things that they talked about besides Wonder Book, of course, a lot

1598
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:44,120
of cool stuff for Playstation Plus, Playstation Plus, as we mentioned, you're gonna get a

1599
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,120
lot of free content, and they announced, you know, the Playstation Plus members are gonna

1600
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:54,960
get 12 new games starting this month, and of course, you know, full free games, if you're

1601
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,520
a subscriber of Playstation Plus, and they're gonna be adding more as time goes on.

1602
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,560
Also, Playstation 1 classics are coming back to the Vita, no duh there, that's kind of,

1603
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,240
you know, been leaked out already, and they're gonna slowly roll those out, starting with

1604
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:16,520
I think Final Fantasy VII, and maybe Tomb Raider, some other stuff.

1605
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
That's pretty amazing.

1606
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,080
Also, some Vita titles, um, not a whole lot of, like, first-party Vita titles that are

1607
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,640
gonna be coming out for, you know, the, um...

1608
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,800
I was also shocked at the lack of Vita.

1609
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,800
It was basically, I mean, all the stuff that was coming out this fall is pretty much stuff

1610
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
we already knew about.

1611
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,600
I mean, you know, LittleBigPlanet carding, and, um, LittleBigPlanet.

1612
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,880
To be fair, some of that may show up at Tokyo Game Show.

1613
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,920
After all, Sony is a Japanese company, some of that may be in their back pocket for Tokyo

1614
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
Game Show.

1615
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,320
At least, I hope to hell that's what happens.

1616
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,960
Um, and then of course, also, um, you know, there's the Playstation, um, you know, All

1617
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,640
Stars Battle Royale, which is gonna be on the Vita as well.

1618
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,200
Um, another pretty cool thing...

1619
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,280
I gotta say this, Shadownextgen in our chatroom says, where is the Vita price drop?

1620
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,720
That was made up by the internet.

1621
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,640
I don't, I think people assume just because the 3DS had a price drop, the Vita was gonna

1622
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,640
get one too.

1623
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,680
It's too soon, they're not gonna announce a price drop yet.

1624
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:17,040
Yeah, I kind of agree, and I think the tech in the Vita, it would be a bigger loss to

1625
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,880
Sony to do something like that.

1626
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,840
They're not gonna, first off, they're not gonna announce, I mean, a price drop three

1627
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,800
months after it's come out, that's gonna be like, oh, yeah, we failed.

1628
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,480
I mean, they're not gonna do that.

1629
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,520
They're not gonna also, I mean, they're not gonna announce, hey, we're gonna drop the

1630
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,920
price in, uh, October.

1631
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:39,320
That being said, however, now that they've kind of ignored it at this show, now they

1632
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,240
might have painted themselves in a corner to have to do that.

1633
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,120
Tokyo Game Show is gonna be critical to the future of the Vita.

1634
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,120
Believe it.

1635
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,960
Um, they did talk about, you know, some games that are kind of a big does, um, Call of Duty

1636
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,640
Black Ops Declassified, not necessarily gonna be the same Black Ops 2 game, so, it's a little

1637
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:02,280
disappointing to me, but, I have to see what it is, and then Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation,

1638
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:07,080
which is gonna be its own kind of unique game with its own character, which is kind of cool.

1639
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,880
Um, that launches October 30th as well.

1640
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:18,680
Um, and then, of course, you know, the big, big reveal that they had was the brand new,

1641
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:27,560
um, was it, uh, Quadric Dream Game, which is Beyond Two Souls, and, um, just such an

1642
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,640
amazing looking game.

1643
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,520
Basically, kind of taking everything that you liked from Heavy Rain and just amping

1644
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,520
it up.

1645
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:42,680
Just the motion capture in it now is just ridiculous how well that looks, um, and, you

1646
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,320
know, big name stars, you know, behind it as well, just, it's cool, I mean, definitely

1647
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:54,800
gotta check it out, um, they have now, um, oh god, who's the fucking actress, I hate

1648
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,800
myself.

1649
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Ellen Page.

1650
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,720
Ellen Page, yes, Ellen Page is now, um, Juno, doing the mocap, and, uh, Kitty Pride.

1651
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,720
That too.

1652
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,720
Kitty Pride.

1653
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,720
Doing the mocap and the, um, you know, the voice work for that game.

1654
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,520
I saw the screens from it, it looks really good.

1655
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,120
It's interesting, it's kind of like a supernatural, uh, Heavy Rain almost.

1656
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,040
You've got, you know, you're playing as the spirit and you're also playing as her, and

1657
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,160
so the spirit thing can, you know, interact with the environment and stuff, um, it's neat.

1658
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,560
It looked, it looked pretty cool, and, you know, if you don't like the quick time events

1659
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,880
stuff, then maybe not for you, but, um, you know, then you probably didn't like Heavy

1660
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,880
Rain either.

1661
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,160
So, uh, I, I need to go watch that trailer, I heard a lot of excitement about it.

1662
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,120
Granted, I kind of miss the boat on Heavy Rain, but, yeah, definitely watch the demo

1663
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,120
footage.

1664
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,120
They have 20 minutes from the game, it looks awesome.

1665
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,540
I'm gonna check it out, for sure.

1666
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,540
Really cool.

1667
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,920
But, uh, so overall Sony's conference, yeah, uh, it's pretty cool.

1668
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,920
Oh, and one more thing.

1669
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,460
Oh, Big Planet 2 is getting some DLC, um, that's gonna turn the Vita into a controller

1670
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,460
for the game.

1671
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:55,460
That's pretty cool.

1672
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:56,460
That's cool.

1673
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,460
That's very cool.

1674
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,460
A lot of cross play stuff there.

1675
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:03,200
I think, honestly, um, out of the three, I think they have the strongest, because they

1676
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,400
showed off, um, this really amazing game, a new property for them, a new IP.

1677
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,960
And then, of course, um, you know, they were showing off some of, like, the stuff that

1678
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,960
they had.

1679
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,320
Third party was pretty awesome.

1680
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,840
It didn't seem like there was a lot that bored me too much.

1681
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:22,080
Wonder Book was pretty eh, I mean, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like Nintendo's press

1682
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,200
conference was just like, okay, when we get into the good stuff, when we get into the

1683
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,200
good stuff, it's over?

1684
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,200
It's over?

1685
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,040
I mean, it's like, when are we getting to these, like, holy crap, holy crap, I need

1686
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:35,640
to buy this system for this game, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool, and I mean.

1687
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:40,480
I think next year's Nintendo's press conference, it better be anyway, it's gonna be a lot like

1688
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,380
that one a couple years ago.

1689
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,960
Remember that year, I think this was two years ago, where Reggie came out on stage and was

1690
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:53,480
basically like, you want games, fine, here's some games, bam, bam, bam, bam, and he showed

1691
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:59,880
like eight of them off in a row and he's like, there's all your fucking games, goodnight.

1692
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,720
For real, like that, that's how we do it, but like, that's what he's gonna have to do

1693
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,720
next year.

1694
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,920
The problem with the Wii U thing was, they had like the three conferences, and it was

1695
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,000
just like, we have to explain to you why the Wii U is important, fuck, I don't care, I

1696
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,720
want to see the goddamn games, I'll figure it out by the game footage that you have.

1697
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,200
You can explain to me later if I go, I don't understand why the game is cool, you know,

1698
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,440
I just, I don't know, whatever.

1699
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:27,120
Zappy in our chatroom says, Nintendo needs to learn the magic of one more thing, harness

1700
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,120
the Steve Jobs.

1701
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,120
Perhaps.

1702
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,520
He did that with fucking Metroid, remember that?

1703
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,160
One more thing, fucking Metroid games, like, that's awesome.

1704
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:40,800
Metroid game by Team Ninja, that sounds awesome and will be okay when it comes out.

1705
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:46,280
Alright, anyhow, was that, I think that might have been the same year, no, that was the

1706
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,840
year before, I think.

1707
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,000
It was the year that that Metroid game was actually coming out, that I think was the

1708
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,320
year where Reggie was like, we got this, we got this, we got this, and if any of you fuckers

1709
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,360
write that no games are coming out for the Wii, I will personally come to your house

1710
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,360
and beat your ass.

1711
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,360
At least, that's what I heard.

1712
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,720
My body is ready to kick some ass.

1713
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:10,680
Alright, quickly, the third party crest conferences, because we're already at that one and a half.

1714
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:15,400
They didn't have that many this year, but Ubisoft did, sorry off of them, of course.

1715
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:20,800
Konami had the online one that showed lots and lots of Metal Gear Rising, which, granted,

1716
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,000
if you like violence, looks great.

1717
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It sounds cool.

1718
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,080
I didn't watch that one, unfortunately.

1719
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,840
Ubisoft, they had Just Dance 4, duh.

1720
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,560
It is going to have some Wii U specific features, including a puppet master mode where you can

1721
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,520
change up the dance moves on the fly.

1722
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,840
Yeah, that's kind of fun if you're in a party environment, I guess.

1723
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth, which is coming to the Wii U, and Kinect.

1724
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,560
Uh, and it also is supposed to be like, kind of, they said drawing from the Secret Invasion

1725
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,560
universe.

1726
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,440
It has like, Skrulls posing as superheroes and stuff, but it looks terrible.

1727
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,480
The Secret Invasion thing was crap.

1728
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,280
It looks fucking terrible.

1729
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,580
It was even worse than Civil War.

1730
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:06,640
The gameplay looks bad, just saying.

1731
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,440
Um, and they have like the X-Men in there, so I don't understand how that's Avengers,

1732
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,440
but whatever.

1733
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:16,080
Never involved in Wolverines in every team in the Marvel universe, ever.

1734
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,080
It's true.

1735
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,080
Hey, he's gotta work.

1736
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,680
He even powered up, he even hung out with Power Pack.

1737
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:26,240
Hey, time for a total tangent where I derail the show.

1738
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,960
I finally saw the Avengers this weekend.

1739
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,960
Wasn't it good?

1740
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,960
Did you stay for the whole thing?

1741
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,960
It was pretty good.

1742
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,960
The whole thing?

1743
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:38,680
No, we thought once we saw the dude, we thought it was over, and then we realized in the car

1744
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:42,560
on the way home, wasn't Jamie talking about a scene with Bla Bla Bla?

1745
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,280
Oh, god damn it, there must have been more after the credits.

1746
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:52,400
This is why you always, always, always, always, always stay through the entire credits of

1747
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,480
a Marvel movie, because they will fuck with you.

1748
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,200
One does not simply leave a movie.

1749
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,640
Leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits.

1750
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,640
Okay, I made a mistake.

1751
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,640
It's on YouTube.

1752
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:05,680
That means, that means, we're gonna go back and see it.

1753
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:10,120
Rayman Legends was another game that they showed off, and that was the sequel to Rayman

1754
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,640
Origins.

1755
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,640
Pretty awesome.

1756
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:17,080
It's gonna have five player co-op with the Wii U, and also the Pro Controller and Wiimote

1757
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:21,320
are supported, and the gameplay looks just awesome.

1758
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:28,000
Just really, really cool stuff that they've got going there with that, so very cool.

1759
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,520
One of the games that I thought was a joke when they were showing it originally on the

1760
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:38,000
Wii U pre-E3 conference, which was a zombie game that this really dorky guy was just kind

1761
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
of being all cliche about, and like, I need help!

1762
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Help me, internet!

1763
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,120
I need to know how to beat this boss!

1764
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,120
I need to show him!

1765
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,240
That commercial was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

1766
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,440
But it's a real game.

1767
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,360
Zombie U is the name of it.

1768
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,240
It's a fucking stupid name.

1769
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:58,560
It was originally Killer Freaks from Outer Space, which was gonna be a neat looking game

1770
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,680
that had almost evil rabbits looking characters, but now it's a generic zombie shooter game.

1771
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:12,960
But they're gonna have some interesting uses of the Wii controller, and honestly, to me,

1772
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,200
this game looks like it's gonna be another Red Steel, which some people may like Red

1773
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,920
Steel, but Red Steel ended up being one of those games that, hey, it looked pretty cool

1774
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:24,160
at E3, and then when it came out, it was not very cool.

1775
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,120
It was just kinda, ehhh.

1776
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:31,520
But we'll see, I mean, zombie game, neat.

1777
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:40,440
And then, of course, they talked a little bit about Far Cry 3, which, oh, that trailer

1778
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,080
that they showed was a bit graphic.

1779
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,640
It was boobies, hey, boobies, and apparently, you know, I know Bobby was talking a little

1780
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:52,120
bit about it, how, and I even asked him, like, hey, were you watching this online, or were

1781
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,480
you watching this on, like, Spike or G4 or something like that?

1782
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,200
Did they censor those fuckin' tits on TV?

1783
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,680
Nope, they did not.

1784
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,960
So that's a little problem.

1785
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,920
And Boobiesoft hashtag was launched from there.

1786
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:09,920
And then, um.

1787
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,960
By the way, I love Aisha Tyler, and I think it's great that she got to emcee, I think

1788
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,200
she, it's funny, because what do her and Joel McHale have in common?

1789
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,320
They've both hosted the soup on E.

1790
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,280
Aisha Tyler was the host before.

1791
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,600
So I love her, I think she's great.

1792
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:34,040
She's got a podcast, too, Girl, I almost said Girl's Gone Wow, but that's not her show.

1793
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,120
That's not her show.

1794
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,400
It's Girl on Guy, I think is the name of the show, and it's pretty good.

1795
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,400
Alan's a really big fan.

1796
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,160
But she's actually a gamer, so that's kinda cool.

1797
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:45,520
And she has a big lady boner for Halo.

1798
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,520
I like her a lot.

1799
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,520
She's funny.

1800
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,520
I've met her.

1801
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,240
I would love to have her on the show.

1802
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:54,120
I know that will never happen, because she, like, does the talk on CBS.

1803
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,480
But I would just love to chat with Aisha Tyler.

1804
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,480
She was funny.

1805
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,840
I met her in person once, but, um.

1806
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,500
I don't know, it's.

1807
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:07,000
She was not that annoying, but the other guy, oh my fucking god.

1808
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,400
Why was he there?

1809
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,780
He was so fucking annoying, and the banter was just annoying.

1810
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:15,280
And then finally, they also, they were talking a little bit about their service that they've

1811
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,280
got.

1812
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:21,640
They have some free games that you can play, including, they've added Trials Evolution,

1813
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:26,200
and Beyond Good and Evil HD, I Am Alive, and some more stuff to their free play service.

1814
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,200
So that's pretty awesome that they've got that as well.

1815
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:34,020
And last but not least, the big thing.

1816
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:38,560
And they're kind of like a, you know, proponent of the, oh yeah.

1817
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,160
And we got one more thing we have to show you.

1818
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:47,480
So, um, their one more thing that they showed off was this game, a brand new IP called Watch

1819
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,320
Dogs.

1820
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,320
That game looked rad.

1821
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,320
And it looks fantastic.

1822
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,320
I did watch that.

1823
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,320
That looked rad.

1824
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,320
And you know what?

1825
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:59,260
Most people were going around saying, Ubisoft won E3, I mean, whatever the hell that means.

1826
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,440
You won, congratulations, you win an E3.

1827
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,440
I think they did.

1828
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,120
They based on that almost single-handedly, that.

1829
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,100
It had more people talking than anything else.

1830
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,180
That was an amazing game.

1831
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:16,280
It's basically this kind of futuristic game where you play this guy who has, he's hijacked

1832
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:21,560
control of this, it's in the future, it's Chicago, and basically this computer runs

1833
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,560
the whole city.

1834
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,560
Everything.

1835
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,440
Every telephone networks, you know, street lights, you know, whatever.

1836
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:33,080
He has this, almost like a magic phone that he can dial in and hack anything, you find

1837
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:37,700
out information about people, and it's just this whole espionage, you know, stealth kind

1838
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:40,800
of action game, and there's a shooter element in there as well.

1839
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,520
And just the integration with your phone, it's supposed to, you know, kind of use the

1840
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,820
smart glass stuff.

1841
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:47,820
Really cool-looking thing.

1842
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:52,360
Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Nintendo, but A, was that game announced for Wii U?

1843
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,360
Nope.

1844
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,360
Because I don't think it was.

1845
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:59,000
And B, I think that's a real problem when more, that's a real problem when more people

1846
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,400
are talking about somebody else's game that's not coming to your system more so than your

1847
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
brand new system.

1848
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,400
That is very bad.

1849
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,720
Well, here's the other bad thing, too, is when you're thinking about it, it's technically

1850
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:16,800
a system that is capable of graphics that are on these two other systems that have this

1851
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,800
game, and it has a fucking tablet controller already that could support this stuff, and

1852
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,940
yet it's not on your system.

1853
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,940
So that's a problem.

1854
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:25,940
However-

1855
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:30,000
Yeah, I mean, to be fair, yet, we never know what might ultimately pan out before the launch.

1856
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Well, they keep insisting-

1857
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,400
It may not be a launch window game.

1858
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,280
Remember, Reggie was focusing on launch window games.

1859
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,280
This may not be-

1860
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,800
This definitely isn't launch window.

1861
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,800
That's for sure.

1862
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,800
That could be the problem.

1863
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,000
Well, here's the other thing, too, is-

1864
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,520
And Shadow Next Gen says it wasn't announced for any system.

1865
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,520
It wasn't announced for 360 or PS3 either.

1866
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:51,160
The press site they have listed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1867
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,560
Everyone thinks it's for Next Gen, though, and it could be.

1868
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,240
It looks very Next Gen, that's for sure.

1869
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:02,480
Another game that was not at Ubisoft at all, which is kind of surprising, was Rainbow Six

1870
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,480
Patriots.

1871
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,480
Where was that?

1872
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,480
That was just missing.

1873
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:12,120
So, who knows where that's been, but I don't know.

1874
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,120
Pretty exciting show.

1875
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,120
Let's line up.

1876
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,120
Let's quickly do EA.

1877
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,320
We were running long for part A, but we knew we would.

1878
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,320
It's E3 week.

1879
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,000
EA, real quick, they had lots of sports games to show off.

1880
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,320
Of course, brand new.

1881
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,000
Madden now, it's a brand new engine that's going to be running.

1882
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,160
The new Infinity Engine has really awesome physics and stuff, so that looks pretty cool.

1883
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,720
They talked a little bit about some new games.

1884
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,600
Dead Space 3, which is kind of a duh that's coming out in February.

1885
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,040
Need for Speed Most Wanted being rebooted by Criterion.

1886
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:43,960
Looks like Burnout with Cops, Burnout Paradise with Cops, great.

1887
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,200
Sim City that's going to be now online only, which is kind of annoying.

1888
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,200
Boo.

1889
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,240
That decision is going to tank that franchise.

1890
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,240
Watch.

1891
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:56,360
Because what they're saying, and Bobby went into this a little bit on his show tonight,

1892
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,440
and I totally am agreeing with his sentiment, is that it's getting away from that whole

1893
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,440
sandbox thing.

1894
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,920
Like, remember how you could, like, unleash Godzilla and a nuclear strike and all that

1895
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,920
on your city?

1896
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,080
And then, okay, just go back and load your save file.

1897
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,360
You can't do that.

1898
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,640
When it's online only, there's no save files now.

1899
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:12,840
People like doing that in the Sims.

1900
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,200
It's just, why would you do that to your franchise?

1901
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,880
I think that is a really bad decision.

1902
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,880
Watch.

1903
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,440
It worked for Diablo.

1904
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,100
It's not going to work for you, EA.

1905
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:29,240
People were used to, Diablo being online only, I mean, not that everybody's okay with that

1906
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:35,520
anyway, but so many people were already playing that game online that it wasn't a deal breaker.

1907
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,000
But SimCity, you don't play that online.

1908
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Ever.

1909
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,560
And it's sad, too, because that's a game that I would like to play offline, and it looks

1910
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,880
like an amazing game.

1911
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,680
It's just, eh.

1912
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:49,400
Unless you do have a local file.

1913
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,680
Because for some online franchises, they do pull your data off a local file.

1914
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,840
So that could work.

1915
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,320
But not likely.

1916
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:00,560
Yeah, I don't think that they're going to, because Diablo 3, if you think about it, could

1917
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,080
have done that as well, but they didn't go that route.

1918
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,840
I think they just shot the franchise in the foot with that decision.

1919
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,840
Watch.

1920
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:08,840
They can always change it.

1921
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,840
They've got time.

1922
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,840
I don't think they're going to.

1923
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,360
I think the whole thing is they're trying to combat piracy, and they think that online

1924
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,360
only is the way to go.

1925
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,040
But, I don't know.

1926
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,280
Once again, you're hurting the legitimate users of it.

1927
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,160
Medal of Honor Warfighter looks amazing.

1928
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,400
Very realistic looking game.

1929
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:29,240
Crisis 3 is just kind of weird, I don't understand why I need to use a bow and arrow in this

1930
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,240
game.

1931
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,240
Neat.

1932
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:35,600
I mean, it's a beautiful looking game, that's for sure.

1933
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,800
SimCity Social for Facebook, they announced, which, cool.

1934
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,840
Battlefield 3, of course, they were, you know, the Battlefield 3 premium service, they announced

1935
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,840
that.

1936
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:52,280
It's out on PS3 first, and then PC and Xbox, kind of opposite of Call of Duty Elite.

1937
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:55,160
Star Wars Old Republic is sort of going free to play.

1938
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:59,440
They're going free to play up to level 15, and they're going to also be adding new content

1939
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,480
as well.

1940
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:07,680
Also Madden NFL kind of jumping on the social bandwagon that they have with FIFA, and they

1941
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,560
actually have some interesting stuff now.

1942
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:14,480
The new game has like a fake Twitter feed that's on there that comments on your performance

1943
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,840
and stuff like you're having real fans comment on your game, which is kind of cool.

1944
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:27,520
They've got that going, plus a lot of other presentation perks that they added with that.

1945
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:34,600
Last but not least, the big one, EA has secured the UFC franchise, so that's going to be coming

1946
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:42,220
to EA now, and they bought it from THQ for an unset amount of money, and basically the

1947
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:47,320
reasoning behind that was UFC 3, which was the last UFC game to come out from THQ, didn't

1948
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,520
make their money, so they have to cut it, and that's what they did.

1949
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,800
They cut the franchise and sold it to EA, although I'm worried now if it's going to

1950
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,920
be like EA Sports MMA, which is kind of terrible.

1951
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,580
All right, well, thank you.

1952
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:07,560
That was a lot of news from E3, but I think we kind of covered it all there and gave our

1953
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,800
feedback as well as you guys there in our chat room, and we do have some more to talk

1954
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,800
about.

1955
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:12,800
We're not done with the show yet.

1956
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,280
We're going to get into some of the little stuff in the next half.

1957
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,680
What's kind of sad that we didn't see was no Dead Rising 3 announcement.

1958
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,520
That is interesting.

1959
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,880
That didn't end up happening.

1960
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,000
Why do you think that is?

1961
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,760
Maybe it's one of those things, like I've been hearing from a lot of different developers

1962
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,100
and publishers, it's not ready to show.

1963
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:31,200
They're not ready to show it yet, or they're not ready to talk about that yet.

1964
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,040
Which is the whole excuse behind Last Guardian.

1965
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,680
Yeah, Last Guardian.

1966
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:39,960
Capcom had a few things that they were showing off, obviously Street Fighter.

1967
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:40,960
You know what?

1968
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,960
I don't really know.

1969
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,840
They referred the Vita, and then they also had Lost Planet 3, which was a big thing.

1970
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:46,840
Devil May Cry.

1971
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,640
They were kind of focusing on those franchises.

1972
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,840
If you think about it, those are coming out quarter one, so this might be a fourth quarter

1973
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,840
game.

1974
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,760
It might be something for next E3, or maybe something that they announced at the Tokyo

1975
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,760
Game Show.

1976
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,760
Who knows?

1977
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
So, it may just not be ready yet.

1978
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,760
Hmm.

1979
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,760
Interesting.

1980
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:02,760
All right.

1981
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,000
Well, we're running a bit long, but we do have a few more segments we want to get in

1982
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,240
here before we get to part B tonight.

1983
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,120
Some people prefer it long.

1984
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:13,000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates on what is coming

1985
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
out a little sooner than any of the games we just talked about.

1986
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,480
This week, we don't have a whole ton, but we've got Lollipop Chainsaw on PS3 and 360,

1987
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,640
and that's sometimes all you need.

1988
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,200
Dirt Showdown's supposed to be coming out this week, although I'm not sure if it's actually

1989
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:31,400
going to be coming out on Tuesday, because they're having production problems.

1990
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,880
But sometime, hopefully, this week.

1991
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,520
That's on PS3 and 360.

1992
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,480
And then, not a whole lot else.

1993
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,680
You're a fan of the Nickelodeon series iCarly.

1994
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:45,160
There's a Groovy Foodie game coming out on Nintendo DS.

1995
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:50,040
On the Vita, getting a couple games, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Gravity Rush.

1996
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,520
Gravity Rush looks pretty awesome, so hopefully that'll be pretty cool.

1997
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,800
And then, I believe that's it.

1998
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,900
All right, traveling to Japan.

1999
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:03,880
Not a whole, whole lot over there, but on the Nintendo 3DS, gone.

2000
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,840
Baku Baku Baku Adventure comes out this week, as well as Heavy Fire, The Chosen Few.

2001
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,680
Again, that's the 3DS in Japan.

2002
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,360
Going over to the PlayStation Vita.

2003
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,360
Oh, I lied.

2004
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,680
This is a big week, because there's a lot of people that are going to want this.

2005
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,800
Persona 4, The Golden, comes out in Japan this week.

2006
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,960
There's a whole little accessory set, as well, that you can get for the Vita.

2007
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,840
There's also a Super Monkey Ball game called Tokumori Asobita comes out this week, as well,

2008
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,440
on the PlayStation Vita.

2009
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,240
I have a feeling more people will be crazy about the Persona 4.

2010
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:36,000
I know there's a lot of fans of that here in the US.

2011
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,880
Going to the PlayStation 3, Lollipop Chainsaw in Japan, as well, and also a game called

2012
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,520
Lord of Sorcery, as well as some new joystick adapters coming for you.

2013
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,640
Is that Lord of Sorcery from Sony?

2014
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,960
I believe that is just Sorcery here.

2015
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,960
It is from Sony.

2016
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,960
Yeah, that's Sorcery.

2017
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,120
And that's a move integrated game.

2018
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:00,520
FIFA 12 gets a price reduction, as well, on the PlayStation 3 this week.

2019
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:08,800
Quickly taking a look at the Xbox 360, Akai Katana Shin gets a price reduction this Friday,

2020
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:13,960
as well as Eshatos gets a price reduction, as well, and Lollipop Chainsaw on the 360,

2021
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:14,960
as well.

2022
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:15,960
And that's Japan.

2023
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:16,960
Dark Sakura?

2024
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:23,040
Well, we have a few things in the UK, and I would tell everybody if my thing would pull

2025
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,040
up.

2026
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,040
There we go.

2027
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:31,320
We have coming up on the 13th, Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock, and Gravity Rush.

2028
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:37,200
And then on the 15th, we have Combat Wings, the Great Battles of World War II, Heroes

2029
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:42,840
of Ruin, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Lollipop Chainsaw.

2030
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,720
And that would do it for the UK.

2031
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,720
All right.

2032
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:52,160
Well, let's go way back, back past E3 and past what's coming out this week, and go way

2033
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,000
back in time to when things were a little bit simpler.

2034
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,360
Back when you had to read about E3 and Nintendo Power.

2035
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,360
Okay, maybe not that long ago, but still, pretty far back.

2036
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,000
It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week, where Dark Sakura's gonna go into

2037
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,160
the gaming vault and pull out an old-ass video game.

2038
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:14,560
She thinks, hey, while you guys are waiting for all this stuff to come out, respect a

2039
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,560
classic.

2040
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,400
This is one from, literally from the vault, which is how I decided.

2041
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,400
All right.

2042
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:23,800
I picked a box of PS games, and this was the second one on them.

2043
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,440
And what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

2044
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,440
Policemauts.

2045
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,960
Policemauts is one of the cinematic adventure games.

2046
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,840
It was done by Hideo Kojima.

2047
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,840
It has...

2048
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,840
Yeah.

2049
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,840
It was a Konami game.

2050
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,840
The old Konami logo.

2051
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:39,840
Aw.

2052
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,480
I missed that.

2053
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:48,440
It was initially released for the PC 9821 in 1994.

2054
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:53,760
And then they remade versions for the 3DO, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn in 96.

2055
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,580
It has never officially been released outside of Japan, although they were going to localize

2056
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,120
it on the Saturn.

2057
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:06,920
And then on August 24th, in honor of the 46th birthday of Hideo Kojima, there was an unofficial

2058
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,400
translation patch that came out on the internet.

2059
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:15,260
Policemauts is a, I would say, a spiritual successor to Snatcher.

2060
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:18,280
It's the same type of game.

2061
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:25,600
With this one, it's a very interesting game because it really refers back to different

2062
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:34,040
references like to Lethal Weapon and Urashima Taro, which is an old Japanese tale.

2063
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:39,920
The game is about a detective who travels to a space colony to investigate his ex-wife's

2064
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,480
murder and her new husband's disappearance.

2065
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:48,800
So it is first person, point and click interface, and you play as the protagonist, Jonathan

2066
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:55,680
Ingram, who is a policeman, basically, a former police officer trained to be a police officer

2067
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,680
in space.

2068
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:03,180
With the console, you use the mouse, but on the Saturn version you can use the light gun

2069
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:10,840
for shooting parts of the game, so it's actually a little bit more rich in terms of play.

2070
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,480
But on the other consoles, it's basically point and click, first person shooter type

2071
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:23,280
stuff, with random saves and everything, and it actually has an easter egg that, if you've

2072
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:30,360
got a save file of Tokimeki Memorial, it refers back to it, so pretty funny.

2073
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,960
And of course, that came up in Metal Gear Solid, where it read your save files on your

2074
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,960
PlayStation card.

2075
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:40,800
Ooh, you are a careful man who saves often.

2076
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:47,280
So basically, again, like I said, he is, Jonathan Ingram is a police snot who is assigned to

2077
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:53,600
Beyond Coast, which is the first functional space colony in 2013, so next year, or apparently

2078
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,600
colonizing space.

2079
01:48:54,600 --> 01:49:01,600
So he goes to see what happened to Lorraine, who is his ex-wife, and her husband's vanished,

2080
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,000
so he has to find out what's going on.

2081
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:11,260
He works with his buddy from the LAPD, Ed Brown, who is helping him with the investigation.

2082
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,640
And so, it really is just that, point and click.

2083
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:17,920
Now, for different versions that came out, I did mention it originally was on the NEC

2084
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:26,600
PC 9821, and it was one CD-ROM that had an installation floppy disk, and the cutscenes

2085
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:33,040
were rendered in hand-drawn pixel art, instead of full motion video.

2086
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,120
It also is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games.

2087
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:43,440
Then it came out on the 3DO on September 29th, 1995, that was two CD-ROMs, and it had animated

2088
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,440
cutscenes.

2089
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:46,440
It was CG animation.

2090
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:48,640
All the graphics were completely redrawn for it.

2091
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:53,400
The PS version came out on January 19th, 1996, on two disks.

2092
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,400
That's the version I have.

2093
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:58,120
Actually, I have the best hits version of that, just to say.

2094
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:01,840
Then it came out on the Sega Saturn on September 13th, 1996, and it used, like I said, the

2095
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,160
light gun.

2096
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:08,400
Other versions that have been out is that there was the Policenauts pilot disk for 3DO

2097
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:13,940
that had a playable demo of the backstory of the game, featurettes, and information

2098
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,700
on the voice actors and developers.

2099
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:19,520
Then there was the Policenauts private collection that came out on the Playstation February

2100
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,520
9th, 1996.

2101
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:25,600
It had a lot of the same content, and an earlier version of the game's script.

2102
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,680
The Playstation 1 has been reissued twice.

2103
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:33,160
There's the Konami The Best version, which is the one that I have, and then it came out

2104
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:41,520
for the Playstation Store, making it downloadable for Playstation Portable and for PS3.

2105
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,820
There was a plan to localize it on the Saturn.

2106
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:49,200
There actually is cover art that exists for this, and there's a fan translation that was

2107
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:57,480
done for the Playstation, which you can actually use through Emulator.

2108
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,400
I've seen a bunch of it through that.

2109
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:05,560
I've played through half of it in Japanese with a copy of that script.

2110
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:12,960
There was also a soundtrack that was released, and then Policenauts FN, which is a range

2111
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,420
of versions of the music from the soundtrack.

2112
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:21,720
There was the MIDI Power Pro 3, so there was a MIDI arrangement of the Policenauts music,

2113
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,680
and the Snatcher Policenauts music disc.

2114
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:27,880
It was called Music Collection of Hideo Kojima Black Disc.

2115
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,720
And there you go, Policenauts.

2116
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:36,800
If I may say so, there's also references to Policenauts and Snatcher in the Metal Gear

2117
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,440
games.

2118
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,720
When it detects your save files and all that.

2119
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:51,280
In fact, here's an obvious one, there's a scene where Otacon is flashed back to being

2120
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:58,000
a big nerd, and there's scenes from Policenauts and Snatcher in his flashbacks.

2121
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,160
Baconbits in our chatroom asks, is there an official release on the US Playstation Network?

2122
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,160
No.

2123
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,160
Nope.

2124
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:05,160
But maybe someday.

2125
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,160
Bug him enough.

2126
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:11,400
However, however, you can find Policenauts, I think, relatively inexpensive if you're

2127
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:14,440
getting the re-release.

2128
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:17,480
And again, you can play it on an emulator with an English patch.

2129
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,960
So if you want to go to the trouble.

2130
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,800
Or if you happen to be able to read and understand Japanese, you can play it on a PS3.

2131
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,120
And there's the way I played it.

2132
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:29,320
I sat down with a freaking script that gave me my options.

2133
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:31,000
It was a pain in the ass.

2134
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
But you did it.

2135
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,600
But I did it.

2136
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:39,920
We beat the freaking Rurouni Kenshin game, the RPG, with a copy of the script.

2137
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,800
And we beat Grandia, we played through half of Grandia with my friend Krista there because

2138
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,480
she could read everything.

2139
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:48,740
So I will tell you this right now.

2140
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:52,040
My Japanese reading is like a literate five year old.

2141
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,040
Seriously.

2142
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,040
I know maybe 30 Kanji.

2143
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,200
That's it.

2144
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,200
Keep trying.

2145
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,300
You might get up to a six year old soon.

2146
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,300
Maybe when I move.

2147
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,300
All right.

2148
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,300
We're going to take a break.

2149
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,200
We're almost two hours with no break here.

2150
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:08,500
And I need to go check into the show tonight at vognetwork.com and get my vog points so

2151
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,200
I can get more loot.

2152
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,680
And hopefully you guys will do the same thing.

2153
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,800
Or you might join us in the VOG Network Clubhouse.

2154
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,360
Again, just search for VOG in the PlayStation Home.

2155
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,880
And there's VOG Network all in caps.

2156
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,800
I think we're going to fill this place tonight.

2157
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:23,420
Blender's already like, do we need a second clubhouse?

2158
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,760
We might.

2159
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,420
So anyhow, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a minute with more of

2160
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:37,100
Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2161
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:42,800
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 460 for this June the 10th

2162
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,800
of 2012.

2163
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,280
We are live at vognetwork.com.

2164
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:47,640
Be sure to check into the show.

2165
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:52,000
Get your points and maybe some hidden loot there.

2166
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,520
Also we're live in the PlayStation Network Clubhouse.

2167
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,720
This is the last time most people have left, honestly.

2168
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:02,720
And I don't know how, we need to convince Sony somehow to give us more than 30 people

2169
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,720
to get in that clubhouse.

2170
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:06,760
But I was checking out, Blender put in all these little like arcade games you can play

2171
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:11,160
and I was playing Electro Kid, which I didn't realize, I mean, I knew there were some mini

2172
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,160
games.

2173
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:15,320
Like I remember there was like a Arknoid clone breakout type thing that was kind of basic

2174
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:18,120
and some other little things that were in there when home first launch.

2175
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,560
Like that Electro Kid I was just playing was kind of like a old school 8-bit platformer.

2176
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:25,320
I was like, wow, I kind of behind the times on home.

2177
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,480
Like the Namco games or something that you could do?

2178
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:33,200
Well, they tied into the, like all it would do, it was a launcher for the Namco collection

2179
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,200
game.

2180
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,720
Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.

2181
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:40,220
But still kind of neat and it looks like they are building more and more games into home.

2182
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,600
So that's, that's pretty cool.

2183
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:45,040
So I was checking that out a little bit during the break.

2184
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:50,320
Also before we get back into some long news here, I was asked to plug another show and

2185
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:54,860
I'm like, all right, whatever, I'm, I'm, I'm a supporter of indie podcasts and so forth.

2186
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,860
This isn't a podcast.

2187
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:56,860
It's a live show.

2188
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:58,760
It's one of our listeners who's PMing me here.

2189
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:02,440
Vince Raven hosts a show called Back in Time.

2190
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:10,360
It airs live Wednesdays at 10 PM on his college's website, ehc.edu.

2191
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:13,280
It's W-E-H-C-F-M.

2192
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,360
He does music and movie reviews and all that stuff.

2193
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,680
It's 10 o'clock Eastern, ehc.edu.

2194
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,720
And you know what?

2195
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:21,720
Why not?

2196
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,080
I'll plug something one of the listeners wants to plug.

2197
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:27,240
Plus I have to admit, I got my start on college radio too.

2198
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:34,520
I used to DJ for KCSC 95.5 in Chico, California, even though that wasn't a real radio frequency.

2199
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,800
You had to have this little thing.

2200
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,520
It was cable radio.

2201
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,960
You had to hook up the cable to your radio.

2202
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,920
Yeah.

2203
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:46,400
I probably have way more listeners now than I did back then.

2204
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,400
That's for sure.

2205
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,840
But we all have to get our start somewhere.

2206
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:55,060
So hey, maybe someday Vince Raven will have his own network that he started after college

2207
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,060
radio.

2208
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:57,060
Who knows?

2209
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:58,060
He'll have his own network somewhere.

2210
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,060
All right.

2211
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:03,000
Anyhow, also at vognetwork.com, be sure to participate in the forums.

2212
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,880
We are running forums again.

2213
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,640
They look very generic right now, but I know that's on the plate for Bobby to expand this

2214
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,640
week.

2215
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:10,920
Bobby has been working nonstop on the site.

2216
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:15,600
You have to remember, VOG Network has only been up in its full form for a week.

2217
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,700
And for a while, about a month before that, he was coding the version that you saw on

2218
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,880
Friday when it launched.

2219
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,200
And he's been still coding nonstop that week.

2220
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,800
And I'm always like, Bobby, you should take a break.

2221
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,680
Bobby, you should go to Disneyland like I did.

2222
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,160
Bobby, you should get away from your computer.

2223
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,680
He's like, we've got to do a mobile site.

2224
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,040
We've got to do this other thing.

2225
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,040
Things I can't talk about.

2226
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,040
We've got to do this other thing.

2227
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,520
And I'm just like, Bobby.

2228
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,680
So he's working very, very hard behind the scenes.

2229
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:41,740
I know, Dar Sacher, you did some of the graphic stuffs.

2230
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:43,440
So some of the pretty colors.

2231
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,920
And there's other things coming up.

2232
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:45,920
That's right.

2233
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:46,920
Content-wise.

2234
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:49,640
That directly involves our listeners.

2235
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,560
But should I?

2236
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,560
I should.

2237
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,560
Drop a hint.

2238
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:55,920
VOG10 and VOGblog.

2239
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,520
All right.

2240
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,280
We do have VOGvlog.

2241
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:02,200
There'll be more for that a little later.

2242
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,200
All right.

2243
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:07,280
Anyhow, let's get back into some actual gaming news out of E3.

2244
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,860
First, some rapid fire news starting with Loki.

2245
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:15,480
So let's talk a little bit about Dawnguard.

2246
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,400
The new expansion for Elder Scrolls Skyrim sounds awesome.

2247
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,360
And it's coming out very soon.

2248
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:26,300
Actually in a few weeks, the tentative date right now is the 26th of June.

2249
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:32,000
And that'll be on Xbox 360 only right now because they are getting the DLC first.

2250
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,240
And so there is currently a beta right now, which they have not accepted me.

2251
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:37,320
Very disappointed there.

2252
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,880
But that will be hopefully very soon.

2253
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,120
We'll get to play the full thing.

2254
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,760
And I will definitely be picking that up.

2255
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:48,240
And I may actually get into a game that's not Minecraft for a little bit.

2256
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,240
Yay.

2257
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:53,440
And there is a sequel announced to Dead Rising, Dead Rising Riptide.

2258
01:57:53,440 --> 01:58:01,400
It is coming out soon, probably this fall, I mentioned, or imagine.

2259
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,400
Consoles and PC.

2260
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:07,760
Doesn't really say when, but there's supposed to be an extensive reveal this summer.

2261
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,480
So probably the fall.

2262
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:14,520
And last but not least was a game that wasn't shown during the press conferences.

2263
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:21,360
But Project P100, a Wii U launch title, which is going to be coming to us from Platinum

2264
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,440
Games.

2265
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:27,600
And it kind of looks like a cross between Viewtiful Joe and Pikmin.

2266
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:32,800
And you basically play like these superheroes that get other superheroes and other citizens

2267
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:36,640
to kind of form together to attack monsters that are attacking Earth.

2268
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:40,880
I saw somebody in chat, and I'm sorry I forget who, said that that was their game of the

2269
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:41,880
show.

2270
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,820
So some people are already excited about this.

2271
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:45,120
It's pretty cool.

2272
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:48,160
Alright, moving on.

2273
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:54,400
WarioWare makes a showing at E3, but not in the way you might think.

2274
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,640
It's part of Game and Wario.

2275
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:02,020
That's just something that kind of was on the E3 page but not really seen at the show.

2276
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:06,160
Why wasn't that show instead of like, you know, half the amount of...

2277
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,760
Because it's not a launch window title, probably.

2278
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:13,280
Anyhow, the description says, Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action.

2279
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:17,720
Game and Wario features a collection of games that use only the Wii U gamepad controller.

2280
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:21,840
The games retain the original flair and character of the microgames from the WarioWare series.

2281
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,600
So it sounds like it's maybe a more fleshed-out version of WarioWare, which could be very

2282
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,660
interesting.

2283
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:33,480
Some games called Arrow and Ski and Shudder sound a lot like, you know, one-word WarioWare

2284
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:34,480
games.

2285
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:35,480
But, yeah, unfortunately it's not WarioWare.

2286
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:36,740
I mean, if it was WarioWare, ha-ha.

2287
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:39,160
It's not, but it sounds like it kind of might be.

2288
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,800
Like it might be the spiritual successor.

2289
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,800
You know that term?

2290
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,800
I don't want a spiritual successor.

2291
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,800
I want an actual successor.

2292
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,920
Screw the spiritual successor stuff.

2293
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,000
We don't need spiritual successes.

2294
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,120
That's if your franchise didn't do very well.

2295
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:54,480
This is WarioWare that we're talking about.

2296
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:59,400
Well, when I think of characters in Sega franchises that ought to turn up in Sonic and All-Stars

2297
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:04,400
Racing Transformed, I don't necessarily think of Danica Patrick, NASCAR Racing Star.

2298
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,400
But guess what?

2299
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:09,000
She's going to be a playable character in Sonic and All-Star Racing Transformed.

2300
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,760
That's kind of cool.

2301
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:11,760
That is kind of cool.

2302
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,520
You know, and I realize especially, she's a good role model for women because she's

2303
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:20,400
in there doing a boy sport that has a lot of, you know, and she's, well, you're kind

2304
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,520
of giving me stank face a little bit.

2305
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:23,520
No.

2306
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,680
Well, I hate the term men's sport when...

2307
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,680
I know.

2308
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:28,680
I don't...

2309
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,680
It's driving a car.

2310
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,440
I don't like it either, but let's say male dominated.

2311
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:33,440
Okay.

2312
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,440
That works.

2313
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:35,440
All right.

2314
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:38,840
And, you know, she's, she kind of kicks a lot of ass and, you know, has done very well

2315
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,160
for herself being a spokesperson for various sites and so forth, and now she's going to

2316
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,800
be playable in a video game.

2317
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,320
So that'll be pretty cool.

2318
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:49,880
Clover Nikon in our chat room though says, I want Alex Kidd to be playable.

2319
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,640
How about the return of Alex Kidd?

2320
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:53,360
Where the hell has he been?

2321
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,400
We need Alex Kidd in Shinobi World 2.

2322
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,400
Dream on.

2323
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:00,520
I want to say that, like, I remember the first game had a lot of like old Sega characters.

2324
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:04,360
I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

2325
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:08,280
There are some Danica haters, cue the Danica haters in our chat room.

2326
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:12,920
Hey, you want to talk about a franchise that could, you know, or a company that could use

2327
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:16,880
one of those, like, oh, hey, our mascots are fighting a battle royale type thing.

2328
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,480
Sega would be pretty amazing.

2329
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,480
I would.

2330
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:20,720
Didn't they do something like that?

2331
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:23,040
I thought they had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

2332
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:24,040
No, I'm sorry.

2333
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,480
That was Ubisoft.

2334
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:26,760
Let me read the haters.

2335
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:27,760
It's the internet.

2336
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,760
There's always going to be haters.

2337
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:32,680
DJ Morpheus says, great, another avenue that shows Danica can't drive.

2338
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,960
Blender says, Danica sucks, I'm ho.

2339
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:41,400
So every fandom has their haters, all right.

2340
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:45,040
Moving on.

2341
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,040
It's hard to laugh and then go into a story like this because stories like this are never

2342
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:53,240
easy to report on, but yet again, another studio has closed.

2343
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,080
It's THQ's San Diego studio.

2344
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:00,020
They were the ones doing the UFC license, mostly was the stuff they were doing those

2345
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,020
games.

2346
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:06,560
So because the license has transitioned elsewhere to Electronic Arts, the San Diego studio has

2347
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,760
been closed.

2348
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,520
Maybe they can get hired at EA.

2349
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,920
That's the tiny little silver lining in this.

2350
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:14,920
We'll see.

2351
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:18,420
Moving on to some more rapid fire news, Dark Sakura.

2352
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:19,920
Let's see what we've got.

2353
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,140
Well, first of all, the Humble Indie Bundle 5 has three new additions to it.

2354
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:32,320
If you pay above the minimum, which is right now at $8.14, you get Braid, Super Meat Boy,

2355
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,320
and Lone Survivor.

2356
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:42,200
Now, I think this is pretty cool for the Minecraft fan in the room, that Marcus Pearson actually

2357
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:51,800
paid $9,999.99.

2358
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:54,200
Next up, Portal 2 in Motion.

2359
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:57,760
It actually is going to use the PlayStation Move.

2360
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:58,760
And you know what?

2361
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,760
I don't give a crap about that because I played on the PC.

2362
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,560
It's basically the stuff that they had, remember, that was the N, I think it was like Sixth

2363
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:10,480
Sense or N Sense or some weird like N Space.

2364
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,000
It uses the same from the Razer Hydra.

2365
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Yeah, Razer Hydra.

2366
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,480
I was just gonna keep naming random names.

2367
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:19,000
Yeah, you know the motion controller, I mean it sucks.

2368
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,840
Well, not suck, but no one's buying it for the PC.

2369
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,020
So why not recycle the content here?

2370
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:29,640
It pissed me off because Sony showed that in one of their little compilations of footage

2371
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,960
and we were like, holy shit, a new Portal game.

2372
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,240
Holy shit, yay, yay, yay.

2373
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,000
And then it's, oh, it's Move DLC.

2374
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,280
Whatever, DLC is DLC.

2375
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:38,280
I guess.

2376
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,280
I follow that under, I don't give a shit.

2377
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,280
I guess.

2378
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,880
And well, how about Sony stuff anyway?

2379
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:43,880
Tokyo Jungle.

2380
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,200
We're getting it, we're getting it.

2381
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:46,800
We don't have to import it.

2382
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,400
I can be a gazelle.

2383
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:51,760
This was the game we lost our shit on last week and said it should be the new President

2384
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,760
Cat.

2385
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,760
Well, that didn't take long.

2386
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,840
They are bringing it to North America, yay.

2387
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:05,080
Well, in fact, this actually was, I'm trying to find the guy's name.

2388
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:12,560
Scott Rode, who was the Sony VP of Product Development and Worldwide, he says, it'll

2389
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,600
ship here, it'll ship everywhere.

2390
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:18,840
And to him, I'm going to read this directly from the article.

2391
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:25,960
To him, Tokyo Jungle's worldwide release is emblematic of Sony's crazy innovative approach.

2392
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:29,900
He says the game is just wacky, but in a good way because we like to show that there's still

2393
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:33,880
an art form and you can still experiment.

2394
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,000
I want the hell out of this game.

2395
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Just saying.

2396
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I know.

2397
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I kind of want it to.

2398
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
It's going to be awesome.

2399
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I'm lusting in my heart after it.

2400
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,240
All right.

2401
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:44,400
And lusting in your heart is lusting for real.

2402
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:49,120
Well, now we're to the part of the show where we're going to get to the foogle question

2403
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:53,240
of the week.

2404
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,080
What the hell is a foogle, you might be asking?

2405
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,320
Well, it's Facebook and Google Plus combined.

2406
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,360
You get a foogle.

2407
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,840
We ask a question on Facebook and Google Plus and you guys answer it.

2408
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,120
And we read some of the answers.

2409
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:05,360
There's a lot of answers tonight.

2410
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,360
I can't read them all.

2411
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:07,360
I just can't.

2412
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,160
We read some of the answers here live on the show.

2413
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:12,640
But if you want to see all the answers, check us out on Google Plus.

2414
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:16,440
The link is on our website because you can't get a short URL on Google Plus yet.

2415
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:20,280
You just go to orangelandtrader.com and in the upper right hand corner is a box that

2416
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:21,280
says extended play.

2417
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,360
Just click on that Google Plus logo and you can add us there.

2418
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,520
And yes, there are people using Google Plus because we got a couple of responses over

2419
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,520
there.

2420
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,840
Tonight we have Michael D answering our question of the week which was, what in your opinion

2421
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,440
was the highlight of E3 this year?

2422
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:39,760
What is the thing you are looking forward to most of all?

2423
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:43,920
And Michael D says from the press conferences, oh excuse me, he did sign it, Technus, my

2424
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:44,920
bad.

2425
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:48,240
Technus says from the press conferences, I'd say what Ubisoft announced pretty much blew

2426
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,240
the big three away.

2427
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:53,320
They had a great combination of going in strong with their existing IPs and finishing with

2428
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:56,800
Watch Dogs, a game that sounds as amazing as it looks.

2429
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:00,320
I would also like to mention that the tech demos for the new next gen engines, i.e.

2430
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:05,240
Unreal Engine 4, CryEngine 3, Final Fantasy tech demo, look extremely impressive.

2431
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,600
Overall, I was pleased with this E3.

2432
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:11,560
Except for Microsoft in which I asked, please stick to the game, save the multimedia info

2433
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,560
for CES.

2434
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:19,320
Good point there about the tech demos for the next gen stuff.

2435
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:22,620
Some of that stuff was really impressive and finally, you know, just when you think the

2436
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:27,760
graphics can't get any better, there they go, they get better.

2437
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:33,800
Lastly, going to a comment from Rababa on Google Plus says, I think the understated

2438
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,560
highlight was smart glass.

2439
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:38,560
If they use this potential, it will pretty much derail the Wii U tablet controller.

2440
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,160
Don't get me wrong, I want the Wii U to succeed, but it will have to be truly awesome

2441
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,160
to be successful.

2442
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:46,800
I'm still waiting for the delay in release to 2013 because their marketing should be

2443
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,880
almost full swing by now to release in the fall, predicting that Wii U may just delay.

2444
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:54,040
I don't think Nintendo can afford it.

2445
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:57,840
Their stocks next year would plummet, or the earnings and all that.

2446
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,840
It has to come out.

2447
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,240
I most look forward to saving money from not buying games this year.

2448
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:08,280
Clothes, Gears of War, Yawn, I just don't like too many shooters.

2449
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:11,240
Let's go to Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

2450
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,600
Picaruno answered and said, probably going to get some shit from someone for this, but

2451
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:20,000
apart from Assassin's Creed 3, none of the games on offer wowed me.

2452
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,080
Wonder Book is a great idea, but its implementation on the Playstation 3 is stupid.

2453
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:26,520
It would sell a lot better on iOS.

2454
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,920
Here's what I'm going to say about Wonder Book.

2455
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,280
It's going to bomb as bad as Eye of Judgment.

2456
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:35,360
Dark Glass actually interests me a lot more than the Wii U, mainly because it works with

2457
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:37,040
all your existing gear.

2458
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:41,000
Its applications are nothing new, but I think they'd be a welcome addition to the Xbox 360's

2459
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
capabilities.

2460
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:45,360
Also, where the fuck were the Vita games, Sony?

2461
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:50,120
Flaco Jones says, beyond two souls, it looked like they took heavy rain's gameplay and improved

2462
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:51,120
everything.

2463
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:53,440
Again, the thing that most excited you about E3.

2464
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,960
Rhetortainment says, ditto on what Picaruno said.

2465
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,680
I want to see more from Metal Gear Revengerance, such as gameplay.

2466
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,840
Quantic Dreams Beyond Two Souls stood out for me.

2467
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:03,840
I loved Heavy Rain.

2468
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,120
I bought a Playstation move just to play again.

2469
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:09,520
When I saw Beyond Two Souls, I made a mental note to buy this game.

2470
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,560
Then I made a note on my droid that reads, buy Beyond Two Souls the day that it comes

2471
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,560
out.

2472
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,640
That's two people in a row excited about Beyond Two Souls.

2473
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,720
Metal Gear Solid game, or not Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising game actually looked pretty

2474
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:21,720
awesome.

2475
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:25,660
Shane from Hoard House commented and said, I'd have an addition to my previous statement,

2476
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:27,160
which was about Mass Effect 3.

2477
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,880
I'd say Mass Effect 3 Wii U, Beyond Two Souls.

2478
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,880
Here it is again.

2479
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,920
Watch Dogs and Last of Us were the only things I cared about at E3.

2480
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,800
I'm super hyped for those games.

2481
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:39,160
Yes, completely forgot about Last of Us, one of the big games that they showed, and that

2482
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,320
was one of their two IPs that they introduced.

2483
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,480
But granted, we knew about that one already.

2484
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,480
Yeah.

2485
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,480
The Last Opus.

2486
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:48,560
I'm sad it's no longer The Last Opus.

2487
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,560
Tiger Caw says, I think the highlights for this year's E3 was Ubisoft with their accidental

2488
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:57,620
nip slips up courtesy of Far Cry 3, and the unveiling of the new game Watch Dogs.

2489
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:01,640
The new game from the creators of Heavy Rain called Beyond Two Souls during the Sony press

2490
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,640
conference.

2491
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,840
As for Nintendo, Zombie Reggie.

2492
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:05,840
That is all.

2493
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:06,840
What?

2494
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:07,840
Okay.

2495
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:11,360
Did you happen to watch the video of the pre-E3 conference?

2496
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,360
A little bit.

2497
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,360
I skipped around.

2498
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:18,120
What the fuck is up with Miyamoto holding a god damn, or, Iwata, holding a banana.

2499
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:19,840
A bunch of bananas for no reason.

2500
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,720
He wanted to be a gif.

2501
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:23,640
Ronnie B says, I agree with Picaruno.

2502
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,280
Assassin's Creed 3 and the concept for Beyond were the only games that stood out for me,

2503
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:28,280
really.

2504
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:29,720
I hate what they've done with Dead Space.

2505
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:33,120
Stan says, hate on me all you want, but Pikmin 3 looks so fun.

2506
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:36,440
I almost went out and bought Pikmin 1 and 2 just from watching 3's trailer.

2507
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:40,440
Well, now would be a great time to re-buy 2, because didn't the new control version come

2508
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:41,440
out?

2509
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,440
Loki?

2510
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,440
Is that out here in the States?

2511
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,440
Yeah.

2512
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,440
It just came up today.

2513
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,440
There you go.

2514
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:51,440
Acidic Vampire says, I'm stoked for South Park RPG Tomb Raider, Beyond Two Souls, The

2515
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,880
Last Opus, Pikmin 3 and Dead Space 3.

2516
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:58,920
Oh, and the upcoming PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 with a gimmicky controller, aka the Wii U.

2517
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:01,960
Actually, I'm not enthralled by it.

2518
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:05,120
Red the Haze says, Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising.

2519
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:07,280
Screw the haters saying that they're similar.

2520
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,320
They should shut up about games that aren't out and that they haven't played before.

2521
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:17,440
Oh, and the Ellen Page waifu simulators, which is the new emerging video game genre.

2522
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:20,760
That's because Ellen Page is heavily inspired in The Last of Us, right?

2523
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:23,440
In one of the characters based off her, sort of?

2524
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,440
Looks likers.

2525
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,440
Looks likers.

2526
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:30,000
All right, let me do one more comment here.

2527
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,440
Actually, two more.

2528
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:35,640
Critical Myth said, Highlight was the Square Enix next gen demo, but for right now I'm

2529
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:38,240
most looking forward to The Last of Us.

2530
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,040
At least we have a good idea when it's hitting the shelves.

2531
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:44,080
And lastly, from Dark Charger, nothing particularly stood out.

2532
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:48,360
E3 this year is about the whole show being greater than the sum of its parts.

2533
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:52,480
Despite the lack of a single bombshell, the many games, mostly third parties, were enough

2534
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:56,720
to keep it not only my attention, but have me checking the calendar for several important

2535
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:57,720
releases.

2536
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:03,200
Perhaps entering E3 with tempered expectations ensures that I, or the gamer in general, always

2537
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,200
wins.

2538
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,200
Interesting.

2539
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,720
Final note, but a good one, I think.

2540
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:08,720
Setting the bar low.

2541
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:16,680
See, the problem with next year's E3 is the bar is really high, because we have Sony and

2542
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:21,600
Microsoft hopefully debuting their new consoles, although honestly, guys, nothing's set in

2543
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,600
place.

2544
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:28,720
Especially if the Wii U kinda goes pfft when it launches, which it very well might, I think

2545
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:31,360
a lot of pressure would be off by Microsoft and Sony.

2546
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,960
The longer they wait, the better the consoles will be, and the more trouble Nintendo will

2547
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,160
be when they do launch.

2548
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,400
Let them sit in the oven a little longer, right?

2549
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,120
Seriously, because they're in no hurry.

2550
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:45,760
They were talking about a console that's basically spec-wise the same as, you know, PlayStation

2551
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:47,680
3 and Xbox 360.

2552
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:53,440
Now that's not necessarily a thing that's gonna be a detriment to them, but, I mean,

2553
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,280
because the Wii did take off.

2554
02:11:55,280 --> 02:12:01,080
However, I don't think that this console's that different than the Wii, and your average

2555
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:06,600
soccer mom, if you will, is not gonna go, I need to have this, because it's like, well,

2556
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:09,080
it kinda does the same thing the Wii does.

2557
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:10,080
It's gonna be interesting.

2558
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:15,040
I'm really curious to see what happens, because, you know, when the Wii first came out, there

2559
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:19,880
was a lot of us going, what the hell's that name, and, but it would, it worked, so we'll

2560
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:20,880
see.

2561
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,880
And the Wii U.

2562
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:22,880
Hey, whatever.

2563
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:30,000
Hey, you know what, at the very least, we still have the Kung Pao jokes, and any attention

2564
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,800
given back to Kung Pao is more attention and possibility for a sequel to that movie.

2565
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:40,600
Shadow Next Gen brings up a good point, the DVD format on the 360 is becoming a serious

2566
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:41,600
issue.

2567
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:45,360
Maybe, maybe, uh, it can't afford to be DVD only much longer.

2568
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:49,680
I mean, I guess there is always digital, but, I mean, it's not really gonna help.

2569
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:55,080
They can always, I think that there's always a possibility that they'll have game installs.

2570
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:59,240
They have it on the PlayStation 3, so just have it now where it comes with ships on three

2571
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:02,120
discs, but you only need one, you can install the other two.

2572
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:06,080
But technically, you can buy an Xbox 360 without a hard drive, so that shit shouldn't be required.

2573
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:08,560
Yeah, technically, it still has four gigs.

2574
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,720
That's not enough for some games.

2575
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:15,480
Alright, let's move on with some more stories, we're gonna get to the mailbag of the Effies

2576
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:18,000
of the Week, and of course, your phone calls, but let's try to get through these stories

2577
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
kind of quick here.

2578
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Loki.

2579
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:27,640
Alright, so, real quick, um, apparently Vivendi is looking to sell, um, part of, a part or

2580
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:35,640
all of their stock in Activision, and of course, Vivendi, um, owns 61% of the controlling stake

2581
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:41,400
in, uh, Activision, and apparently they're holding a meeting on the 22nd of this month

2582
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:47,880
to discuss the potential for the sale of, um, part or all of its holdings, and, um,

2583
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:54,800
basically, I think they're trying to drum up some more money, and, um, you know, basically,

2584
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:59,320
they're saying, uh, some people believe that Vivendi's worth more if it's split up into

2585
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:04,120
various parts, and the potential split doesn't really mean anything for Activision other

2586
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:12,400
than a lot of shares on the market all at once, so, yeah, I don't really think it means

2587
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:17,120
a whole lot, other than, you know, one company's not really gonna own anything, although, it's

2588
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:20,320
kinda sad when you think about Vivendi, they purchased all these other companies when they

2589
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,560
bought Activision, and...

2590
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,920
It seems like a weird time to sell it off, I mean, I don't know, I didn't think there

2591
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:29,360
was bad news necessarily coming out of there right now.

2592
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,720
It's bad news, maybe they just need more money, maybe, you know, that section...

2593
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:32,720
That could be!

2594
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:35,720
Maybe that section of their business is doing okay, but they want, you know, they want their

2595
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:37,040
fat paycheck.

2596
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:41,920
Perhaps, or maybe they think it's good now, but maybe they're not so excited about the

2597
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,920
future, but...

2598
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,920
Maybe they gotta go, ew, it's all sticky!

2599
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,200
Get rid of it!

2600
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:49,100
Maybe they're a little worried about some of this Diablo 3 fallout, and maybe they're

2601
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:53,100
worried about the next WoW expansion, and maybe this new Blizzard product, I'm focusing

2602
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,880
on Blizzard, but I can't help myself.

2603
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,080
I don't think that's, I think I just want money.

2604
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,080
Sell off some shares.

2605
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:00,080
And who doesn't?

2606
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:01,080
Retire.

2607
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:06,960
Well Sega doesn't want money, clearly, because they took Hatsune Miku Project Diva F for

2608
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:11,920
the Vita to E3 to show it off, and then said, oh, it's not coming out of North America.

2609
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,120
Which is very weird, it's very weird, usually games don't show up at E3 that aren't coming

2610
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:21,480
out of North America, but according to a Sega rep, it was a sneak peek of a game coming

2611
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,480
to Japan.

2612
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:27,000
There are many Project Diva fans out there, like Dark Sakura, so it is disappointing to

2613
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,960
hear that this will not be coming out.

2614
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,840
However, Vita is region free, right?

2615
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:31,840
That's true.

2616
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:40,440
So maybe this is all hint, hint, hint, it's not coming to America, hint, wink, import.

2617
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,640
Let's go to the mailbag.

2618
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:47,180
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your

2619
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:49,320
emails here on the show.

2620
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,800
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst again at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

2621
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,960
and pick out some of her favorite emails to read right now.

2622
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:58,640
Well, I'm going to read all the ones that are in there.

2623
02:15:58,640 --> 02:15:59,640
They're not very long.

2624
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:02,040
Hey OLR, quick question for all three hosts.

2625
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,520
Of all the games you saw presented at this year's E3, which ones are you planning to

2626
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,680
buy on day one, if any?

2627
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:13,160
And I'm honestly, I'm interested in Beyond Two Souls, and I want to play Tank Tank Tank,

2628
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:17,400
because I'm sorry, that game is freaking addictive as hell.

2629
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:21,360
Otherwise I'm not super interested in hardly anything, so.

2630
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:26,440
I'm a little behind still, I feel, but I definitely want that new Tomb Raider game.

2631
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:35,200
I'll probably end up getting the Wii U, I don't know, to be determined.

2632
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:41,880
That Ubisoft game Watch Dogs looks really good too, I might have to check that out.

2633
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:44,820
Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U.

2634
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:51,760
Borderlands 2, for sure, South Park, The Sick of Truth, and...

2635
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:57,720
Oh yeah, I totally want that South Park game too.

2636
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,520
Really, those are the only two that jumped out right now.

2637
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:01,720
Grand Theft Auto 5, whenever the hell that fucking comes out.

2638
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,720
Yeah, where was that?

2639
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,920
Eh, it's not ready yet.

2640
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:09,280
They probably think, hey, well, Take Two's not really at, you know, they aren't really

2641
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,280
at E3.

2642
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,920
Their booth always has no electric fence.

2643
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,960
And so they probably, you know, maybe it's just not ready to show off yet, because I

2644
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:20,200
mean, if you think about it, it's probably about a year away from being released, so...

2645
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:24,640
They'll just have their own fucking splash, but hey, fucking Grand Theft Auto 5, you're

2646
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,520
buying this shit, you know it.

2647
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:27,520
Let's continue.

2648
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:29,960
I'm pretty sure Dan would want to get Halo 4, so.

2649
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:34,200
And then, Ospher, who wrote the email, says, for me, Halo 4 and Beyond Two Souls 4 must

2650
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,200
have titles.

2651
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,360
Except I misread it as titties, so.

2652
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,360
Sincerely, Ospher.

2653
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:42,280
P.S., all my love goes to the Krogan, but I guess I can spare some for my fellow Mass

2654
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:43,280
Effect gamers.

2655
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:44,280
Heart!

2656
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:47,800
You know, actually, speaking of titties, Far Cry 3 actually looks pretty awesome.

2657
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:49,920
I actually may pick that up day one.

2658
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,080
You know what game looked ridiculous?

2659
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:55,140
Alan made me watch the trailer last night.

2660
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:56,140
That Hitman Absolut-tion.

2661
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:58,840
Okay, well, the trailer was ridiculous.

2662
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:03,400
The trailer was totally ridiculous, with the stripper nuns and guns.

2663
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,960
They're trying to think, like, this is all the things that boys like.

2664
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:06,960
Well, they even...

2665
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:07,960
Don't forget exploding toilets.

2666
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:11,680
They even, well, even, like, a lot of people in the industry are just like, what the fuck

2667
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:12,680
was that trailer?

2668
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:14,200
That just makes no sense.

2669
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,720
The game looks pretty good.

2670
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,720
Anyhow.

2671
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,720
Next email!

2672
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:20,720
Um, Robert M. here.

2673
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:24,360
You guys mentioned Retro City Rampage's Meat Boy minigame on last week's pre-taped...

2674
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:27,280
I hate that word!

2675
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:29,280
Taped show.

2676
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:33,700
Last month's Nintendo Power had a feature on the game for WiiWare, including a Splosion

2677
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,240
Man minigame as well.

2678
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:37,240
Not sure how that works license-wise.

2679
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:42,320
I get the impression that this will join Meat Boy and Spelunky as unreleased, especially

2680
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,500
this late in the Wii's life cycle.

2681
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:47,320
For what other consoles is it scheduled?

2682
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,320
As for the...

2683
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,320
Oh, go ahead.

2684
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,320
You were gonna say?

2685
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:56,040
Uh, Xbox Live Arcade, uh, PlayStation Network for both, um, PlayStation 3 and the Vita as

2686
02:18:56,040 --> 02:18:57,040
PC.

2687
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,040
Nice.

2688
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,040
Okay.

2689
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:04,640
As for the voice of Geeks Network, how practical do you expect it'll be for shows doing video

2690
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:09,320
content, under Sedation Live in particular, to have a video podcast feed?

2691
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:13,440
I know when he was doing Friday Night Gaming, Bobby said such a feed would be three gigabytes

2692
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:14,440
an episode.

2693
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:22,040
Uh, yeah, the problem is you have to compress the video and then it's tricky.

2694
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:24,160
It's tricky to do something like that.

2695
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:28,680
Um, you know, yeah, video podcasts are hard and there haven't been a lot of successful

2696
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:29,680
ones that are over.

2697
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:32,860
I mean, most of them are like five minutes long.

2698
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:38,080
That's how they deliver the video podcast because five minutes worth of HD video is

2699
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:40,380
like our three hour show, you know?

2700
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:41,380
They're about the same size.

2701
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:44,120
There's plenty of them that use, um, just post them to YouTube.

2702
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:45,120
Yeah, that's true.

2703
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,160
Um, you know, I think Travis has been putting clips on YouTube and so forth and I'd certainly

2704
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,700
encourage him to continue doing that.

2705
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:58,360
But for now, I think him particularly is very about getting people in for the live experience.

2706
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:02,100
So I don't think he's going to take a whole lot of effort to try and get the video up

2707
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,140
when he is putting the audio out there at least.

2708
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:07,480
So at least, and I will say this, give mad props to Travis.

2709
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:09,640
He's got that shit on same day turnaround now.

2710
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:10,640
Like forever.

2711
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:13,000
We were like, Travis, get season five up, Travis, get season five.

2712
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,960
He's worked out a system where he's on same day turnaround now.

2713
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:15,960
So props to him.

2714
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:18,840
I think that's, I think that is important too.

2715
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:23,840
I finally saw the disco thing and disco disco Lord.

2716
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,680
It made me glad I didn't have a webcam at the time.

2717
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:29,740
Uh, Oh God, did he put that on YouTube?

2718
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,740
I don't think so.

2719
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:31,740
Phew.

2720
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:32,740
Phew.

2721
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:33,740
Um, I don't know.

2722
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:34,740
I didn't look.

2723
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:35,740
Um, I will say this.

2724
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:39,440
We are looking at doing more type of like vlog content cause like Travis did that studio

2725
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,440
tour that went up during the week.

2726
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:45,960
And I'm going to do one that's a little more talking head, but I've got one coming up in

2727
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:49,680
the next week that I'll, I'll, should I spoil it?

2728
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,680
Spoil.

2729
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:53,060
I'll, I'll say this much, I'll drop a hint.

2730
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:57,840
I'm going to explain why I am not doing a particular podcast.

2731
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,700
People have been asking me to do a podcast on a certain topic and I'm going to explain

2732
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:02,800
in depth why that's not going to happen.

2733
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:03,800
And sorry.

2734
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:04,800
Mm hmm.

2735
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:11,440
Um, so to continue with the email as for the voice of geeks network, how proud, Oh, nevermind.

2736
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:12,440
I already read that.

2737
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,440
Blah.

2738
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:14,440
Next email.

2739
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:16,200
Um, Hey guys, die.

2740
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:17,200
You're sexist.

2741
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:18,200
Um, sorry.

2742
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:24,520
Um, so I just finished watching the E3 press conference conferences while I was really

2743
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:28,200
looking forward to what Microsoft and Nintendo had to offer and didn't really expect much

2744
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:33,000
from Sony ended up liking the fact that Sony focused on games for the most part as really

2745
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,940
considering the Wii U since I thought it would be next gen system that would get all the

2746
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:40,420
new games for other, that other systems shared plus Mario and Zelda.

2747
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:43,640
Unfortunately after their press conference, it seemed like they were focusing too much

2748
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:47,720
on the gimmicks and the multi console games were all out of date.

2749
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,640
So I guess I'll have to pass on that.

2750
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:53,120
I did think the new Kinect features and the smart glass that Microsoft presented were

2751
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:54,120
cool.

2752
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:59,300
However, when it comes to games, I just don't care about getting into Halo or Gears of War

2753
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:02,880
after all this time and they didn't offer anything new game wise.

2754
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,880
Sony still won me over with their exclusives.

2755
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:09,320
I love to have you rain, so I will be buying beyond right away.

2756
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:13,600
The last of us looked like a great way to tell a different kind of story with the already

2757
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:18,880
proven uncharted game engine and while I don't care much about God of war or PlayStation

2758
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,720
all sores, it's all stars, not all sores.

2759
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:22,720
All sores.

2760
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:27,040
It's the amazing game where you fight STDs.

2761
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,440
That is important.

2762
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,440
Oh God.

2763
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:31,440
It's herpes man.

2764
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:39,640
Herpes, that sores herpes man versus Mrs. Gonorrhea, ringworm gun, ringworm gym, ringworm

2765
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:41,280
gun.

2766
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:45,640
Anyway, um, all stars.

2767
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:50,080
It's still nice that Sony is delivering for fans of those types of games as well.

2768
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:53,800
I just wish Wii U wasn't trying to ram this new controller down our throats more like

2769
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,200
up your ass.

2770
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,720
Um, seriously, it's not just swallow it.

2771
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,760
It's take it as a suppository too.

2772
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:06,000
Um, I had high hopes when I saw the pro controller that there would be an alternative, but there,

2773
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,360
but they aren't even getting the awesome looking Watch Dogs game, at least not when it comes

2774
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:11,360
out.

2775
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,800
That means no Mario or Zelda for me, as long as they keep pushing gimmicky controls and

2776
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,800
that's from Flacco Jones.

2777
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:20,440
There's the other thing too, like once again, it gets me thinking about the Wii U, um, their

2778
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:24,640
biggest features that they like were pimping out.

2779
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,280
This system can be played when someone wants to watch TV.

2780
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:30,000
I just don't understand that.

2781
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
You're supposed to, okay, this system is supposed to be so awesome that you want to play it

2782
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
on your TV.

2783
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,760
And I know a lot of people probably have multiple TVs they can play it on.

2784
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:40,520
I don't understand why that's necessarily a feature that we need to be pimping out.

2785
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:46,160
And, and once again, just like the Wii was, they're pimping it as like this party environment

2786
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:51,360
that all these party games, you know, like Just Dance has this, you know, Poppy Master

2787
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:52,360
Mode.

2788
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,360
Hey, guess what?

2789
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:57,880
I hardly ever have people over to my house to play games nowadays because I have a kid.

2790
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:02,320
I can't just be getting the party going and you know, oh, hey, we gotta be quiet because

2791
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:05,320
we have the kid there, you know, so I don't have that.

2792
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:12,880
So the fact that, you know, Super Mario, um, New Super Mario Brothers, you or, you know,

2793
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:14,600
Rayman Legends has five player co-op.

2794
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:19,920
I can't get two player co-op in my household, let alone five people.

2795
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,580
Let me get out here a couple points on Wii U from our chat room.

2796
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:27,500
Shadownextgen in our chat room at vognetwork.com, click on live chat says, I love how no one

2797
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:28,640
can see what is happening.

2798
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,600
Mass Effect 3, for example, will obviously be late to the Wii U, but with EA BioWare

2799
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:38,320
being on board with Wii U, that means Mass Effect 4 will be day date with the other consoles.

2800
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:42,080
Black Wolf says, you know, if they didn't spend all that time discussing the new controller,

2801
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:45,600
we would have been like, wait, why did you not give us more information on the controller?

2802
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:47,920
No, we wouldn't have.

2803
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,040
Yes, they would have.

2804
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,640
I agree with them.

2805
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:53,600
Unless you're just in the same boat that I am.

2806
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:54,700
Don't care.

2807
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:57,880
What more information did we get about their controller?

2808
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:02,120
The quote unquote final design, and the whole fact that you can use two of them now, which

2809
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:03,720
was a big thing people were bitching about last year.

2810
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:06,280
That's not important though, but if you think about it, that's not important, because we

2811
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:09,480
didn't see any games that used two of them, so who knows how that's going to be utilized,

2812
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:12,320
and we already saw the final design and got leaked out already.

2813
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:15,660
So what did we need to know about the controller that we didn't know already?

2814
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:16,660
Back to the email.

2815
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:17,660
Can I read the last email?

2816
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:21,000
Greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2817
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,660
I thought I'd say hi and keep up the good work.

2818
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:26,680
Your show helps make my Mondays bearable at work.

2819
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:29,440
I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions of E3.

2820
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:30,440
One last thing.

2821
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:34,480
I just bought my first smartphone and was wondering if there are any apps and or games.

2822
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:36,520
Do you think I'd be crazy not to get?

2823
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:38,920
Peace and Chicken Grease, Serious Turtle.

2824
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:39,920
Yes.

2825
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:42,600
And we need to know what kind of phone you have too.

2826
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:43,600
We don't know what kind of phone.

2827
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,280
There's a big difference between Android and iOS.

2828
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:49,160
There's some games that are between both.

2829
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:53,560
I like Cut the Rope, personally, and Temple Run.

2830
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:55,400
I'm so addicted to Temple Run recently.

2831
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:59,920
I got Bubble Bobble, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble, Best of Move.

2832
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:02,400
I played the crap out of it.

2833
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:12,120
And seriously, it is, you know, that I actually really liked Espigobluda too.

2834
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:18,080
And I really, you know, as far as apps, I know I'm looking at my phone right now.

2835
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:23,240
The Midway Arcade Collection isn't bad, especially because I think it was 99 cents or

2836
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:27,320
relatively low cost, and it does have a lot in it, even though I kind of hate using the

2837
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,080
touch screen controls.

2838
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:32,160
Bejeweled Blitz is a free PopCap game.

2839
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,160
That's pretty cool.

2840
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:34,160
Pinball Arcade.

2841
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:36,160
Oh, oh, yes, the Pinball games.

2842
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,160
Oh my gosh.

2843
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:40,680
There's Zen Pinball has a Pinball version, and then there's that new one too.

2844
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:41,680
Yeah, Pinball Arcade.

2845
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:42,680
There's Juke Beat.

2846
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:43,820
I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy.

2847
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:44,820
Both are worth getting.

2848
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:45,820
Absolutely.

2849
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:46,820
Robot Unicorn Attack, Peggle.

2850
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:47,820
Plants vs. Zombies.

2851
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:49,320
Beat Hazard is on iOS now.

2852
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:52,220
You know, Plants vs. Zombies, I don't really like so much on the iPhone.

2853
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:54,680
It would need a larger thing.

2854
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:58,300
R-Type, actually, believe it or not, R-Type is one of the few shooters that works very

2855
02:26:58,300 --> 02:26:59,300
well on the iPhone.

2856
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:01,720
Well, I'm just seeing what else I have.

2857
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:05,140
As far as like regular apps, you know, I've got Facebook.

2858
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:06,560
For Twitter, I use Echo Phone.

2859
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:08,660
I paid for Echo Phone, and it's worth it.

2860
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:12,340
If you're on iOS, Flipboard.

2861
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:15,480
I have the Tumblr app, Goodreads, because I like to share my books.

2862
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:19,600
The Steam app, AIM, Pinterest, you know, I've got all the usual stuff.

2863
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:20,600
And then...

2864
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,600
XTube?

2865
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:22,600
Not Jamie.

2866
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:23,600
Just kidding.

2867
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:28,480
I've also got a program that, when I go to eat out, I use called Check, Please, that

2868
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:34,840
actually splits your meal, includes or dis-includes tip, and lets you go up to 30% tip.

2869
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:36,560
Ah, downloading that right now.

2870
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:39,800
QR Reader, because of all the stuff using QR codes now.

2871
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:43,240
And actually a really neat little clock program called Nuka.

2872
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:47,760
Nuka does all these interesting different digital watches, and the Nuka app is actually

2873
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:51,920
pretty fun to play with, and has neat timers and everything.

2874
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:55,400
I have Secret Garden that Ikuma JP did.

2875
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:56,960
I use Shazam all the time.

2876
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:59,080
You're not going to go through all seven pages of your phone, are you?

2877
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:00,080
No, I'm not.

2878
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,320
I'm just picking the best ones.

2879
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:05,840
I have the Kindle app, but I love Shazam because I go to Pinkberry and like the music, so I'll

2880
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:10,480
tag the music at Pinkberry, and then I usually go and download albums.

2881
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:12,640
If you're playing Mass Effect 3, get the data pad.

2882
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:17,400
I mean, there's just lots of good stuff, and, you know, when you go to Disneyland, use Mouse

2883
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:22,240
Plate, you know, so that you know how long you have to wait for Space Mountain.

2884
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:27,240
But really, those are just some good ones, and that was the last email.

2885
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:28,640
Awesome.

2886
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:32,440
Just root your phone and download them all for free.

2887
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:37,480
Alright, let's move on with the FUs of the week, because some things that E3 might have

2888
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:40,320
made us angry, or maybe stuff IRL.

2889
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:57,080
We're going to find out right now.

2890
02:28:57,080 --> 02:29:01,640
I'm not really upset about anything, except for my nail polish deciding that it all wanted

2891
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:07,040
to come off tonight, and my nails are kind of brittle, so.

2892
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:11,520
Fucking in my throat for being sore, it's not really, I don't know, it's like a weird

2893
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:12,520
thing.

2894
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:15,960
I don't know if it's allergies, or if it's cold, or strep throat, or what, but for like

2895
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:20,520
the last two weeks, my throat's just been like, I'll get sharp pains every now and then,

2896
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:25,600
and you might, I feel really raspy right now at this talk that I've made.

2897
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,760
But like, I'll just all of a sudden, I'll be like talking, and like, ah, tickle, I have

2898
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:34,480
to cough, and it hasn't gone away, and I really wish it would go away, because it's annoying.

2899
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:38,000
I hope it's not strep throat, because then that means I have to have my tonsils out.

2900
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I haven't had that happen yet.

2901
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:45,120
I like to keep all my body parts intact, even the unnecessary ones.

2902
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:50,520
They are necessary, they do serve a purpose until they get infected.

2903
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:54,280
You know, I still have everything I was born with except for my wisdom teeth.

2904
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,280
Lucky you.

2905
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,280
I'm missing a gallbladder, I'm missing wisdom teeth, anyway.

2906
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:03,320
Uh, moving on, um, my F.U. of the week goes to, believe it or not, this is going to shock

2907
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:04,320
you.

2908
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:05,320
Disneyland.

2909
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:09,400
Yep, Disneyland on Wednesday was a fucking hot mess, oh my gosh.

2910
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:13,040
I guess all those people were there for the Cars Land preview, the cast members, and that

2911
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,440
must have been all the veteran cast members, because the noobs were running the place.

2912
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:20,080
And uh, yeah, just, just so crowded, especially for a Wednesday.

2913
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:25,560
And I get that it's summer, but I've gone E3 week the last like three years, and I've

2914
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:27,560
never had an experience as terrible as last week.

2915
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,240
Like, every other year's been relatively good.

2916
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,240
Okay, Rob.

2917
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:31,240
I don't know, because I didn't get to go.

2918
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,940
Tell me, how bad did the Mad Tea Party blow?

2919
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:37,480
I think it wasn't running weeknights, but I did see the decorations.

2920
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:40,560
The decorations looked great, they spent a lot of money on them, which kind of pissed

2921
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:41,560
me off.

2922
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:46,240
My friends were there this past weekend, they said it was the worst thing to ever happen.

2923
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:47,240
That's too bad.

2924
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:48,240
Yeah.

2925
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:51,000
It was basically, what did you call it, the Mad Suck Party or something?

2926
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
The Mad Flop Party.

2927
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
That was the Mad Flop Party.

2928
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,640
I like to call it the Mad Flop Party.

2929
02:30:54,640 --> 02:31:00,800
Um, but yeah, the one thing that bugged me most of all is that Disney don't, don't give

2930
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:04,620
celebrities the royal treatment and shut down the entire fucking ride just because one celebrity

2931
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,620
wants to ride it.

2932
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:09,420
They need to, I'm not saying, look, I get if you want to have the little ushers, bring

2933
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:12,600
them up the exit and give them a little bit of special treatment, but you don't stop the

2934
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,480
entire fucking ride because the celebrity's on it.

2935
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:15,480
I don't care.

2936
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:17,080
I don't care if it's Barack Obama.

2937
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:18,080
I don't care who it is.

2938
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,140
That is kind of lame.

2939
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,080
You don't stop for everybody else.

2940
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,760
Who was a celebrity?

2941
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:25,240
Uh, David Beckham and his wife Posh Spice.

2942
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,240
Lame.

2943
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:32,960
Yeah, they could do it at least for like a real celebrity like Neil Patrick Harris.

2944
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,800
Anyhow that just kind of ticked me off.

2945
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:39,900
So meanwhile, let's get back into, I know, I know, I, I, I, I just did not have a good

2946
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:42,760
experience on Wednesday and that ticked me off cause it was like extra for Matt's first

2947
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:45,940
experience at Disneyland and they enjoyed themselves cause we had a really good time

2948
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:46,940
on Monday.

2949
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:50,160
It wasn't nearly as bad and we got to fit in a lot of the good stuff, but Wednesday

2950
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:53,480
was, was a mess.

2951
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:55,800
I could go on and on, but I won't.

2952
02:31:55,800 --> 02:32:00,960
So meanwhile, Loki, let's get back into the gaming news, uh, uh, Twitter topics, a few,

2953
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:03,160
and then Skypline most of all in a little bit.

2954
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:07,640
So one of the rumors that we were supposed to get out of E3 was that one of these, um,

2955
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:11,700
streaming companies is supposed to be partner of a console, but they didn't see that.

2956
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:15,040
No OnLive or no, uh, Gaikai teaming up with consoles.

2957
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:22,040
But OnLive did say that they are going to be teaming up with smart TV, um, manufacturers

2958
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:27,640
including LG smart TVs with Google TV and internet browsers as well.

2959
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:33,920
Um, they're going to be allowing the online service to be used in browser, um, which is

2960
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:34,920
kind of neat.

2961
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:39,640
And of course if you have a, one of those smart TVs, you can download an app that will

2962
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:44,320
allow you to stream stuff and then you just have to buy the controller as well.

2963
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:46,960
Um, that's kind of neat.

2964
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:53,000
I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen smart TVs, you know, take off yet, but I mean, I'm

2965
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,720
sure in the future we're going to see that.

2966
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:56,960
I mean, everything's fucking connected to the internet now.

2967
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:59,840
So pretty cool.

2968
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:04,960
And of course when the games are showing on there's Borderlands, it looks sexy, of course.

2969
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:09,460
Um, some other little details about the Wii U is some actually really good news because

2970
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:13,420
Nintendo could have made the bad decision here, but they made the good decision.

2971
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:16,640
So we need to, you know, I know we've been giving Nintendo a little bit of a hard time

2972
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:21,000
tonight, but we need to applaud this decision and that is that Nintendo is working on the

2973
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:27,360
system to figure out how Wii owners are going to transfer their content to the Wii U.

2974
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:33,120
Designer Katsuya Iguchi said, uh, we are readying the system, yes, to transfer saves and everything

2975
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,520
you've bought.

2976
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:38,120
So the good news is if you bought virtual console stuff and WiiWare stuff, they're going

2977
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:41,360
to transfer over to the Wii U and it doesn't sound like they're going to charge you more

2978
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:43,360
for it or try to sell it to you again.

2979
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,360
Yay.

2980
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:46,960
Oh, that's good.

2981
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:48,080
That is very good.

2982
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:49,080
Have a cookie, Nintendo.

2983
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:53,300
I wonder if it's being done with the friend code for the, cause that'll be tied to the

2984
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:54,300
console.

2985
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,300
Who knows?

2986
02:33:55,300 --> 02:33:56,300
Who knows?

2987
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:59,360
Now, while there's good news, we have to of course follow that up with a little bit of

2988
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:00,360
WTF news.

2989
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:06,960
Uh, that whole Miiverse thing, it came out after the, uh, show that Miiverse, which will

2990
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:08,880
allow you to kind of like post messages.

2991
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,920
It's kind of like the Nintendo social network, I guess, for lack of a better term.

2992
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:16,320
Uh, Satoru Iwata said there will be filtering on the Miiverse content.

2993
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,880
The first will be automatic content filtering.

2994
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:22,480
So if you post something that's like, fuck you and your fucking dog, it's going to hit

2995
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:25,960
that filter cause it says the F word and won't post.

2996
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:34,000
However, the second, there will be a moderator reading all posts before they're published.

2997
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,520
That seems crazy, but yes, live people will be screening all the messages and they say

2998
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:43,680
it may take about 30 minutes between the time you post something and the time it's actually

2999
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,640
visible because of that delay.

3000
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:49,600
Lastly, users can also flag if something is missed, which we know will happen at some

3001
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:50,600
point.

3002
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:51,600
That's lame.

3003
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:52,600
That is extreme.

3004
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:58,140
I mean, I get, I get that, you know, it's kind of like a forum so you can post stuff

3005
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:00,440
and there should be moderators for that stuff.

3006
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:02,040
That's fine.

3007
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:08,260
I have a problem with them going all 1984 and just let's monitor every single thing.

3008
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:13,920
And also being an adult owning a console, I don't give a fuck if the word fuck is in,

3009
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,920
you know, something.

3010
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:15,920
If they're like, fuck this boss.

3011
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:16,920
I hate it.

3012
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,600
I fucking died nine times.

3013
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:19,600
That's acceptable to me.

3014
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:20,880
I'm not a fucking little child.

3015
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:24,560
I don't need to be, Oh, let's start.

3016
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,620
Little children will be using it.

3017
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:26,620
I understand that.

3018
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:27,620
But you know what?

3019
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:33,420
They have, they have wonderful parental technology, you know, that you can block this stuff so

3020
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:36,720
you can put content filtering for those age groups.

3021
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:38,800
They'll figure out how to override by themselves.

3022
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:43,600
Well then you gotta be smart and fucking that maybe, well maybe this system will get overridden

3023
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,600
too.

3024
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:46,920
I, I want to be able to go post and Loki's me verse.

3025
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:47,920
Fuck you.

3026
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:48,920
You fucking fuck.

3027
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:52,320
That should, that should be, that's what X-Box is for.

3028
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:53,320
Rob.

3029
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:55,360
No, that's for saying far worse words.

3030
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:56,360
Go ahead.

3031
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,360
Frisbee.

3032
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,360
Everyone learned lead.

3033
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:02,320
Um, by the way, probably moderators will know a little tangent here.

3034
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:05,160
What about FIFA, FIFA and the whole connect thing.

3035
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:09,720
If you fucking swear, you get, you get flagged by the shit is funny.

3036
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:10,720
I'm sorry.

3037
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:11,720
That is funny.

3038
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:12,720
I know.

3039
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:13,720
Yeah.

3040
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:14,720
That's funny.

3041
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:17,560
Like the, to me, the whole fact that the connect will pick it up if you're saying like, fuck

3042
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:19,400
you flag.

3043
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:20,400
That's funny.

3044
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:22,040
If you don't like it, unplug the connect.

3045
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:27,080
But if they have that technology, why don't we apply it to the goddamn X-Box service?

3046
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:28,920
That's a little too big brother.

3047
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:32,980
And if I want to say like, if we're playing mass effect online and I want to be like this

3048
02:36:32,980 --> 02:36:37,880
fucking Banshee bitch can S my D, you know, then I should be able to say I should be able

3049
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:38,880
to swear on my TV.

3050
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:43,120
But then again, here's the thing is that if I were to ever play FIFA, which is not going

3051
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:46,840
to happen, I'm not going to fucking use connect.

3052
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,120
Fuck that shit.

3053
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:50,360
All right.

3054
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:56,580
That's my, we, you news, uh, Esperanto.

3055
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:57,580
You know what?

3056
02:36:57,580 --> 02:36:59,080
Actually, that's a great idea.

3057
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:02,900
You know what, the average person actually can look at a page written in Esperanto and

3058
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:06,580
figure out what it says because that's the purpose of the language.

3059
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:10,240
Anyone who knows any little bit of Latin, which just about every English speaker does

3060
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:14,840
know a little bit of Latin and Greek is part of the basis of our language and the romance

3061
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:15,840
languages.

3062
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:18,040
No Esperanto.

3063
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:20,560
I've read a page in Esperanto and I've never learned it.

3064
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:21,560
How do I say fuck you?

3065
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:24,160
You fucking fucking Esperanto Frick year.

3066
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,160
I don't know.

3067
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,880
I'm going to look it up actually.

3068
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:29,160
Well, read a story first.

3069
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:34,960
Oh yeah, that, um, is being bitches.

3070
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:36,720
That's my official title of this.

3071
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:43,480
They're not going to copy steam 75% off sales because they think it cheapens the IP and

3072
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:46,040
they don't want to copy that practice.

3073
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:51,040
Um, there's a quote from David Demartini, the origin boss.

3074
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:54,760
Um, obviously they think it's the right thing to do after a certain amount of time.

3075
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:59,000
I think it, I just think it cheapens your intellectual property.

3076
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:03,480
Um, honestly, steam is successful.

3077
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:08,880
It clearly works and people are still forking out the money to buy the games.

3078
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:13,240
So what about it is cheapening the IP if it's bringing it to a wider audience?

3079
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:16,520
And it's not like steam's just going, okay, we're going to charge less for your game.

3080
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:17,520
They're good.

3081
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:20,880
They're coordinating with these different developers and publishers and saying, okay,

3082
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:26,480
hey, we want to mark it down to drive up some, you know, business and you drive up some sales

3083
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:31,640
for you guys as well as maybe bringing a little bit of, you know, exposure to your product

3084
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:33,400
and then EA saying, ah, fuck it.

3085
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:34,400
We don't care.

3086
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:35,920
You know, well, you know what?

3087
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:37,600
No one has to purchase stuff through origin.

3088
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:40,160
Just saying, you know, there are other services out there.

3089
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:43,720
So if you don't want to put your stuff on sale, then fine.

3090
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:44,720
Someone else will.

3091
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:49,040
Well, and here's another thing that he's saying is what steam does might be teaching the customer.

3092
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:52,880
I might not want it in the first month, but if I look at it in four or five months, I'll

3093
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:56,320
get one of those weekend sales and I'll buy it at that time at 75% off.

3094
02:38:56,320 --> 02:39:01,920
What he's not realizing is that people who are into the game will buy it when it comes

3095
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:02,920
out.

3096
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:05,000
They don't care about waiting for a sale.

3097
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,120
They'll get it when it comes out.

3098
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:11,360
You know, when portal two came out, now true, I didn't buy it for myself cause I knew I

3099
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:16,720
was getting it for Christmas slash Hanukkah slash Kwanzaa slash Festivus, whatever, which

3100
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:17,720
I did.

3101
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:21,360
Um, but I was all hot and bothered to buy it when it came out.

3102
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:26,360
You know, so I've bought, like I bought fractal when it came out, you know, I've bought tons

3103
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:31,060
of games when they've come out, even though I knew, like for example, okay, here, here's

3104
02:39:31,060 --> 02:39:32,560
a good example.

3105
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:38,860
Um, Marvel versus Capcom three or no, um, not Marvel versus, yeah, I bought it right

3106
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:39,860
when it came out.

3107
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:41,200
Well, Dan bought it right when it came out.

3108
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:44,860
As soon as ultimate Marvel and we knew ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three would be out and

3109
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:45,860
guess what?

3110
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:46,860
We bought that too.

3111
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:49,520
It just, if someone wants it, they don't care.

3112
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:50,520
They're going to go get it.

3113
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:53,920
The sheer amount of games I've purchased on steam, well, mostly through the Humblelandy

3114
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:59,600
bundles, but I have not played most of them and I have a lot of people, you know, my coworkers

3115
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,920
and stuff that buy stuff on steam that say, yeah, I'll see this game for like five bucks.

3116
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:07,960
I'm like, fuck, I'm going to pick that up because I may play it eventually.

3117
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:14,680
So there's a lot of really quick, um, just spontaneous purchases because of these sales.

3118
02:40:14,680 --> 02:40:17,160
And I think it's, you know, sure.

3119
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:23,920
Keep your game at $20, you know, and someone may pick it up or drop the $5 and the check

3120
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:24,920
stand purchase.

3121
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:25,920
Yeah.

3122
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:28,680
It's, you know, when you're in line at the grocery store and go, Oh man, I love Twix

3123
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:29,680
two for a buck.

3124
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:32,760
And it's usually a lot of these independent games that most people aren't like aware of

3125
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,760
that.

3126
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,760
Oh, I sense all.

3127
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:35,760
Yeah, sure.

3128
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:39,440
I'll try it for, if it's a buck, you know, if it sucks, whatever I paid five bucks for

3129
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:44,360
a game, just, you know, like I've played the binding of Isaac for like five minutes, which

3130
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:46,600
was another game I played this week.

3131
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:47,600
Oops.

3132
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:48,720
Um, but you know, it's good.

3133
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,680
It's something I can go back, you know, if I'm feeling kind of bored, I don't have anything

3134
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:56,820
to do, then I can go in and play cave story, which I, you know, bought on the hundle indie

3135
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:59,180
bundle before too.

3136
02:40:59,180 --> 02:41:07,600
So it's, he's not, he's using a business, the business mentality and not real world

3137
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:08,600
common sense.

3138
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:14,120
Well, at the end of story, origin is not as big of a deal as steam is at the end of the

3139
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,120
day.

3140
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:16,700
What brought people into steam?

3141
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:17,700
Those sales.

3142
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:18,700
Duh.

3143
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:23,680
Well, and here's another thing that he says, um, we don't believe in the drop it down,

3144
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:27,440
spring it up 75% off approach, which is not necessarily what steam is doing.

3145
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:32,040
Um, but we've got something else that we do believe in that we'll be rolling out.

3146
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:35,880
I don't know what that is and honestly I don't care because I'm only going to ever play one

3147
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:36,880
game on origin.

3148
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:41,120
If I have to buy 10 get one free and they're stupid anyways because they're like, Oh, we

3149
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:44,660
don't believe in marking stuff down and bringing it back up and price clearly don't believe

3150
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:45,660
in making money.

3151
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:52,160
Well, apparently you're, you didn't have no idea what your, you know, iOS team is doing

3152
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:56,560
because there's a lot of EA games that go down the 99 cents when those properties are

3153
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,240
like $7 or whatever.

3154
02:41:58,240 --> 02:41:59,240
Well said.

3155
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:05,200
Well, so it's like, I mean, Hey, you, you're talking this talk right here, but at the same

3156
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:07,680
time you're doing something completely different in this platform.

3157
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:08,680
So you know why?

3158
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:09,680
Who gives a fuck?

3159
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:12,480
What do you want to do and you know, people hate it and then they'll just won't go to

3160
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:13,480
your service.

3161
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:18,020
You'll eventually fold if it doesn't work for you that whatever your plan is, that's

3162
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:19,020
the way it is.

3163
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:20,020
All right.

3164
02:42:20,020 --> 02:42:21,020
Two more stories.

3165
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,020
And then the Skypline Loki.

3166
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:27,280
So there's a new app that's going to be coming to Xbox, um, pretty soon.

3167
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:29,640
And it's the Virgin gaming app.

3168
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:33,980
And what the Virgin gaming app is going to do is it's going to run a tournament service.

3169
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:39,980
And so you can, um, launch into a bunch of different Xbox live tournaments, including,

3170
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:44,600
and this of course is, you know, with, uh, Xbox gold.

3171
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:47,640
Um, apparently you can, uh, enter different tournaments.

3172
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:52,880
Some are free, some are with a paid entry and you can compete in a variety of different

3173
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:54,960
games, um, through their service.

3174
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:58,400
I think they actually do this right now through their website, um, Virgin gaming.

3175
02:42:58,400 --> 02:43:05,180
But I guess right now they're going to be partnering with EA sports, 2k sports and Ubisoft,

3176
02:43:05,180 --> 02:43:09,200
and they're going to have different, like, you know, matchmaking, um, stuff.

3177
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:19,800
And also, I don't know, some, uh, different services was it pay to have pays to have game

3178
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:22,080
as their tagline for Virgin gaming.

3179
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:25,000
It'll be interesting to see what it is.

3180
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,400
I'm curious on how that's really going to work and, um, you know, how we can leverage

3181
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:32,980
it to have tournaments for OLR and VOG network and so forth.

3182
02:43:32,980 --> 02:43:33,980
But, uh, we'll see.

3183
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:34,980
Too bad.

3184
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:38,420
Too bad they didn't do this shit back in the day when Grand Theft Auto wasn't modded the

3185
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:43,720
fucking hell because I kicked a lot of ass in vanilla Grand Theft Auto and episodes from

3186
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:44,720
Liberty City.

3187
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,280
Well, there's always Grand Theft Auto 5.

3188
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:47,280
There is.

3189
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:49,120
I will fucking own that shit again.

3190
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:50,620
I am ready.

3191
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:51,620
Your body is ready.

3192
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:55,720
I need, I need to play Max Payne 3 because that's supposed to be pretty awesome, but

3193
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:58,760
Grand Theft Auto 5, I will dedicate my life to that game.

3194
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:00,760
Alright, let's move on to one last story here.

3195
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:04,400
I want to end on a good note with the stories tonight and this is a great note.

3196
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:07,320
And, uh, you know, we talked a little bit last week about, you know, Curt Schilling's

3197
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:11,920
studio and all the closures and all that, but a big, huge games, one of the studios

3198
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:18,320
that was, uh, closed in that whole 38 Studios, uh, debacle from a couple weeks ago has basically

3199
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:21,960
been gobbled up by Epic Games.

3200
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:25,820
And this is good news because Epic Games is going to open a brand new studio called Epic

3201
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:30,000
Baltimore and it's made up of the folks from Big Huge Games.

3202
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:34,000
I think that's quite awesome that basically, um, they, they've helped them find jobs.

3203
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,660
Of course, not everybody's going to go cause some people might, you know, decide to do

3204
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:40,800
something else, but most of them sounds like you're going over to this.

3205
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:45,320
The official quote on this from Epic Games President Michael Capps quote, on Wednesday,

3206
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:51,000
the ex, uh, BHG, Big Huge Games leadership game leadership team contacted us.

3207
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,600
They wanted to start a new company and keep together some of the key talent displaced

3208
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:59,300
by the layoff and hope that they could use an Epic IP as a starting point for a new game.

3209
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:02,900
We love that they all wanted to keep working together, but it was pretty clear they'd have

3210
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:07,520
trouble building a demo and securing funding before their personal savings ran out.

3211
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:08,640
So there they go.

3212
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,700
They are going to be working on a big IP.

3213
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:12,040
Who knows what it is?

3214
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:18,120
It won't be reckoning to though, unless Epic ends up buying that IP because I believe the

3215
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:23,080
state of Maryland owns that now or Rhode Island, excuse me, also their thing was, is we make

3216
02:45:23,080 --> 02:45:24,080
IP.

3217
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:27,080
We don't buy IP, so they're not going to buy the IP.

3218
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:33,000
Uh, Blackwell ventures a guest that Epic Baltimore could be making infinity blade for consoles.

3219
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:38,000
That is a pretty big, uh, Epic IP that, you know, wouldn't surprise me.

3220
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:43,720
You know what would fit down, uh, fit right with, um, Epic in that it's something that

3221
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:47,760
kind of got canceled a long time ago, even though it looked really awesome.

3222
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:50,120
Project offset would have been fucking amazing.

3223
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:54,440
It was that first person, like fantasy RPG game that was like a first person shooter

3224
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:58,560
almost, but like with giant dragons and shit, it looked really amazing.

3225
02:45:58,560 --> 02:45:59,560
That would be cool.

3226
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:05,120
Like a project offset game, but developed by Epic, like an RPG fantasy game, but like

3227
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:07,040
Gears of War, I guess.

3228
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:08,280
Let's open up the Skype line.

3229
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:13,200
It is open one eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

3230
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:17,240
Certainly you have something to say about the news tonight, so give us a call and we

3231
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:20,280
will talk E3 or whatever it is that's on your mind tonight.

3232
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:24,360
In the meantime, um, quickly, let's try to fit in a couple of last minute stories here.

3233
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,360
Loki.

3234
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:29,360
Um, so yes, let's, uh, I don't have anything pulled up again.

3235
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:30,360
Oh, you don't?

3236
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:31,360
That's all right.

3237
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:32,360
I can go to Twitter.

3238
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,360
All right, let me go to Twitter real quick.

3239
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:37,840
Let me bring it up cause I wasn't prepared for that either.

3240
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:38,840
That's okay.

3241
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:39,840
All right.

3242
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:43,320
We do have some tweets at twitter.com slash O L R. Oh, and how convenient.

3243
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:44,800
Skypline's already going off.

3244
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:48,640
Now you have some time to pull up the other stuff higher on orange house radio.

3245
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:49,640
Who's this?

3246
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:50,640
It's Shane.

3247
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:51,640
Hey, hey, hey Shane.

3248
02:46:51,640 --> 02:46:52,760
How you doing?

3249
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:56,260
I'm tired and hungry and grouchy.

3250
02:46:56,260 --> 02:46:57,260
Why are you grouchy?

3251
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:59,720
Cause I can't eat or drink anything.

3252
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:02,000
So are you supposed to be fasting for something?

3253
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,800
No, I have surgery tomorrow.

3254
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:06,160
So I'm not supposed to eat or drink.

3255
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,400
So you're fasting for something.

3256
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:08,400
I guess.

3257
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:09,400
Okay, fine.

3258
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:10,400
Yeah.

3259
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:12,400
But not a good reason.

3260
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:18,560
Well, good luck with all of that stuff and can't wait to talk to you when you're on drugs.

3261
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:23,680
I know that will be why you should tune into Horde house on Tuesday, which by the way gets

3262
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:25,840
it's, well, they, they don't hear it on Tuesday.

3263
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:29,600
They hear it on Wednesday, Wednesday live, not live.

3264
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,600
Damn it.

3265
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:32,040
It's new for us.

3266
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:37,720
Should I just hang up and we could start this over premiered at vog network.com on Warcraft

3267
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:40,280
Wednesdays and then on the podcast feed Wednesday night.

3268
02:47:40,280 --> 02:47:41,280
All right.

3269
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:42,560
Anyhow, they don't need to know it's tape Tuesdays.

3270
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:43,560
All right.

3271
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:44,840
So Shane, what are you talking about?

3272
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:46,040
It's not taped on Tuesday.

3273
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,040
That's right.

3274
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:48,400
It's taped really quickly.

3275
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:49,400
Live.

3276
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:50,400
All right.

3277
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:55,100
Shane's been playing guru for me in private messages for Mass Effect so that I actually

3278
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:59,020
will not go to Noveria first.

3279
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:00,020
It's what I do.

3280
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:01,020
All right.

3281
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:02,020
You do too.

3282
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:03,160
What did you want to call on the show about tonight?

3283
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:04,160
Shane?

3284
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,160
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3285
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:06,160
No, wait.

3286
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:07,160
I don't want to hear what you have to say.

3287
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:08,160
I want to talk about your corgi.

3288
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:10,160
I want to talk about your corgi.

3289
02:48:10,160 --> 02:48:11,160
Yes.

3290
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:14,140
My corgi that I will have this weekend.

3291
02:48:14,140 --> 02:48:16,220
So he's not your corgi yet.

3292
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:17,760
He's my corgi.

3293
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,720
You put a deposit down on the corgi.

3294
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,720
Yes.

3295
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:25,120
Because that specific one that I showed you a picture of the corgi can exactly help you

3296
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:26,120
recover from surgery.

3297
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:29,760
In fact, that might make things worse.

3298
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:30,760
Hopefully but I don't care.

3299
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:33,280
I'm going to share with everyone what I shared with Shane earlier.

3300
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:34,280
What?

3301
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:35,280
You know what corgi means?

3302
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:36,840
Sheepdog in Welsh.

3303
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:37,840
So you're getting a sheep.

3304
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:38,840
Wait a minute.

3305
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:39,840
But you're afraid of sheep.

3306
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:41,680
Then it will run it away clearly.

3307
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:44,600
That's what sheepdogs before they heard sheep.

3308
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,600
Away from me.

3309
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:46,600
Yes.

3310
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:47,600
All right.

3311
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:48,600
Fair enough.

3312
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:49,600
All right.

3313
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,600
What?

3314
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:51,600
Okay.

3315
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:52,600
Now I'll hear what you have to say.

3316
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:53,600
What did you, what did you really want to call in about tonight?

3317
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:58,240
I just wanted to gloat because clearly I won that list list from a couple of weeks ago.

3318
02:48:58,240 --> 02:48:59,240
What makes you say that?

3319
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:02,200
It's a segment of the show where we come up with a definitive list.

3320
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:03,200
Yes.

3321
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,200
Yeah.

3322
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:09,360
And we had to say what we wanted on Wii U and of everything we all said, me talking

3323
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:13,280
about Mass Effect was the only thing that came true.

3324
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:15,640
Well congratulations, Shane.

3325
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:17,920
You get a no prize.

3326
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:18,920
Yeah.

3327
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:19,920
You get a new version of Mass Effect.

3328
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:20,920
I know.

3329
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:24,120
Shane can have a raspberry.

3330
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:28,520
I can someday give you a free piece of loot on voggenetwork.com.

3331
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:29,520
How's that sound?

3332
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:30,520
No.

3333
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:31,520
I want something worth something.

3334
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:32,520
Hey now.

3335
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:36,880
Hey now don't devalue the loot at voggenetwork.com.

3336
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:41,160
I can't sell it or make money off of it.

3337
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:46,360
You can soon post it on your profile like you're supposed to be able to do in home.

3338
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:47,360
What have a profile?

3339
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:48,360
Yeah.

3340
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:52,360
You can have one night alone with Kayden.

3341
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:53,360
How about that?

3342
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:57,640
I don't know.

3343
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:04,080
You're like, just one.

3344
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:10,100
What if they decide in Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U, they're just going to not have Kayden

3345
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:12,960
in it because they're just going to say, you know what, we're going to just go with this

3346
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:14,840
storyline from the first game.

3347
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:18,840
What if, because it's on Nintendo console, they cut out all the sex scenes?

3348
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:24,520
Oh, oh, I don't know if I could get it then.

3349
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:27,320
I'm still waiting for the Garrisnookie, so.

3350
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:29,280
You have to wait till, well I should just go.

3351
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:30,280
I know.

3352
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:31,280
It's in the second one.

3353
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:32,280
I know.

3354
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:33,280
All right.

3355
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:36,680
So in the first one I've decided that I am going to bang the hell out of Kayden.

3356
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:38,240
Just out of support for Shayne.

3357
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:39,240
Good.

3358
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:40,240
Thank you.

3359
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:41,240
What?

3360
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:42,240
That's the right way to play the game.

3361
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:43,240
Because Ashley's a bitch.

3362
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:44,240
Yes.

3363
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:45,240
Oh, I've taught you well.

3364
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:46,240
I don't like her.

3365
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:53,320
I like Tali, but she's kind of dumb.

3366
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:59,440
The other thing I was calling in about, because I care, so other people should care.

3367
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:04,980
The new DJ Maxx game on Vita, while it doesn't have a release date, I guess Pentavision confirmed

3368
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:08,760
that there will be a collector's edition in America.

3369
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:14,960
And they announced three of the licenses already, which are just songs from the previous games.

3370
02:51:14,960 --> 02:51:18,600
But it's still something important because we actually get a real honest to goodness

3371
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:20,600
K-pop license.

3372
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:21,600
That's cool.

3373
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:26,760
What bands are we expecting to see under the...

3374
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:32,460
Right now we've only got a K-pop group called Cara, I don't know how to say it, with their

3375
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:34,800
song Step from Technica.

3376
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:41,120
And then a guy named Mr. Funky, who does a lot of music for the later DJ Maxx games with

3377
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:47,740
Rockstar and Signalize by Paul Bazuka, who again does a lot of music for the later games.

3378
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:51,240
But what's interesting is that I don't know where Step is from.

3379
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:57,400
I know it's from a Technica game, but Rockstar and Signalize are both from the latest Technica

3380
02:51:57,400 --> 02:51:59,560
game that came out, Technica 3.

3381
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:05,880
So we might see more transplants from current music instead of stuff from way back when.

3382
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:09,000
And that makes me happy.

3383
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:12,120
That sounds like it would be worthy, I believe.

3384
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,120
Yes.

3385
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:16,840
I just need to know how many hundreds of dollars I'm going to spend on this collector's edition,

3386
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:18,680
because that will happen.

3387
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:23,200
It'll probably only be like $10 or $20 more than retail.

3388
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:24,200
Yeah, probably.

3389
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:28,080
And it won't come with anything that's worth anything, like they haven't in a while.

3390
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:36,280
I used to get awesome puzzles and face masks, and in the last one I got a CD and a crappy

3391
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:37,440
book.

3392
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:40,200
So it might not actually be worth it, I'll just download the game instead.

3393
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:43,960
All right, Shane, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

3394
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:45,280
Whatever, that's fine.

3395
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:47,360
All right, talk to you later in the week.

3396
02:52:47,360 --> 02:52:48,360
Okay.

3397
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:49,360
Happy surgery.

3398
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:50,360
Thank you.

3399
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:51,360
Bye.

3400
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,360
Bye.

3401
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:55,960
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3402
02:52:55,960 --> 02:52:56,960
Sorry about that, guys.

3403
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:59,800
We just had Bugmageddon here in the studio.

3404
02:52:59,800 --> 02:53:01,760
I don't know why, like tons of bugs.

3405
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:03,720
They just love the light.

3406
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:07,960
And Alan's trying to do laundry outside and had to run in, and all the bugs followed him.

3407
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:08,960
It's gross.

3408
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:09,960
Raid everywhere.

3409
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:15,160
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3410
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:17,040
Are you ready for last minute stories now, Loki?

3411
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:18,440
You just have one thing.

3412
02:53:18,440 --> 02:53:19,440
All right, that's fine.

3413
02:53:19,440 --> 02:53:20,440
I'll go to tweets after that.

3414
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:21,440
All right.

3415
02:53:21,440 --> 02:53:26,440
So there is a new Kickstarter for a sword fighting game called Klang.

3416
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:30,680
And you know, it's always good to have a good video to, you know, get people interested

3417
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:32,400
about your property.

3418
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:36,520
Well, they got Gabe Newell in there.

3419
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:41,860
Apparently, he is quite handy with blacksmithing.

3420
02:53:41,860 --> 02:53:45,840
And so of course, he was in there to poke fun at the fact that Half-Life 3 is not out

3421
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,400
and he was a jerk.

3422
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:49,120
He was forging a new crowbar.

3423
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,120
All right.

3424
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:51,120
Let me go to the phones.

3425
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:52,120
We had another call on the line.

3426
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:53,120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3427
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:54,120
Who's this?

3428
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:56,120
Chugga chugga choo choo, motherfuckers.

3429
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:57,120
It's Jim Sally.

3430
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:58,120
Hey, hey.

3431
02:53:58,120 --> 02:54:00,080
Hey, and you can say that word on this show.

3432
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:01,080
I'm sorry.

3433
02:54:01,080 --> 02:54:02,080
You know that, right, man?

3434
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:06,040
I'm so sick of being held back on Bobby's show.

3435
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:08,880
Hey, he's just taking the Nintendo approach.

3436
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:09,880
It's all right.

3437
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:10,880
Oh, fuck.

3438
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:11,880
I love this.

3439
02:54:11,880 --> 02:54:14,880
You guys, I love this new Nintendo approach with moderating everyone's shit.

3440
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:19,880
I don't, I don't, listen, I know most people are complaining about this bullshit that they're

3441
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:22,360
going to monitor everything before you post it up or whatever.

3442
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:24,720
I'm thinking cha-ching, cha-ching, motherfuckers.

3443
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:25,960
I just sent my resume off.

3444
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:29,800
I could, I could probably weed through that shit at home all day.

3445
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:35,000
Maybe there will actually be some type of like Nintendo reality show where people audition

3446
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:38,080
to be one of the moderators and they'll call it The Moderator.

3447
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:40,640
Oh, that's a genius idea.

3448
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:42,200
And it'll be on the Nintendo network.

3449
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:46,400
It sounds like, it sounds like something a Japanese company would do for sure.

3450
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:47,400
And you could compete.

3451
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:49,160
Fucking right I can.

3452
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:51,640
I mean, friggin' right I can.

3453
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:52,640
All right.

3454
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,920
So what, no, really, what are your thoughts on E3 this week, Jim Salley?

3455
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,040
It was all next to nothing.

3456
02:54:58,040 --> 02:55:02,360
Like, every time I watch E3, I'm just, I don't want to say I'm depressed afterwards, but

3457
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:05,960
like, I feel like I was let down the last couple of years.

3458
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:08,320
You wouldn't say you're depressed because you look for the cyanide?

3459
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:11,480
No, I didn't, no, I didn't make the Kool-Aid.

3460
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:15,760
I didn't make Kool-Aid with Vocky in it, because I thought we were going to get some crazy

3461
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:19,960
shit to see, but nope, we didn't get nothing.

3462
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:22,600
Wii U is pretty weird though, it's strange.

3463
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:25,080
What about the stuff that everybody's going crazy about?

3464
02:55:25,080 --> 02:55:28,160
What about the Watch Dogs and the Beyond Two Swords?

3465
02:55:28,160 --> 02:55:35,080
Ah, that's all garbage to Jim Salley, listen, if it's not, if it's not Halo 4, it's everything

3466
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,080
else.

3467
02:55:36,080 --> 02:55:37,080
That's all I'm going to say.

3468
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:38,720
So you're a Halo 4 fan?

3469
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:40,400
Who doesn't love, who isn't a Halo game?

3470
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:42,040
Who doesn't love Halo?

3471
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:48,840
Well, I have fallen out of love with Halo a bit since all the stuff after 3, but I will

3472
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:51,760
say Halo 4 looks pretty darn interesting.

3473
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:54,840
What do you think kind of about the different look, it has kind of a different look to it,

3474
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,560
what do you think of it?

3475
02:55:56,560 --> 02:56:00,920
I think it's about time we changed it up a little bit anyway, I was getting kind of drab

3476
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:05,360
before, almost like redundant before, so we're not changing up a little bit.

3477
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:10,200
I'm really concerned though with the online, I wonder how well they'll do, because Bungie

3478
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:11,200
kind of babied us.

3479
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:13,200
They did it right for a long time.

3480
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:16,280
So do you think the change in studio was a good thing?

3481
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:20,520
Ah, yeah, because to be honest with you, I don't think Bungie could keep it up, they

3482
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:24,600
said it themselves, that they were getting kind of sick of, not honestly sick, but they

3483
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:29,080
were getting kind of bored with doing Halo, right, and if they're not going to have that

3484
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:33,440
same drive to build the great Halos like they did in the past, then it is time to pass the

3485
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:36,000
torch on to someone new.

3486
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:40,400
And I can agree with that, I mean, especially, it actually has to do with I think anything

3487
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:43,400
that one is working on, if you don't have the enthusiasm, it's going to show in the

3488
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,400
end product.

3489
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:49,280
Exactly, right, which is why we see a lot of Obsidian games, when they're just, they

3490
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:52,160
know they're only getting the sequel, right, they just pump it out as quick as they can,

3491
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:55,040
because they just need to get their money and they want to be done with it, they don't

3492
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,040
care, they want to move on.

3493
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:58,040
Yeah.

3494
02:56:58,040 --> 02:57:00,840
It's sad, it was an error though, man.

3495
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:04,560
So what else does the Jim Sally train want to share with us tonight here on OLR?

3496
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:06,520
Is Loki there, or is he eating pizza right now?

3497
02:57:06,520 --> 02:57:07,520
I'm right here.

3498
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:13,560
Listen, I'm really ashamed of myself, I'm going to admit this to you, but I've been

3499
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:20,680
at the very last mission of Grand Theft Auto IV for about a year, and I can't fly a fucking

3500
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:22,280
helicopter to save my life.

3501
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:25,200
That's alright, their controls are kind of terrible.

3502
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,920
Is there like a cheat though, or something I can do, like, it's got to be some sort of

3503
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:29,920
a cheat.

3504
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:31,280
To control the helicopter better?

3505
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:35,920
I don't know, like a helicopter doesn't die mode or something?

3506
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:42,760
Well you can put in your god mode code and just bring up your phone, and then when you

3507
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:51,800
have the phone up, you can just keep hitting the health, it's the GTA555-0100 is the number,

3508
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:56,320
and then basically you just keep hitting that and you'll keep replenishing the health on

3509
02:57:56,320 --> 02:57:57,880
the helicopter.

3510
02:57:57,880 --> 02:58:06,240
Really though, it's difficult to keep shooting down the bad guy in the game.

3511
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:10,360
So really my best bet is to go get a kid from the elementary school to come over and just

3512
02:58:10,360 --> 02:58:11,360
do it for me?

3513
02:58:11,360 --> 02:58:18,680
Yeah, you could do that, or I mean, you can hack it even further, but it's probably just

3514
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:22,520
easier just to use that cheat code if that's the way you want to go.

3515
02:58:22,520 --> 02:58:24,520
But I have to type that in as I'm falling to my death?

3516
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:28,680
No, no, you just type it into your phone beforehand so you have that cheat up, and then you bring

3517
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:33,720
it up on your cheats menu in the phone, and then you can just keep hitting A over and

3518
02:58:33,720 --> 02:58:39,800
over or X or whatever, and each time you hit it, it'll recover the health in your helicopter,

3519
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:45,600
or you can just wait until your helicopter starts smoking or whatever, and it'll replenish

3520
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:49,640
the health on the helicopter.

3521
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:53,720
You're my best friend, Loki.

3522
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:54,720
There you go.

3523
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:57,720
Friends are made, and now you have something to do right after the show.

3524
02:58:57,720 --> 02:58:58,720
Right after the show, baby!

3525
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,720
It's time to go finish.

3526
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:00,720
GTA 5-5-5!

3527
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,720
All right.

3528
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:05,320
Jim, Sally, I gotta let you go so we can get into some more calls, but thanks so much for

3529
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:06,320
stopping in tonight.

3530
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:07,320
Okay, man.

3531
02:59:07,320 --> 02:59:09,520
I just want to dedicate this call to my buddy Birdman.

3532
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:13,120
Listen, Bird, if you've been drinking too much and I gotta call your brother to come

3533
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:17,960
over and take you home at the party, then maybe you've had too many beers, Birdy, or

3534
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:19,520
not enough.

3535
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:20,520
And don't drink and drive, ever.

3536
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:21,520
Don't drink and drive.

3537
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:22,520
That's why I called your brother.

3538
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:24,120
You drunk fuck, Bird.

3539
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:25,120
Jesus Christ, man.

3540
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:26,120
All right, Birdman.

3541
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:28,520
Don't drive your car to my house and drink a six-pack of beers.

3542
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:29,520
Get the fuck out of here, Bird.

3543
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:30,520
Go with your brother.

3544
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:31,520
I love you, Sky.

3545
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:32,520
All right.

3546
02:59:32,520 --> 02:59:33,520
Love you, too.

3547
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:34,520
Take care.

3548
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:35,520
All right, thanks.

3549
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:36,520
Thanks, Loki.

3550
02:59:36,520 --> 02:59:37,520
No problem.

3551
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:38,520
Oh, I see how it is.

3552
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:42,520
I was gonna say bye, Darkie, but I guess not now.

3553
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:43,520
Aww.

3554
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:44,520
Heart.

3555
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:45,520
Bye, sweet Darkie.

3556
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:46,520
Heart face.

3557
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:47,520
Little bum.

3558
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:48,520
I made the little bum thing for you.

3559
02:59:48,520 --> 02:59:49,520
Making duck face.

3560
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:50,520
With the three.

3561
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:51,520
With the number three.

3562
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:52,520
I'm hanging up now.

3563
02:59:52,520 --> 02:59:53,520
Bye, Jim Sally.

3564
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:59,520
Everybody look at my bum.

3565
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:01,520
That was a great note to end on.

3566
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:02,520
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3567
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:07,120
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3568
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:10,520
If you think you can follow that call, good luck to you.

3569
03:00:10,520 --> 03:00:15,020
Meanwhile, I'm gonna try to do Twitter topics here.

3570
03:00:15,020 --> 03:00:18,520
Every time I've done it, though, I've been derailed, though, but we'll go to a couple

3571
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:19,520
tweets here.

3572
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:27,520
TigerClaw305 sent us a tweet about Nexon pays $685 million for 14.7% of NCSoft.

3573
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:28,520
NCSoft.

3574
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:30,520
They've made games like Guild Wars.

3575
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:31,520
I know it's one of their big titles.

3576
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:32,520
Ion.

3577
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:34,520
They've done a couple other MMOs as well.

3578
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:38,520
They are now the largest shareholder in NCSoft.

3579
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:40,520
So, there you go.

3580
03:00:40,520 --> 03:00:41,520
Very cool.

3581
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:46,520
That's part of a two-year agreement between these two South Korean gaming companies.

3582
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:51,520
So, we'll see what is born of that partnership later on.

3583
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:58,520
TigerClaw sent us another tweet about Kojima seeing social and core games converging together.

3584
03:00:58,520 --> 03:01:01,520
And this is kind of some of what you saw in some of Nintendo's presentation.

3585
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:03,520
That's what Kojima said.

3586
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:06,520
In an interview with CVG, he said, quote,

3587
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:09,520
I don't think social and core games are separate.

3588
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:14,520
Both will evolve together, and at some point, I feel the social side of things will converge

3589
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:15,520
with the core gamers.

3590
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:21,520
I think in the future, maybe Metal Gear will change in certain ways to integrate social aspects.

3591
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:25,520
If you look at other games on the market now, you can see it's already happening.

3592
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:28,520
So, Metal Gear may at some point get involved.

3593
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:30,520
How do you guys feel about that?

3594
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:34,520
Do you think he's onto something there, or do you think maybe too far?

3595
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:36,520
Casual Metal Gear game?

3596
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:38,520
Yeah, I don't know about that.

3597
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:40,520
That's very interesting.

3598
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:48,520
I mean, I thought what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network did was already kind of social,

3599
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:51,520
and not that it's always showing the best parts of society.

3600
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,520
But, you know, I kind of thought that was the social gaming.

3601
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:58,520
Because what used to be social gaming arcades.

3602
03:01:58,520 --> 03:02:01,520
And look what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network has done to arcades.

3603
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:03,520
I don't know.

3604
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:07,520
I don't think, I mean, when I hear this, I think Facebook games.

3605
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:10,520
And there's very few Facebook games I get excited about.

3606
03:02:10,520 --> 03:02:11,520
Very, very few.

3607
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:14,520
Although, I will say, you don't know Jack is pretty fucking awesome on Facebook.

3608
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:16,520
Just saying.

3609
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:18,520
Hmm.

3610
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:20,520
I've derailed the chat room, and this is epic.

3611
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:23,520
We're talking about Filipino food now.

3612
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:28,520
One more call, or one more, time for one more call, and I'll get to one more tweet here.

3613
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:33,520
1877 game OLR again, or a username on Skype is orangeonsradiolastcall for calls.

3614
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:36,520
Meanwhile, we got one more tweet here from actdeft.

3615
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:41,520
The Nubuo Summer Bundle Kickstarter.

3616
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,520
So it's a Kickstarter that he's linked us to.

3617
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:46,520
It's music inspired by video games.

3618
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:47,520
And it's a Kickstarter.

3619
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:50,520
They're trying to raise $8,000.

3620
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:51,520
And why are they doing this?

3621
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:56,520
Well, they're trying to do video game music information in English and Japanese.

3622
03:02:56,520 --> 03:03:01,520
A two-CD original and arranged soundtrack album for the browser game Rokochan.

3623
03:03:01,520 --> 03:03:03,520
And doing some different design work there.

3624
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:07,520
Proceeds of the Kickstarter will benefit the bundle's eight participating musicians.

3625
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:10,520
And will be the first source of funding for the Rokochan team.

3626
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:16,520
So I guess it's kind of like a little bit of a startup company here slash get a cool little soundtrack album.

3627
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:19,520
I will say this though, some of the albums that are included in this,

3628
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:26,520
Super Meat Boy Choice Piano Cuts, Splatterhouse Volume 1 Volume 2, and Splatterhouse Butchered.

3629
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:29,520
So if you're a Splatterhouse fan, also in there in the arranged pack,

3630
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:34,520
Looks like our friend Mega Ran who was on the show a few weeks ago is involved there with Black Materia the remixes.

3631
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:36,520
As well as some stuff by Metroid Metal.

3632
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:38,520
So those are some groups you should know of.

3633
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:43,520
So go onto Kickstarter and search for N-U-B-U-W-O.

3634
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:45,520
Nubwo.

3635
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:46,520
There it is.

3636
03:03:46,520 --> 03:03:48,520
That's it for tweets.

3637
03:03:48,520 --> 03:03:49,520
The phone ain't going off.

3638
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:52,520
So I'm thinking the show's about over.

3639
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:56,520
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight to our little program.

3640
03:03:56,520 --> 03:04:02,520
We really appreciate you guys tuning in every week and supporting independent podcasting.

3641
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:03,520
We really appreciate your support.

3642
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:10,520
Again, if you like what you hear, leave us a nice review on iTunes or whatever pod software site you use to get this.

3643
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:11,520
There's a new one now.

3644
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:12,520
There's Stitcher Radio.

3645
03:04:12,520 --> 03:04:17,520
If you don't download podcasts directly to your device, there's an app in the App Store.

3646
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:20,520
And it's also, it's iOS and it's Android called Stitcher Radio.

3647
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:23,520
And you can give us thumbs up and likes and stuff.

3648
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:25,520
And there actually is like a chart that ranks shows.

3649
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:28,520
And I think last I looked, we were number 40 or something in games.

3650
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:30,520
And we can go a little higher, right?

3651
03:04:30,520 --> 03:04:32,520
Give us some thumbs up.

3652
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:33,520
Stitcher's free.

3653
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:34,520
So go get it.

3654
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:35,520
Give us some thumbs up.

3655
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:36,520
It's on the web too.

3656
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:40,520
I'll have to get the link for the website or Tiger Claw will beat me to it in about five seconds here.

3657
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:43,520
We could definitely use your thumbs up and your likes over there on Stitcher Radio.

3658
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:45,520
We'd really appreciate that.

3659
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:46,520
Or just tell a friend.

3660
03:04:46,520 --> 03:04:52,520
Word of mouth is how we spread the good word of Orange Launch Radio and grow the O.L. Army.

3661
03:04:52,520 --> 03:04:56,520
Before we conclude tonight, though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3662
03:04:56,520 --> 03:04:58,520
Dark Sakura, we'll start you tonight. Ladies first.

3663
03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:00,520
I'm changing the fortune cookie.

3664
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:01,520
You can't do that.

3665
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:02,520
Yes, I can.

3666
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:04,520
Alright, fine. You can change the fortune cookie.

3667
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:06,520
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3668
03:05:06,520 --> 03:05:09,520
I have to get off Kickstarter. It's dangerous.

3669
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:11,520
Spending too much money?

3670
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:14,520
Well, no, I've been luckily not spending too much money.

3671
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:17,520
But I'll talk to you out there about stuff.

3672
03:05:17,520 --> 03:05:22,520
I don't know. I've just seen some of these ideas that people come up with.

3673
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:23,520
It's just like, really?

3674
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:25,520
No, we're not doing a Kickstarter.

3675
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:27,520
No, no, no, no, no.

3676
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:28,520
Not at all.

3677
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:29,520
Alright.

3678
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:31,520
Not at all. There's definitely no one I'm getting at.

3679
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:32,520
Alright.

3680
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:40,520
My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to eating what's in that crock pot right over there in the corner of the room.

3681
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:47,520
And all those bugs can go die of raid poisoning. Stupid bugs.

3682
03:05:47,520 --> 03:05:50,520
That's it. We're done. We're out of here.

3683
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:53,520
Thank you everybody so much for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

3684
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:55,520
And we'll see you again next week.

3685
03:05:55,520 --> 03:05:59,520
We didn't mention it all tonight, surprisingly, just because E3 has kind of dominated everything.

3686
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:06,520
But I will mention now, we are two weeks away from the ten year Orange Lounge Radio anniversary show.

3687
03:06:06,520 --> 03:06:07,520
If you can believe it.

3688
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:08,520
That's a long time.

3689
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:10,520
Two weeks away.

3690
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:12,520
Are you going to be here?

3691
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:13,520
Yeah, I'll be here.

3692
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:15,520
Okay, there was a week you weren't going to be here.

3693
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:16,520
That was supposed to be this week.

3694
03:06:16,520 --> 03:06:17,520
Oh, but you made it anyway.

3695
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,520
Yeah.

3696
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:19,520
Oh, hooray.

3697
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:20,520
Alright, great.

3698
03:06:20,520 --> 03:06:21,520
So are you really giving me the webcam?

3699
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:24,520
Yes, I'm giving you the, well technically that was from Akuma JP.

3700
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:27,520
So Akuma JP gave you, then gave me, then gave you back the webcam.

3701
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:28,520
Cool.

3702
03:06:28,520 --> 03:06:29,520
Alright.

3703
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:31,520
That's it. We're done. We're out of here.

3704
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:32,520
Have a great night everybody.

3705
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:35,520
Thanks for staying up late with us or listening to us at work or whatever it is.

3706
03:06:35,520 --> 03:06:36,520
Just can't thank you guys enough.

3707
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:37,520
We'll see you next week.

3708
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:41,520
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3709
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:46,520
