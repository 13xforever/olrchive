00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,080
Tonight, June 3, 2012, rumored new Wii U functionality is revealed, details emerge on the next Skyrim

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:31,640
expansion, and Apple answers rumors about an Apple console.

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,360
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,640
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,760
First off, the one, the only, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,400
Yo, dog, what up?

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,880
How you doin'?

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,120
Um, I'm full of curry.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,520
Hurry hurry hurry, get your rice and curry.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
It was really good.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,480
It was Thai, not Indian, thank you.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,800
Nerds out there will know that song.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Hi.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
How are you doing, Loki?

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm doing fine.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Alright.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Now, tonight's a little bit different of a show.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,080
Usually I would introduce our chat room at vognetwork.com, but unfortunately we, well,

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,480
I mean, fortunately and unfortunately we are taping in advance of Sunday night, so if you're

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,660
listening to this live on Sunday night at the VOG Network, congrats, you're hearing the

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,080
premiere of this episode, but we're actually taping here on Thursday, May the 31st.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,200
So a little disclaimer before we get into the news too much tonight, especially with

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,480
all the E3 stuff starting to come out, things may have changed between the night we taped

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,800
this and the night you guys hear it.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,280
Why did we do that this week?

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
Well, as I mentioned on last week's show, I'm going to be out of town, therefore the

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
OLR studio will be closed that night and Loki really wants a night to sit at home and play

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,800
Minecraft all night uninterrupted.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Well, it's not uninterrupted, but it'll be longer than a few hours.

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
There you go.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,960
So Minecraft all day Sunday.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,280
My God, it's getting bad.

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,280
You were telling me before the show, just now you've cheated even worse in Minecraft

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
360, right?

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
I wouldn't even really consider it cheating.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Exploiting, stretching the limits of the rules.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
It is cheating, but I mean, really when you think about it, it's just, I've basically

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
enabled God mode.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,760
I've rigged it so that the health is so high that I don't die, but it's really, it's for

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,440
the poor programming of the game because like for example, the future updates and stuff,

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,120
when you're digging underground, you know, if there's lava, you know, one brick away

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,920
from where you're digging, you don't in this game.

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,880
So you're digging all of a sudden, Oh crap, lava killing me.

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,920
Yeah, the first tip I got about playing Minecraft is never dig straight down.

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,640
Well, I wasn't digging straight down.

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,520
I was digging straight forward and then all of a sudden I hit a block and lava flow dead.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
I was like, thanks.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,280
All right.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,600
Anyhow, we'll talk more about our gaming weeks in a little bit, but first, as I mentioned,

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,920
we are getting into E3 week.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,760
Finally it's uh, it's here a little strange E3 for us here at orange launch radio this

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
year.

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,040
And you know, as I'm sure a lot of you guys know, E3 kind of scaled back on the amount

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,480
of people they invite and OLR is not exactly on the guest list anymore.

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,880
So um, you know, we're just trying to make the best of it and uh, I'm going to Disneyland

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
instead.

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
LOL.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Uh, but I think a Loki dark soccer, you guys may or may not be watching it at home.

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Loki, you still took the time off from work, so you kind of watch it, right?

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,200
I didn't take any time off work, but I'll still be watching it.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,640
But technically it's related to your job so you can kind of get away with it.

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And because I'm awesome like that.

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,120
I kind of think that my work is more interesting.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,360
Well, this year especially, you know, I, I'm, I'm feeling a little eh about E3 this year.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
I mean, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and to go into it with low expectations is

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
probably a good place to be.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,600
But you know, um, I think Bobby put it best, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, the man who you

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
hear before us on Sunday nights at VOG network.

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,180
Um, he said, you know, if I had to miss my first E3 in, I think he said it was 16 years

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,180
I think.

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
15, 16 years.

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,680
I probably got that wrong.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Um, it, this is probably a good one to miss.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,800
Why do you think the bar is so low this year?

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,320
I mean, we do have a new, I mean, everybody's saying, well, there's no new consoles.

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Well, there is.

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,560
I mean, there is the Wii U.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,880
I mean, is, is excitement really that low about Wii U or what?

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,400
I don't think the Wii U is doing enough different to make it like, Ooh, wow.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
It's not like the graphics are like, Whoa, that much better.

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,640
Or you know, Whoa, this is a totally new technology, you know, way of controlling things.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,200
It's basically, Hey, look, we took, we made a big DS minus other minus a D.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,480
But isn't this a good place for Nintendo to be though?

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,540
I mean, I know that sounds really weird.

88
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,300
Like you, you know, nobody likes the negative buzz and obviously E3 kind of left them with

89
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,740
a very meh feeling, a lot of people walking out of the Wii U, but I mean, when the bar

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,280
is low, they really have the potential to exceed expectations.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
True.

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,880
And well, with what they're doing right now, the technology seems to be more familiar to

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
the developers.

94
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,640
So they're able to port stuff over that, you know, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are getting.

95
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,920
I don't know how that's going to look when the new systems come out, but you know, that's

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
still a ways off.

97
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,720
For a whole year, they'll be on the cutting edge.

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,880
And even still, you know, even those new systems, you remember the very first, you know, games

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,100
are coming out in the, you know, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 just kind of look like

100
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:37,160
a Brezzed PlayStation 2 and Xbox games, so it's not always, you know, the biggest, best

101
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,720
looking, well definitely never the best looking games at launch, it's just, you know, ways

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
after that.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
All right.

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,680
So quickly, I know we kind of talked about this a little more in depth a couple weeks

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,240
ago, so I don't want to dwell on this topic too long, but since this is our last chance

106
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,860
before E3 officially hits and the press conferences start, what are your final predictions out

107
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
of E3?

108
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,760
One prediction each for the big three.

109
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,200
What are your final big predictions out of E3?

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Loki?

111
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Or Dark Sakura?

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,480
Um, that I'll be asleep when they're made.

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,560
Do you, well let me ask you, Darkside, do you have any interest in Wii U at all?

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Not really.

115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Why not?

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I don't know.

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,280
I mean, really, I'm just, my apathy is kind of overwhelming about it because I'm, I mean,

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,660
we'll probably get one, I guess.

119
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:34,220
It's just, I'm really getting to the point that a lot of big hype about stuff just makes

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,080
me not care.

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
I don't, I don't want to speculate.

122
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,080
I just want to see it when it's out.

123
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Because when you say you're apathetic and you don't care, it makes me think that Nintendo's

124
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,140
just not doing anything to excite you, that there's nothing that's happening there that

125
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,360
you go, oh, this is new and fascinating.

126
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,660
They're really not.

127
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,900
The technology isn't anything new.

128
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,480
We've got touchscreen stuff.

129
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
We've got tablets.

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,920
You know, using a tablet, they've had that interactivity from a handheld before when

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,680
they had the game link with the GBA.

132
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,880
So it's nothing really new.

133
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,280
It's them just saying, oh, well, we're making a part of the Wii now.

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm not really excited about it.

135
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,920
I don't, I'm not going to be excited until I actually sit down and see it.

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,600
And granted, I feel somewhat similar, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

137
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm really hoping there's that one game that I've got to have, but we'll see.

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,460
Loki, predictions for the big three?

139
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,360
I don't really know what Nintendo's, just based on what they've rumored to be coming

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,840
out in the new Mario game, New Super Mario Bros. me, which I think is what it's supposed

141
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
to be.

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,720
I was just like, I'm, seriously, that does not appeal to me at all.

143
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
New Super Mario Bros. didn't ever appeal to me.

144
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I mean, I understand.

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,240
Well, one of the DS was pretty cool, and then the Wii one came out, and then number two's

146
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,480
coming out, and they all look the same.

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,680
It's just, I don't care.

148
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,420
I wish, I don't know, I wish it would do something innovative, like take one of those franchises

149
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,680
like Mario or Zelda and do like a little big planet thing with it.

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,240
You know, have this fucking amazing level editor with it and just, you could even make

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,440
it like an old, you know, the 16-bit Zelda, like do that, re-release that and have this

152
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,840
fucking amazing level editor where you can share it online and stuff like that.

153
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm gonna bring you back, because this isn't a prediction, this is wank.

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,440
This is what you want to see, this isn't what you're gonna see.

155
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm prepared to be completely underwhelmed by Nintendo, that's my prediction, that they'll

156
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,960
talk about all this wonderful stuff that the Wii U can do, and it'll be just these stupid

157
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,680
games that, hey look, it's WWE 13, but with this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Darksiders

158
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,560
2, but this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Batman Arkham City that came out last year,

159
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,840
but it has this extra feature.

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't fucking care, that's not gonna make me, I'm not buying another console because

161
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,200
it has a cool gimmick.

162
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,120
I mean, I want something that's gonna be a little bit different.

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
The Wii was very different than what was out there on the market, that's why I was interested

164
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,320
in it, and it was completely boring later on, because there was nothing really good

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
for it.

166
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,560
Nothing I really needed to have.

167
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,320
How about Microsoft and Sony?

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,180
Microsoft, I'm waiting for a lot of announcements from them, because they really don't know

169
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,200
a whole ton of what's coming out, and obviously they're gonna talk about the new Gears of

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,740
War game, which really don't care about that.

171
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm hoping we'll see, they'll probably announce their TV thing, the whole initiative where

172
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,720
they're gonna have some sort of IPTV, that'd be kinda nice, because all these little apps

173
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,920
that they have that are tied to your cable, hey you can have the Xfinity app, oh but you

174
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,480
have to have Xfinity in order to actually view any of the content on there, well fuck,

175
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,200
you know what, I can do that on my PC, why do I need your stupid app?

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,320
It's very useless for me.

177
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,760
If it's something like, hey you pay for Xbox Live and you get TV content with that, awesome,

178
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,040
cool then I don't have to pay for cable, of course cable doesn't want you to do that,

179
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
but we'll see.

180
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,400
And then for PlayStation, Sony, I mean, I don't know, it's really, it kinda, it's going

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,440
back to what we were saying before, it's very meh, there's nothing I'm really expecting,

182
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,680
that's the thing, it's nothing like, oh I can't wait to hear about this, I just don't

183
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,560
think anything's gonna happen, I mean, I would like to, I'm predicting that they'll talk

184
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,840
about new Vita titles, because I gotta tell you right now, the two that I was looking

185
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:55,360
forward to, Resistance and Gravity Rush, Resistance apparently is pretty terrible, and that's

186
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
not good, Gravity Rush I hear is kind of okay, there's a demo out for Gravity Rush, there's

187
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
a demo out for both, but I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet, but I hear, I mean

188
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
I hear it's okay, but it's not like, woo, gotta have that, Resistance was one of those

189
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
things, I was like, ooh, first person shooter, that might be really cool, and then here it's

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,920
just kinda meh, and so, I'm like, well crap, now I have to wait until the fall for some

191
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,720
good games to come out, and we're back to the 3DS again, where it's just like, well

192
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,840
crap, you know, I gotta wait until the fall for some good games to come out, it's like,

193
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,720
am I gonna have to sell this system too?

194
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,560
Alright, I'll go real quick, I think Nintendo, I obviously, is gonna be very heavy on the

195
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,680
Wii U and the 3DS, I, this may just be the fanboy wank in me, but I kinda think they're

196
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,280
gonna drop F-Zero on us, and I'm gonna have to get one, I think that's, I think that's

197
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,080
what's gonna ultimately happen, and I think there'll be something kinda cool where that

198
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,000
little tablet's gonna have like the map, and kinda like the racer's cockpit or something,

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,360
and maybe something like being able to use like power-ups and stuff will be all on the

200
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,400
little touch screen, and then the HD screen will be nothing but gorgeousness, you know,

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,920
and possible fan wank, but I just, there are rumors that that could be the big one that's

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,400
being dropped, so I'm just gonna remain hopeful, I really hope this is Nintendo's chance to

203
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,680
finally prove that they get online, and I think they are gonna show that they get online

204
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,800
finally, but no more so than say Sony, you know, it's not gonna be like, oh my god, Nintendo's

205
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,000
the must-have online, so I think they'll do about as well as Sony.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Microsoft, I really don't know what they can do to impress me at this point, especially

207
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,560
if they are gonna be hedging their bets on two big first-person shooters, which usually

208
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,360
aren't my kinda game, I don't know what to think.

209
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,920
I wanna see new franchises.

210
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I really do too, and I want something to be on Kinect that's interesting, there was that

211
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,200
whole gladiator game they showed last year that we never really heard anything about

212
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,960
again, and I imagine they're gonna show more of that this year, but I'm not, mmm.

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,360
It's Fable, The Journey is gonna be their big Kinect game, it's not on Rails!

214
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Well, you know what, again, and a great example of where the bar is really effing low, and

215
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,840
here's a chance to blow me away, so maybe, maybe, cause I liked Fable 2.

216
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,600
I don't think there's ever gonna be another good Fable.

217
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
We'll see.

218
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,440
I think only the bet rises and you come out for this console.

219
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
The other thing I wanna say about Microsoft though is I still think Windows 8, I think

220
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
Windows 8 gets dropped at some point during the conference, it's Microsoft's big push

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,560
at the end of the year, as a company, that whole synergy, there's gonna be something

222
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,200
with your Xbox and Windows 8.

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Just wait.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Ooh, fantastic!

225
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Yep.

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Exactly.

227
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,640
I was watching a video of that interface today, and granted, there are things that they've

228
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,840
made improvements to, but that fuckin' Metro desktop is...

229
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,080
That is all optional, right?

230
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,720
I don't have to use that, right?

231
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
I don't know.

232
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Question mark?

233
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Oh boy.

234
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
That replaces the start menu.

235
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Oh boy, alright.

236
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,840
Um, Sony.

237
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,960
You know, Sony is so unpredictable, and yet, I think is really predictable, I mean, obviously

238
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,480
you're gonna have the God of War, you're gonna have probably more hints of the Last Guardian

239
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,960
and the PlayStation fighting game, but at the same time, I feel like last year we thought

240
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,140
we knew everything Sony was gonna do, and they did kinda have a lot of surprises still.

241
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,040
So I have faith that Sony could still shock us with something, but I just, you know, I'm

242
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,200
hoping again it's that game I haven't seen yet.

243
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,160
So I, and I think there will still be, of course, more Vita, and I'm hoping for more

244
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Vita, PlayStation 3 kinda, you know, togetherness.

245
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
So we'll see.

246
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,360
There is that, what was that dungeon crawler game that never ended up coming out with the

247
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Vita's launch?

248
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't remember what it's called now.

249
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Paperware the game?

250
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
No, something...

251
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
I know what you're talking about.

252
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
It's like Diablo, but not...

253
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
They showed that off last year, I imagine more of that.

254
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,840
Well they had, they had the one that was at launch, the Ubisoft title that ties in, I

255
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
think.

256
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
No, no, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

257
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
No, I know what you're talking about, the Sony one.

258
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
I don't remember what the hell it's called.

259
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
It's not Sorcery either.

260
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
No, it's not Sorcery.

261
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
That's the Vita.

262
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
No, I know what you're talking about.

263
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Yeah.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Because they just were talking about like, oh hey, where's that game?

265
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,420
And yeah, I don't know.

266
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,960
But again, I'm hoping it's not just, you know, I mean, again, last year, despite, I think

267
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,560
there was a leak a couple weeks in advance, but otherwise that Twisted Metal game kinda,

268
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
you know, was a surprise.

269
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,560
You know, I'm hoping for some surprises, but we'll, we'll see.

270
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Anyhow.

271
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,700
New franchises.

272
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,200
That's all I'm saying.

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,120
Each one should come out with a new franchise.

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,560
I mean, there's, there's some pretty cool ideas that they have for new franchises, like

275
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,360
remember Cameo, the launch title for the 360?

276
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,820
That was like really cool looking when they showed it off at E3, and it was okay when

277
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,280
it came out, but it could have been a good sequel, huh?

278
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,440
It could have been a good title.

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,520
Like that, that type of game was pretty cool and not something that really the Xbox has

280
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
from Microsoft.

281
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,400
They don't have that type of platforming, like a Ratchet and Clank or something.

282
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,160
They need something like that.

283
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,400
Alrighty I'm gonna move on here and start to get into tonight's news just to kinda wrap

284
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
things up though.

285
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,320
Again, hopefully, hopefully we're all pleasantly surprised.

286
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,160
I know we're feeling kinda eh about this year's E3.

287
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,960
I really hope it gets people buzzed because this Christmas could be quite a disaster for

288
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,320
video games in general if, you know, there's not anything to get excited about.

289
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,640
That could be bad.

290
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Here's one thing though.

291
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,080
If the video game market could live through a recession, I don't know that it's gonna

292
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
have a problem.

293
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Well, but if this year is bad, that could have a real impact on the Sony Microsoft consoles

294
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
next year.

295
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Oh please.

296
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Grand Theft Auto for October.

297
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,640
Please Grand Theft Auto for October.

298
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
We'll see.

299
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
You know, actually, what was that?

300
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,360
The Lego City stories.

301
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
Still wanna hear about that.

302
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,800
That actually would, might sell me a Wii U.

303
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Maybe.

304
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,760
Alright, I'm gonna get into some housekeeping real quick here.

305
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,040
First off, again, I wanna plug the live show even though we're taped tonight.

306
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,000
We will be back next week, June 10th, to talk about everything that happened at E3.

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,120
And that'll be available at vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right

308
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,040
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

309
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,000
Also, by the time you guys hear this, the full vognetwork.com website should have launched.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,740
We had, or we're having, I have to think what tense to use here.

311
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,140
So, since you guys are hearing this Sunday, we had a special on Friday talking about the

312
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,600
future of the network.

313
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,200
I don't wanna repeat it here because it's like 95% ago right now, but there is a chance

314
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
it could be delayed to the 8th.

315
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
We will has had.

316
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,560
Yes, you will has had by this point.

317
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,240
My hope is, though, by the time you guys are hearing this, the full vognetwork.com website

318
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,920
did in fact launch, so check it out, and just, it's gonna be awesome.

319
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,680
There were unicorns and rainbows and- I don't know about unicorns, but there may

320
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,780
be rainbows.

321
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,000
There was definitely a unicorn on the test site, but I think that's being removed for

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,240
the full.

323
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
There were sheep.

324
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
That was interesting.

325
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
There were sheep.

326
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Oh, did you see that?

327
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,520
I saw that.

328
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
That was my graphic design.

329
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,800
There were sheep and men in underwear.

330
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,300
All right, anyhow, vognetwork.com should be live 24-7 now as well, and a full website

331
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
for you guys to see.

332
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
So, that'll be fun.

333
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,920
All right, anyhow, moving on.

334
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,840
Let's talk about the news.

335
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Loki, why don't you start us off?

336
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
And no gaming week?

337
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Oh, shit.

338
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,520
Yeah, we should talk about our gaming weeks, huh?

339
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Dark soccer.

340
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,360
All the E3 talk got me sidetracked.

341
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,240
Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?

342
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
We've only had half a week, too.

343
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,440
I played- actually, Dan got the new Arkham City expansion, the Harley Quinn's Revenge.

344
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,760
Oh, yeah, that looked really neat.

345
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,880
I watched about half of it, and then I had to go to bed, because I had taken NyQuil,

346
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,260
and I was like, ugh.

347
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,460
You play a lot of it as Robin, and as much as I liked Harley Quinn's voice actor, she

348
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,680
gets really annoying after a while, so whatever.

349
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,400
And also, for fans of certain little Easter eggs that were found in the game before, you

350
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
can get pissed off.

351
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
So, just saying.

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,720
Don't get your hopes up, wah.

353
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
I already know exactly what it's got to be.

354
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
All right.

355
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah.

356
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:17,480
So, anyway, I played- I had this really good streak in Fractal, which I love that fucking

357
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
game.

358
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
Fractal is so fun, and I had a really good streak, and then I got pissed off at the game

359
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
again and stopped playing.

360
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,800
So then I played some WoW, and played some Star Trek Online, only to find out that they

361
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:41,660
completely redid your skills, and it's stupid, so I'm like, ugh, I don't have my kickass

362
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
bomb skills anymore.

363
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't you hate that when you leave an MMO and then you come back and they change everything?

364
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah.

365
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,800
But apparently, like, some of the stuff I have, my legacy items, are pretty good, so.

366
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, that's good.

367
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm still an admiral piloting a Defiant.

368
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
Are you still playing with all the Scottish people?

369
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,560
They weren't on, only a couple people were on, and they weren't the Scotsmen.

370
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,960
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

371
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,800
They're apparently all still there, they're just there at weird times.

372
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Probably.

373
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
All right.

374
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I played Minecraft.

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Of course you did!

377
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,840
I played lots of Minecraft.

378
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,320
I built a giant pig.

379
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Oh, God, I saw the pictures on your Twitter.

380
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,080
When you say you built a giant pig, you must have found the pixel layout somewhere online.

381
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,800
There's a guide online.

382
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
Oh my gosh.

383
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,160
I love, it was like a hollow pig.

384
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
You could climb up the ladder.

385
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,720
Yeah, you can climb up the ladder into it.

386
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
It's a house.

387
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
You can live in its butt.

388
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
You can live inside.

389
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
And guess, actually, here's the best part.

390
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,400
It's like the dinosaurs in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

391
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
Remember when they go to watch the sunrise?

392
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,540
You can live in a pig's ass.

393
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,740
You can live inside the pig, and not only that, near its ass, because it's on the inside

394
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,200
of its ass, there's a chest.

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
What's inside the chest?

396
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Pork chops!

397
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Yes!

398
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Yes!

399
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
The pork chops are in there.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Oh, dog, I heard you like pigs, so I put pig in your pig.

401
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Exactly.

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
So you could be a pig.

403
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I don't know.

404
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
I just thought that would be fun.

405
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
What do I want to build next?

406
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I'll build a giant pig.

407
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,880
That thing is scary, because I'll be running through, and then I'll look out the window

408
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
and see this pig.

409
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,360
And it's just like, it's always there, staring at you.

410
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,680
Hey, hey, hey, I have a question for you.

411
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,220
Can you make a slide, because you could totally make a tongue slide for your pig?

412
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,880
You can make a water slide.

413
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
You should make a drooling pig water slide.

414
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,160
Are you going to make a water slide out of its bum, because that's kind of gross.

415
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
No.

416
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,080
Do it in its mouth so it can be the drooling pig.

417
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,280
I thought about making, see, I was going to have that pig, and I was going to have another

418
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,000
pig to re-skin, to make it all evil looking, with glowing eyes and fire, and spikes sticking

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
up.

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Darth Pig!

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Darth Pig!

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink!

423
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,360
It was funny, though, because all the pigs keep wandering around the giant pig.

424
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,200
It's like they're worshipping the idol.

425
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Wow.

426
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,620
All hail our bacony god!

427
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,520
But yeah, and another thing, too, Robson, since we're on the same map.

428
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
If you go to...

429
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,920
You know I started a new map, actually, a long time ago.

430
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
What?!

431
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah, I'm on seed OLR.

432
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm not on seed VoG anymore.

433
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I got sick of VoG.

434
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
But I'm sick of OLR, too.

435
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,240
You need to go back to VoG, because you know why?

436
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,280
Because if you go to the bottom, the southwestern portion of the map, there's this giant hole

437
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,720
that goes straight into the ground with a waterfall in it and stuff, and it's pretty

438
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
awesome inside there.

439
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,460
That's cool.

440
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
You know what you need to do?

441
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,680
You need to put a video on YouTube of your giant pig.

442
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Once I'm done.

443
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Da, da, da, da, da, da!

444
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
Well I'm going to have...

445
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
I've already...

446
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm planning on making a giant rollercoaster ride thing, or possibly...

447
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Oh my god!

448
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,280
They even have water slides that you can make.

449
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,880
You can make a water slide thing with jumps and all this cool stuff.

450
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,800
What has happened just three months ago?

451
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,440
I should go find a clip from this show just three months ago.

452
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Minecraft?

453
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
What the hell?

454
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Why do people play Minecraft?

455
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I don't get this game.

456
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Or just ask Dark Sakura.

457
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Hey, Dark Sakura, what do you think of Minecraft?

458
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah, and then Loki in the meantime, I'm going to make a fucking Minecraft theme park, woo!

459
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
You know what, though?

460
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,860
As soon as somebody either pays for me to have an account or gets it to me for free

461
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
somehow.

462
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Let's play the demo.

463
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
No, I don't like demos.

464
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,120
I'll pay for you to quit complaining.

465
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Hold on, I think I have a dollar.

466
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Hold on.

467
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Here, hold on.

468
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Let me just dig in my pocket.

469
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,560
I'll take that dollar too, and I'll stop complaining for five seconds.

470
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,640
Here, alright, I'm putting one dollar, this is a great radio show, here's my dollar, and

471
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm putting it in the Dark Sakura Quit Your Bitchin' and Buy Minecraft Fund.

472
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
There it is.

473
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
I have a dollar.

474
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Pinkberry!

475
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Here, take your dollar.

476
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I don't want your dirty money.

477
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
No.

478
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,160
That is the most non-Jewish thing you've ever done.

479
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,800
Remember back when I popped up the volume, and the little thing said, give me a dollar?

480
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,640
People did send me dollars.

481
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
A couple people.

482
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,080
Someone sent me a two dollar bill.

483
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,800
Kickstarter to buy Jamie Minecraft.

484
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,160
This was before Kickstarter, they should be paying me.

485
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,600
Alright, anyhow, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

486
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,720
I played a little bit of Call of Duty, we actually played a Kill Confirmed game with

487
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,040
just the three of us, so that was fun.

488
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,720
We just don't play a lot of Call of Duty anymore, because everyone's really busy and my coworker's

489
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,760
out for a couple weeks, and it's just...

490
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,720
So I get more Minecraft time then.

491
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,600
But yeah, I started getting bored though, because I'm like, well, I don't know really

492
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,840
what else to do in here, and so I don't know, we'll see.

493
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,160
So I may actually go start a new seed at some point, but I don't know, how's the old RC?

494
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,240
Not that great, actually, but then again I haven't explored the entire map, but I can

495
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,120
tell you, the underground really annoys the hell out of me, and there's some weird...

496
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,880
There's like, okay, if you want like just this gigantic mountain where the bottom half

497
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,480
is all cave and it's the weirdest thing, it's available on that map.

498
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,280
I would almost play it just to see how different it is.

499
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,720
There's some seeds I've seen that are really crazy, like just valleys inside of a mountain

500
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
with lava and water and all sorts of strange stuff.

501
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,880
Well whenever we get those VoG forums that may or may not be there, when you hear this...

502
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
I have no idea what the crap you guys are talking about.

503
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,680
You should share some of your awesome seeds for Minecraft.

504
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,800
All right, look, let's move on.

505
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
What seed?

506
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Like what...

507
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,600
You tell it what word you give it, you can give it random numbers and letters or capital,

508
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,920
you know, you give it a word and you can make a world that uses that as the seed.

509
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,800
But the good thing about that is that like if I use capital V, capital O, capital G,

510
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,240
and he uses the same thing, we have the same world essentially, even though it's kind of

511
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,380
randomized, if that makes sense.

512
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm just thinking of Final Fantasy VIII now, where there were seed members in their gardens.

513
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, no.

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,360
All right, my gaming week.

515
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,800
Honestly, I've been working on the website, not as much as Bobby has, but I still have

516
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,760
been working on that quite a bit this week, so I haven't had a whole lot of time to game.

517
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,920
When I have gamed, I've played a little bit of Warcraft.

518
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,420
Shane and I have been running some dungeons to get heirlooms for the monks, we will inevitably

519
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,220
roll in the expansion.

520
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,760
And otherwise, I checked out the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer expansion, the... is it the

521
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
Rebellion Pack, or was that the last one?

522
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
I don't know.

523
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah, I remember.

524
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Oh, Recruit...

525
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Something war-related.

526
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,600
Another freaking multiplayer pack came out this week, and it adds the two male Quarians,

527
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,920
the two Cerberus defectors, and the two Vortia.

528
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,520
And dang, people are already unlocking shit.

529
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,400
I went into a random, and I already was playing with a male Quarian, which was kind of neat,

530
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,960
to just kind of see one running around.

531
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,880
And I got to play on one of the new maps.

532
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,400
So there are two new maps, one of them is, I think it's Thessia was the one I was playing

533
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,840
on, because it's based off that one, well I don't want to spoil it because it's staged

534
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,680
near the end of the game, but something big happens there.

535
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,520
So I was, yeah, I was having a good time on that map, and apparently there's a new type

536
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,060
of credit game, too.

537
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,840
On the third, sixth, and tenth wave, you have to do something different than just killing

538
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
everybody.

539
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,760
It's either like, hit the four beacons, or upload all the data.

540
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,360
Now there's a new one that's kind of like, fetch it and bring it back.

541
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,560
So, and it's kind of like Murderball, where the person who's carrying it walks really

542
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,000
slow, and is more vulnerable to attack, so I kind of like that they're doing different

543
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
things with it.

544
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,360
You know, Mass Effect, good times.

545
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,140
After finally having played the entire fucking trilogy up to this point, it's kind of nice

546
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,120
to be current, and get to experience a lot of this Mass Effect hub-a-loo when it's current,

547
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,680
so that part's cool.

548
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,080
All right, now we can do gaming news, right?

549
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Yes.

550
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
All right, let's do it.

551
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,760
All right, let's talk a little bit about rumors, and apparently Sony is rumored to be looking

552
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,320
to buy a cloud gaming service, whether it's going to be Gaikai or OnLive.

553
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,000
The thought, though, is it's probably going to be-

554
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Or the Phantom.

555
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Well you have to have a cloud gaming service first, you can't just say, hey, we've got

556
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,780
this cloud gaming service, it's behind that wall over there, but trust us, it's there.

557
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,560
This giant E3 booth we have.

558
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,520
It works great.

559
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,320
Seriously.

560
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
It's awesome.

561
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Yeah, our first game-

562
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Take our word for it.

563
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
We can't show it to you, it's awesome.

564
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,280
Our first game coming out for it's called Snake Oil.

565
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Forget it.

566
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Yeah.

567
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:21,080
So, and I guess the speculation also kind of goes along with what Gaikai was saying

568
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,960
about E3, saying that, you know what, there may not be new consoles, because if you think

569
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:33,520
about it, if the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 adapt cloud gaming, there really doesn't need

570
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,400
to be a new console, because they just upgrade the stuff that's on the server side.

571
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Oh, they'll always find a way to sell you something.

572
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,320
It's never going to happen, people.

573
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
It's never going to happen.

574
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,560
It may happen to coexist with regular stuff like renting titles or stuff like that, but

575
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
it's never going to be, you just-

576
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,520
Until it's the holodeck, there will always be a need for another console.

577
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Or, Intella will suck your dick, let's be real.

578
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,400
The console either has to be the holodeck, or if they build the console, then they don't

579
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
need anything else.

580
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
If I lose out-

581
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
What?

582
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Well, I'm losing out there.

583
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Well, no, no, no.

584
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
It'll be the holodeck.

585
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
You can demand horizontal holodeck.

586
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
They'll be an inverter for women.

587
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
But I'm just saying, though, there's never-

588
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,820
It comes with a vacuum attachment.

589
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,560
There's never- Well, even when the blowjob machine and the holodeck come out, they're

590
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,100
going to need to make improvements to that.

591
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,720
There's always going to be improvements done to everything.

592
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
That's true.

593
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,640
It would be too bad if you get a glitchy hoe.

594
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

595
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Let it go.

596
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Let it go.

597
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Let it go.

598
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
No!

599
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Female attachment!

600
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Not the male attachment.

601
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Bad.

602
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Anyways.

603
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,520
So, yeah, I mean, it could be interesting.

604
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,920
I guess we'll have to wait and see what's going on there.

605
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,840
I'm sure that announcement next week will be in the works if they are going to do something

606
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,640
like that.

607
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
It makes a lot of sense.

608
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

609
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,160
I mean, they could do a lot of different- I mean, I don't think it's going to be only

610
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
that.

611
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,920
Because, you know, another thing that they can consider, at least Sony did, was making

612
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
it online only.

613
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah.

614
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,040
Think about this, though, real quick.

615
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,720
If they do adopt, like, a cloud gaming thing, then they can have all the fucking control.

616
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
You know what I mean?

617
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Think about it.

618
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,880
Because when it's in there, they get all of the fucking control.

619
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,240
Like, they could release, like, a beta game or something that you could play for, like,

620
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,760
an hour, and then it's, like, pulled.

621
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
You know?

622
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,560
And then the advertisement's right in the middle of it, and there's nothing you can

623
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
do about it.

624
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,720
Like, that part of it's kind of interesting to me.

625
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,800
Yeah, they could do that, and then everybody else doesn't do that, and then no one plays

626
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
it.

627
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
So, um, I don't know.

628
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,040
But yeah, basically they ultimately rejected the idea of a download-only console because

629
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,320
they remembered, hey, we released something called the PlayStation Portable Go, and that

630
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,280
sucked.

631
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,240
So they didn't, they decided not to do that instead.

632
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,960
Maybe we're just not ready for online-only yet.

633
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,720
That's, that's probably true.

634
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,800
I mean, especially when, you know, you can't, it would look really stupid to have one article

635
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,720
come out about Sony PlayStation 4 to be online-only right next to the article that comes out and

636
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,800
says Comcast finally firms up their plan on how to enforce their bandwidth caps and starting

637
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,300
at 300 gigs.

638
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
Or even better.

639
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,320
It's like Sony puts out online-only consoles.

640
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,740
Servers for online console are being throttled.

641
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,640
No one can play anything on their console.

642
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,880
Fantastic.

643
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,360
But if you buy the special Xfinity version, then it won't count against your cap.

644
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
Comcast subsidized two-year agreement.

645
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
I'm telling you.

646
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, seriously, if it goes online-only, hey, guess what?

647
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Guess what, console makers?

648
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Here's a little, little fact for you.

649
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,360
You know we don't have to buy consoles.

650
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,920
You know there are things called PCs that are open platforms that, oh my god, there's

651
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,600
not these fucking restrictions on.

652
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,240
I mean, they may be on certain games, but guess what, we don't play those games.

653
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,120
So no one's forcing us to buy these consoles.

654
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,000
Well, it's funny you bring up PC games because Diablo III is one of the big PC games, of

655
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,740
course, in the world right now.

656
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,480
And as you know, they've been having quite a few issues.

657
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,520
You know, especially launch day was really bad.

658
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,160
It got a little better for a little bit, but just within the past couple days before we're

659
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
taping this show.

660
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,840
Unfortunately, there's been more Error 37s, the auction house has been delayed, and so

661
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
on.

662
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,160
Well, one country is taking this shit seriously, and it's Korea.

663
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
The Korean Federal Trade Commission-

664
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,780
They take their Diablo series, they take all their Blizzard games seriously.

665
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,520
Like when I say seriously, like no joke, the Federal Trade Commission in Korea raided Blizzard's

666
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,840
Seoul office earlier this week.

667
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,360
That's, you know, South Korea.

668
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Because of consumer claims-

669
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,740
And those WoW subscriptions were expensive, but man, that they're collecting souls now?

670
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
That's just ridiculous.

671
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Stop it.

672
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,720
Uh, Blizzard apparently refused to refund Diablo III to Korean players who should have

673
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
been eligible after consumer complaints.

674
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,440
The FTC thinks that Blizzard is violating Korean law on electronic commerce and commercial

675
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
contracts.

676
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,280
They're trying to gather evidence and so forth related to this raid.

677
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,300
Korean players are frustrated with the server issues happening in Diablo III and asking

678
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
for refunds.

679
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,680
The user denied it, saying contract terms.

680
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,040
You know that whole little thing that you scroll through real quick and agree to play

681
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
the game?

682
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Yeah, that's contract.

683
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Um, the FTC is considering these terms to not be good to the player base, as you can

684
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
imagine.

685
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,520
Quote, we have received many complaints from Diablo III users.

686
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,720
So just like people here complain to the government, it's happening in Korea too, and they raided

687
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
the office.

688
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,600
Well, I always have a problem with those contracts, if you will, anyways, because I'm not presented

689
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,700
that contract before I purchase the item.

690
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,120
It's like, I get this sprung upon me once I open the box and try and install and play

691
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
the game.

692
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,600
At that point, it's like, too fucking late, haha, you either agree to this or you get

693
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
nothing.

694
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,240
Um, now, one very interesting note I want to share is, according to the Korea Times,

695
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,500
the FTC is investigating if Blizzard should be liable for its ill preparation in regards

696
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,880
to player traffic.

697
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I don't know if I've ever heard anything like that before.

698
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
That's interesting.

699
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,520
Basically, that Blizzard could be responsible for not being prepared for how big their game

700
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
was going to be.

701
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,880
I don't know why, but I find that fucking fascinating.

702
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,200
And I think that they should be liable, because they had a beta, they knew how much traffic

703
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,840
was going to be in there, and they need to have enough servers, and they didn't.

704
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,740
I mean, come on.

705
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,360
You're telling me that you don't realize how many copies of your game are out there?

706
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,720
You know how many copies you printed, and you're just assuming that not everyone's going

707
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,280
to be online at the same time.

708
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Which was a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing to do.

709
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,680
You need to expect the worst case scenario.

710
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
You need to have those extra servers.

711
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,040
Stop trying to cut costs.

712
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,240
Because, you know what, you didn't have to make this an online only fucking game.

713
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,760
That's your fault.

714
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,880
Now, um, you know, looking ahead here, if something were to happen, and let's say the

715
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,800
game gets pulled in Korea or something, it's not actually the worst case scenario for Blizzard,

716
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,000
because the real money auction house already doesn't exist in Asia, and I believe that

717
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
was also because of Korea.

718
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,520
I wouldn't let them do it.

719
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,840
So, um, it's still one to watch, though.

720
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,940
This is kind of unprecedented.

721
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,720
So I'm very curious to see what comes of this.

722
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,480
If anything, this could also just be, you know, for headlines, and, you know, to let

723
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,960
everybody know we are not messing around, people.

724
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,520
This could just end up being a big slap on the wrist and negative press.

725
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Who knows?

726
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,120
There's no such thing as negative press.

727
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,240
There's only press.

728
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Interesting way to look at it.

729
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Well, it's true.

730
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
I know.

731
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
What about press with a negative slant?

732
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
What about Lee press-on-nails?

733
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Ew.

734
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Tacky.

735
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,240
In more ways than one.

736
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:11,920
Well, speaking of tacky, Konami, bitches, so, how many of us were led to believe that

737
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,280
the Silent Hill HD Collection was a port?

738
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,880
They were porting and then rescanning and redoing voices and stuff.

739
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,320
Up to the part with the fog?

740
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Yeah, I kind of thought that.

741
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,320
Well, it was actually not ported from the final version of the game.

742
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,520
It was ported from incomplete source code.

743
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,240
They actually lost the source codes for the Silent Hill games.

744
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,080
The missing source code parts were replaced with frog DNA, and that's how they got Jurassic

745
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Park.

746
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,420
Well, here is what the producer Tom Hewlett had to say.

747
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,880
We got all the source code that Konami had on file, which in turn wasn't the final release

748
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,220
of the games.

749
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:04,140
So during the debug, we didn't just have to deal with the expected porting bugs, but also

750
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,320
had to squash some bugs that the original team obviously removed prior to release that

751
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,640
we had never seen before.

752
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,400
So it looks like they just were working with what was left over.

753
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,680
It was sort of like what you do when you've got left over spaghetti, but you don't have

754
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,640
enough to make a full meal out of it.

755
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,720
So you like make a sandwich or something out of your spaghetti.

756
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,840
A spaghetti sandwich?

757
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
I've done it.

758
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Wow.

759
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I was in college.

760
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
You know what, ladies and gentlemen?

761
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,360
I don't think any other gaming podcast in the history of ever would compare Silent Hill

762
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,960
HD to a spaghetti sandwich, but there you go.

763
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,560
They're both terrible.

764
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I don't know.

765
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Spaghetti sandwiches.

766
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,480
Cold spaghetti sandwich on sourdough bread is actually okay.

767
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Just saying, just saying.

768
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,960
It's like kind of like a sloppy joe with noodles.

769
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,520
Subway sells meatball sandwiches.

770
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
That's the other half.

771
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
They're not very good either.

772
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
I was going to say, though, that that's the problem.

773
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,640
That's why we had all the issues, because they used frog DNA instead of fog DNA.

774
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,920
You know, there's no fog in there because they didn't use the right DNA.

775
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,240
You didn't say the magic word, uh, uh, uh.

776
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,400
Well, the other thing, the other quote in here was saying, um, and this is actually

777
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
pretty funny.

778
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
I'm going to read this.

779
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Okay.

780
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
A lot of issues such as textures and sound had to be taken out of the compiled game.

781
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,060
And that brings with it a host of unique issues, especially when taken on top of the tricky

782
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,240
coding workarounds that play in the original games.

783
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
We certainly had our hands full.

784
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,080
I think at one point Heather was blue.

785
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,000
La la la la la la la la la la killing pyramid had wrong game.

786
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,900
Well, if you can't cut it, then don't make the game.

787
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,360
But there's deadlines and investors and stuff.

788
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,600
Angry internets.

789
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:54,880
I mean, if, if people have decompiled, because you know, people have decompiled the, um,

790
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,080
release versions of the games, why couldn't they just do the same thing?

791
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:05,720
Well I look at shit like that Sonic HD that like outdid Sonic for episode one and I kind

792
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,080
of go, they did it without the original source code.

793
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Yeah.

794
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
No.

795
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
All right.

796
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,280
This street, wasn't the streets of rage HD collection done with completely original programming?

797
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Uh, yeah.

798
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
There was that fan one.

799
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Yeah.

800
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Yeah.

801
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,640
So those are all both like 2d stuff.

802
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,200
And then once again, this wasn't necessarily something that they needed to make.

803
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,640
They had put these games out before.

804
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Why did they feel compelled?

805
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,560
Oh, I know money because they wanted quick, but we're also, I'm glad I didn't buy it.

806
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,320
We're honestly, where did they put the source code?

807
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:46,560
Like you would think that kind of stuff goes, uh, smuggled it out in his butt, clearly.

808
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,280
He left Konami and took it with him or, I mean, I guess a drive could get demagnetized

809
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,760
or something, but I mean, how do you lose source code?

810
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,240
That's why you make back ups.

811
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Someone could find it on eBay.

812
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,840
Did you check behind the couch?

813
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm going to look online.

814
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,680
Silent Hill source code.

815
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
All right.

816
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Moving on.

817
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,240
Let's travel around the world and check out some, uh, release dates for games coming to

818
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,080
a store near you that are hopefully finished.

819
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,360
Well, there's never a guarantee anymore.

820
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,860
I mean, considering that, you know, the amount of patches and stuff that we get, but this

821
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,360
week we've gotten a few things.

822
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:27,480
Um, nothing terribly exciting, starting off with, uh, inversion on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

823
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
360.

824
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,520
It's like a third person shooter, but you can manipulate gravity.

825
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,640
And then of course Madagascar 3, tying in the new movie that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox

826
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,600
360, Wii, 3DS and DS.

827
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,440
Um, the new play control stuff is being re-released.

828
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,640
We've got the Mario Power Tennis on the Wii, which is a port of the GameCube game.

829
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,520
And then Pikmin 2, because Pikmin 2 never came out over here for some reason.

830
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,960
One of those, oh hey, we localized this game, but oh, we forgot to release it in the other

831
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
territory.

832
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,440
That whole new play control thing, right?

833
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,000
It just, well yeah, it came out like a couple in 2009.

834
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,840
We should put out a game on the Wii.

835
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,160
No, it's, it's seriously, hey, hey.

836
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,560
You know that the Wii's just like a GameCube.

837
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,880
We could take GameCube games and we'll add the Wii controls to it.

838
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,440
Yes, you kind of have to add the Wii controls to it because there are no GameCube controls.

839
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,320
In fact, that's actually a guarantee on some of the new consoles because there's no GameCube

840
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
controller ports.

841
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,440
Or backwards compatibility anymore.

842
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,560
Or backwards compatibility, yes, very true.

843
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:45,680
Um, so there's a, oh, oh, oh, and if you're a Sims 3 fan, Jamie.

844
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
I lost count.

845
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,640
The Sims 3 Katy Perry Sweet Treats pack.

846
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
Ew!

847
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,200
Mark Katy Perry!

848
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,520
Just in time for the movie.

849
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,040
I have actually officially stopped playing Sims 3.

850
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,560
Because they never, every time they would release it, they would never work out how

851
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,600
to get it to not have the crappy slowdown issue with your add-ons and stuff.

852
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,640
You know what this calls for?

853
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,240
Katy Perry Simlish music!

854
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
That was a good video.

855
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:21,120
That sounds about the same.

856
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,920
I honestly can't tell it's different.

857
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,800
It actually is a cute little video.

858
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,360
She's not a, oh, I forget it.

859
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
I need to stop shading.

860
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,840
Alright, and that's, I kid you not, that's literally it.

861
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,000
Unless you count Max Payne 3, which, you know, technically for us is coming out tomorrow,

862
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,200
but it would have been out on Friday, yeah.

863
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Alright.

864
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
On PC.

865
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,160
Let's travel to Japan and check out the release dates over there.

866
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,280
Not a whole lot to get excited about, but there's a couple games here and there.

867
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,160
On the Playstation 3, Tokyo Jungle comes out this week, and I'm not sure exactly what this

868
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
game is.

869
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,640
It sounds like a zombie game.

870
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,880
Fucking amazing is what it is.

871
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Is it?

872
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
It is awesome.

873
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
Let's see, the description here.

874
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,640
Humans disappeared from Tokyo all of a sudden, oh, so it's like 28 days later, leaving the

875
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,160
animals to fend for themselves.

876
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,480
Play the game as various animals in this apocalyptic scene.

877
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Learn to hunt, gather, and mark territory?

878
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Pee.

879
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Game of the year!

880
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,840
No, I'm serious, this is fucking amazing.

881
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
You need to watch this.

882
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
You play by pee?

883
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Right now.

884
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,560
Okay, I will watch this right now if it will load properly.

885
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
This is Africa good.

886
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
Africa good.

887
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Africa.

888
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Well, where is it?

889
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,280
Just type in YouTube, just type the game's title into YouTube, you'll find it.

890
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Hey, Tokyo Jungle.

891
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,300
Where did you hear about this?

892
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,520
From them talking about Tokyo Jungle.

893
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,920
Is this coming out here?

894
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,000
No, but at least I don't think it is.

895
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,440
It very well could.

896
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,480
I posted actually a thing on Twitter about it, because they were talking about, you know,

897
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,620
like dogs and stuff like that, you know, pomeranes.

898
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
You get to be a pomeranian?

899
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,620
Yes, you can be a pomerane.

900
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
Oh.

901
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
This is a stinkin' add-on.

902
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
Let's wait for this.

903
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
Boo.

904
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Buy me 30 seconds.

905
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,680
So anyways, yeah, they have pomeranians, they have like wolves you can play as, like, you

906
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,280
know, horses, cows, and they have different rabbits.

907
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,720
Can you be a fox?

908
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
I think you can be a fox, you might be able to.

909
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,320
And then, the best part about it is you unlock costumes for them, so you can get an elephant

910
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,940
and roller skates, and you can dress them up.

911
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,120
But it's a ridiculous looking game, I mean, it's just...

912
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I need this game.

913
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
It's just crazy.

914
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay, anyways, so now...

915
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Here we go.

916
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
All right, Tokyo Jungle.

917
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,960
It is by Sony.

918
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,560
Or published by Sony.

919
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Oh, it's Japan Studio, okay.

920
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Crispies!

921
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,480
How many freakin' publishers...

922
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Okay.

923
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,640
Okay, so we just see, like, an abandoned city.

924
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,640
Tokyo.

925
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,640
Tokyo.

926
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,640
Dog.

927
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:03,880
I wasn't a dog, I was, like, a panther person.

928
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,400
This is really terrible radio, y'all.

929
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm trying to remember, there was Akotaku, there was it, and I think it was today, there

930
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,080
was a video on there.

931
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Tokyo Jungle.

932
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,160
All right, now it should be, come on, kick into gear, show me the peeing.

933
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,920
I want to see some dogs peeing.

934
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Lions, and bulldogs, and gazelles, and beagles.

935
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Wow, you're...

936
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck was that?

937
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,960
It was a dog in a freakin' sumo outfit.

938
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,160
No, that was, like, a...

939
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,560
That looked like a Native American dress thing.

940
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,760
No, look at the big rope behind it, see?

941
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
It's got, um...

942
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Oh, it is.

943
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,760
Those are, uh, from Shinto shrines.

944
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Shrines.

945
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
That's, like...

946
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,200
Actually, it's just like an Ainu, look at the robe.

947
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,360
He's like the Lion King, but a dog.

948
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,320
He's the Doggin King.

949
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Giraffes.

950
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
The hell game.

951
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Cow.

952
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,840
Dude, I want to be...

953
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,600
I want to fight between...

954
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,120
Panda bears killing each other.

955
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
That was a brown bear and a panda bear.

956
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,120
That's pandemonium.

957
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Chicken, chickies, and piggies.

958
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

959
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,120
Did we see...

960
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,040
Those two dogs were about to mount each other.

961
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,400
Okay.

962
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,720
Where the fuck is this game?

963
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,760
I will import this shit if I have to.

964
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,760
This looks astoun...

965
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,760
This looks amazing.

966
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,200
Are they going to show this at E3 next week?

967
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I don't know.

968
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
That would be hilarious.

969
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,800
Rob, let's get this game, since there's no region coding.

970
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,040
Animal dance.

971
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,040
Animal dance.

972
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,360
Da da da da da da da da.

973
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
Animal dance.

974
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
Like, they could set the trailer to that music.

975
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
It would be amazing.

976
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,360
No, you know what they should set it to?

977
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
What?

978
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
Um, Gilda Radner.

979
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,920
Let's talk Geordi to the animals.

980
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,680
This is the new President Cat, as far as I'm concerned.

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Let's face it, y'all.

982
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
President Cat ain't happening.

983
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Now, I want Tokyo Jungle.

984
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,640
I posted a link on my Twitter.

985
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
It was today.

986
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,640
All right.

987
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,320
The story is, like, in Tokyo, little dogs are the king of the jungle, and it's basically

988
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,880
talking about...

989
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,840
It's the commercial, I guess, I think, for the game.

990
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,320
But yeah, it's seriously awesome.

991
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
All right.

992
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,520
So yeah, that is now one to kind of keep your eye on, is Tokyo Jungle.

993
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
I want...

994
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Oh, man.

995
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,520
Watch.

996
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
That'll be like...

997
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
Oh, Vida.

998
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,360
That'll be in the corner of the Sony booth somewhere, like, some poor intern doesn't

999
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,440
even know anything about the game and has to show it, and it's just, oh, my gosh.

1000
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Africa.

1001
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Africa.

1002
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,520
But that's what Africa should have been.

1003
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
That was Africa with killing.

1004
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Tokyo.

1005
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,160
Tokyo Jungle.

1006
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,480
On the PlayStation Vida, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny, and a Hello Kitty game.

1007
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,040
Hello Kitty Tohiso Block Crash 5, but let's be real.

1008
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,480
You're all waiting for June 14th when Persona 4 comes out on the Vida.

1009
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,480
Let's just be real right there, exactly.

1010
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,080
Moving on, lastly, to the Xbox 360.

1011
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,160
No, nothing until Lollipop Chainsaw on the 14th.

1012
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
I want to play that.

1013
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
It does look pretty awesome, huh?

1014
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
All right, let's move on to the UK.

1015
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,560
On June 5th, Madagascar 3, the video game.

1016
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,720
I was having to do my...

1017
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,720
I should do my riff raff voice.

1018
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Master...

1019
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,720
No.

1020
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:17,920
On June 6th, we have Virtual Fighter V Final Showdown, and June 8th, Dungeon Bowl, which

1021
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,320
I have no idea what it's about, but hey, it's got a neat name.

1022
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Chair of Swords for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1023
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
I'm sorry.

1024
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Game of Boring.

1025
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,920
I mean, Thrones.

1026
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,520
Chair of Swords.

1027
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
And Rayman Origins.

1028
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Chair of Swords.

1029
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
All right, just a few more stories for you guys.

1030
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,560
I did see one cool thing having to do with that show.

1031
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,560
What?

1032
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,360
We're sitting on the throne.

1033
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,720
Just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1034
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,760
But first, Loki.

1035
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,440
So there are a couple court cases resolved themselves this week.

1036
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
Epic has one lawsuit against Silicon Knights.

1037
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,400
As you may remember, Silicon Knights was complaining that Unreal Engine is too hard to program

1038
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
in.

1039
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
That's why two humans sucked.

1040
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,520
It wasn't because we can't make a good game.

1041
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
And they lost.

1042
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:14,040
So they owe now $4.45 million to Epic, and yeah.

1043
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,320
Of course, they are disappointed with the outcome, Silicon Knights, and they're going

1044
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,640
to appeal, because it can never end.

1045
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:29,960
And then finally, Activision is also expected back in court again, because Judge has okayed,

1046
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,040
no doubt, to continue their lawsuit for their appearance in Band Hero.

1047
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,320
You may remember that they claimed the agreement was that they would sing their songs as their

1048
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,080
characters, because they have themselves in the game.

1049
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,160
However, you can sing anybody's songs with anybody's characters, and so some people took

1050
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,840
offense to that.

1051
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,880
And so now they apparently can file their lawsuit.

1052
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,040
I keep feeling like every few months we hear that that lawsuit has slowly progressed.

1053
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,760
Well, I mean, dude, it was originally filed in 2009.

1054
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,120
It's been a long time.

1055
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,480
Our justice system at work.

1056
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,280
Moving on, the Wii U.

1057
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,840
More rumors just ahead of E3.

1058
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,720
Any day now we'll see if this is true or not, but why not?

1059
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,560
We'll engage these rumors, because it's from NeoGaf, so clearly it's true.

1060
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,600
But hey, you never know.

1061
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,600
You never know.

1062
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,480
Some people laughed at some of the things we've posted before, and they ended up being

1063
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,000
true, so who knows?

1064
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,440
Plus, most of this sounds plausible.

1065
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,120
So here's the latest features in the latest dev kit.

1066
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,320
Video chat available, but it must be from the main menu of the system, not while playing

1067
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,440
a game.

1068
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
That seems plausible.

1069
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,000
Voice commands available.

1070
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Why not?

1071
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,800
Facial recognition, similar to the Xbox Kinect.

1072
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,480
I don't know how well that works, even on the Kinect, and it's something I never use.

1073
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,080
And they can technically do it on the DSi and all that, so I mean, yeah, it'll be there,

1074
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,960
but it's not going to have a point.

1075
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,600
The ability to suspend games, similar to the 3DS.

1076
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,560
That'd be cool, and I don't see why not, because they can do that on the Vita, too.

1077
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,320
Yeah, duh to that.

1078
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,520
Ability to share achievements with friends by sending videos or screenshots with drawings

1079
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
on them.

1080
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,800
That would be pretty cool.

1081
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,360
That could make the internet a lot more fun, if you think about it.

1082
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,000
The TTP possibilities with that are quite quick.

1083
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,760
Yeah, so that could-

1084
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,760
Achievement, penis!

1085
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:35,840
Imagine that the game, right up to you getting the achievement, actually takes a video, not

1086
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,480
just of your feeding game, but also video of your face.

1087
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,480
Like Burnout.

1088
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
You remember that Burnout game that would show video of you?

1089
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,920
So basically it's Pikura.

1090
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,680
This could be interesting.

1091
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,200
Other interesting one, I want to know if you think this is plausible.

1092
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,240
Watch a friend play online.

1093
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,880
Well they kind of have that with spectating, but not all games support that, like on Xbox

1094
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,120
360, so maybe.

1095
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
Why not?

1096
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,280
It would definitely seem the technology's there, and people are doing it with Ustream

1097
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,520
and Twitch TV and all this stuff.

1098
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,000
People are just sitting there watching other people play games.

1099
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It would be cool, I mean, I don't know, maybe.

1100
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It'd be interesting.

1101
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,480
And lastly, multitasking.

1102
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,120
For example, keep a text or video walkthrough open from the site while playing the game.

1103
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,880
Swap back and forth as needed.

1104
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,120
Can't you do that already with the, well you can on the Vita, I don't remember if you can

1105
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,120
do that on the 3DS.

1106
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,520
You sort of can.

1107
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,480
You can't like have the internet and your game going.

1108
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,240
Because those are two different applications, but you can have your game going and then

1109
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,600
you can like, I don't, there's not a lot you can do with the game suspended, I don't think.

1110
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,280
Because you really, like if you launch anything else, it says, you can go look at your friends

1111
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
list.

1112
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
On the 3DS.

1113
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
And your notifications.

1114
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
That's about it.

1115
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,280
You can.

1116
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,920
Because you can like open stuff, as long as you're not trying to run two games at the

1117
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
same time.

1118
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,000
I can see that it's possible, also with the other screen, maybe, you know, have a walkthrough

1119
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
on there.

1120
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Could be.

1121
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,360
So I, hey, if this is all true, especially kind of like the video screenshot drawing

1122
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,280
stuff, that's the kind of stuff that I would like Nintendo to surprise us with.

1123
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,060
That would make me go, oh okay, maybe they do get online.

1124
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,120
So we'll see.

1125
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,200
Of course this could just all be fan wank and come visit my website.

1126
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,440
Well, and the other thing too, is I don't know how much of this they would actually

1127
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,160
be talking about at E3, you know what I mean?

1128
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,440
That's a lot of bullet points for stuff.

1129
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,080
Oh well, I think all that would come to light in the press announcements or the behind the

1130
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:40,160
scenes, like it's not gonna be at the keynote, but it would, you'd see it behind the scenes.

1131
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,160
A lot of that stuff tends to come out of interviews and stuff and sites going in asking the questions,

1132
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,520
is this true, is this true?

1133
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,640
You know, and some of the stuff they read on the internet.

1134
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
So.

1135
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:55,600
Alright, well, enough of all this new fangled Wii U drawing penises on your achievement

1136
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,480
stuff, let's go back to a time when games were a little bit simpler.

1137
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,880
Take a trip down memory lane with a classic game of the week.

1138
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,600
Dark Soccer's gonna step into the vault and pull out one game that she thinks, hey, play

1139
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
this.

1140
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
Or GTFO.

1141
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,920
We didn't have GTFO when I was little, it was get off my lawn.

1142
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,240
Here it is, your classic game of the week.

1143
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:23,800
It's Guitar Freaks, wow, is a music game by Konami where you use a guitar.

1144
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,920
That should just be all there is to know, but let's go a bit further than that.

1145
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,680
Basically it's mostly rock and J-pop.

1146
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:40,680
It's seriously, even every source that you look at is gonna say, oh, that's what led

1147
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,300
to Guitar Hero, even though they tried to deny it in my living room that it was because

1148
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,720
of Guitar Freaks.

1149
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:54,400
Now it's on its 19th version, Guitar Freaks V8, which came out March 28th, 2011.

1150
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,080
And it is said to be the final release of Guitar Freaks V.

1151
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,480
There will be a spinoff, Guitar Freaks XG, actually, well, there was one that came out

1152
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,800
in Japanese arcades on March 10th, 2010.

1153
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,400
Add two more buttons, add it to the fret bar instead of the three.

1154
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,560
And there is a sequel called Guitar Freaks XG2 that came out March 9th, 2011.

1155
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,560
So the controller looks kind of like a Fender Jazzmaster or a Fender Mustang.

1156
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,760
It has three buttons, red, green, and blue.

1157
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:38,440
And it has a pick lever so that you also have a knob that you can use as an effector and

1158
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,480
it'll add like chorus and delay effects to your guitar.

1159
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:54,920
Anyway, so it really plays a lot like a reverse pop music or reverse BeatMania 2DX where everything

1160
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:00,560
scrolls very DDR style, you know, from bottom to top, except it uses the bars and you have

1161
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:06,600
to use your strum lever while you hold the appropriate colored button.

1162
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,960
And you can pull your bar back when you see a little guitar flashing on the screen and

1163
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,400
you get a wailing bonus.

1164
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,480
And in some cases you even have hidden things that you can play that will populate this

1165
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,000
new, I'm glad you picked that song because that's like one of the best songs ever.

1166
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:35,480
It'll populate a, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh yeah, a new series of items to play

1167
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,080
on the screen.

1168
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,320
I was actually very distracted because Rob picked Fire, you should play a little bit

1169
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
of that.

1170
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Cool.

1171
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:50,880
My husband and I would play the crap out of this song.

1172
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,240
So anyway, basically your life is powered by your...

1173
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,880
Wait a minute, this is somebody who edited Fire to be the Mega Man song, that's not the

1174
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
song.

1175
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,880
No, but I meant, that's not the song.

1176
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,280
That actually is kind of rad though.

1177
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,640
Yeah, well I knew it sounded wrong, but I like it.

1178
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Alright, let me find the real Fire.

1179
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,560
Find the real Fire, because real Fire is good.

1180
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,480
Although it sounds very MIDI like.

1181
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,480
That is pretty awesome.

1182
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,400
See there's the right one.

1183
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Yeah this is it.

1184
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,480
This is the full version.

1185
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,280
That's fine.

1186
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,680
Let me get to where the guitar is.

1187
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,960
I like the...

1188
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,120
I can totally hear where somebody heard the Mega Man song in that though.

1189
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
Yeah.

1190
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,960
Anyway, your scoring depends on how accurate you are with hitting low key.

1191
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,560
You have perfect, great, good, poor, and miss.

1192
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,520
Ratings of poor and miss will deplete your group gauge, perfect and great will replenish

1193
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
it.

1194
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:04,160
If your group gauge is empty completely, you fail, and the game is over.

1195
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,320
Um, to determine how the cabinet is set up, you have one to five songs, and you can earn

1196
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:16,040
additional songs in some versions of the game like a bonus.

1197
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,280
You also have session link, which would hook up the Guitar Freaks with the Dramania, and

1198
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,380
basically you have like a little band set up.

1199
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,760
But back in the day, we had Super Session.

1200
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,240
I miss this so much.

1201
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,880
So do I.

1202
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,000
There were only two versions of Guitar Freaks and Dramania that had Super Session.

1203
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,320
It hooked up with the Keyboard Mania third mix, and that worked with Guitar Freaks fifth

1204
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:47,000
Dramania fourth, and Guitar Freaks sixth Dramania fifth.

1205
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,520
And you only have like a handful of songs that you could play on the Super Session,

1206
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,840
but they were freaking cool.

1207
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:01,040
Like um, what was the one that we would always, always play that was um, I could not tell

1208
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,680
you of this, this far after.

1209
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:12,320
The one that had a really cool drum beat um, Right On Time, that was it.

1210
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Wow.

1211
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
We would always play Right On Time.

1212
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
That's amazing, you remember that.

1213
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,800
I actually just listened to that song the other day, but I had the Japanese version

1214
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,520
of it, so anyway.

1215
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,400
Um, so yeah, there's something like over 500 songs available for Guitar Freaks because

1216
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,200
there's been so many versions, thank you Rob.

1217
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:44,880
And uh, this is Right On Time, the drum, when you play this in the uh, medium mode, it was

1218
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,880
just like constant.

1219
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,800
I could do it for a while, and remember those calluses I had on my hands from playing the

1220
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,640
damn drum, because we would buy our own drumsticks, and use our own drumsticks.

1221
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,800
Um, but um, as far as the different versions of them, I don't even know if I have time

1222
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,880
to list them all because there's so many.

1223
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,200
Yeah, let's not.

1224
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,400
Well, I'll put it this way.

1225
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Fuck tons.

1226
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,200
We've been everything, we've had regular mixes up to 11th, and then there was an 8th mix

1227
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:23,680
of power-up versions, we've had V2, V3, V4, Rock X Rock, or Rock X Cross Rock, V5, Rock

1228
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:33,840
to Infinity, V6 Blazing, XG, V7, XG2, Groove to Live, V8, XG3 that came out February 2012,

1229
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:42,560
Guitar Freaks V4 and V2 Infinity that were, um, uh, looks like, uh, European releases.

1230
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:48,280
So there's just been all kinds of different versions, and also, um, for, uh, the Drummania

1231
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,280
ones over in, um, other countries they were called Percussion Freaks, just saying.

1232
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
So that's it.

1233
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,560
I still was waiting for Sax Maniacs.

1234
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,560
Someday.

1235
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Someday.

1236
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
Don't give up hope.

1237
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,280
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1238
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,520
Guitar Freaks, originally in the arcade, but eventually on the Playstation in Japan.

1239
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:11,760
And uh, clearly part of the inspiration for Guitar Hero, because again, Red Octane, who

1240
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:20,080
funded the original Guitar Hero, used to make, used to make, uh, those controllers for Guitar

1241
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,120
Freaks, which had five buttons on them at one point, which Guitar Freaks never had five

1242
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,280
buttons, and everybody was like, why are they putting out five button controllers?

1243
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,520
XG has it now, ew.

1244
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Alright.

1245
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,800
Anyhow, um, we were gonna go right into rapid fire news, I think in light of the power outage

1246
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,960
a couple weeks ago, I think I should save what we've done so far, so let's do a quick

1247
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:49,200
in-studio break, we'll be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1248
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,360
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, not live, on this June the 3rd of 2012, but

1249
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,200
psst, it's a radio trick, we're taping on May 31st a few days beforehand, but uh, thanks

1250
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,280
to those of you that showed up to chat along with the show anyway at vognetwork.com, and

1251
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,560
we will be back live next week, June the 10th of 2012, and podcast folks, hey, you got another

1252
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,760
show this week, so, enjoy, even though it'll be a little bit shorter tonight, because we're

1253
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,320
missing the live interaction, and just, since it's earlier in the week, there's not as much

1254
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:24,720
to talk about, but hey, we do still have plenty of news, including tonight's rapid fire news,

1255
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,360
which Loki's gonna start us off with.

1256
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,840
Yes, there is a new Ratchet & Clank game announced, it will also be, well actually, it's only

1257
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,160
gonna be released on the Playstation Network, kind of like what they did with the second

1258
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,880
Ratchet & Clank game, or no, there's like a middle Ratchet & Clank game, like the second

1259
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,240
and the third one was out on the consoles, but it's Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault,

1260
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,500
and it's coming this fall.

1261
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,000
All those Ratchet & Clank games have kind of suggestive names, don't they?

1262
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,120
Yeah, I mean, the last one that was released only on the Playstation Network was Ratchet

1263
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:06,200
& Clank Future Quest for Booty, so, I don't know, but yeah, it looks interesting, if you're

1264
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
a Ratchet.

1265
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,600
Did they find the booty?

1266
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:15,080
They probably did, of course, it's been rumored for a while that Battlefield 3 is gonna try

1267
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,600
to pull Call of Duty Elite and come out with their own service, and they have, it actually

1268
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,760
leaked out, and then they finally announced it, well actually, no, I believe it leaked

1269
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,040
out and they, I don't know if they've confirmed it or whatever, but what ended up happening

1270
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,560
is there's this Battlefield 3 premium service, it's gonna cost you 50 bucks, and includes

1271
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,280
five themed expansion packs, some of which have already been announced, and actually

1272
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:45,560
one that's already out, back to Carcland, which was a pre-order bonus if you bought

1273
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:52,320
the game, and then of course the Close Quarters DLC, which I think is out, or it's coming

1274
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:59,180
out, no, it's coming out next week, on June 4th, and then they have, let's see, Armored

1275
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:04,480
Kill, Aftermath, and Endgame are the next three as well, and apparently you're gonna

1276
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:11,480
get exclusive weapons and also two weeks access early to said packs as well of other unique

1277
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,960
in-game items if you pay 50 bucks.

1278
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,360
I don't know, it seems like they're trying to copy what they're doing with Call of the

1279
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,680
Elite, and of course they're gonna want to do that because, if it works, if the shoe

1280
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,920
fits, they made quite a bit of money, but originally it came out, it was on the European

1281
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,280
PlayStation Network store, and then it got pulled, but, you know, once it's on the internet,

1282
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:38,160
that's right, screenshots, so, alright, well moving on, if you want to get some good games

1283
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,760
and do some good, there's always the Humble Indie Bundle available at HumbleBundle.com,

1284
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,560
and you know, every time one of these bundles comes out, the internet blows up with, best

1285
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,960
one yet, well, the fifth one, Humble Indie Bundle 5, was just announced today, and guess

1286
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,720
what, best one yet, I already bought it, like for real, like, okay, here's the deal, Psychonauts,

1287
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Limbo, Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery, EP, and Amnesia are all available, and if you

1288
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:12,560
pay above the average price, you get Bastion, which, you know, all, there's tons of great

1289
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,240
games, every single one of those games is something, got it for five dollars and sixty

1290
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,840
cents to get Bastion, I'm sure that the average price is way higher, I've already got most

1291
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,560
of those, yeah, I know, I have Amnesia, but you know what, it's not just about being able

1292
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,340
to get the games cheap, but that you are doing some good, because the money doesn't just

1293
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:32,120
go to the developers, but it goes to, if you want, again, you get to choose how you divvy

1294
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:36,720
up the money, it goes to the Humble Indie Bundle, or Child's Play Charity EFF, so if

1295
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,580
you want, you can plunk down fifteen bucks, give it all to Child's Play Charity, and say

1296
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,880
to everybody else, none for you, buy, and that's how, you know, you divvy up the money.

1297
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,480
Right now, as of the taping of the show, the minimum is seven dollars and fifty-one cents,

1298
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,640
I imagine that's gonna climb closer to ten bucks by the time, it's still worth it, shit,

1299
01:05:53,640 --> 01:06:01,320
these games together, easily worth sixty, for, honestly, the price of a regular retail

1300
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:07,320
game, why not? So, if you're feeling charitable, or shit, you just want some good games, head

1301
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:14,000
over to HumbleBundle.com, again, it's been, it's been out for one day, already up to one

1302
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,720
hundred and eighty-seven thousand, one hundred and, this number's just climbing, forty-six,

1303
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,940
eight, fifty, just keeps climbing, I imagine by the time Sunday rolls around, they'll easily

1304
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:28,900
be at a half million. Easily. Easy. So, Humble Indie Bundle 5. Uh, we kinda mentioned this

1305
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:33,680
already earlier in the show, but, if you missed it, Game Informer Magazine is teasing, in

1306
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,960
the shadows, a new Gears of War, apparently to be on the July issue of their magazine,

1307
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,760
obviously, if this is, you know, what it is, it could be Gears of War 4, it could be a

1308
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,360
Gears of War spin-off game, it's a prequel, so, just like pre-Gears of War. It's a prequel,

1309
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,720
Gears of Battle. It's a prequel because of spoilers regarding the main characters, so.

1310
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,400
I see, okay. There, there, there cannot be a sequel with the main character. Well, that,

1311
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,280
it doesn't, whoever said it had to be the main character, it could be the main, look,

1312
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,040
in one of the Mass Effect games, it's Phoenix, they kill Shepard and bring him back, and

1313
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,360
that's not a spoiler because that's in the very beginning of the game, Mass Effect 2,

1314
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:18,360
so anything is possible, you know? I always love when people say, oh no, they can't do

1315
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,440
it, it's a prequel. Time travel and shit, they can do whatever they want, look what

1316
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,600
they did with Star Trek, for fuck's sake. It's another Gears of War game. They found

1317
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,680
a way to maybe bring Con back, although they swear up and down it's not gonna happen. Whatever,

1318
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:34,640
it's another Gears of War game. Alright, well whatever it is, it's coming soon, as in E3

1319
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:42,040
soon. Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura. Um, yeah. Some more stuff, how about Spy Hunter?

1320
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,760
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Well, I was playing that

1321
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:50,040
on my iPad, actually, the Spy Hunter, which, the control sucks, because it's no steering

1322
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:57,460
wheel, you have to tilt your iPad. Well, um, basically it's a reboot on the handhelds,

1323
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:08,000
it's basically super spy racing type game. Ooh. Um, basically you are the, uh, the spy,

1324
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,720
and you have to go catch bad guys. And you do that in a fast vehicle, and you destroy

1325
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:20,080
enemy vehicles. Your car is called the G-6155 Interceptor, which is, uh, supposed to transform

1326
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:26,320
from a supercar to offer an assault vehicle to a speedboat. So, you can, uh, go hunt and

1327
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:31,120
capture those nasty, nasty spies. But the real question is, did they license the theme

1328
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,440
from Peter Gunn, because if not, forget it. Uh, they have the theme in the, um, a remix

1329
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:42,880
dubstep of the, oh god. Dubstep is evil. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1330
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,820
doo doo doo doo doo. Anyways, Bingdom by Warner Brothers Interactive, um, and, uh, yeah. It's

1331
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:54,720
supposed to be on 3DS and PS Vita in the fall. You know. What do dubstep and downtown Julie

1332
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:02,200
Brown have in common. Wubba wubba. Wubba wubba wubba! So Capcom has registered a trademark

1333
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:08,320
for a potential game called Remember Me. We don't really know anything else about that

1334
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:14,520
except that it was filed on May 22nd this year, in both the US and Europe. So maybe

1335
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:21,360
this will be something at E3? Who knows? Who cares? It could be the subtitle to another

1336
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:29,440
game too, right? It may not necessarily be a standalone game. Maybe. Remember Me, the

1337
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,240
sensible Capcom, they put out regular games that were fun and people liked buying them

1338
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,480
and we didn't have download content that was on disk. Remember Me, sensible Capcom? Well,

1339
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,640
I'm gone forever. And now it's time for a joke that nobody but maybe two of our listeners

1340
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:57,840
will get. Actually, you know what I was distracted by, Rob? A story about this guy eating his

1341
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,160
roommate's brain and heart. Ew, that's like that grody old, have you read about all that

1342
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:07,920
crap coming out of Canada? That doesn't happen in Canada. The guy eating faces in Florida,

1343
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,080
but if I lived in Florida I'd probably go crazy too. What is wrong with humanity right

1344
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,440
now? This guy was in Maryland, I think he was too close to the capitol. Is it the moon?

1345
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,640
Is it that big moon going on causing people to eat people's faces? Well, it's always something

1346
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:30,080
like that. Asteroid, moon, virus, Wednesday, I don't know, it causes zombies. But the guy

1347
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,200
was turned in actually by his dad. People stop being ridiculous. Oh, that guy in Canada

1348
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:41,800
got caught finally? No, no, this guy named Alexander Kinyua ate his roommate's heart

1349
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:49,200
and brain and his dad found him with the head and hands in a bucket in his basement. His

1350
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:55,080
dad turned him in. Do not Google that guy who they want in Canada because you'll read

1351
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,560
all these stories about it. He didn't just do fucked up things to humans and you will

1352
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,800
get mad. You will get mad. Allegedly, I have to say allegedly. But there was a guy in Japan

1353
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,800
who killed a couple of women and ate them and now he's a celebrity and does tours. What?

1354
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:15,600
Serious. And no evidence. It's gone. He wrote. That sounds like the plot of natural born

1355
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,520
killers. Did you ever see that? No, that was Robert Downey Jr. back when he was on drugs.

1356
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,800
I'll find the guy's name. But he he he did it like 30 years ago and now he like goes

1357
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:31,320
around doing tours about what it's like to eat people. That's totally sounds like the

1358
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,920
plot to natural born killers. All right. Ayo. Moving on. I need some happiness and cheerfulness.

1359
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,920
So let's look at video games. Loki. I got his name. No, I don't want it. His name is

1360
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,960
Issei Sagawa. Send it back. You know, there's nothing more happier and cheerful than Doom

1361
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:56,300
3. Doom 3 is getting the HD treatment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. And not only

1362
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:02,760
are you getting Doom 3 with HD graphics, extra levels, 3D support. They even have head mounted

1363
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,840
display support, which I'm not really sure there's that many head mounted displays out

1364
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:14,040
there. I know that apparently John Carmack made one and it had duct tape on it. Here's

1365
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,640
the thing. John Carmack has one. So that's why it's in the game. Oh, yeah. So he's supporting

1366
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:26,560
it. And yeah, Doom one and two are also included and it's supposed to be out this fall. So

1367
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:35,000
that's kind of cool, I guess. I mean, here's another awesome question. Why Doom 3? Because

1368
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,440
just because maybe it was kind of over, I don't want to say it was overlooked, but it

1369
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:44,040
certainly didn't have that same cultural grab that the first two did. Well, Doom 3, because

1370
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:54,080
they are new game rage bombed. Why not Quake 3? Well, Quake 3 was Quake. It's basically

1371
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:59,200
Quake Live now. Yeah, Quake Live, which I think, don't they have Quake 3 on Xbox Live Arcade?

1372
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,800
They do, you're right, they do. I actually have it. And technically they're releasing

1373
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,560
Quake, well they actually are releasing Quake 4 again. Really? Quake 4 wasn't very good.

1374
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,600
On Xbox 360. That was one of the launch titles for 360, remember that? Yeah, here's the thing

1375
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,600
I want to kind of know about it though, is remember, the launch title, and hopefully

1376
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,720
you can find it dirt cheap now, it, I mean the game wasn't very good, but it came with

1377
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:29,080
Quake 2 on another disc. Which was good. That's right. The even, the even numbered Quakes,

1378
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,000
it's like the opposite of Star Trek, the even numbered Quakes are not very good. Quake 2

1379
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,840
was pretty good. It wasn't a fan. Quake 3 was great. Compared to 1 and 3, I mean 3 was

1380
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,320
like the best. Ascii Quake, Rob. It's only gonna be 20 bucks, it's supposed to be coming

1381
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,840
out in like two weeks. Well that's pretty awesome. Or you can buy one of the original

1382
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:54,600
copies for probably like 5 bucks, and get it now. Alright. Well if you're not into first

1383
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,580
person shooters, maybe you're into first person role playing games, and one of the biggest

1384
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:04,320
ones out there right now is Skyrim, and guess what, finally an expansion coming, we don't

1385
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,760
know exactly when yet, but we do finally have a title. This is one of those like, pre-E3

1386
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,080
leaks where the companies try to get a jump on all that press coverage that's gonna be,

1387
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:17,780
you know, cause everybody's fighting for time during E3 week. Like literally, I mean things

1388
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:21,200
get brutal during E3 week, like literally there's invites out there that are telling

1389
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:26,700
people, hey cancel your meeting and come to our booth. Like, really? That's how desperate

1390
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:32,360
people are to get seen at E3. So some people get the jump on it. So Bethesda leaked the

1391
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,840
trailer for Skyrim Dawnguard, the expansion, a little bit early. And you know there's a

1392
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,100
whole trailer out there that doesn't really say a whole lot except that there's gonna

1393
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:46,800
be a crossbow weapon, which we kinda already knew from some of the patch things. What is

1394
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,120
this? You can turn into a bunch of bats, so there's a vampire theme going on, which was

1395
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,440
already in the game, right? You can already be a vampire, but this actually shows like

1396
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,120
you can transform into like a giant bat thing and like fly, like kind of a really weird

1397
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,480
No no no no no no no bat thing. You know, bat thing, I don't know. You know, once again

1398
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,840
though the graphics, you know, look pretty good cause it's all in the, you know, Skyrim

1399
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,720
engine which looked good to begin with. Here's the somewhat bummer, if you were playing this

1400
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:17,360
on the Playstation 3 like I was or the PC like Alan was, you're shit out of luck cause

1401
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:23,820
this is coming to the Xbox 360 first for 1600 Microsoft points, that's 20 bucks in real

1402
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:30,920
money soon, as in this summer soon. 30 days later is when the rest of us can play it because

1403
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:39,400
Microsoft basically sold their soul to get this and so can you in the expansion to Skyrim.

1404
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:44,920
Because Microsoft gives it up better. So, I like the little castle on fire, the little

1405
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,520
like dark castle looking thing. It's like the little obsidian portal in Minecraft, but

1406
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,800
prettier. Uh, Loki, you played way more Skyrim than I did, what's your interest level in

1407
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,120
this? I'm interested in it, um, I'm not as excited as before, you know, cause I was like

1408
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,640
oh I'm gonna get whatever expansion they put out, but like it has to do with vampires.

1409
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,760
I haven't really done anything with vampires, I've been just trying to make sure I don't

1410
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,640
turn into a vampire because it's lame. Um, not because of Twilight, but I just don't

1411
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,320
want to be a vampire or a werewolf in the game. I like that horse that was on fire though.

1412
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,040
I like that map. But, we'll see. That glowing electron. Oh I think that was the Elder Scrolls.

1413
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,560
Um, you know what though, when you said that you were interested in that it totally made

1414
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,680
me think of Alucard. I'm interested in this. That is kinda, it does look like you can play

1415
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,720
as Alucard in this. That would be cool. I would play Skyrim if I could be Alucard. I

1416
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:42,320
just wish. You can name your character Alucard. I mean, it would be really impossible for

1417
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:48,880
them to add it later on cause it's such a rewrite of code, but I just want, you know,

1418
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,120
I know that they have Skyrim, or not Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, which is really weird

1419
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:59,000
because it gets lamer and lamer each update that they put out on it. It's like every update

1420
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,200
that there is for it, I get less and less interested in this game. But, I really wish

1421
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:10,400
there was just like co-op. Like four player co-op in Skyrim would be fucking awesome.

1422
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,280
Alright. Well, this is the part of the show where we'd move into the mailbag segment,

1423
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:23,200
except there's no emails tonight. So, instead we're gonna plug and say, email us! Mailbag

1424
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:29,360
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us. And we'll read your email next week. Shirley,

1425
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,760
with E3 going on, there's gonna be something that makes you want to email us and have your

1426
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,600
voice heard. So, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. And don't call them Shirley. Alright, let's

1427
01:17:37,600 --> 01:18:00,480
get into the FUs of the week. Lack of email makes us angsty. Um, my FD goes to this continuously

1428
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:10,040
not having a voice. So, yeah. Boo. Loki? Um, FU to the fact that I can't go to E3. I kind

1429
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:15,760
of miss going to E3 each year. It's been a couple years now that I haven't been able

1430
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:21,800
to go. Even if it is a lame E3, I still like going and playing this stuff. And my co-worker,

1431
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:29,080
well not my co-worker, my boss and his boss get to go. They go to meetings. It's like,

1432
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,360
so what did you go check out at E3? Oh, we didn't even go on the show floor. The fuck

1433
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,720
are you doing there then? Oh, I'm going to meetings. Oh, because you can't have meetings.

1434
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:45,440
To be fair. I understand. It is business. No, okay, no. I understand. It's business.

1435
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,600
But then they go through like, oh, we went through a couple of booth walkthroughs of

1436
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,600
like, like what was it? Last year. I'm trying to think of what they saw last year. It was

1437
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,440
something very lame. I don't even remember what it was. It may have been Bethesda. But

1438
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:08,440
yeah, it's just, they waste time there. We would like to display our new game cat butthole.

1439
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,320
No, no, no. I do take that back. It is their fault because you know why? Because they only

1440
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:18,200
go down for like one or two days. They miss a day or two of the time there and like, what

1441
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,760
the fuck? You could be hitting the show floor. But here's the thing. They don't fucking care

1442
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:32,920
and his boss. I'm sorry. Look, maybe next year, maybe next year. Um, I F you to just

1443
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,240
too much to do and not enough time to do it and F you to the fact that I kind of bring

1444
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:43,120
that on myself. So F you to that. That's what you get for procrastinating. It's not even

1445
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,960
procrastinating. It's just maybe, maybe I don't know how to say no. And maybe I need

1446
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,560
to learn that has nothing to do with this program or vog or anything like that. It's

1447
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,000
just other things in life that maybe I need to just say, maybe it's time to stop because

1448
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:08,280
I'm just too damn busy. So what? It is possible to say no. I say it to you all the time. No.

1449
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:14,900
All right. Anyhow, that's it for the F you to the week. Let's get into a few more stories

1450
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:20,680
for you guys before we say good night. Loki. Um, there's rumor that, well, there's always

1451
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:26,200
a rumor that there's going to be an announcement of an, a redesign of the three ds, but, um,

1452
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:30,480
it's actually looking like that it may actually happen this year. Um, and the reason behind

1453
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:36,140
that is Amazon has stopped carrying the three ds. Um, not necessarily that they've stopped

1454
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:41,040
selling it, but they themselves have stopped selling it on the website. It's only available

1455
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,360
through third party. Um, you know, providing like, cause you know, like any, anybody can

1456
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:52,020
go on Amazon sell stuff, but there's actually stuff that's sold directly by Amazon and that's

1457
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:58,220
in the U S region. Not only that, but in Japan they also have stopped, um, having the three

1458
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:03,800
ds available. So why do you think they've stopped selling the three ds? Maybe because

1459
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,560
there's another three ds coming out. Did somebody report the original three ds is flawed to

1460
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,700
Amazon and they stopped selling it. That could have happened too. Maybe. No. So I, well,

1461
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,940
what about the new color? I know that's crazy, but weren't they going to discontinue like

1462
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,020
blue or something because of the new color pan. They just continue. I'm talking about

1463
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:27,780
all colors, every single color in the U S right now. It will maybe not purple, but everything

1464
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:35,340
Aqua blue, Pearl, pink, um, Cosmo, black and flame red are all being shipped. Um, never

1465
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:40,100
fulfilled by Amazon. In other words, you know, they were doing the shipping, but not sold

1466
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:49,300
by Amazon. Um, so it's interesting. Um, the other thing is, you know, there, the thoughts

1467
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:54,020
are that there's a rumor that they're going to announce monster Hunter for, um, the three

1468
01:21:54,020 --> 01:22:03,540
ds coming, you know, this E3 as well for the North American region. All right. I mean,

1469
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:11,420
there's going to be a redesign. It's just when I think it could be this holiday. Uh,

1470
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:17,860
this is pretty shitty is a rumors and fakeness all over the interwebs. And, uh, I, I, I did

1471
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:21,860
want to bring it up though because there was a part of me that went, well, what if square

1472
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:25,900
Unix announced what's going to be at their booth? That part's not a lie. And what I thought

1473
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,780
was interesting was completely missing from that list was final fantasy versus 13 because

1474
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:33,660
it's like, shouldn't that fucking game be out by now? Like how long has that been in

1475
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:38,160
development and we've, you know, whatever. So the thought out there is, well, maybe it's

1476
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,540
like a secret. Maybe something's happening with it and they're going to show it at one

1477
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:47,940
of the conferences or something. So this crazy ass rumor came out complete with fake footage

1478
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:55,060
that final fantasy versus 13 was renamed to final fantasy 15 to be fair. That part I'd

1479
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:59,100
actually believe. I know a lot of people poo pooing that idea. I'd actually believe that.

1480
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,020
I still don't understand how they tie with each other. And you know what? I believe more

1481
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,980
that they renamed final fantasy versus 13 to final fantasy 14. What do you mean there

1482
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:18,220
was already a, just shh, but there's already a file fancy for shh. Anyhow, uh, it's just,

1483
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:23,380
and apparently the game was going to be coming to the Wii U. Now people, and I guess it's

1484
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:27,460
because of the footage was, I didn't even watch the footage, but I'm looking at it here.

1485
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:34,340
This like one minute clip here. Oh God, you can just tell that that's an overlaid thing.

1486
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:37,220
But apparently, you know, people are watching this footage or whatever, and then you see

1487
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:47,300
the logo for final fantasy 15 and yeah, it doesn't look too convincing. Um, but it did

1488
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:52,220
kind of make me stop and go, well, why couldn't it be on the Wii U? I mean the Wii U is supposed

1489
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:57,540
to be getting all this other stuff. Here's why they wouldn't put it all only on the Wii

1490
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:01,740
U. It's because we're supposed to be fair with PlayStation three and Wii U like somebody

1491
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:07,340
took out the Xbox logo and put the Wii U logo. They're not going to do that. I mean, come

1492
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:11,380
on. They know, they know that they need to make money on this stuff. They're not going

1493
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:17,180
to cut out the Xbox just because the Wii U, I mean they're, they, they sold plenty of

1494
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,660
copies of, you know, final fantasy 13 and 13 two on the Xbox that they're not going

1495
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,540
to ignore that 14 was cut for totally different reasons that had to do with the Xbox live

1496
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:30,900
infrastructure rules that were bent from final fantasy 11. Microsoft would not bend on again

1497
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:36,820
because 11 didn't do that well on Xbox. So it, I, they're not going to do that. I'm sorry

1498
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:42,940
if it's anything going to be for the Wii U or even like it's always been their own game

1499
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:47,340
that's been kind of lame on the Wii. So I think if there's anything on the Wii U, it's

1500
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:54,540
going to be another lame Crystal Chronicles game. Same. You never know. Well that if that

1501
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,700
whole Wii U being similar to the Game Boy Advance linking to the GameCube, there was

1502
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:03,300
that final fantasy game that was specifically for that setup. So it'd be very easy to make

1503
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,060
a sequel to that. Just don't see them doing, I don't, I don't see them coming out with,

1504
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:12,020
cause I've seen like rumors, of course, everybody's making up fucking rumors. I mean, there's,

1505
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:16,780
there's a rumor I read and even open the page because it just looks stupid. They're talking

1506
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:21,820
about, oh, Kingdom Hearts remix. It's going to have all these different characters and

1507
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,220
stuff from all these games. It's only going to be on the Wii. I'm like, no, it's not.

1508
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:30,080
They're not going to do that. Could Square be withholding Kingdom Hearts 3? Can I wish?

1509
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:36,260
Can I wish? They've got, they've got plenty of stuff that they're working on right now.

1510
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,760
If wishes and musts were buckets of, or no, damn it. If wishes and musts were clusters

1511
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:45,620
of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola. I screwed that up the first time. Sorry. It's

1512
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:50,900
a tongue twister. All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the end

1513
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:55,740
of the show cause there's no Skypline tonight cause we're not live, but Dark Saga. Well,

1514
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:02,100
it is official according to Tim Cook with Apple. Um, they don't really care about doing

1515
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:07,780
consoles. They're not interested in doing it right now. Maybe someday, but not now.

1516
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:13,420
They're, I mean, basically they're cool with the little, uh, IOS games. That's cool. In

1517
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,100
fact, he says customers love games and this makes me think of bitches love games, you

1518
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:22,780
know, but, um, he goes on a record saying, I'm not interested in being in the console

1519
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:27,420
business and what is thought of as traditional gaming, but Apple is a big player today and

1520
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:33,000
things in the future will only make that bigger. Well, if the rumor is true that they're building

1521
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,980
their own TVs and shit, then they can just take the iPad, iPhone stuff over to the TV.

1522
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:42,980
That's their money. It's just not console in the traditional sense. That's all. But

1523
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:46,320
you can't deny it. Apple's a player in gaming right now. They're probably thinking that

1524
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:53,980
they're beyond consoles anyway, so we're bigger than console. Really? Yeah. I mean, Smurfs

1525
01:26:53,980 --> 01:27:01,140
village just, you know, puts that gears award a shame. They just, they really don't need

1526
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:05,380
it. I mean this, to be honest, they don't need, I don't want to see Apple do a console.

1527
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:09,500
What they're doing right now is challenging the industry enough. I think, you know, especially

1528
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:14,660
Nintendo, the handheld market, they are, you can't deny that the iPhones and iPads are

1529
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:21,340
breathing a lot of heat on not just the Vita, but the, you know, three DS to the point where

1530
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:27,780
shareholders are calling on Nintendo to put Mario on the iPhone, which is, don't be terrible.

1531
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:32,420
I actually agree. It would be terrible cause the touch controls just wouldn't work. On

1532
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:38,740
a whim. I got mega man two on the iPhone. It is ass. It is the stuff that comes from

1533
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:42,660
the stuff comes out of an ass. You know what they could do though on the iPhone that would

1534
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:47,500
work is, um, like a Zelda game, like they have on the three. Yes. It was all stylist

1535
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:55,220
control. Oh yeah. It worked. It might work, but it's still side. All right, well that

1536
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:59,140
brings us to the end of the show. I checked Twitter earlier and nothing was sent today

1537
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,380
and uh, we don't have the Skype line cause we're not live. So that really brings us to

1538
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,460
the end of the show. I will ask Loki if there was anything we didn't cover tonight that

1539
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:10,420
he wanted to talk about last minute stories or dark soccer. Oh, you do have one. All right.

1540
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:18,860
Guitar P. It is a guitar P urinal that basically has like little strum bars in it and a big

1541
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:23,420
fret bar coming out of the top that you can pee in it and then you can actually get a

1542
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:28,460
code to download your piece on later. You know what's sad is that as a second time we've

1543
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:32,700
talked about P based games in a month. I, that's why I brought it up. I weep for our

1544
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:40,220
society is apparently a video up of what guitar P sounds like. No thank you. Yeah. Um, yeah,

1545
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,740
I do have a few things I was just going to cover real quick. So someone supported super

1546
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:51,580
road blaster to the SNES now super road blaster. Um, or I should say a road blaster, which

1547
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:57,540
was a 1985 laser disc arcade game with animations like full motion video thing like a dragon's

1548
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:04,180
layer or something like that. Um, he's actually created a rom file. That's 6,320 megabits.

1549
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:09,720
Although when you compare that with the largest SMES cartridge, which is like 48 megabits,

1550
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,780
it's a little impossible to run without special software. Um, you can actually get a card

1551
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:21,180
or SD, um, to SNES, uh, SD card adapter. They'll allow you to run the game on a physical SNES

1552
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:26,420
and it actually, it works and you can download the rom, which is 118 megs over it. Well,

1553
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:31,900
for a super Nintendo rom, that's huge. Um, and uh, it plays a full motion video and everything.

1554
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,740
It's pretty amazing. So that cartridge back in the day probably would have cost about

1555
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:44,780
$900. Yeah. It would have had to be like a super gigantic box. It would be the size of

1556
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:51,860
a constantly the size of the super NAS basically. Um, so they have that, uh, CD project red.

1557
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:56,820
Um, they announced a cyberpunk, um, which is going to be based off the pen and paper

1558
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:01,820
game. And I'm all about, you know, RPGs are like, you know, the cyberpunk stuff. So that

1559
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:05,980
looks pretty cool. I do have a late tweet. We got a tweet just now, uh, or I should say

1560
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:09,900
an hour ago, but that was, uh, while we were in the middle of the show. So here's a question

1561
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:15,260
from Oscar who sent a legit question for the show tonight. So we need to entertain it here.

1562
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:22,260
Oscar tweets us at twitter.com slash O L R asking tweet for the show. What is a game that frustrated

1563
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:31,300
you like no other, a game that frustrated you like no other puzzle and Dessu was one.

1564
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:36,260
Why is that? Just cause some of the puzzles get really hard and fast. I mean, it was just

1565
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:42,220
a pain. And then, um, shoot at something that actually will fractal actually for a little

1566
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:47,820
while was getting me super frustrated because, um, I'm on the part now where you have splits

1567
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:54,540
in weird places and um, it'll like completely mess up. You're trying to get your blooms.

1568
01:30:54,540 --> 01:31:03,460
So it's pretty fucked up. And a few, um, games with puzzles in them, few puzzles. For me,

1569
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,380
super meat boy, let me put it this way. Alan used to like ask me to play super meat boy

1570
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,380
cause he used to giggle when I would get really frustrated with the game. Like it was some

1571
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:14,540
type of satisfaction for him. So, uh, definitely super meat boy. But that's the whole point

1572
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:19,960
of that game is to get frustrated and want to throw the controller. Loki. Um, VVVVV.

1573
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:25,920
Oh God. Yes. Oh my God. I know what the, here's the thing is I played that game without downloading

1574
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:32,180
on steam and then I just now download it on steam. I can't import my safe. I'm like, fuck

1575
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:37,980
that. You can actually copy it, copy it directly out of the safe folder. I hope so. Cause I

1576
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,980
Not fucking doing that again

1577
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:45,000
On the on the 3ds. I'm just stuck in one level that I'm never gonna get past

1578
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,900
It's when that little asshole is following you and you can't get him killed either

1579
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:55,600
I finished all that but I have one more like little shiny object thing to get and it's just like

1580
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,280
No, I'm no I'm not doing it quit

1581
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:04,740
Quit I don't care all right. There's the tweet. Sorry any other stories Loki

1582
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:10,940
um yeah retro city rampage speaking of super meat boy has this cool little trailer that they put out for a

1583
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:18,380
Game within the game called the virtual meat boy. It's done like virtual the virtual boy, but you're playing as meat boy

1584
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:19,380
Oh, that's awesome

1585
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,260
And you also get to play as me boy in the game, too

1586
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:26,540
And it has 3d with like the red red blue glasses if you wanted that's funny because

1587
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:31,920
Super meat boy kind of had those throwback stages like there was the NES stages, and there was a gameboy stage

1588
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,720
I a virtual boy stage makes a lot of sense. That's kind of funny actually yeah, that's pretty awesome

1589
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,760
And then the last thing I was gonna mention real quick well actually two things

1590
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,760
Nintendo's patented a new kind of input device for the 3ds. It's a vibrating stylus

1591
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,960
It's gonna allow you to have some sort of haptic feedback for

1592
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,760
stuff based on the position I guess of

1593
01:32:54,360 --> 01:33:00,520
Where the stylus is the camera? I guess the vibrating stylus has changed things around you know usually

1594
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,520
We have a saying on the show called

1595
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:09,360
TTP whenever there's a new piece of hardware coming out, and that's time to penis, but I think this one's gonna be time to but

1596
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,760
TTB

1597
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,560
Maybe boob or V and then the last last one was kind of in the line of

1598
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,520
Why the fuck did they make this CTA did?

1599
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,320
our CTA

1600
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,020
Company that makes accessories, and I think they've made they made that

1601
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,100
I

1602
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:33,140
Think for was it a connect adventures member the raft

1603
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:39,360
That is completely poor. Oh god. Yes, it was just a raft. Oh my god. Yes, that's amazing. They have done

1604
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,980
Themselves one more they have made an inflatable

1605
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:46,820
Go kart that you can sit in and yes

1606
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:52,620
I can play the I heard of this already 3ds Mario Kart 7 game

1607
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:58,500
Oh for the 3ds now a giant inflatable cart for your portable console

1608
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,260
But you put your 3ds within this little like

1609
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:03,820
Steering wheel thing it's like why?

1610
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:09,940
Why would you spend $40 you don't need to pretend that you're in a cart? It's not

1611
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,460
Stupid it's just so stupid

1612
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,020
That's awesome. I'm done all right well

1613
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,080
