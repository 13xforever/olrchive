00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:24,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 3rd, 2012, rumored new Wii U functionality is revealed, details emerge on the next Skyrim expansion, and Apple answers rumors about an Apple console.

2
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:38,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:43,259
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

4
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,481
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, dog, what up?

6
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:49,063
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

7
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm full of curry.

8
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry, hurry, hurry.

9
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your rice and curry.

10
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:56,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.

11
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:57,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Thai, not Indian.

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

13
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerds out there will know that song.

14
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,072
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:03,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

16
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:03,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

17
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:04,996
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

18
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:06,177
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:43,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're actually taping here on Thursday, May the 31st So a little disclaimer before we get into the news too much tonight Especially with all the E3 stuff starting to come out Things may have changed between the night we taped this and the night you guys hear it Why did we do that this week?

20
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:52,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as I mentioned on last week's show, I'm going to be out of town Therefore the OLR studio will be closed that night And Loki really wants a night to sit at home and play Minecraft all night uninterrupted

21
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,299
[SPEAKER_03]: IDDQD IDDQD

22
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:22,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't die.

23
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:27,049
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really for the poor programming of the game.

24
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:35,853
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the future updates and stuff, when you're digging underground, you know if there's lava one brick away from where you're digging.

25
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:37,534
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't in this game.

26
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're digging and all of a sudden, oh crap, lava, killing me.

27
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:45,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first tip I got about playing Minecraft is never dig straight down.

28
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't digging straight down.

29
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I was digging straight forward.

30
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,857
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all of a sudden I hit a block in Lava Flow.

31
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead.

32
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, thanks.

33
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,878
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, we'll talk more about our gaming weeks in a little bit.

34
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:28,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you still took the time off from work so you can kind of watch it, right?

35
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't take any time off work, but I'll still be watching it.

36
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But technically it's related to your job so you can kind of get away with it.

37
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I'm awesome like that.

38
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think that my work is more interesting.

39
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:45,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this year especially, you know, I'm feeling a little eh about E3 this year.

40
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.

41
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And to go into it with low expectations is probably a good place to be.

42
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,823
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think Bobby put it best.

43
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:58,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, of course, the man who you hear before us on Sunday nights at VOG Network.

44
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:04,387
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, you know, if I had to miss my first E3 in, I think he said it was...

45
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think the bar is so low this year?

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,592
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the Wii U. Is excitement really that low about Wii U or what?

47
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:30,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the Wii U is doing enough different to make it like, ooh, wow.

48
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the graphics are like, whoa, that much better.

49
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:37,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, whoa, this is a totally new technology way of controlling things.

50
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:38,196
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically...

51
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:47,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look, we made a big DS minus a D. But isn't this a good place for Nintendo to be, though?

52
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that sounds really weird.

53
00:04:50,228 --> 00:05:01,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody likes the negative buzz, and obviously E3 kind of left them with a very meh feeling, a lot of people walking out of the Wii U. But, I mean, when the bar is low, they really have the potential to...

54
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,436
[SPEAKER_05]: For a whole year, they'll be on the cutting edge.

55
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:32,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And even still, you know, even those new systems, you remember the very first, you know, games that were coming out on the, you know, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 just kind of looked like up-res PlayStation 2 and Xbox games.

56
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:40,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's not always, you know, the biggest, best looking, well, definitely never the best looking games at launch.

57
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:42,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, ways after that.

58
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:57,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so quickly, I know we kind of talked about this a little more in depth a couple weeks ago, so I don't want to dwell on this topic too long, but since this is our last chance before E3 officially hits and the press conferences start, what are your final predictions out of E3?

59
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: One prediction each for the big three.

60
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your final big predictions out of E3?

61
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:02,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

62
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:03,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Or DarkSakura?

63
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be asleep when they're made.

64
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me ask you, DarkSakura, do you have any interest in Wii U at all?

65
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,439
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

66
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:48,229
[SPEAKER_05]: because when you say you're apathetic and you don't care it makes me think that Nintendo's just not doing anything to excite you that there's nothing that's happening there that you go oh this is new and fascinating

67
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:49,916
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

68
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really excited about it.

69
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be excited until I actually sit down and see it.

70
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:24,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, I feel somewhat similar, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

71
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really hoping there's that one game that I gotta have.

72
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:29,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

73
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, predictions for the big three?

74
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what Nintendo's... Just based on what they've rumored to be coming out in the new Mario game, New Super Mario Bros.

75
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:47,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, which I think is what it's supposed to be.

76
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:48,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, that does not appeal to me at all.

77
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:49,504
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

78
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,404
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't ever appeal to me.

79
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:54,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand... Well, the one with the DS was pretty cool.

80
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:56,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Wii one came out.

81
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And then number two's coming out.

82
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all look the same.

83
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:00,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I don't care.

84
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it would do something innovative.

85
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:14,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Take one of those franchises like Mario or Zelda and do a little Big Planet thing with it.

86
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Have this fucking amazing level editor with it.

87
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:22,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You can even make it like an old 16-bit Zelda.

88
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:23,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that.

89
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:28,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Re-release that and have this fucking amazing level editor where you can share it online and stuff like that.

90
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to bring you back because this isn't a prediction.

91
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,015
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wank.

92
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,819
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you want to see.

93
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,100
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't what you're going to see.

94
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm prepared to be completely underwhelmed by Nintendo.

95
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:41,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my prediction.

96
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:47,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll talk about all this wonderful stuff that the Wii U can do.

97
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:54,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be just these stupid games that... Hey, look, it's WWE 13, but with this extra feature.

98
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, look, it's Darksiders 2, but this extra feature.

99
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, look, it's Batman Arkham City that came out last year, but it has this extra feature.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fucking care.

101
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not gonna make me... I'm not buying another console because it has a cool gimmick.

102
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I want something that's going to be a little bit different.

103
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,789
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii was very different than what was out there on the market.

104
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,411
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was interested in it.

105
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was completely boring later on because there was nothing really good for it.

106
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing I really needed to have.

107
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,725
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Microsoft and Sony?

108
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping we'll see... They'll probably announce their TV thing.

109
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole initiative where they're going to have some sort of IPTV.

110
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:51,772
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kind of nice.

111
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:55,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all these little apps that they have that are tied to your cable.

112
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you can have the Xfinity app.

113
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but you have to have Xfinity in order to actually view any of the content on there.

114
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fuck.

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,821
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

116
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:03,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that on my PC.

117
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:04,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I need your stupid...

118
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:08,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It says very useless for me.

119
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:12,728
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something like, hey, you pay for Xbox Live and you get TV content with that.

120
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:14,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

121
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:14,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

122
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I don't have to pay for cable.

123
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, cable doesn't want you to do that, but we'll see.

124
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:26,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for PlayStation, Sony, I mean, I don't know.

125
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:29,379
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, it kind of, it's going back to what we were saying before.

126
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very meh.

127
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,780
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing I'm really expecting.

128
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:32,801
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

129
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing like, oh, I can't wait to hear from,

130
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,200
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity Rush I hear is kind of okay.

132
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,323
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a demo out for Gravity Rush.

133
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:02,324
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a demo out for both, but I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet.

134
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I hear it's okay, but it's not like, woo, gotta have that.

135
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:09,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Resistance was one of those things I was like, ooh, first-person shooter, that might be really cool.

136
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear it's just kind of meh.

137
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, well, crap.

138
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have to wait until the fall for some good games to come out.

139
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're back to the 3DS again, where it's just like...

140
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, crap.

141
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,162
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I gotta wait until the fall for some good games to come out.

142
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:28,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, am I gonna have to sell this system too?

143
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll go real quick.

144
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:36,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo obviously is gonna be very heavy on the Wii U and the 3DS.

145
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

146
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,980
[SPEAKER_05]: This may just be the fanboy wanking me, but I kind of think they're going to drop F-Zero on us and I'm going to have to get one.

147
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what's going to ultimately happen.

148
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:52,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there'll be something kind of cool where that little tablet's going to have the map and kind of like the racer's cockpit or something.

149
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:57,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe something like being able to use power-ups and stuff will be all on the little touch screen.

150
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the HD screen will be nothing but gorgeousness.

151
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, possible fan wank, but there are rumors that that could be the big one that's being dropped.

152
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:07,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to remain hopeful.

153
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope this is Nintendo's chance to finally prove that they get online and I think they are going to show that they get online finally but no more so than say Sony you know it's not going to be like oh my god Nintendo's the must have online so I think they'll do about as well as Sony

154
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:27,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft.

155
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:31,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know what they can do to impress me at this point.

156
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if they are going to be hedging their bets on two big first person shooters which usually aren't my kind of game.

157
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what to think.

158
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see new franchises.

159
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do too.

160
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:46,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I want something to be on Kinect that's interesting.

161
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:50,150
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that whole Gladiator game they showed last year that we never really heard anything about again.

162
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine they're going to show more of that this year but I'm not

163
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:54,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Fable of Journey.

164
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be their big Kinect game.

165
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:58,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not on rails!

166
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

167
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, a great example of where the bar is really effing low.

168
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a chance to blow me away.

169
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe.

170
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

171
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I liked Fable 2.

172
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's ever going to be another good Fable.

173
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:11,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

174
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:15,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be willing to bet Rise isn't going to come out for this console.

175
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I want to say about Microsoft, though, is I still think Windows 8.

176
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Windows 8 gets dropped at some point during the conference.

177
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Microsoft's big push at the end of the year as a company.

178
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole synergy.

179
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,862
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be something with your Xbox and Windows 8.

180
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:31,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait.

181
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:32,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fantastic.

182
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

183
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching a video of that interface today.

184
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, there are things that they've made improvements to, but that fucking Metro desktop is... That is all optional, right?

185
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to use that, right?

186
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:47,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

187
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:47,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Question mark?

188
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It replaces the start menu.

189
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:50,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

190
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:50,909
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

191
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:52,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony.

192
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:57,351
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sony is so unpredictable, and yet I think is really predictable.

193
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, you're going to have the God of War.

194
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:04,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have probably more hints of The Last Guardian and the PlayStation fighting game, but at the same time...

195
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,335
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

196
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:30,183
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think there will still be, of course, more Vita and I'm hoping for more Vita, PlayStation 3 kind of, you know, togetherness.

197
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

198
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that, what was that dungeon crawler game that never ended up coming out with the Vita's launch?

199
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it's called now.

200
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:40,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaporware the game?

201
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: No, something, it's like Diablo but not

202
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: They showed that off last year.

203
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:44,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine more of that.

204
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,639
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the one that was at launch, the Ubisoft title that ties in.

205
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,400
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

206
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about that.

207
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:50,342
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know what you're talking about, the Sony one.

208
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:51,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the hell it's called.

209
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Sorcery either.

210
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:53,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That came out and that's the Vita.

211
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,046
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not Sorcery.

212
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know what you're talking about.

213
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

214
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they just were talking about like, oh, hey, where's that game?

215
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:58,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

216
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

217
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's some pretty cool ideas that they have for new franchises.

218
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Cameo?

219
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,409
[SPEAKER_03]: The launch title for the 360?

220
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,630
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really cool looking when they showed it off at E3.

221
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:34,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay when it came out, but it could have been a good sequel, huh?

222
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:37,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been a good title.

223
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:42,557
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of game was pretty cool and not something that really the Xbox has from Microsoft.

224
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,978
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have that type of platforming like a Ratchet and Clank or something.

225
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,660
[SPEAKER_03]: They need something like that.

226
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,541
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

227
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:53,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move on here and start to get into tonight's news.

228
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kind of wrap things up, though, again, hopefully we're all pleasantly surprised.

229
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:01,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're feeling kind of eh about this year's E3.

230
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:14,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope it gets people buzzed because this Christmas could be quite a disaster for video games in general if there's not anything to get excited about.

231
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:15,235
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be bad.

232
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one thing, though.

233
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: If the video game market could live through a recession, I don't know that it's going to have a problem.

234
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:28,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but if this year is bad, that could have a real impact on the Sony Microsoft consoles next year.

235
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, please, Grand Theft Auto for October.

236
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:32,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, Grand Theft Auto for October.

237
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

238
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:34,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, what is that?

239
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lego City stories.

240
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Still want to hear about that.

241
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually might sell me a Wii U. Maybe.

242
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

243
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,006
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

244
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:07,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, by the time you guys hear this, the full VOGnetwork.com website should have launched.

245
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to think what tense to use here.

246
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:19,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So, since you guys are hearing this Sunday, we had a special on Friday talking about the future of the network.

247
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:25,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to repeat it here because it's like 95% a go right now, but there is a chance it could be delayed to the 8th.

248
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:26,259
[SPEAKER_01]: We will has had.

249
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you will has had by this point.

250
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:33,365
[SPEAKER_05]: My hope is, though, by the time you guys are hearing this, the full VOGnetwork.com website did, in fact, launch.

251
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:37,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So check it out and just... It's going to be awesome.

252
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:42,372
[SPEAKER_02]: There were unicorns and rainbows and... I don't know about unicorns, but there may be rainbows.

253
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:47,836
[SPEAKER_05]: There was definitely a unicorn on the test site, but I think that's being removed for the full... There were sheep.

254
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:48,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting.

255
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:49,318
[SPEAKER_02]: There were sheep.

256
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:50,889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

257
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,285
[SPEAKER_05]: All the E3 talk got me sidetracked.

258
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:21,546
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

259
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: We've only had half a week, too.

260
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:29,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I played... Actually, Dan got the new Arkham City expansion.

261
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: The Harley Quinn's Revenge.

262
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:32,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that looked really neat.

263
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:37,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched about half of it and then I had to go to bed because I had taken NyQuil and I was like...

264
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You play a lot of it as Robin.

265
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,241
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I liked Harley Quinn's voice actor, she gets really annoying after a while, so whatever.

266
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:59,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, for fans of certain little Easter eggs that were found in the game before, you're going to get pissed off.

267
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:00,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just saying.

268
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get your hopes up.

269
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:02,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

270
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:06,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I already know exactly what it's gotta be, alright.

271
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:17,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I played, I had this really good streak in Fractal, which I love that fucking game.

272
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Fractal is so fun.

273
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:24,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a really good streak and then I got pissed off at the game again and stopped playing.

274
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:38,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, then I played like some WoW and played some Star Trek Online only to find out that they completely redid your skills and it's stupid.

275
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:42,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, I don't have my kick-ass bomb skills anymore.

276
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:45,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you hate that when you leave an MMO and then you come back and they change everything?

277
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:46,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

278
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:46,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

279
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:53,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, like, some of the stuff I have, my legacy items are pretty good, so.

280
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:54,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good.

281
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:58,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still the, the, I'm still an Admiral piloting a Defiant.

282
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still playing with all the Scottish people?

283
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I weren't on.

284
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:03,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a couple people were on and they weren't the Scotsmen.

285
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:04,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

286
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:06,899
[SPEAKER_02]: They're apparently all still there.

287
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,541
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just there at weird times.

288
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:09,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

289
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:10,783
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

290
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

291
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Minecraft.

292
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you did.

293
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I played lots of Minecraft.

294
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:18,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I built a giant pig.

295
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I saw the pictures on your Twitter.

296
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say you built a giant pig, you must have found the pixel layout somewhere online.

297
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,518
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a guide online.

298
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:31,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

299
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, it was like a hollow pig.

300
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You could climb up the ladder.

301
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can climb up the ladder into it.

302
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a house.

303
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,521
[SPEAKER_05]: You live in its butt.

304
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:39,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You can live inside.

305
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:40,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess, actually, here's the best part.

306
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:43,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the dinosaurs in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

307
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when they go to watch the sunrise?

308
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You can live in a pig's ass.

309
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:04,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

310
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought that would be fun.

311
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what do I want to build next?

312
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll build a giant pig.

313
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,881
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing is scary.

314
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:12,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll be running through and then I'll look at when I'll see this pig.

315
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:16,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, it's always there staring at you.

316
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:17,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, I have a question for you.

317
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:20,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you make a slide?

318
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you could totally make a tongue slide for your pig.

319
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,591
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make a water slide.

320
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make, you should make a drooling pig water slide.

321
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to make a water slide out of its bum?

322
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of gross.

323
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:31,583
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

324
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:33,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it in its mouth so it can be the drooling pig.

325
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not making, I thought about making, see, I was going to have that pig and I was going to have, like, another pig that I reskin, like, you know, to make it all evil looking, like with glowing eyes and fire and, like, spikes.

326
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:45,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Darth Pig.

327
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Darth Pig.

328
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:49,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Da, da, da, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

329
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny, though, because all the pigs keep wandering around the giant pig.

330
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they're worshipping the idol.

331
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

332
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:02,058
[SPEAKER_01]: All hail our bacon-y god!

333
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and another thing, too, Rob, since we're on the same map.

334
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:10,864
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I started a new map, actually.

335
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: What?!

336
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm on seed OLR.

337
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not on seed VOG anymore.

338
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I got sick of VOG.

339
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick of OLR, too, actually.

340
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,071
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go back to VOG, because you know why?

341
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:32,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you go to the bottom, was it the bottom, the southwestern portion of the map, there's this giant hole that goes straight into the ground with a waterfall in it and stuff, and it's pretty awesome inside there.

342
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:33,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

343
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you need to do?

344
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to put a video on YouTube of your giant pig.

345
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:38,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I'm done.

346
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:50,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to have... I've already... I'm planning on making a giant roller coaster ride thing or possibly... Oh, my God.

347
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,236
[SPEAKER_03]: They even have water slides that you can make.

348
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,797
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make a water slide thing with jumps and all this cool stuff.

349
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: What has happened just three months ago?

350
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I should go find a clip from this show just three months ago.

351
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Minecraft?

352
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

353
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people play Minecraft?

354
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get this game.

355
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:05,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just ask DarkSakura.

356
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:06,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, DarkSakura, what do you think of Minecraft?

357
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:12,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then Loki in the meantime, I'm gonna make a fucking Minecraft theme park!

358
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

359
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:14,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

360
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as somebody either pays for me to have an account or gets it to me for free somehow... Just play the demo.

361
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:22,804
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't like demos.

362
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:24,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pay for you to quit complaining.

363
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,759
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

364
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:59,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember back when I had the volume and the little thing said give me a dollar?

365
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:01,819
[SPEAKER_02]: People did send me dollars.

366
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,421
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple people.

367
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:04,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone sent me a $2 bill.

368
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:06,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Kickstarter to buy Jamie Minecraft.

369
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:08,027
[SPEAKER_02]: This was before Kickstarter.

370
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be paying me.

371
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:10,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

372
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:11,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

373
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:12,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of Call of Duty.

374
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:16,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually played a Kill Confirmed game with just the three of us, so that was fun.

375
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't play a lot of Call of Duty anymore because everyone's really busy and my co-worker's out for a couple weeks.

376
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get more Minecraft time then.

377
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, I started getting bored, though.

378
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:34,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because I'm like, well, I don't know really what else to do in here.

379
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,169
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, I don't know.

380
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

381
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I may actually go start a new seed at some point.

382
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know.

383
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the old R seed?

384
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that great, actually.

385
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:44,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I haven't explored the entire map.

386
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:48,898
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can tell you, the underground really annoys the hell out of me.

387
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some weird... There's like... Okay, if you want, like, just this gigantic mountain...

388
00:24:55,043 --> 00:25:01,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I would almost play it just to see how different it is.

389
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some seeds I've seen that are really crazy, like just valleys inside of a mountain with lava and water and all sorts of...

390
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whenever we get those VOG forums that may or may not be there I have no idea what the crap you guys are talking about You should share some of your awesome seeds for Minecraft Alright, look, let's move on What seed?

391
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:37,261
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell it what word you give it You can give it random numbers and letters You give it a word and you can make a world that uses that as the seed But the good thing about that is that if I use capital V, capital O, capital G and he uses the same thing, we have the same world essentially

392
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's kind of randomized, if that makes sense.

393
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:46,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking of Final Fantasy VIII now, where there were seed members in their gardens.

394
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:47,723
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

395
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:48,803
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, My Gaming Week.

396
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:56,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I've been working on the website, not as much as Bobby has, but I still have been working on that quite a bit this week, so I haven't had a whole lot of time to game.

397
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:59,466
[SPEAKER_05]: When I have gamed, I've played a little bit of Warcraft.

398
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:02,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane and I have been running some dungeons to get heirlooms for the monks.

399
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We will inevitably roll in the expansion.

400
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:08,310
[SPEAKER_05]: and otherwise I checked out the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer expansion.

401
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the Rebellion Pack or was that the last one?

402
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

403
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:13,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Recruit Pack.

404
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Something war related.

405
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Another freaking multiplayer pack came out this week and it adds the two male Quarians, the two Cerberus defectors and the two Vorcha.

406
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:26,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang, people are already unlocking shit.

407
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:32,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I went into a random and I already was playing with a male Corian, which was kind of neat to just kind of see one running around.

408
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to play on one of the new maps.

409
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:36,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are two new maps.

410
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:41,028
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is, I think it's Thessia was the one I was playing on because it's based off that one.

411
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't want to spoil it because it's staged near the end of the game, but something big happens there.

412
00:26:45,669 --> 00:27:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: so I was yeah I was having a good time on that map and apparently there's a new type of credit game too on the third sixth and tenth wave you have to do something different than just killing everybody it's either like hit the four beacons or upload all the data now there's a new one that's kind of like fetch it and bring it back

413
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: so and it's kind of like Murderball where the person who's carrying it walks really slow and is more vulnerable to attack so I kind of like that they're doing different things with it you know Mass Effect good times after finally having played the entire fucking trilogy up to this point it's kind of nice to be current and get to experience a lot of this Mass Effect hubble when it's current so that part's cool all right now we can do gaming news right yes all right let's do it

414
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:30,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Or The Phantom

415
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: SnakeOil

416
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:11,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

417
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:33,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

418
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,001
[SPEAKER_03]: to coexist with regular stuff like renting titles or stuff like that.

419
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:51,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's never going to be you just play.

420
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:56,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Until it's the holodeck, there will always be a need for another console.

421
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Or until it will suck your dick.

422
00:28:59,105 --> 00:28:59,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real.

423
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:05,888
[SPEAKER_05]: The console either has to be the holodeck or if they build the console that sucks your dick, then they don't need anything else.

424
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I lose out.

425
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:07,188
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

426
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm losing out there.

427
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, now, now.

428
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:10,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the holodeck.

429
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,150
[SPEAKER_03]: You can demand whores in the holodeck.

430
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be an inverter for women.

431
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:17,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just saying, though, there's never... In terms of the vacuum attachment.

432
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: There's never... Well, even when those, you know, even the blowjob machine and the holodeck come out, they're going to need to make improvements to that.

433
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:27,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be improvements done to everything.

434
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

435
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be too bad if you get a glitchy hoe.

436
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

437
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:36,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it go, let it go, let it go.

438
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,895
[SPEAKER_03]: No, female attachment, not the male attachment.

439
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad.

440
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:43,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so...

441
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it could be interesting.

442
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll have to wait and see what's going on there.

443
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:58,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that announcement next week will be in the works if they are going to do something like that.

444
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a lot of sense.

445
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make a lot of sense.

446
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:14,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they could do a lot of different... I mean, I don't think it's going to be only that because another thing that they considered, at least Sony did, was making it online only.

447
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

448
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:41,693
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah think about this though real quick if they do adopt like a cloud gaming thing then they can have all the fucking control you know what I mean think about it because when it's in there they get all of the fucking control like they could release like a beta game or something that you could play for like an hour and then it's like pulled you know it's like and then the advertisements right in the middle of it and there's nothing you can do about it like that part of it's kind of

449
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:43,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting to me.

450
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:46,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they could do that, and then everybody else doesn't do that, and then no one plays it.

451
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:51,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

452
00:30:51,756 --> 00:31:02,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, basically they ultimately rejected the idea of a download-only console because they remembered, hey, we released something called the PlayStation Portable Go, and that sucked.

453
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So they decided not to do that instead.

454
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,921
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

455
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:32,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even better, it's like Sony puts out online-only consoles.

456
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:35,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Servers for online console are being throttled.

457
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,631
[SPEAKER_03]: No one can play anything on their console.

458
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:39,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

459
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:43,496
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you buy the special Xfinity version, then it won't count against your cap.

460
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:47,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Comcast subsidized two-year agreement.

461
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you.

462
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, if it goes online-only, hey, guess what?

463
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, console makers?

464
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a little fact for you.

465
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

466
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's funny you bring up PC games because Diablo 3 is one of the big PC games, of course, in the world right now.

467
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, they've been having quite a few issues, especially launch day was really bad.

468
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:28,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It got a little better for a little bit, but just within the past couple days before we're taping this show, apparently there's been more error 37s.

469
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:31,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The auction house has been delayed and so on.

470
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:35,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one country is taking this shit seriously and it's Korea.

471
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They take their Diablo series, they take all their Blizzard games seriously.

472
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:41,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I knew that those WoW subscriptions were expensive, but man, that they're collecting souls now, that's just ridiculous.

473
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

474
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:06,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard apparently refused to refund Diablo 3 to Korean players who should have been eligible after consumer complaints.

475
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:12,825
[SPEAKER_05]: The FTC thinks that Blizzard is violating Korean law on electronic commerce and commercial contracts.

476
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:16,827
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to gather evidence and so forth related to this raid.

477
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:22,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Korean players are frustrated with the server issues happening in Diablo 3 and asking for refunds.

478
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard denied it saying contract terms.

479
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:25,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that whole little...

480
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:36,214
[SPEAKER_05]: The FTC is considering these terms to not be good to the player base, as you can imagine.

481
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, we have received many complaints from Diablo 3 users.

482
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:46,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just like people here complain to the government, it's happening in Korea too, and they raided the office.

483
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:50,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I always have a problem with those contracts, if you will, anyways, because...

484
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:53,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not presenting that contract before I purchase the item.

485
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:58,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I get this sprung upon me once I open the box and try and install and play the game.

486
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:01,502
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, it's like, too fucking late.

487
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha.

488
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:04,063
[SPEAKER_03]: You either agree to this or you get nothing.

489
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:18,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one very interesting note I want to share is according to the Korea Times, the FTC is investigating if Blizzard should be liable for its ill preparation in regards to player traffic.

490
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:43,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I've ever heard anything like that before that's interesting basically that Blizzard could be responsible for not being prepared for how big their game was going to be I don't know why but I find that fucking fascinating and I think that they should be liable because they had a beta they knew how much traffic was going to be in there and they need to have enough servers and they didn't I mean come on

491
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:45,995
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to expect the worst case scenario.

492
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,116
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have those extra servers.

493
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:47,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to cut costs.

494
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what?

495
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have to make this an online only fucking game.

496
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:06,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your fault.

497
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, looking ahead here, if something were to happen, and let's say the game gets pulled in Korea or something, it's not actually the worst case scenario for Blizzard because the real money auction house already doesn't exist in Asia.

498
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:23,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that was also because of Korea.

499
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:24,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't let them do it.

500
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:28,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's still one to watch though.

501
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,271
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of unprecedented.

502
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:34,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very curious to see what comes of this.

503
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, this could also just be, you know, for headlines and, you know, to let everybody know we are not messing around, people.

504
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,396
[SPEAKER_05]: This could just end up being a big slap on the wrist and negative press.

505
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:44,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

506
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:47,537
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as negative press.

507
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:48,677
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only press.

508
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:50,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting way to look at it.

509
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:52,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's true.

510
00:35:52,678 --> 00:35:54,359
[SPEAKER_03]: What about press with a negative slant?

511
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,420
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Lee press on nails?

512
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:56,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

513
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

514
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Tacky in more ways than one.

515
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of tacky, Konami, bitches.

516
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:14,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how many of us were led to believe that the Silent Hill HD collection was a port?

517
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That they were porting and then reskinning and redoing voices and stuff?

518
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Up to the part with the fog?

519
00:36:21,674 --> 00:36:22,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I kind of thought that.

520
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:27,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was actually not ported from the final version of the game.

521
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ported from incomplete source code.

522
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:37,406
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually lost the source codes for the Silent Hill games.

523
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:41,889
[SPEAKER_05]: The missing source code parts were replaced with frog DNA.

524
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how they got Jurassic Park.

525
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:50,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here is what the producer, Tom Hewlett, had to say.

526
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like they just were working with what was left over.

527
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:20,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sort of like what you do when you've got leftover spaghetti, but you don't have enough to make a full meal out of it.

528
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:23,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make a sandwich or something out of your spaghetti.

529
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:24,876
[SPEAKER_05]: A spaghetti sandwich.

530
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it.

531
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:25,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

532
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:26,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in college.

533
00:37:27,237 --> 00:37:28,398
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, ladies and gentlemen?

534
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any other gaming podcast in the history of ever would compare Silent Hill HD to a spaghetti sandwich, but there you go.

535
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,462
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both terrible.

536
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:38,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, spaghetti sandwiches.

537
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:43,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold spaghetti sandwich on sourdough bread is actually okay.

538
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying, just saying.

539
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a sloppy joe with noodles.

540
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Subway sells meatball sandwiches.

541
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,251
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not very good either.

542
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:58,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, though, that's why we had all the issues because they used frog DNA instead of fog DNA.

543
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,517
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fog in there because they didn't use the right DNA.

544
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:03,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-uh-uh, you didn't say the magic word.

545
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-uh-uh.

546
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:13,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other thing, the other quote in here was saying, and this is actually pretty funny, I'm going to read this, okay.

547
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:24,217
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of issues such as textures and sound had to be taken out of the compiled game, and that brings with it a host of unique issues, especially when taken on top of the tricky coding workarounds at play in the original games.

548
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly had our hands full, I think at one point Heather was blue.

549
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,861
[SPEAKER_03]: La la la la la la la la la la la la.

550
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you can't cut it, then don't make the game.

551
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's deadlines and investors and stuff.

552
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry internets.

553
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:58,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if people have decompiled the release versions of the games, why couldn't they just do the same thing?

554
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I look at shit like that Sonic HD that outdid Sonic 4 Episode 1, and I kind of go, they did it without the original source code.

555
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

556
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: or wasn't the Streets of Rage HD collection done with completely original programming?

557
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:20,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was that fan one, yeah.

558
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:22,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all both 2D stuff.

559
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:27,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, this wasn't necessarily something that they needed to make.

560
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:28,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They had put these games out before.

561
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they feel compelled?

562
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:32,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know, money.

563
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they wanted a quick buck.

564
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:36,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I didn't buy it, honestly.

565
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:38,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did they put the source code?

566
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:41,468
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think that kind of stuff goes in a vault somewhere.

567
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:44,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira Yamaoka smuggled it out in his butt.

568
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

569
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:48,272
[SPEAKER_05]: He left Konami and took it with him.

570
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a drive could get demagnetized or something, but how do you lose source code?

571
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you make backups.

572
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:56,258
Backups.

573
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet someone could find it on eBay.

574
00:39:58,221 --> 00:39:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you check behind the couch?

575
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look online.

576
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:02,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Source Code.

577
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:03,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

578
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:10,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for games coming to a store near you that are hopefully finished.

579
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:12,544
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

580
00:40:33,402 --> 00:40:39,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Madagascar 3, tying in the new movie that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS.

581
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:47,744
[SPEAKER_03]: The new play control stuff is being re-released.

582
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:53,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the Mario Power Tennis on the Wii, which is a port of the GameCube game.

583
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Pikmin 2, because Pikmin 2 never came out over here for some reason.

584
00:40:58,513 --> 00:41:03,658
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those, oh hey, we localized this game, but oh, we forgot to release it in the other territory.

585
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole new play control thing, right?

586
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it came out in 2009.

587
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put out a game on the Wii.

588
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:09,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

589
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:13,453
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's seriously.

590
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:17,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know that the Wii is just like a GameCube.

591
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:21,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We could take GameCube games and we'll add the Wii controls to it.

592
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you kind of have to add the Wii controls to it because there are no GameCube controls.

593
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:32,368
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, that's actually a guarantee on some of the new consoles because there's no GameCube controller ports.

594
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Or backwards compatibility anymore.

595
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:36,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Or backwards compatibility, yes.

596
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:37,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

597
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh.

598
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:46,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a Sims 3 fan, Jamie... I lost count.

599
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Sims 3 Katy Perry Sweet Treats Pack.

600
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:51,776
[SPEAKER_03]: More Katy Perry!

601
00:41:52,016 --> 00:41:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in time for the movie.

602
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually officially stopped playing Sims 3.

603
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:07,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they never, every time they would release it, they would never work out how to get it to not have the crappy slowdown issue with your add-ons and stuff.

604
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:09,034
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what this calls for?

605
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:11,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Katy Perry Simlish music!

606
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:12,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good video.

607
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:27,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is a cute little video.

608
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:30,277
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not in it.

609
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:30,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forget it.

610
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop shading.

611
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and that's, I kid you not, that's literally it.

612
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:43,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you count Max Payne 3, which technically for us is coming out tomorrow, but it would have been out on Friday.

613
00:42:45,215 --> 00:43:03,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, on PC Let's travel to Japan and check out the release dates over there Not a whole lot to get excited about but there's a couple games here and there On the PlayStation 3, Tokyo Jungle comes out this week and I'm not sure exactly what this game is Sounds like a zombie game Fucking amazing is what it is

00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:09,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so it's like 28 days later.

[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you hear about this?

00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:42,668
[SPEAKER_03]: From them talking about Tokyo Jungle.

641
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:43,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this coming out here?

642
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,891

643
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:46,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It very well could.

644
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted actually a thing on Twitter about it because they were talking about dogs and stuff like that, palmerians.

645
00:43:57,582 --> 00:43:58,503
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to be a Pomeranian?

646
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:00,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can be a Pomeranian.

647
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:01,705
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a stinking ad.

648
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:02,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

649
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wait for this.

650
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:06,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy me 30 seconds.

651
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:07,428
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Pomeranians.

652
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:08,449
[SPEAKER_03]: They have wolves.

653
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play as horses, cows.

654
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:13,632
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have different rabbits.

655
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:14,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be a fox?

656
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:15,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could be a fox.

657
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:16,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to.

658
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, the best part about it is you unlock costumes for them.

659
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get an elephant in roller skates and you can dress them up.

660
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:23,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I need this game.

661
00:44:23,915 --> 00:44:25,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a ridiculous looking game.

662
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... I need this game.

663
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just crazy.

664
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:30,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so now... Here we go.

665
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Tokyo Jungle.

666
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:34,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's by Sony.

667
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Or published by Sony.

668
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Japan Studio.

669
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

670
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:42,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Krispies!

671
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:44,672
[SPEAKER_05]: How many freaking publishers?

672
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

673
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:49,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we just see like an abandoned city.

674
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:50,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Tokyo.

675
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:53,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Tokyo.

676
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:55,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Dog.

677
00:44:55,815 --> 00:44:57,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't a dog.

678
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:58,915
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like a panther person.

679
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:05,497
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really terrible radio, y'all.

680
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember.

681
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Akotaku.

682
00:45:10,158 --> 00:45:10,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was today.

683
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,238
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a video on there.

684
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:23,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Tokyo Jungle Come on, kick into gear, show me the peeing I want to see some dogs peeing

685
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Lions, Bulldogs, Gazelles, and Beagles

686
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Giraffes.

687
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:57,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The hell game.

688
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Cow.

689
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:04,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I want to fight between panda bears killing each other.

690
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a brown bear and a panda bear.

691
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pandemonium.

692
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:09,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Chickies and piggies.

693
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

694
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we see those two dogs were about to mount each other?

695
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:14,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

696
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:17,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the fuck is this game?

697
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:21,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I will import this shit if I have to.

698
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:22,686
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks astounding.

699
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:23,607
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks amazing.

700
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:26,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to show this at E3 next week?

701
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

702
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be hilarious.

703
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:30,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, let's get this game since there's no region coding.

704
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:35,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Dance, Animal Dance, Animal Dance.

705
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:37,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they could set the trailer to that music.

706
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be amazing.

707
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:39,720
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know what they should set it to?

708
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,220
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

709
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Gilda Radner, Let's Talk Geordie to the Animals.

710
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:46,562
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the new President Cat as far as I'm concerned.

711
00:46:46,602 --> 00:46:47,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's face it, y'all.

712
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:48,863
[SPEAKER_05]: President Cat ain't happening.

713
00:46:48,883 --> 00:46:50,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I want Tokyo Jungle.

714
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted a link on my Twitter.

715
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:52,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It was today.

716
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:53,066
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

717
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: The story is like in Tokyo, little dogs are the king of the jungle.

718
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:03,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically talking about it's the commercial, I guess, I think, for the game.

719
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:05,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's seriously awesome.

720
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

721
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that is now one to kind of keep your eye on is Tokyo Jungle.

722
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:10,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I want.

723
00:47:10,183 --> 00:47:10,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

724
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:13,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch, that'll be like... Bring that to the Vita.

725
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:20,196
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be in the corner of the Sony booth somewhere, like some poor intern doesn't even know anything about the game and has to show it.

726
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:21,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

727
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:22,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa.

728
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:23,638
Africa.

729
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:25,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Africa should have been.

730
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:27,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Africa with killing.

731
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,841
Tokyo Jungle.

732
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:39,189
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PlayStation Vita, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny, and a Hello Kitty game, Hello Kitty Toeiso Block Crash 5.

733
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's be real.

734
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:44,315
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all waiting for June 14th when Persona 4 comes out on the Vita.

735
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just be real right there.

736
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:46,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

737
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:51,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, lastly, to the Xbox 360.

738
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:54,885
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing until Lollipop Chainsaw on the 14th.

739
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play that.

740
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:57,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It does look pretty awesome, huh?

741
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:58,989
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on to the UK.

742
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,834
[SPEAKER_02]: On June 5th, Madagascar 3 is a video game.

743
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having to do my... I should do my riff-raff voice.

744
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:09,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Master... No.

745
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Master...

746
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:37,750
[SPEAKER_02]: on June 6th we have Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown and June 8th Dungeon Bowl which I have no idea what it's about but hey it's got a neat name Chair of Swords for PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 I'm sorry Game of Boring I mean Thrones Chair of Swords and Rayman Origins Chair of Swords alright just a few more stories for you guys I did see one cool thing having to do with that show what?

747
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,491
[SPEAKER_02]: the doctor sitting on the throne what?

748
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

749
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:44,438
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki.

750
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there are a couple of court cases resolved themselves this week.

751
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic has one lawsuit against Silicon Knights.

752
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:55,855
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may remember, Silicon Knights was complaining that...

753
00:48:56,201 --> 00:49:11,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Unreal Engine is too hard to program and that's why two humans sucked it wasn't because we can't make a good game um and they lost so um they owe now 4.45 million dollars to Epic and um

754
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:22,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course, they are disappointed with the outcome, Silicon Knights, and they're going to appeal because it can never end.

755
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:36,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, Activision is also expected back in court again because Judge has okayed, no doubt, to continue their lawsuit for their appearance in Band Hero.

756
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember that they claimed the agreement...

757
00:49:39,382 --> 00:49:43,765
[SPEAKER_03]: was that they would sing their songs as their characters because they have themselves in the game.

758
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:48,968
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you can sing anybody's songs with anybody's characters and so some people took offense to that.

759
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now they apparently can file their lawsuit.

760
00:49:54,971 --> 00:50:00,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep feeling like every few months we hear that that lawsuit has slowly progressed.

761
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:01,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Slowly.

762
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally filed in 2009.

763
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:05,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time.

764
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:07,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Our justice system at work.

765
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,865
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

766
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:31,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of this sounds plausible.

767
00:50:31,746 --> 00:50:34,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the latest features in the latest dev kit.

768
00:50:34,847 --> 00:50:39,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Video chat available, but it must be from the main menu of the system, not while playing a game.

769
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:41,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems plausible.

770
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Voice commands available.

771
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:49,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Facial recognition similar to the Xbox Kinect.

772
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Ability to share achievements with friends by sending videos or screenshots with drawings on them.

773
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty cool.

774
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:22,157
[SPEAKER_05]: That could make the internet a lot more fun, if you think about it.

775
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:24,557
[SPEAKER_03]: The TTP possibilities with that are quite quick.

776
00:51:25,058 --> 00:51:28,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that could... Achievement, penis!

777
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:40,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine that the game, like, you know, right up to you getting the achievement actually takes a video, not just of, like, your feet in game, but also, like, video of your face, like Burnout.

778
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:42,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that Burnout game that would, like, show video of you?

779
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's Pikura.

780
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:45,706
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be interesting.

781
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:48,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Other interesting one.

782
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:50,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know if you think this is plausible.

783
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:53,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch a friend play online.

784
00:51:55,128 --> 00:52:01,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they kind of have that with spectating, but not all games support that like on Xbox 360, so maybe.

785
00:52:02,129 --> 00:52:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

786
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:07,750
[SPEAKER_05]: It would definitely see the technologies there and people are doing it with, you know, Ustream and Twitch TV and all this stuff.

787
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,771
[SPEAKER_05]: People are just sitting there watching other people play games.

788
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:12,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be cool.

789
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:12,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

790
00:52:16,526 --> 00:52:21,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Multitasking Keep a text or video walkthrough open from the site while playing the game.

791
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:23,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Swap back and forth as needed.

792
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: um you can't like have the internet and your game going because those are two different applications but you can have your game going and then you can like I don't there's not a lot you can do with the game suspended I don't think because you really like if you launch anything else it says you can go look at your friends list on the 3ds notifications that's about anything the Vita I know you can because you can like open stuff and as long as you're not trying to run two games at the same time

793
00:52:58,385 --> 00:52:59,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that it's possible.

794
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:02,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, with the other screen, maybe have a walkthrough on there.

795
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:03,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be.

796
00:53:03,988 --> 00:53:16,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey, if this is all true, especially kind of like the video screenshot drawing stuff, that's the kind of stuff that I would like Nintendo to surprise us with that would make me go, oh, okay, maybe they do get online.

797
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:17,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

798
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:21,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this could just all be fan wank and come visit my website.

799
00:53:21,926 --> 00:53:27,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the other thing, too, is I don't know how much of this they would actually be talking about at E3, you know what I mean?

800
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of bullet points for stuff.

801
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:35,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I think all that would come to light in the press announcements or the behind the scenes.

802
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:40,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, it's not going to be at the keynote, but you'd see it behind the scenes.

803
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:46,080
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of that stuff tends to come out of interviews and stuff and sites going in asking the questions, is this true, is this true?

804
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and some of the stuff they read on the internet, so...

805
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:55,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, enough of all this newfangled Wii U drawing penises on your achievement stuff.

806
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:58,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to a time when games were a little bit simpler.

807
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:02,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a trip down memory lane with a classic game of the week.

808
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,894
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's gonna step into the vault and pull out one game that she thinks, hey!

809
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Play this or GTFO.

810
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:12,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have GTFO when I was little.

811
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It was get off my lawn.

812
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:16,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, your classic game of the week.

813
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:18,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Guitar Freaks.

814
00:54:19,027 --> 00:54:19,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

815
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:23,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a music game by Konami where you use a guitar.

816
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That should just be all that you need to know, but let's go a bit further than that.

817
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's mostly rock and J-pop.

818
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:46,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, even every source that you look at is going to say, oh, that's what led to Guitar Hero, even though they tried to deny it in my living room that it was because of guitar freaks.

819
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's on its 19th version, Guitar Freaks V8, which came out March 28th, 2011.

820
00:54:54,365 --> 00:55:07,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is said to be the final release of Guitar Freaks V. There will be a spin-off Guitar Freaks XG, actually, well there was one, that came out in Japanese arcades on March 10th, 2010.

821
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:11,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It had two more buttons added to the fret bar instead of the three.

822
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:16,415
[SPEAKER_02]: and there is a sequel called Guitar Freaks XG2 that came out on March 9th, 2011.

823
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:23,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So the controller looks kind of like a Fender Jazzmaster or a Fender Mustang.

824
00:55:23,477 --> 00:55:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It has three buttons, red, green, and blue.

825
00:55:26,638 --> 00:55:37,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a pick lever so that you also have a knob that you can use as an effector.

826
00:55:38,286 --> 00:55:41,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll add chorus and delay effects to your guitar.

827
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:45,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so it really plays a lot like...

828
00:55:47,131 --> 00:56:05,966
[SPEAKER_02]: A reverse poppin' music, or reverse Beatmania 2DX, where everything scrolls very DDR style, you know, from bottom to top, except it uses the bars, and you have to use your strum lever while you hold the appropriate colored button.

829
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:12,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can pull your bar back when you see a little guitar flashing on the screen, and you get a wailing bonus.

830
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:23,135
[SPEAKER_02]: and in some cases you even have hidden things that you can play that will populate this new, I'm glad you picked that song because that's like one of the best songs ever.

831
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:30,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll populate a, what's the word I'm thinking of?

832
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:36,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, a new series of items to play on the screen.

833
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually very distracted because Rob picked fire.

834
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,781
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play a little bit of that.

835
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:44,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool!

836
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:50,676
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband and I would pull the crap out of this song.

837
00:56:50,696 --> 00:56:56,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, basically your life is powered by your- Wait a minute.

838
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: This is somebody who edited Fire to be the Mega Man song.

839
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the song.

840
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:04,127
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I meant- That's not the song.

841
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:08,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually is kind of rad, though.

842
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I knew it sounded wrong, but I like it.

843
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let me find the real fire.

844
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the real fire, because real fire is good.

845
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it sounds very MIDI-like.

846
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:17,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty awesome.

847
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the right one.

848
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:22,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is it.

849
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:25,780
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the full version.

850
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,221
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

851
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get to where the guitar is.

852
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:34,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the...

853
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:41,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I can totally hear where somebody heard the Mega Man song in that though.

854
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:41,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

855
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:48,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, your scoring depends on how accurate you are with hitting the key.

856
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,421
[SPEAKER_02]: You have perfect, great, good, poor, and miss.

857
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Ratings of poor and miss will deplete your groove gauge.

858
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect and great will replenish it.

859
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:03,770
[SPEAKER_02]: If your groove gauge is empty completely, you fail and the game is over.

860
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how the cabinet is set up, you have one to five songs.

861
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Session Link Super Session

862
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss this so much.

863
00:59:00,342 --> 00:59:03,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I could not tell you this far after.

864
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:06,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that had the really cool drum beat.

865
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:10,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on Time?

866
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:12,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on Time, that was it.

867
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:12,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

868
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We would always play Right on Time.

869
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing that you remember that.

870
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Rob.

871
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:39,619
[SPEAKER_05]: This is right on time.

872
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The drum, when you play this in the medium mode, was just like constant.

873
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:47,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do it for a while.

874
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:50,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember those calluses I had on my hands from playing the damn drum?

875
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:53,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we would buy our own drumsticks and use our own drumsticks.

876
00:59:56,748 --> 01:00:03,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the different versions of them, I don't even know if I have time to list them all because there's so many.

877
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:05,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's not.

878
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:07,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll put it this way.

879
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:07,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck tons.

880
01:00:07,894 --> 01:00:08,815
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been everything.

881
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had regular mixes up to 11th, and then there was an 8th mix power-up version.

882
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:28,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had V2, V3, V4, Rock X Rock, or Rock Cross Rock, V5 Rock to Infinity, V6 Blazing, XG, V7, XG2 Groove to Live,

883
01:00:29,186 --> 01:00:57,328
[SPEAKER_02]: V8, XG3 that came out February 2012 Guitar Freaks V4 and V2 Infinity that were looks like European releases so there's just been all kinds of different versions and also for the Drum Mania ones over in other countries they were called Percussion Freaks just saying so that's it I still was waiting for Sax Maniacs

884
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

885
01:00:59,111 --> 01:00:59,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give up hope.

886
01:01:00,332 --> 01:01:02,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

887
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:05,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks, originally in the arcade, but eventually on the PlayStation in Japan.

888
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in the collection.

889
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:15,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly part of the inspiration for Guitar Hero, because again, Red Octane, who funded the original Guitar Hero, used to make... Denied it in my kitchen.

890
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:16,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Used to make...

891
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:25,569
[SPEAKER_05]: and those controllers for Guitar Freaks, which had five buttons on them at one point, which Guitar Freaks never had five buttons.

892
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody was like, why are they putting out five button controllers?

893
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:29,531
[SPEAKER_05]: XG has it now.

894
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:30,532
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

895
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:34,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we were going to go right into rapid fire news.

896
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:38,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in light of the power outage a couple weeks ago, I think I should save what we've done so far.

897
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's do a quick in studio break.

898
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back with more Orange Launch Radio right after this.

899
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

900
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:57,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Not live on this June the 3rd of 2012, but it's a radio trick.

901
01:01:57,145 --> 01:02:00,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taping on May 31st, a few days beforehand.

902
01:02:00,267 --> 01:02:05,131
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks to those of you that showed up to chat along with the show anyway at vognetwork.com.

903
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:08,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be back live next week, June the 10th of 2012.

904
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:12,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And podcast folks, hey, you got another show this week, so...

905
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:13,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy!

906
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:20,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it'll be a little bit shorter tonight because we're missing the live interaction and just since it's earlier in the week there's not as much to talk about.

907
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:26,034
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, we do still have plenty of news including tonight's rapid fire news which Loki's going to start us off with.

908
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:36,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was a new Ratchet & Clank game announced that will also be, well actually it's only going to be released on the PlayStation Network, kind of like what they did with the second Ratchet & Clank game.

909
01:02:37,814 --> 01:02:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, there's like a middle Ratchet & Clank game, like the second and the third one was out on the consoles.

910
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault and it's coming this fall.

911
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:52,579
[SPEAKER_05]: All those Ratchet & Clank games have kind of suggestive names, don't they?

912
01:02:53,775 --> 01:02:56,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet and Clank Future Quest for Booty Did they find the booty?

913
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:09,234
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably did.

914
01:03:10,795 --> 01:03:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's been rumored for a while that Battlefield 3 is going to try to pull Call of Duty Elite and come out with their own service.

915
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have.

916
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:22,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually leaked out and then they finally announced it.

917
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:24,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no.

918
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:33,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it leaked out and they... I don't know if they've confirmed it or whatever, but what ended up happening is there's this Battlefield 3 Premium...

919
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to cost you $50 and includes five themed expansion packs, some of which have already been announced, and actually one that's already out.

920
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:45,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to Karkland, which was a pre-order bonus if you bought the game.

921
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:55,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, the Close Quarters DLC, which I think is out, or it's coming out next week on June 4th.

922
01:03:56,126 --> 01:04:03,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they have Armored Kill, Aftermath, and Endgame are the next three as well.

923
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:12,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently you're going to get exclusive weapons and also two weeks access early to said packs as well of other unique endgame items if you pay $50.

924
01:04:15,057 --> 01:04:34,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it seems like they're trying to copy what they're doing with Call of Duty Elite and of course they weren't going to want to do that because if it works, if the shoe fits they made quite a bit of money but originally it came out on the European PlayStation Network store and then got pulled but once it's on the internet that's right, screenshots alright

925
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:43,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving on, if you want to get some good games and do some good, there's always the Humble Indie Bundle available at HumbleBundle.com.

926
01:04:43,105 --> 01:04:48,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, every time one of these bundles comes out, the internet blows up with, best one yet.

927
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:53,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the fifth one, Humble Indie Bundle 5, was just announced today, and guess what?

928
01:04:53,712 --> 01:04:54,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Best one yet.

929
01:04:54,873 --> 01:04:55,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I already bought it.

930
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:56,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for real.

931
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:57,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, here's the deal.

932
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:04,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Psychonauts, Limbo, Super Brothers, Sword & Sorcery, EP, and Amnesia are all available.

933
01:05:05,282 --> 01:05:12,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you pay above the average price, you get Bastion, which, you know, there's tons of great games.

934
01:05:12,828 --> 01:05:14,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single one of those games is something.

935
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it for $5.60 to get Bastion.

936
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that the average price is way higher.

937
01:05:18,694 --> 01:05:20,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already got most of those.

938
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:22,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I have amnesia, but you know what?

939
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just about being able to get the games cheap, but that you are doing some good because the money doesn't just go to the developers, but it goes to, if you want, again, you get to choose how you divvy up the money, it goes to the Humble Indie Bundle or Child's Play Charity EFF.

940
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:44,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want, you can plunk down 15 bucks, give it all to Child's Play Charity and say to everybody else, none for you, bye, and that's how you divvy up the money.

941
01:05:44,751 --> 01:05:47,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, as of the taping of the show, the minimum is $7.51.

942
01:05:47,692 --> 01:05:52,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine that's going to climb closer to $10 by the time... It's still worth it.

943
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still worth it.

944
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:55,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, these games together, easily worth $60.

945
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:01,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the price of a regular retail game?

946
01:06:02,816 --> 01:06:03,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

947
01:06:04,077 --> 01:06:09,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you're feeling charitable or shit, you just want some good games, head over to HumbleBundle.com.

948
01:06:09,378 --> 01:06:12,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's been out for one day.

949
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Already up to 187,100.

950
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:18,683
[SPEAKER_05]: This number's just climbing.

951
01:06:18,703 --> 01:06:20,625
[SPEAKER_05]: 46, 8, 50, just keeps climbing.

952
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:23,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine by the time Sunday rolls around, they'll easily be at a half million.

953
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:24,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Easily.

954
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:25,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

955
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:47,237
[SPEAKER_05]: so Humble Indie Bundle 5 we kind of mentioned this already earlier in the show but if you missed it Game Informer magazine is teasing in the shadows a new Gears of War apparently to be on the July issue of their magazine obviously if this is you know what it is it could be Gears of War 4 it could be a Gears of War spin-off game it's a prequel

956
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:49,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So just like pre-Gears of War.

957
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:50,339
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a prequel.

958
01:06:50,379 --> 01:06:51,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of Battle.

959
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a prequel because of spoilers regarding the main characters.

960
01:06:55,423 --> 01:06:56,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, okay.

961
01:06:57,705 --> 01:07:00,707
[SPEAKER_03]: There cannot be a sequel with the main character.

962
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:02,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever said it had to be the main character?

963
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:08,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, in one of the Mass Effect games, they kill Shepard and bring him back.

964
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:11,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not a spoiler because that's in the very beginning of the game, Mass Effect 2.

965
01:07:12,336 --> 01:07:14,358
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything is possible, you know?

966
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I always love when people say, oh, no, they can't do it.

967
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:19,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a prequel.

968
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Time travel and shit.

969
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,225
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do whatever they want.

970
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:23,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what they did with Star Trek, for fuck's sake.

971
01:07:23,966 --> 01:07:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Gears of War game.

972
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:28,150
[SPEAKER_05]: They found a way to maybe bring Khan back, although they swear up and down it's not going to happen.

973
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:28,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

974
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Gears of War game.

975
01:07:30,091 --> 01:07:30,312
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

976
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:34,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whatever it is, it's coming soon, as in E3 soon.

977
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:35,696
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

978
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:35,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

979
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:36,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura.

980
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:38,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

981
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:39,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more stuff.

982
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Spy Hunter?

983
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:45,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Well, I was playing that on my iPad, actually.

984
01:07:46,713 --> 01:07:47,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The Spy Hunter.

985
01:07:47,955 --> 01:07:50,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Which the control sucks, because it's no steering wheel.

986
01:07:50,157 --> 01:07:51,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to tilt your iPad.

987
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically it's a reboot on the handhelds.

988
01:07:57,402 --> 01:08:01,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically super spy racing type game.

989
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically you are the spy and you have to go catch bad guys.

990
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do that in a fast vehicle and you destroy enemy vehicles.

991
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:23,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Your car is called the G6155 Interceptor, which is supposed to transform from a supercar to offer an assault vehicle to a speedboat.

992
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:28,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go hunt and capture those nasty, nasty spies.

993
01:08:29,114 --> 01:08:31,954
[SPEAKER_05]: But the real question is, did they license the theme from Peter Gunn?

994
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:33,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if not, forget it.

995
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:40,095
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the theme in a remix dubstep of the... Dubstep is evil.

996
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:43,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.

997
01:08:43,638 --> 01:08:47,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being done by Warner Brothers Interactive.

998
01:08:49,322 --> 01:08:53,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be on 3DS and PS Vita in the fall.

999
01:08:53,124 --> 01:08:55,666
[SPEAKER_05]: What do Dubstep and Downtown Julie Brown have in common?

1000
01:08:56,226 --> 01:08:56,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Wubba Wubba.

1001
01:08:56,786 --> 01:08:57,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Wubba Wubba Wubba!

1002
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:05,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So Capcom has registered a trademark for a potential game called Remember Me.

1003
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:13,666
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know anything else about that except that it was filed on May 22nd this year in both the US and Europe.

1004
01:09:14,247 --> 01:09:16,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this will be something at E3?

1005
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1006
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:17,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1007
01:09:19,036 --> 01:09:22,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be the subtitle to another game too, right?

1008
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not necessarily be a standalone game.

1009
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:27,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1010
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:35,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember me, the sensible Capcom that put out regular games that were fun and people liked buying them and we didn't have download content that was on disc?

1011
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember me, sensible Capcom?

1012
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm gone forever.

1013
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's time for a joke that nobody but maybe two of our listeners will get.

1014
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:46,143
Remember!

1015
01:09:52,152 --> 01:09:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you know what I was distracted by, Rob?

1016
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:59,141
[SPEAKER_02]: A story about this guy eating his roommate's brain and heart.

1017
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:03,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew, that's like that grody old... Have you read about all that crap coming out of Canada?

1018
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:06,289
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't happen in Canada.

1019
01:10:06,309 --> 01:10:10,494
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy eating faces in Florida, but if I lived in Florida, I'd probably go crazy too.

1020
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:11,475
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1021
01:10:32,404 --> 01:10:34,125
[SPEAKER_05]: People, stop being ridiculous.

1022
01:10:34,185 --> 01:10:36,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that guy in Canada got caught finally?

1023
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,006
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1024
01:10:37,806 --> 01:10:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy named Alexander Kinyua ate his roommate's heart and brain and his dad found him with the head and hands in a bucket in his basement.

1025
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:49,831
[SPEAKER_02]: His dad turned him in.

1026
01:10:50,131 --> 01:10:59,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not Google that guy who they want in Canada because you'll read all these stories about he didn't just do fucked up things to humans and you will get mad.

1027
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:00,738
[SPEAKER_05]: You will get mad.

1028
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Allegedly.

1029
01:11:02,419 --> 01:11:03,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say allegedly.

1030
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:08,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a guy in Japan who killed a couple of women and ate them and now he's a celebrity and does tours.

1031
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:09,284
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1032
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:10,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious?

1033
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,226
[SPEAKER_05]: In no evidence.

1034
01:11:12,306 --> 01:11:13,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.

1035
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:16,169
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote... That sounds like the plot of Natural Born Killers.

1036
01:11:16,209 --> 01:11:16,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever see that?

1037
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:17,410
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1038
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Robert Downey Jr.

1039
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:20,513
[SPEAKER_05]: back when he was on drugs.

1040
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:21,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find the guy's name.

1041
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:27,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But he did it like 30 years ago, and now he goes around doing tours about what it's like to eat people.

1042
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:28,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

1043
01:11:30,341 --> 01:11:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That totally sounds like the plot to Natural Born Killers.

1044
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow...

1045
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:34,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1046
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I need some happiness and cheerfulness.

1047
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at video games.

1048
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:38,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1049
01:11:38,832 --> 01:11:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I got his name.

1050
01:11:39,974 --> 01:11:40,555
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want it.

1051
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Issei Sagawa.

1052
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it back.

1053
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:47,413
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's nothing more happier and cheerful than Doom 3.

1054
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:54,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom 3 is getting the HD treatment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1055
01:11:55,356 --> 01:12:04,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only are you getting Doom 3 with HD graphics, extra levels, 3D support, they even have head-mounted display support, which...

1056
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:08,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure there's that many head-mounted displays out there.

1057
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:13,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that apparently John Carmack made one, and it had duct tape on it.

1058
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:14,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1059
01:12:14,552 --> 01:12:15,793
[SPEAKER_05]: John Carmack has one.

1060
01:12:16,614 --> 01:12:17,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it's in the game.

1061
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:18,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1062
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:19,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's supporting it.

1063
01:12:21,218 --> 01:12:25,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, Doom 1 and 2 are also included, and it's supposed to be out this fall.

1064
01:12:26,063 --> 01:12:27,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool, I guess.

1065
01:12:27,925 --> 01:12:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1066
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another awesome question.

1067
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:32,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Why Doom 3?

1068
01:12:34,169 --> 01:12:41,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Because... Just because maybe it was kind of over... I don't want to say it was overlooked, but it certainly didn't have that same cultural grab that the first two did.

1069
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:45,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Doom 3 because they are a new game.

1070
01:12:45,436 --> 01:12:46,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Rage Bombed.

1071
01:12:48,758 --> 01:12:49,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not Quake 3?

1072
01:12:49,519 --> 01:12:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That's...

1073
01:12:51,384 --> 01:12:55,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Quake 3 was Quake... It's basically Quake Live now.

1074
01:12:55,046 --> 01:12:59,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Quake Live, which I think they... Don't they have Quake 3 on Xbox Live Arcade?

1075
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: They do, you're right, they do.

1076
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have it.

1077
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:07,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And technically they were releasing Quake... Well, they actually are releasing Quake 4 again.

1078
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1079
01:13:07,873 --> 01:13:08,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake 4 wasn't very good.

1080
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:09,674
[SPEAKER_03]: On Xbox 360.

1081
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:11,395
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the launch titles for 360, remember that?

1082
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:18,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and here's the thing I want to kind of know about it, though, is remember, the launch title, and hopefully you can find Dirt Cheap now, it...

1083
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: The game wasn't very good, but it came with Quake 2 on another disc.

1084
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was good.

1085
01:13:24,825 --> 01:13:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1086
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:30,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The even-numbered Quakes, it's like the opposite of Star Trek.

1087
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,172
[SPEAKER_05]: The even-numbered Quakes are not very good.

1088
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake 2 was pretty good.

1089
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:35,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake 3 was great.

1090
01:13:36,096 --> 01:13:39,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Compared to 1 and 3, 3 was the best.

1091
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:40,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Asky Quake, Rob.

1092
01:13:41,799 --> 01:13:42,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to be $20.

1093
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be coming out in two weeks.

1094
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:47,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can buy one of the original copies for $5 and get it now.

1095
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:51,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1096
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:57,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're not into first-person shooters, maybe you're into first-person role-playing games.

1097
01:13:57,747 --> 01:14:00,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the biggest ones out there right now is Skyrim.

1098
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:01,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?

1099
01:14:01,227 --> 01:14:03,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, an expansion coming.

1100
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know exactly when yet, but we do finally have a title.

1101
01:14:07,449 --> 01:14:12,570
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those pre-E3 leaks where the companies try to get a jump on all that press coverage.

1102
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:15,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be, you know, because everybody's fighting for time during E3 week.

1103
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:17,472
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1104
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:46,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what is this?

1105
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:52,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you can turn into a bunch of bats, so there's a vampire theme going on, which was already in the game, right?

1106
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:57,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You can already be a vampire, but this actually shows, like, you can transform into, like, a giant bat thing and, like, fly.

1107
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, kind of a really weird... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, bat thing.

1108
01:15:00,982 --> 01:15:02,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bat thing.

1109
01:15:02,984 --> 01:15:03,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1110
01:15:03,956 --> 01:15:04,857
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1111
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:51,968
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 days later is when the rest of us can play it because Microsoft basically sold their soul to get this and so can you in the expansion to Skyrim because Microsoft gives it up better I like the little castle on fire the little dark castle looking thing it's like the little obsidian portal in Minecraft but prettier

1112
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you played way more Skyrim than I did.

1113
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:57,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your interest level in this?

1114
01:15:58,648 --> 01:15:59,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in it.

1115
01:16:00,128 --> 01:16:04,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not as excited as before, you know, because I was like, oh, I'm going to get whatever expansion they put out.

1116
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:06,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, it has to do with vampires.

1117
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really done anything with vampires.

1118
01:16:08,553 --> 01:16:12,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been just trying to make sure I don't turn into a vampire because it's lame.

1119
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because of Twilight, but I just don't want to be a vampire or a werewolf in the game.

1120
01:16:17,718 --> 01:16:19,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that horse that was on fire.

1121
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:20,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that map.

1122
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:20,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1123
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:21,780
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

1124
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: What's glowing like Tron?

1125
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:24,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think that was the Elder Scrolls.

1126
01:16:24,922 --> 01:16:25,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1127
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1128
01:16:26,822 --> 01:16:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said that you were interested in that, it totally made me think of Alucard.

1129
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in this.

1130
01:16:31,704 --> 01:16:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of, it does look like you can play as Alucard in this.

1131
01:16:34,785 --> 01:16:35,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

1132
01:16:35,605 --> 01:16:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play Skyrim if I could be Alucard.

1133
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish.

1134
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:39,827
[SPEAKER_04]: You can name your character Alucard.

1135
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:46,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be really impossible for them to add it later on because it's such a rewrite of code.

1136
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:57,698
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want, you know, I know they have Skyrim, or not Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, which is really weird because it gets lamer and lamer each update that they put out on it.

1137
01:16:57,798 --> 01:17:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like every update that there is for it, I get less and less interested in this game.

1138
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:05,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really wish there was just like co-op.

1139
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:09,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Like four-player co-op in Skyrim would be fucking awesome.

1140
01:17:09,445 --> 01:17:09,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1141
01:17:12,432 --> 01:17:12,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1142
01:17:13,413 --> 01:17:19,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is the part of the show where we'd move into the mailbag segment, except there's no emails tonight.

1143
01:17:19,298 --> 01:17:22,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead, we're going to plug and say, email us.

1144
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:26,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us.

1145
01:17:26,905 --> 01:17:28,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll read your email next week.

1146
01:17:28,306 --> 01:17:33,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely, with E3 going on, there's going to be something that makes you want to email us and have your voice heard.

1147
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1148
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't call them Shirley.

1149
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:40,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1150
01:17:40,677 --> 01:17:42,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Lack of email makes us angsty.

1151
01:17:58,389 --> 01:18:01,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my FU goes to this continuously not having a voice.

1152
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:03,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, boo.

1153
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:06,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1154
01:18:07,955 --> 01:18:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the fact that I can't go to E3.

1155
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of miss going to E3 each year.

1156
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:16,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a couple years now that I haven't been able to go.

1157
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it is a lame E3, I still like going and playing the stuff.

1158
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:24,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And my boss and his boss get to go.

1159
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:28,333
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to meetings.

1160
01:18:28,433 --> 01:18:30,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so where did you go check out at E3?

1161
01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:32,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we didn't even go on the show floor.

1162
01:18:33,015 --> 01:18:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1163
01:18:50,962 --> 01:18:52,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what was it, last year?

1164
01:18:52,563 --> 01:18:54,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think what they saw last year.

1165
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something very lame.

1166
01:18:57,005 --> 01:18:57,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what it was.

1167
01:18:58,306 --> 01:19:00,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have been Bethesda.

1168
01:19:01,327 --> 01:19:04,509
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's just, they waste time there.

1169
01:19:05,586 --> 01:19:08,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to display our new game, Cat Butthole.

1170
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,470
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1171
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I do take that back.

1172
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:11,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It is their fault.

1173
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know why?

1174
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:13,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they only go down for like one or two days.

1175
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:16,799
[SPEAKER_03]: They miss a day or two of the time there.

1176
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:18,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck?

1177
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:20,963
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be hitting the show for... But here's the thing.

1178
01:19:21,144 --> 01:19:22,765
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't fucking care and his boss...

1179
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:27,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Loki.

1180
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:27,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next year.

1181
01:19:27,772 --> 01:19:28,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next year.

1182
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:34,796
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to just too much to do and not enough time to do it.

1183
01:19:34,856 --> 01:19:37,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to the fact that I kind of bring that on myself.

1184
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So, F you to that.

1185
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:42,600
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get for procrastinating.

1186
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even procrastinating.

1187
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:47,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just maybe I don't know how to say no.

1188
01:19:48,403 --> 01:19:49,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I need to learn.

1189
01:19:49,824 --> 01:19:52,465
[SPEAKER_05]: That has nothing to do with this program or VOG or anything like that.

1190
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:55,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just other things in life that maybe I need to just say

1191
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:59,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's time to stop because I'm just too damn busy.

1192
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, look at me.

1193
01:20:02,428 --> 01:20:04,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It is possible to say no.

1194
01:20:04,309 --> 01:20:05,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I say it to you all the time.

1195
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:06,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch.

1196
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1197
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,230
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1198
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's it for the FU of the Week.

1199
01:20:13,451 --> 01:20:16,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into a few more stories for you guys before we say goodnight.

1200
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:18,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1201
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:24,513
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a rumor that there's going to be an announcement of a redesign of the 3DS.

1202
01:20:25,513 --> 01:20:28,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually looking like it may actually happen this year.

1203
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:34,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason behind that is Amazon has stopped carrying the 3DS.

1204
01:20:34,919 --> 01:20:40,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily that they've stopped selling it, but they themselves have stopped selling it on the website.

1205
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:47,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only available through third-party providers, because you know anybody can go on Amazon and sell stuff.

1206
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:50,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's actually stuff that's sold directly by Amazon.

1207
01:20:51,770 --> 01:21:11,404
[SPEAKER_03]: that's in the US region not only that but in Japan they also have stopped having the 3DS available so why do you think they've stopped selling the 3DS maybe because there's another 3DS coming out did somebody report the original 3DS is flawed to Amazon and they stopped selling it that could have happened too maybe

1208
01:21:11,923 --> 01:21:13,724
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1209
01:21:43,628 --> 01:22:07,928
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's interesting the other thing is the thoughts are that there's a rumor that they're going to announce Monster Hunter for the 3DS coming this E3 as well for the North American region alright I mean there's going to be a redesign it's just when I think it could be this holiday

1210
01:22:10,422 --> 01:22:20,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this is pretty shitty, is, uh, rumors and fakeness all over the interwebs, and, uh, I, I, I did want to bring it up, though, because there was a part of me that went, well, what if?

1211
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:32,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix announced what's gonna be at their booth, that part's not a lie, and what I thought was interesting, was completely missing from that list, was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, because it's like, shouldn't that fucking game be out by now?

1212
01:22:32,677 --> 01:22:35,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how long has that been in development, and we've, you know, whatever.

1213
01:22:35,979 --> 01:22:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So the thought out there is, well, maybe it's like a secret.

1214
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe something's happening with it, and they're going to show it at one of the conferences or something.

1215
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:52,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So this crazy-ass rumor came out, complete with fake footage, that Final Fantasy Versus XIII was renamed to Final Fantasy XV.

1216
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, that part I'd actually believe.

1217
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:57,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people poo-pooing that idea.

1218
01:22:58,243 --> 01:22:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd actually believe that.

1219
01:22:59,203 --> 01:23:01,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't understand how they tie with each other anyway.

1220
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'd believe more?

1221
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:06,387
[SPEAKER_05]: That they renamed Final Fantasy Versus XIII to Final Fantasy XIV.

1222
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:10,029
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean there was already a... Just shh, shh.

1223
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,071
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's already a Final Fantasy XIV.

1224
01:23:12,191 --> 01:23:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Shh.

1225
01:23:15,655 --> 01:23:24,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, apparently the game was going to be coming to the Wii U. Now, I guess it's because of the footage.

1226
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:28,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even watch the footage, but I'm looking at it here, this one-minute clip here.

1227
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:29,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1228
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:33,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just tell that that's an overlaid thing.

1229
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:42,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently people are watching this footage or whatever, and then you see the logo for Final Fantasy XV, and yeah, it doesn't look too convincing.

1230
01:23:42,549 --> 01:23:43,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1231
01:23:46,877 --> 01:23:50,258
[SPEAKER_05]: But it did kind of make me stop and go, well, why couldn't it be on the Wii U?

1232
01:23:51,499 --> 01:23:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Wii U is supposed to be getting all this other stuff.

1233
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why.

1234
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:03,623
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't put it only on the Wii U. It's because... Well, to be fair, it was PlayStation 3 and Wii U. Like, somebody took out the Xbox logo and put the Wii U logo.

1235
01:24:06,151 --> 01:24:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to do that.

1236
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1237
01:24:07,952 --> 01:24:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They know that they need to make money on this stuff.

1238
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to cut out the Xbox just because of the Wii U. I mean, they sold plenty of copies of Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 on the Xbox.

1239
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,281
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to ignore that.

1240
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:26,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And XIV was cut for totally different reasons that had to do with the Xbox Live infrastructure.

1241
01:24:26,984 --> 01:24:33,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Rules that were bent for Final Fantasy XI, Microsoft would not bend on again because XI didn't do that well on Xbox.

1242
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:33,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1243
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they're not going to do that.

1244
01:24:36,453 --> 01:24:36,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1245
01:24:37,194 --> 01:24:45,183
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything going to be for the Wii U, or even like, it's always been their own game that's been kind of lame on the Wii.

1246
01:24:45,604 --> 01:24:50,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think if there's anything on the Wii U, it's going to be another lame Crystal Chronicles game.

1247
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:52,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Same.

1248
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:53,051
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1249
01:24:53,071 --> 01:25:04,113
[SPEAKER_05]: If that whole Wii U being similar to the Game Boy Advance linking to the GameCube, there was that Final Fantasy game that was specifically for that setup, so it would be very easy to make a sequel to that.

1250
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:11,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see them doing... I don't see them coming out with... Because I've seen rumors... Of course, everybody's making up fucking rumors.

1251
01:25:11,935 --> 01:25:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a rumor I read, and I didn't even open the page because it just looks stupid.

1252
01:25:16,436 --> 01:25:17,196
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about...

1253
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:19,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kingdom Hearts Remix.

1254
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:23,941
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have all these different characters and stuff from all these games and it's only going to be on the Wii.

1255
01:25:23,961 --> 01:25:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, it's not.

1256
01:25:25,202 --> 01:25:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to do that.

1257
01:25:26,363 --> 01:25:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Square be withholding Kingdom Hearts 3?

1258
01:25:29,066 --> 01:25:29,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I wish?

1259
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:30,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I wish?

1260
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:33,610
[SPEAKER_05]: If wishes were fishes.

1261
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,912
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got plenty of stuff that they're working on right now.

1262
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:39,195
[SPEAKER_05]: If wishes and musts were buckets of... Damn it.

1263
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:42,738
[SPEAKER_05]: If wishes and musts were clusters of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola.

1264
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1265
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is official.

1266
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Tim Cook with Apple, they don't really care about doing consoles.

1267
01:26:02,773 --> 01:26:04,434
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not interested in doing it right now.

1268
01:26:04,914 --> 01:26:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someday, but not now.

1269
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're cool with the little iOS games.

1270
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:13,078
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1271
01:26:13,658 --> 01:26:15,279
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, he says customers love games.

1272
01:26:15,339 --> 01:26:17,720
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes me think of bitches love games, you know.

1273
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:29,411
[SPEAKER_02]: but he goes on record saying I'm not interested in being in the console business and what is thought of as traditional gaming but Apple is a big player today and things in the future will only make that bigger

1274
01:26:30,905 --> 01:26:37,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if the rumor's true that they're building their own TVs and shit, then they can just take the iPad, iPhone stuff over to the TV.

1275
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: It prints money.

1276
01:26:39,852 --> 01:26:42,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not console in the traditional sense, that's all.

1277
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:43,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't deny it.

1278
01:26:43,935 --> 01:26:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple's a player in gaming right now.

1279
01:26:45,396 --> 01:26:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably thinking that they're beyond consoles anyway.

1280
01:26:49,099 --> 01:26:51,101
[SPEAKER_05]: We're bigger than consoles, really.

1281
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:57,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Smurfs Village just puts that Gears of War to shame.

1282
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:01,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't need it.

1283
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:03,490
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, they don't need it.

1284
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to see Apple do a console.

1285
01:27:05,332 --> 01:27:08,694
[SPEAKER_05]: What they're doing right now is challenging the industry enough, I think.

1286
01:27:09,174 --> 01:27:11,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially Nintendo, the handheld market.

1287
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:19,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't deny that the iPhones and iPads are breathing a lot of heat on not just the Vita, but the 3DS.

1288
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:24,726
[SPEAKER_05]: To the point where shareholders are calling on Nintendo to put Mario on the iPhone.

1289
01:27:25,745 --> 01:27:26,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't.

1290
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:27,305
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be terrible.

1291
01:27:28,146 --> 01:27:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually agree it would be terrible because the touch controls just wouldn't work.

1292
01:27:31,066 --> 01:27:34,847
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, on a whim, I got Mega Man 2 on the iPhone.

1293
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It is fucking terrible.

1294
01:27:36,027 --> 01:27:36,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It is ass.

1295
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:40,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the stuff that comes from the stuff that comes out of an ass.

1296
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:46,350
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they could do, though, on the iPhone that would work is like a Zelda game like they have on the 3DS.

1297
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all stylus control.

1298
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:48,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1299
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:49,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked.

1300
01:27:50,051 --> 01:27:50,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It might work.

1301
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still sucks.

1302
01:28:12,648 --> 01:28:25,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a guitar pee urinal that basically has like little strum bars in it and a big fret bar coming out of the top that you can pee in it and then you can actually get a code to download your pee song later.

1303
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:30,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's sad is that is the second time we've talked about pee-based games in a month.

1304
01:28:30,859 --> 01:28:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I brought it up.

1305
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I weep for our society.

1306
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:37,463
[SPEAKER_02]: There's apparently a video up of what guitar pee sounds like.

1307
01:28:38,303 --> 01:28:38,864
[SPEAKER_05]: No thank you.

1308
01:28:39,164 --> 01:28:39,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1309
01:28:40,078 --> 01:28:43,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do have a few things I was just going to cover real quick.

1310
01:28:43,641 --> 01:28:47,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone supported Super Road Blaster to the SNES.

1311
01:28:47,685 --> 01:28:58,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Super Road Blaster, or I should say Road Blaster, which was a 1985 Laserdisc arcade game with animations, like a full motion video thing, like Dragon's Lair or something like that.

1312
01:28:59,615 --> 01:29:12,480
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually created a ROM file that's 6,320 megabits, although when you compare that with the largest SNES cartridge, which is only 48 megabits, it's a little impossible to run without special software.

1313
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:22,143
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get a SD2 SNES SD card adapter that will allow you to run the game on a physical SNES, and it actually works.

1314
01:29:22,563 --> 01:29:23,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download the ROM, which is 118 megs.

1315
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:25,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Only?

1316
01:29:26,204 --> 01:29:28,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for a Super Nintendo ROM, that's huge.

1317
01:29:28,426 --> 01:29:28,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1318
01:29:29,526 --> 01:29:31,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And it plays a full motion video and everything.

1319
01:29:31,848 --> 01:29:32,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing.

1320
01:29:32,548 --> 01:29:35,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So that cartridge back in the day probably would have cost about $900.

1321
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:36,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1322
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:43,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have cost about as much as the... And it would have had to be in like a super gigantic box.

1323
01:29:44,134 --> 01:29:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Neo Geo CD Projekt Red Cyberpunk

1324
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:03,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a late tweet.

1325
01:30:03,578 --> 01:30:04,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a tweet just now.

1326
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:08,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I should say an hour ago, but that was while we were in the middle of the show.

1327
01:30:09,242 --> 01:30:14,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a question from Osfer who sent a legit question for the show tonight, so we need to entertain it here.

1328
01:30:15,406 --> 01:30:23,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Osfer tweets us at twitter.com slash OLR asking, tweet for the show, what is a game that frustrated you like no other?

1329
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:28,415
[SPEAKER_05]: A game that frustrated you like no other.

1330
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:30,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle and Desu was one.

1331
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:31,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

1332
01:30:32,247 --> 01:30:34,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because some of the puzzles get really hard and fast.

1333
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:36,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just a pain.

1334
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:54,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um... Shoot, it's something that actually... Well, Fractal, actually, for a little while was getting me super frustrated because I'm on the part now where you have splits in weird places and it'll, like, completely mess up your trying to get your blooms.

1335
01:30:54,503 --> 01:30:55,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty fucked up.

1336
01:30:56,745 --> 01:31:00,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few games with puzzles in them.

1337
01:31:00,387 --> 01:31:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: A few puzzles...

1338
01:31:02,654 --> 01:31:04,094
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, Super Meat Boy.

1339
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

1340
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:09,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan used to ask me to play Super Meat Boy because he used to giggle when I would get really frustrated with the game.

1341
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some type of satisfaction for him.

1342
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely Super Meat Boy.

1343
01:31:13,637 --> 01:31:16,678
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the whole point of that game is to get frustrated and want to throw the controller.

1344
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:17,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1345
01:31:18,959 --> 01:31:19,859
[SPEAKER_05]: V, V, V, V.

1346
01:31:20,868 --> 01:31:21,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, yes.

1347
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:22,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1348
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:23,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1349
01:31:23,973 --> 01:31:28,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing is I played that game without downloading it on Steam, and then I just now downloaded it on Steam.

1350
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:29,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't import my save.

1351
01:31:30,722 --> 01:31:32,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck that.

1352
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:33,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp, womp.

1353
01:31:33,646 --> 01:31:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually copy it directly out of the save folder.

1354
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:40,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, because I am not fucking doing that again.

1355
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that with my games.

1356
01:31:41,853 --> 01:31:45,135
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 3DS, I'm just stuck in one level that I'm never going to get past.

1357
01:31:45,175 --> 01:31:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when that little asshole is following you and you can't get him killed either.

1358
01:31:49,617 --> 01:31:57,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished all that, but I have one more little shiny object thing to get, and it's just like, no.

1359
01:31:58,082 --> 01:31:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not doing it.

1360
01:31:59,103 --> 01:31:59,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit.

1361
01:32:00,043 --> 01:32:00,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1362
01:32:00,383 --> 01:32:00,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit.

1363
01:32:01,044 --> 01:32:01,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1364
01:32:01,944 --> 01:32:02,204
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1365
01:32:02,565 --> 01:32:03,225
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the tweet.

1366
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:03,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1367
01:32:03,945 --> 01:32:04,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other stories, Loki?

1368
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Retro City Rampage, speaking of Super Meat Boy, has this cool little trailer that they put out for a game within the game called Virtual Meat Boy.

1369
01:32:15,045 --> 01:32:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done like Virtual Boy, but you're playing as Meat Boy.

1370
01:32:18,871 --> 01:32:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

1371
01:32:19,452 --> 01:32:21,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also get to play as Meat Boy in the game, too.

1372
01:32:22,015 --> 01:32:25,637
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has 3D with like the red blue glasses if you want to.

1373
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:31,999
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny because Super Meat Boy kind of had those throwback stages like there was the NES stages and there was a Game Boy stage.

1374
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: A Virtual Boy stage makes a lot of sense.

1375
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:35,841
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of funny actually.

1376
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:37,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's pretty awesome.

1377
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing I was going to mention real quick, well, actually two things.

1378
01:32:41,363 --> 01:32:56,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's patented a new kind of input device for the 3DS it's a vibrating stylus it's going to allow you to have some sort of haptic feedback for stuff based on the position I guess of where the stylus is compared to the camera

1379
01:32:57,046 --> 01:32:57,246
[SPEAKER_05]: TTP V

1380
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:22,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last one was kind of in the line of why the fuck did they make this?

1381
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:32,447
[SPEAKER_03]: CTA, a company that makes accessories, and I think they made that thing for, was it Connected Ventures?

1382
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the raft?

1383
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:35,428
[SPEAKER_03]: That was completely pointless.

1384
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:36,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, yes.

1385
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:37,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was just a raft.

1386
01:33:37,229 --> 01:33:38,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God, yes.

1387
01:33:38,089 --> 01:33:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was amazing.

1388
01:33:38,929 --> 01:33:41,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They have done themselves one more.

1389
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:47,871
[SPEAKER_03]: They have made an inflatable go-kart that you can sit in and play.

1390
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1391
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:50,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard of this already, I thought.

1392
01:33:50,571 --> 01:33:52,772
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3DS Mario Kart 7 game.

1393
01:33:53,332 --> 01:33:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for the 3DS now.

1394
01:33:55,032 --> 01:33:58,533
[SPEAKER_05]: A giant inflatable kart for your portable console.

1395
01:33:58,773 --> 01:34:02,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You put your 3DS within this little steering wheel thing.

1396
01:34:04,821 --> 01:34:05,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you spend $40?

1397
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to pretend that you're in a cart.

1398
01:34:09,523 --> 01:34:10,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1399
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:12,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's stupid.

1400
01:34:12,124 --> 01:34:13,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so stupid.

1401
01:34:15,305 --> 01:34:15,805
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1402
01:34:15,885 --> 01:34:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1403
01:34:16,866 --> 01:34:17,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1404
01:34:17,886 --> 01:34:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's going to bring us to the close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

1405
01:34:25,169 --> 01:34:26,430
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.

1406
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:27,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Your final thoughts.

1407
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:44,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought tonight my final thought is hey, there's pictures of the E3 show floor I'm sad, I can't go I'm sad that you're sad no leaks

1408
01:34:45,652 --> 01:35:11,312
[SPEAKER_05]: my final thought is I really want to just thank everybody who's worked really hard on VOGnetwork.com especially Bobby's been doing a heck of a lot of the coding and all that fun stuff but you know and again I can't say too much because I don't know if the Friday thing happened for sure or not yet at this point but just some of the people that are doing some other work behind the scenes who I'll congratulate more specifically later on I just really want to thank you all for your work I'd like to thank the Academy and yay VOG

1409
01:35:12,335 --> 01:35:13,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

1410
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:24,375
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, remember, we don't ask for you guys to send us tons of money or we don't ask for much.

1411
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:30,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We always ask for you is to help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.

1412
01:35:30,134 --> 01:35:37,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Word of mouth is what gives us advertising and just tell a friend or two about the show or leave us a nice review on iTunes always helps and what have you.

1413
01:35:38,376 --> 01:35:39,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It all goes a long way.

1414
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:42,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Help promote the show and of course the new Voice of Geeks Network.
