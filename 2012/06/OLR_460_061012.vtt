WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.960
Tonight, June 10th, 2012, E3 2012 has come to a close and we discuss the highlights,

00:19.960 --> 00:31.720
the lowlights, and everything in between with our live audience.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.280
Yes, Loki in the mid-lights too.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.280
Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

00:38.280 --> 00:44.640
every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live as we always are, every Sunday night

00:44.640 --> 00:48.800
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG

00:48.800 --> 00:50.720
Network or the Voice of Geeks Network.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.200
VOGnetwork.com is where you can go and if you click on live chat, you can chat live

00:55.200 --> 00:57.640
with us, the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.640
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.580
I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and of course this week

01:02.580 --> 01:05.240
the big E3 expo with my co-host.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.400
First up, Jamie Summers or Dark Sakura.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Hi.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.960
It looks like you were giving my salad the sting guy.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.480
I was trying to figure out what was in it.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.360
I was like, is that avocado or is that?

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
It's avocado.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.760
I made basically avocado mango salsa.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.760
Okay.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.160
And put it over fresh greens.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.440
Just, you know, green things are always kind of the...

01:23.440 --> 01:24.600
With goat cheese on top.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
It's all raw.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.600
Okay.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.880
And delicious because I am back to eating raw food.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.960
There you go.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
Not vegan.

01:30.960 --> 01:31.960
Mind you, not vegan.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.120
How do you do raw food without being vegan because it doesn't...

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
Sashimi.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.120
Oh, okay.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.120
Fish.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
And beef tataki.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.120
Oh, there you go.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.120
And raw milk cheese and raw milk.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.120
That works.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
And yogurt.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
I can have fermented things too.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.020
All right.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.960
Let's also go over to tech master Loki.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.960
Hi.

01:49.960 --> 01:55.640
Who will probably talk about his very non-raw food diet of McDonald's.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.160
You couldn't have two more polar opposites.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.200
That's actually not food though.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.320
She does have a point.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.960
It is definitely not even close to food.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.320
It is the show where every gamer, no matter what you eat, has a voice.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.440
If there was a fast food place on the way here that serves sashimi, then I'd probably

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
be getting that.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.600
Although it is quite expensive.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.680
I had pop chips.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.680
I think that falls somewhere in between the two of you.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.800
I actually had dinner before I came to this show and then I picked that up on the way

02:21.800 --> 02:23.160
because I was still kind of hungry.

02:23.160 --> 02:28.440
I wanted to stop at Burger King, but there was a bunch of car crashes right in front

02:28.440 --> 02:32.480
of the turn to turn into the shopping center with the Burger King.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.840
I was like, ah, come on.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
Party at Burger King.

02:35.840 --> 02:41.200
No, it's probably stupid people on the light rail.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.000
Whatever happened to parties at Burger King?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.160
Like when I was young and this might be dating myself a bit here, but like people used to

02:46.160 --> 02:48.120
have their birthday parties at McDonald's and Burger King.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.600
Is that still like a thing or did they?

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
I don't think so.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.600
Yeah.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.760
It's all Chuck E Cheese now.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.480
Chuck E Cheese was a little, that's not food either.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.160
However sometimes they have good games.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.120
It really is the shittiest pizza anywhere.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
Anyway.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.120
It's still okay.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.960
You know, but you know who started Pizza Time Theater, right?

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Huh?

03:06.960 --> 03:08.880
Um, and crap, I forgot his name.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
Atari dude.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
Oh yeah.

03:10.880 --> 03:11.880
Nolan Bushnell.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.880
Yeah.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.880
Oh, Woodland Hills.

03:13.880 --> 03:14.880
Not that long ago.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.880
I don't know if it's still open.

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
It was about a year or two ago.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.000
I went to the original Chuck E Cheese way back.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.800
That was the coolest one too.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Really?

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Like two stories?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Had two story slide.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.720
It had the full animatronic band.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.900
Oh, it was great.

03:26.900 --> 03:34.480
In Mobile, where I'm from, we had a massive Chuck E Cheese slash Showtime pizza that had

03:34.480 --> 03:42.800
the party room with the hippo girl in it who played a piano and, and Alan said he remembered

03:42.800 --> 03:43.800
that.

03:43.800 --> 03:49.520
And then we had, um, the big party room with the full band and like the room that you go

03:49.520 --> 03:53.520
into to go to the bathroom that's all like LED lights on the wall that would give me

03:53.520 --> 03:59.280
like a seizure and, um, the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.280
I remember that.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.640
Chuck E Cheese in a way is almost responsible.

04:02.640 --> 04:06.280
I mean, for real, for me being like so into video games because I remember, I distinctly

04:06.280 --> 04:11.160
remember going when I was three or four years old, it was my sister's wedding reception

04:11.160 --> 04:12.960
for some reason was at Chuck E Cheese.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.400
I think it was like the after reception reception.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.320
Like it was like the real reception was at the Elk Lodge, but then like the wedding party

04:21.320 --> 04:24.120
and the families was more for the kids.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.360
So they, I think my sister was like, let's do something for Rob and the kids.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.560
And so, cause my sister was 16 years older than I am.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.880
So that's why like I'm, I'm four and she's like 20 getting married.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
Right.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.880
So we all went to Chuck E Cheese.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.720
I distinctly remember I have like people ask, what is one of your earliest memories?

04:39.720 --> 04:44.760
I distinctly remember Crystal Castles and the track ball and the little box that they

04:44.760 --> 04:49.440
used to have to bring over that you can stand on so I could be a four year old playing Crystal

04:49.440 --> 04:50.440
Castles.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.200
We had the sit down pole position.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
Nice.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.820
And when they closed the big Chuck E Cheese, they actually moved the same pole position

04:56.820 --> 04:59.680
cabinet to the newer Chuck E Cheese.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.320
And I did as an adult go back and play the exact same one I played as a small kid.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.200
All right, let's go to our chat room.

05:06.200 --> 05:11.680
And the always present, present fourth guest on our show at vognetwork.com.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.680
Click on live chat.

05:12.680 --> 05:17.680
I believe you can also use the URL live.vognetwork.com.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.480
A lot has changed in vognetwork since our last live show and I'll talk about that in

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
a minute.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
Oh, don't forget.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
What?

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
Thanks to Travis last night.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
We have the vognetwork.com as well.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
That's right.

05:27.480 --> 05:32.460
You can also access at the vognetwork and I believe, I don't know, I maybe, I might

05:32.460 --> 05:37.280
get a hand slap from Bobby for making this public, but I know you registered at voiceofgeeks.com

05:37.280 --> 05:38.480
also works.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.640
So there you go.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.720
Several ways you can get to our website.

05:41.720 --> 05:47.000
We prefer vognetwork.com, but you can also do the vognetwork.com.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.280
Going to our chat room.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.200
Vince Raven is in our chat room saying, is this a prerecorded show or live?

05:53.200 --> 05:54.960
It must be live because I just read your name.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
There you go.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
We are live tonight.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.200
I know it was taped last week.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.280
There's no such thing as prerecording.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.700
There's just recording.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.760
That's what they say.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.760
That's the buzzword.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.820
It's voiceofgeeks.com not voiceofgeeksnetwork.com, right?

06:08.820 --> 06:09.820
It's voice, right?

06:09.820 --> 06:10.820
Yeah.

06:10.820 --> 06:11.820
Voiceofgeeks.com.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.280
All right.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.600
And some folks in the chat room are hand slapping there for me.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.640
Uh, let's see.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.360
Also some folks reminiscing about showbiz pizza, which I believe was the Chuck E Cheese

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
of the East coast.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.360
It's kind of the same thing.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.280
And they merge like a black Wolf is in there saying showbiz pizza where a kid can be a

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
kid.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.740
Well now it's where a kid can get shot.

06:30.740 --> 06:34.280
I don't know if you read some of the crazy things that happened at Chuck E Cheese on

06:34.280 --> 06:38.240
Yahoo and news and all that stuff, but they got an image problem.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.600
They're not what they used to be.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.080
I used to like, um, Bullwinkles.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.920
That was the knockoff Chuck E Cheese.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
Oh yes.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.440
Bullwinkles was the shit.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
It was awesome.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
Oh my God.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.880
Water show that you could, you know, watch while you eat pizza.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.640
Here in Sacramento too, there was the best place.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.960
I know this is like, so like nobody in our audience will understand this cause we're

06:57.960 --> 06:59.320
international and all.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
We have folks.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.080
I see Rob from girls gone.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.080
Wow.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.080
From the UK is listening tonight.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.560
I saw Clover Nikon, who I believe is from Australia is listening tonight.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.760
We've got like an international group here tonight.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.620
Now here I am talking about our little hometown of Sacramento, but there used to be this place

07:15.620 --> 07:19.800
called the mine shaft place was the shirt.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.200
Now it's like an abandoned RV.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Yeah.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.800
Now it's like a scary place, but like you used to go underground to start the miniature

07:26.800 --> 07:27.800
golf.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
They had a two story arcade.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.100
It was awesome.

07:30.100 --> 07:35.280
And then right before it closed, it had like a dance club in the basement and it was commonly

07:35.280 --> 07:40.000
known as the Mormon dance club because I guess the mine shaft was owned by Mormons.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.360
And so the Mormon dance club, I don't even know how that works, but I just know that's

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
what everybody did.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
Go there one summer.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.060
Like, you know, just, ah, we'll go play miniature golf there cause I've never really been there

07:50.060 --> 07:51.060
before.

07:51.060 --> 07:55.280
Like, and man, it was, it was run down.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.880
It was pretty bad.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.920
Oh, DJ Morpheus is reminding me about Sam's town too.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
That was awesome.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.920
Damn.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.240
We had some great entertainment and I'm sure wherever you're from in your hometown, you

08:05.240 --> 08:08.320
used to have these great entertainment places that have probably all shut down.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.520
Alan, were there any awesome ones in the Bay area?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.240
I'm not thinking of he's ignoring.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.240
Oh, okay.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.240
Oh, he's shaking his head.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.640
You know what we had in mobile and it's still there and it's changed names, but it used

08:18.640 --> 08:20.760
to be called mount Asia.

08:20.760 --> 08:27.000
It was a huge like multi level, um, uh, mini golf, but it had a great arcade.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.560
That's where I played truck for the first time.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.440
I was hooked on that game.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.360
The only thing notable I can remember in the East Bay was in Concord.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.920
There was a big Malibu grand Prix, which had the RC cars and then a huge arcade, but it

08:37.920 --> 08:39.960
closed when I was like seven.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.480
So I barely remember it.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.480
They saw some of that Scandi is like, you know, I love, not necessarily our Scandi,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.840
our Scandi went, I don't know what happened to our Scandi.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.400
It's just weird.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.800
But like the other Scandi is, you know, they still have like the old arcades and stuff.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.800
They're kind of cool.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.000
They saw that vibe, you know, they have the go-karts and miniature golf and that kind

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
of stuff.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I miss retro arcades.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.280
I wish that's why I loved Flynn's arcade at Disneyland and we weren't here last week because

09:04.280 --> 09:08.680
I made another trip to Disneyland and so I got to see electronic as replacement, which

09:08.680 --> 09:09.960
is the mad tea party.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.080
Now I didn't see the actual party cause we were there on weekdays, but I saw the decorations

09:14.080 --> 09:18.080
and it pained me to see Flynn's arcade just gone, just totally gone.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.280
The front had been replaced with something else that wasn't even really themed for Alice

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
in Wonderland.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.960
Just made me sad as I've been calling it the mad flop party.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.080
I've had some friends that have gone that did not enjoy themselves, but we'll see.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
We'll see.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
You never know.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.280
I think we're all just very bitter about the whole Tron thing being gone.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.560
Anyhow, let's talk about what's changed real quick.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.480
I will get into video games and E3, but I want to talk about some big things for us

09:40.480 --> 09:45.280
that happened during this last week that we weren't here.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.720
Vognetwork.com, our official site has launched.

09:48.720 --> 09:54.020
If you visited it back in May when we first, you know, established the network with Bobby

09:54.020 --> 09:58.080
and understation live, we had kind of a temporary site there that was just one page with the

09:58.080 --> 09:59.520
chat room taking up the whole page.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.760
The full site is now available and if you haven't been able to take a look at it, I

10:03.760 --> 10:08.880
really encourage you to go because in one week, and I'm not just saying this cause you

10:08.880 --> 10:14.760
know, it's like part my idea, the whole site, but in one week we've accomplished so much.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.760
I'm like really proud and a lot of that is the very hard work that Bobby's been putting

10:18.760 --> 10:23.120
in on the programming side of it, but there's been a lot of hard work on the content side

10:23.120 --> 10:24.200
too.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.900
We have some great authors for editorials that we picked up, thanks to Twitter shout

10:28.900 --> 10:29.900
outs.

10:29.900 --> 10:34.520
Jeff, I know is one of them and Elliot, they've been writing some great stuff for the site

10:34.520 --> 10:36.040
and it's not just video game stuff too.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.160
Remember it's the voice of geeks network, so we have articles on Indiana Jones, we have

10:39.160 --> 10:44.100
articles on of course, you know, Minecraft and there's some other things too, but it's

10:44.100 --> 10:45.640
a wide variety of things.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.840
Yes, right before the show I was asking Raul, who are these people that are, you know, writing

10:49.840 --> 10:50.840
stuff for our site?

10:50.840 --> 10:53.280
Oh my God, I don't recognize these people.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.080
Well, Twitter's a powerful thing.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.200
I know Elliot's been following me on Twitter for a while.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.000
He's based out of the UK and he sent me a direct message that took me like three weeks

11:01.000 --> 11:06.600
to respond to cause my Twitter app was acting up, but he already did some writing, I think

11:06.600 --> 11:09.760
for either a high school or a college paper and I was like, all right, you want to write

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
for a school?

11:10.760 --> 11:11.760
Let's, let's see it.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
And he did that.

11:12.760 --> 11:18.640
Uh, Jeff came in from, this is really cool, video game outsiders retweeted us when I put

11:18.640 --> 11:23.920
or retweeted me, I should say when I put the call out for, um, uh, authors, which by the

11:23.920 --> 11:29.480
way, let me just really quick, really quickly say the fact that we're all like supportive

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
of each other.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.680
I love video game outsiders and you know, I know they, they sent the retweet for me

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
and everything.

11:34.680 --> 11:40.520
I hope this dispels the whole, there's an all games and vog network war and they're

11:40.520 --> 11:44.840
a fighting and they're, they, they split, it's civil fricking war.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.080
No, let it go and stop it.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.800
Stop spreading those rumors.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.280
Let them do their thing and be great.

11:51.280 --> 11:56.800
Let us do our thing and also be great because if we're both great, everybody wins.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.040
Anyway, Jeff came in through that retweet and his stuff's been great.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Yeah.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.720
Loki, you say you've been reading that stuff and it's really funny and it's good, good

12:06.720 --> 12:07.720
stuff.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.720
Anyhow.

12:08.720 --> 12:15.500
I'm going to our chat room again at live.vognetwork.com a little more reminiscing there and some

12:15.500 --> 12:18.560
talk about E3 as well.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.120
Act Def is teasing that the, some of the content from orange launch radio, I love this song

12:22.120 --> 12:24.040
is coming this week to vog network.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.040
That's right.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.040
It's going to be growing.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.040
Um, so if you haven't checked out vognetwork.com, please do.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.060
It's not just the station, it's the articles.

12:32.060 --> 12:38.040
And most importantly, the big thing that was announced the Friday before was that it's

12:38.040 --> 12:39.720
all a game.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.840
You can actually sign up.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.800
You can find a loot places on the site.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.560
So EJ from girls gone wow, continuing our conversation from a couple of weeks ago, there's

12:48.560 --> 12:49.560
your loot.

12:49.560 --> 12:54.040
You can check it out over there on the site and you can get loot.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.040
I can't tell you how you get loot, but I'll tell you one of them is really easy.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
Like sign up for the website.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Easy.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
And you get loot.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.280
Um, you can comment on articles, thumbs up.

13:04.280 --> 13:09.000
You can actually, if you notice Bobby posted a review of, I'm going to mess up the name

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
of this.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.520
It's jam music band or something like that.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.320
This just came out on Xbox live arcade.

13:13.320 --> 13:18.960
He wrote a review of that and you can actually write a review that agrees or disagrees and

13:18.960 --> 13:23.480
your review, if approved by the original author, which you know, they're not going to disapprove

13:23.480 --> 13:27.800
it just cause you disagree with them, will show up right underneath the original review.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
It's pretty cool.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.720
So you can like kind of like have your own say like I disagree because XYZ.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
So pretty cool.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.160
We'll have more stuff like that come to the site in the next few weeks.

13:37.160 --> 13:41.440
So yeah, vognetwork.com again, Orange House Radio listeners, if you haven't checked out

13:41.440 --> 13:45.200
the website since the placeholder that was there last month, so much has changed.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
Check it out.

13:46.200 --> 13:52.560
Uh, let's go back into games and talking about E3 and before we get into our own gaming week

13:52.560 --> 13:55.520
and the stuff we've been playing as we usually start the show off with, I know we're going

13:55.520 --> 14:01.840
to do a lot of recapping about E3 tonight and I want to talk about this topic that's

14:01.840 --> 14:05.000
been brought up that's kind of hovering over the air.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.920
And that is the question of, is E3 still relevant?

14:07.920 --> 14:14.560
Now, the ESA was very quick to defend the, that question basically that was asked, uh,

14:14.560 --> 14:19.480
by saying, of course it's still relevant, you know, where this is the, all the, I don't

14:19.480 --> 14:22.480
have the quote in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing of course, but you know, all the attention

14:22.480 --> 14:27.160
is on Los Angeles this week and it's still the place to have games shown and be covered

14:27.160 --> 14:29.000
and be exposed to the world.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.700
It is the place to be, but there's a lot of people that are saying, well, you know, in

14:32.700 --> 14:37.360
this day and age of the internet and where everything kind of goes to spike TV the first

14:37.360 --> 14:43.760
day or G4 hits the internet, is it really that important to be there live and in person?

14:43.760 --> 14:47.720
So I want to ask those in studio, especially considering this year E3 was a bit different

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
for us personally.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.880
This is the first year at Orange Lawns Radio in quite some time.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.380
We didn't really cover it.

14:53.380 --> 14:57.780
We didn't, none of us went and you know, let me ask that question.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.480
Is E3 still relevant?

14:59.480 --> 15:00.480
Loki?

15:00.480 --> 15:05.000
Um, I think it's still relevant because they have a lot of great games being shown there,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.120
but they've kind of made it really difficult for, well, they've always made it kind of

15:09.120 --> 15:13.920
difficult for independent coverage of E3.

15:13.920 --> 15:19.120
It's more of having to, you know, cover the, you know, you don't get invited to the press

15:19.120 --> 15:24.080
events so you cover the feed from Spike TV or something like that, you know, and you

15:24.080 --> 15:30.440
make your comments off of that, which you know, works just fine because it's, you know,

15:30.440 --> 15:33.800
you get to see the same stuff pretty much except you don't get to actually play any

15:33.800 --> 15:36.480
of it.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.480
I don't know.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.360
I think for the gaming industry, I think it's not necessarily the greatest thing for them.

15:43.360 --> 15:49.720
I mean, just because a lot of companies are being hit financially pretty hard and they

15:49.720 --> 15:55.200
can't afford to have these really huge booths and spend millions of dollars on the stuff

15:55.200 --> 16:01.680
like THQ, for example, not at E3 because they can't afford to spend money on that kind of

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
stuff right now.

16:02.680 --> 16:08.360
They have jobs at stake and properties and, you know, their own company, so they can't

16:08.360 --> 16:10.240
do that.

16:10.240 --> 16:15.280
So I think that, you know, as far as saying, oh, E3 is the place to go for game, you know,

16:15.280 --> 16:18.800
news and to see the games and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily the case.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.080
I mean, yeah, it is a place to go.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.080
It's definitely something that people look forward to, but there's also other conventions

16:25.080 --> 16:26.080
out there.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.920
There's PAX, which is definitely getting a lot of coverage for games and stuff.

16:29.920 --> 16:35.600
And honestly, I mean, you can scale down your booth size a bit and show the same type of

16:35.600 --> 16:39.280
stuff there and I think still get the same kind of press coverage that they're getting

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
with E3.

16:40.280 --> 16:46.560
Granted, they're not doing these huge keynote events and stuff like that, but I still think

16:46.560 --> 16:48.760
it's a good way to get your game covered.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.560
Plus, you know, in the day and age of the internet, there's also companies just launching

16:52.560 --> 16:56.360
their own games on Kickstarter or, you know, through other means and they can get press

16:56.360 --> 16:58.960
coverage that way or, I don't know.

16:58.960 --> 17:04.280
I don't think press is necessarily a problem because people were probably talking about

17:04.280 --> 17:10.760
Madden and Assassin's Creed and stuff like that beforehand, but now it's just, hey, look,

17:10.760 --> 17:15.520
we've got, you know, a bunch of people showing off Assassin's Creed at the Sony, you know,

17:15.520 --> 17:19.920
press conference, at the Ubisoft press conference and at the Xbox press conference and at the

17:19.920 --> 17:24.680
Nintendo press conference because they only showed Ubisoft games because a lot of them

17:24.680 --> 17:26.760
just thought they were so awesome.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.280
So yeah, I can see how, you know, they could come to that conclusion.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
I don't know.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.480
I just, I'm just jealous I didn't get to go.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.320
I would like to play some more games, but honestly, you know, digesting it through just,

17:41.320 --> 17:45.640
you know, reading, you know, other sites covering and stuff, I feel that I kind of took in more

17:45.640 --> 17:49.080
information than if I were to be stumbling around because it seems like every time I'd

17:49.080 --> 17:53.680
go to E3, it would be like, oh, hey, you know, there's this really cool game and I didn't

17:53.680 --> 17:58.960
get to see it because I completely was unaware that they had talked about it or was announced

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
or something like that.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.320
And I just never made it over to that booth because I wanted to go see something I was,

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
you know, aware of beforehand.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.280
I don't know.

18:07.280 --> 18:12.800
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shadownextgen, who is actually at the show

18:12.800 --> 18:16.980
and was talking about it extensively on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight said, I think it is

18:16.980 --> 18:19.920
important to be in, be there in person if you can.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.920
I always enjoy the experience.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.080
DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live, I'm reading like comments from other

18:26.080 --> 18:27.600
shows tonight, but that's all right.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
It's a network.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.880
DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live says, I said it during Bobby's show,

18:31.880 --> 18:36.760
but I see South by Southwest becoming the dominant game showcase in a couple of years.

18:36.760 --> 18:41.180
That's a very interesting prediction because South by Southwest is the place where things

18:41.180 --> 18:43.840
like Foursquare really took off.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.620
And I don't know if you view Foursquare as a game, but if you look at VOG Network as

18:47.620 --> 18:51.680
a game, South by Southwest would probably be our show, right?

18:51.680 --> 18:54.680
That's an interesting perspective, especially with the technology and everything.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.880
Except Foursquare kind of sucks.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.840
But think of all the clones that exist.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.240
I mean, think of it this way, Facebook basically jacked Foursquare.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
You know?

19:05.240 --> 19:08.920
So, you know, well then again, one could argue, okay, Grant, I better get this out or I'll

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
get corrected.

19:09.920 --> 19:16.080
Google Latitude was kind of, you know, also before all of that, but I believe that was,

19:16.080 --> 19:21.400
if I got my tech history right, that was Dodgeball and the Dodgeball guy started Foursquare.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
I've gone cross-eyed.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.040
At this point, these big conventions just kind of seem pointless to me because if they

19:27.040 --> 19:33.920
really wanted to get reviews and get the press information out there, they would go to like

19:33.920 --> 19:42.560
a virtual format, you know, VE3 or something, and send out demos directly to the press,

19:42.560 --> 19:49.800
you know, especially since they've been cracking down so hard on, you know, the non-press,

19:49.800 --> 19:51.080
you know what I mean?

19:51.080 --> 19:54.680
The people who are their version of not industry.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.960
I think they're just wasting time and money.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.680
What Up G in our chat says, the only thing you don't get from not being at E3 is any

20:01.680 --> 20:02.680
hands-on time.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.600
Well, I remember a couple of years ago when they did the whole, a lot of demos, not all

20:06.600 --> 20:12.400
of them obviously, but quite a handful of demos were available on Xbox Live as they

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
were there at the show.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
That was pretty awesome.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.480
2006 was the year that they did that.

20:16.480 --> 20:22.920
And they had like, you know, MotoGP and Lost Planet and there was one other one, but I

20:22.920 --> 20:24.760
don't remember what it was.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.760
That was awesome.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.480
E3 at home is basically like, hey, you know what?

20:28.480 --> 20:29.680
We know that you can't go to E3.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.840
Here's some of the E3 demos that are available right now.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.400
Why don't they do that anymore?

20:34.400 --> 20:39.200
I really, I mean, that's a good way to get, you know, information out about your game.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.000
But I understand people are like, oh, well, it's not finished, but who cares?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
You just put that up.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.560
Hey, unfinished game, but you get to check the demo for it.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.480
MotoNext Gen just bring up an interesting point in our chat, sending out demos to the

20:48.480 --> 20:50.240
press wouldn't necessarily work.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.240
Not everyone has debug units that can play the early code.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.480
Maybe that's a part of it that the code isn't ready for that live environment.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.480
You know, there is a difference.

20:57.480 --> 21:02.660
They usually prepare demos, you know, that have taken care of, you know, hiding any errors

21:02.660 --> 21:04.880
and are programmed for certain time limits.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.360
Some companies are sick of doing that.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.800
I remember reading an article on that.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.080
Some companies are thinking there's the E3 demos are actually kind of not a waste of

21:12.080 --> 21:15.680
their time, but it's taking away from time from developing for the game.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.640
So, again, why have E3 at all?

21:18.640 --> 21:19.880
All right.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.680
I really don't see it being relevant anymore.

21:22.680 --> 21:27.640
Going to other comments in our chat room, Dark Tetsuya says, we totally need VOGCON.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
Dream big.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.640
Maybe someday.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.640
Dream big.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.640
Let's see.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.020
And Tigerclaw notices that I am on PlayStation Home right now.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.280
That is correct.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.760
Over there on the TV, look, I'm sitting next to Tigerclaw on the couch.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.800
I am in PlayStation Home and I want to pimp the new VOG Network Clubhouse.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.520
So if you have your PlayStation nearby, fire it up, search in the clubhouses for VOG and

21:50.520 --> 21:53.360
you'll get VOG Network in all caps.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.840
And hopefully, oh, it looks like Blender left, but hopefully he'll be back and he can accept

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
more apps into the clubhouse.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.040
And I got to say, Blender did a great job with the clubhouse.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.800
I didn't even know they had new ones now.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.160
He's got this whole, like, desert, I think it's called the Desert Penthouse or something.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
There's like a little pool.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.420
Look at all those arcade games he's got in there.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.420
It's pretty neat looking.

22:09.420 --> 22:13.000
It totally looks like it's floating.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.320
So anyhow, now you'll notice Tigerclaw and I are sitting on the couch, but not too close

22:17.320 --> 22:18.320
together.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.320
Not too close.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.320
There's...

22:20.320 --> 22:21.520
It's a nice doodly distance apart.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.520
I'm sorry.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.480
I do not believe that that's actually home.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.360
No one is doing the running man.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.360
So, you know.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.360
Oh, hey, DDR machine.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.180
Is that a DDR machine?

22:30.180 --> 22:31.180
Get out.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.180
It's a...

22:32.180 --> 22:34.000
Yeah, it's like a little DDR machine over there.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.320
I believe that is a DDR machine.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.480
Well, speaking of home, they have the whole virtual, you know, not to...

22:39.480 --> 22:43.680
I mentioned Xbox a minute ago, but they do their whole virtual Sony booth.

22:43.680 --> 22:49.000
Granted, it's not the same as being there, but it's kind of a neat little tie-in, you

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
know.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
It kind of...

22:51.000 --> 22:53.640
Again, there's always that question of, what the hell's the point of home?

22:53.640 --> 22:58.200
But when you see something like that, you kind of go, oh, that is pretty cool.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.600
Did you ever look at the virtual booth in home?

23:00.600 --> 23:04.920
I've seen pictures of it, but I haven't been the home for a long time.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.840
I actually haven't ever used home.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.320
Oh, you got to check it out.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.480
It's kind of neat there.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.720
I've been playing on my PC.

23:11.720 --> 23:18.440
I believe Tiger Claw is fulfilling the running man quota here.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
You know what?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.920
I got to say, this may be the reason to bring a live webcam back to the show.

23:22.920 --> 23:28.920
Don't have the cam on us, but put the cam in Sony home, and you guys can look at that

23:28.920 --> 23:30.460
while we broadcast.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.040
I seriously might do that.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.600
That's a good idea.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
Go me.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
I'm going to be storming live on air.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.080
Mister, I'm going to keep the webcam.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.080
You can have the webcam.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
Look, here's the webcam.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.080
There you go.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
All yours.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.080
Have a blast.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.840
Well, I thought you had your video camera hooked up.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
That died, sadly.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.480
That $400 camera died.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.040
That's part of the reason we haven't had video in a while, and that webcam isn't the best

23:53.040 --> 23:54.040
resolution.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.040
You know what?

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
I actually think that my camera still works.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
Oh, yeah?

23:57.040 --> 24:01.120
I mean, I've never tried it as a webcam, and I have to convert all of those Disneyland

24:01.120 --> 24:04.360
movies, but I think my Panasonic still works.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.080
I have an HD camcorder that I'm not using at all.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
All right.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.080
Anyways.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.240
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.840
We'll come back to E3 in just a moment.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.840
Loki's going to wrap up the whole thing for us, and we're going to give our witty insight

24:16.840 --> 24:18.080
and commentary.

24:18.080 --> 24:23.720
First off, though, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.720
Dark Sakura.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
I played stuff.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.720
I played stuff.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
Yes, you did.

24:27.720 --> 24:28.720
And I am so proud of you.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
Anyway, talk.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.200
I played a bunch of Mass Effect until I decided that I really would rather play it on the

24:33.200 --> 24:41.560
PC, because I hate the targeting system so much, and it hurts my hand to try to retarget,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.120
and I kept dying when I found Counselor Choi.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.120
You know what I mean?

24:45.120 --> 24:46.120
The matriarch.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.120
Yes.

24:47.120 --> 24:53.520
So, I swear, she must have been on some pretty nasty PMS, but anyway.

24:53.520 --> 24:57.040
So yeah, all of the Asari commandos, like, whooped my ass.

24:57.040 --> 25:01.220
So I decided to play it on PC instead, and I've remade my femshep, and totally going

25:01.220 --> 25:02.220
after Garrus.

25:02.220 --> 25:03.220
Shut up.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.280
Don't judge me.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.440
Another one indoctrinated, ladies and gentlemen.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Shut up.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
I played some well.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.440
Addict.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
Dealer.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.440
Rob, you are the game pimp, okay?

25:17.440 --> 25:18.440
You know what?

25:18.440 --> 25:20.400
You have to kind of blame Shane for that, really, though.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.160
That was just like, that's like the whole, like, this is like, Mass Effect is now this

25:24.160 --> 25:30.840
Tupperware pyramid scheme, and Shane is kind of like the regional director, and he got

25:30.840 --> 25:36.720
me hooked, and now, in an attempt to, you know, get my free toaster, I got Dark Sakura

25:36.720 --> 25:37.720
hooked.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.000
It's a pyramid scheme.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.280
That's right, it's a pyramid scheme.

25:40.280 --> 25:44.840
Oh, and I want to point out, Tigerclaw totally moved closer to me on that couch, you see

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
that?

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
That's still a dudely distance.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.840
It is a dudely distance.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.920
Well, I think that's the, uh...

25:49.920 --> 25:53.640
That's the appropriate distance for dudes to be apart.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.480
That is the, um, programmed distance away.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.280
That's where your hitbox is.

25:59.280 --> 26:02.640
Well, I also played, I did play WoW.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.120
I'll put a picture of this on orangehonestready.com.

26:05.120 --> 26:12.040
I did play WoW, duh, and I started another MMO just because of Iguana Girl, of Jessica

26:12.040 --> 26:17.080
Harper, who has said, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, so finally I'm like,

26:17.080 --> 26:21.020
okay, I'll give it a try, you know, because I'm a little bored with WoW because other

26:21.020 --> 26:24.480
people are playing Diablo all the damn time, shut up.

26:24.480 --> 26:31.280
So, um, the pyramid head scheme, um, so I started playing Lord of the Rings online,

26:31.280 --> 26:39.800
and it's actually not bad, um, it's very pretty, I actually prefer it graphically to WoW, um,

26:39.800 --> 26:45.120
lots of, lots of fun in-depth stuff, I really like how it more mirrors the books, and you

26:45.120 --> 26:50.320
know, without Tolkien's horrible, horrible writing, I'm sorry, you spend, when you spend

26:50.320 --> 26:54.900
five pages describing the landscape, and like half a paragraph describing the people you're

26:54.900 --> 26:58.000
talking about, that's not good writing.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.080
And I'm probably going to hell in the minds of lots of, uh, Tolkien fans, but I don't

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
care.

27:04.080 --> 27:11.200
Um, I did play a little Diablo, by the way, um, but I actually, you know, I'm, I've only

27:11.200 --> 27:15.520
played, I'm only a level 8 character right now in Lord of the Rings, it's enough that

27:15.520 --> 27:21.000
I've gotten kind of a grasp that, number one, I like the camera in WoW better, but I like

27:21.000 --> 27:25.160
the scenery in, the graphics in, um, Lord of the Rings better.

27:25.160 --> 27:31.400
I do have to say that WoW has better water effects, just saying, um, I actually, when

27:31.400 --> 27:36.840
I had it optimized, it basically lets me run the game at full settings, and I had some

27:36.840 --> 27:45.040
lag today, but for the most part, it actually runs pretty smoothly, um, I've, uh, I've basically

27:45.040 --> 27:53.440
had some problems with, uh, some kill stealing, so I don't like that my targets aren't locked,

27:53.440 --> 27:55.400
but, you know, what can you do?

27:55.400 --> 27:59.600
It's free, I don't, I like the free part, the free's good, and I played some STO this

27:59.600 --> 28:05.280
week, by the way, um, just to, uh, play Dabo at Deep Space Nine.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
And um...

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
You've been MMOing it up!

28:07.280 --> 28:09.680
I have been, I'm like a little whore here.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.800
No, I'm not a whore, because I'm paying.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.720
Somebody clip that little, clip that little phrase and send it to Travis.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.440
I'm a Momo slut.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.920
I'm being, I'm a Momo slut.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.800
I'm playing the field.

28:20.800 --> 28:26.440
Hey, if guys can do it and are, you know, lauded for it, then a woman should be able

28:26.440 --> 28:29.320
to be lauded for spreading herself out a little bit too.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.080
Just saying.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.440
Double standard here, double standard.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.760
It was right in his show forums.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.320
Bitches.

28:37.320 --> 28:45.840
So um, and uh, I have also decided, I'd played the Minecraft demo, the freebie version that's

28:45.840 --> 28:46.840
on the website.

28:46.840 --> 28:47.840
Hated it!

28:47.840 --> 28:48.840
Wait.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
No.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
There's no waiting.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.040
I hated the demo too.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.360
There's no waiting, I thought it was boring as shit.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.080
And actually it made me motion sick, it did make me, now the one, actually going back

29:00.080 --> 29:06.080
to uh, um, the reason why, the other reason I shifted to playing Mass Effect on PC is

29:06.080 --> 29:09.960
because the Xbox version made me motion sick, and I haven't had that yet with the PC version.

29:09.960 --> 29:14.160
Because I'm playing it in windowed mode, and it gives me a little bit more to focus on

29:14.160 --> 29:15.160
other things.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.680
Turned off the motion blur, turned off the fill grain, all of that, it still made me

29:18.680 --> 29:19.840
sick.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.440
And I hate to say it, but I do get motion sickness with Lord of the Rings because of

29:23.440 --> 29:24.740
the camera.

29:24.740 --> 29:30.040
Because it's like, okay, you know how in WoW the camera auto adjusts when you're running?

29:30.040 --> 29:33.480
In Lord of the Rings you can actually turn your camera around, you can watch yourself

29:33.480 --> 29:38.880
sideways, but you're still moving forward with W. If that makes sense.

29:38.880 --> 29:44.520
So, I'll try to hit sideways because that's the direction on my screen is trying to run.

29:44.520 --> 29:49.840
And my camera is oriented the other way, so it's more or less, I guess, a little bit of

29:49.840 --> 29:53.320
user error, but I still would prefer that auto orienting, and I don't know if I have

29:53.320 --> 29:54.520
a way to turn that on.

29:54.520 --> 29:59.920
However, it's got this full, um, cosmetic thing, so you, it's kind of like, not necessarily

29:59.920 --> 30:05.120
like transmogging, because honestly I really like the transmogging system, and you really

30:05.120 --> 30:11.160
have to think about what you want, but, um, I do like the cosmetic system and, you know,

30:11.160 --> 30:14.120
the dye, you know, you can get clothes dye and everything.

30:14.120 --> 30:20.760
And crafting is better, oh my god, crafting is so much easier, the end.

30:20.760 --> 30:29.000
So I'm about even, I mean, WoW is still, thanks, sorry, you know, I still like WoW, I'm not,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.840
I signed the blood pact, I'm not quitting.

30:30.840 --> 30:35.760
And Pandaria may kind of, you know, WoW is really a lull for a lot of people now.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
I like monks.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.760
I want a goat monk so bad.

30:37.760 --> 30:44.920
But, you know, the one thing that really, and I decided this today, the really big thing

30:44.920 --> 30:51.360
that Lord of the Rings does not have going for it, no true caster DPS class.

30:51.360 --> 30:55.320
You have a hunter, that's your only real dedicated DPS class.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.240
And you know me, I like the pew pew.

30:57.240 --> 31:04.080
I have, what, a mage, a druid, a shadow priest, you know, on WoW, I play caster pew pew.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.720
So you know, if that popped up on Lord of the Rings, oh no, that might, that might pull

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
me over permanently.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
It's the same.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
And I like free.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.720
Did I say I like free?

31:13.720 --> 31:14.720
I like free.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.200
The MMO queen has spoken.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.040
Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
And Ragnarok Online.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.600
How was your gaming week?

31:20.600 --> 31:24.200
I played mostly Minecraft.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.600
I started by building an artificial volcano.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.800
Took the largest mountain that was in the game, well, largest mountain in this one area,

31:31.800 --> 31:37.880
and then I built on top of it, all the way up to the top of the skybox, and then I covered

31:37.880 --> 31:43.280
the whole thing with obsidian, because I had duped a bunch of obsidian, and then I poured

31:43.280 --> 31:48.640
some volcano, or some lava over the top of that, and got too much lava.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.680
There was a ton of lava on there, man.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.080
You put that in the wrong spot, and it'll just spread like crazy.

31:55.080 --> 32:01.000
So I finally took care of that, and got it a little bit more situated to how I like it,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.760
and then started to hollow the whole inside off.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.600
And actually it's kind of cool, because the whole thing is actually the shrine of fire,

32:08.600 --> 32:13.280
because there is fire all over the place, there's lava fountains on the inside.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
It's just ridiculous.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.360
Didn't you do a shrine of fire in Animal Crossing?

32:16.360 --> 32:17.360
Oh no, that was Jamie.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.360
That was Jamie.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.360
That was Jamie that did that.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.240
We did the shrine to fire, and we had lesbians.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.240
Remember, we had lesbians.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.760
Yeah, I do remember the lesbians in your neighborhood.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.280
With the rainbow sign in front of her house.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.040
It was the one that was the gym teacher.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.320
She had the gym themed, and the short hair.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.000
I swear she was the biggest lesbian ever.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.760
The only thing that kept her from being the ultimate lesbian was by having multiple girlfriends

32:37.760 --> 32:39.620
live with her in succession.

32:39.620 --> 32:44.640
So you had the shrine to fire in your basement in Animal Crossing.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.840
You had the shrine to fire in Minecraft.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.760
What game do I make the shrine to fire in?

32:48.760 --> 32:50.220
That's what I need to figure out.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.800
Just a Minecraft, I don't know.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
We'll see.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.160
Oh, oh, oh, that just reminds me of something.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.600
I can have a house in Lord of the Rings, and I might build a shrine to fire there.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Just saying.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.920
Just don't burn down your house.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.320
I miss Mog houses.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.480
You know, Rob, I miss Mog houses.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.480
I do too.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
Wowney's houses.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.480
They do.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.480
They do.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
Alright, alright.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.480
Rather than me just pretending that my goat lives in the back room of the tavern.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.480
The man finishes gaming week so we can get to E3.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.480
He's gonna get the rest of the damn show.

33:13.480 --> 33:18.760
So anyways, so other than, yeah, I've just been playing Minecraft for the most of it.

33:18.760 --> 33:24.400
It's kinda cool though, because it, unbeknownst to me, there was a dungeon in the middle of

33:24.400 --> 33:28.920
that mountain that I built the volcano on.

33:28.920 --> 33:35.280
So now I have this dungeon that's gonna be in the bottom of this giant fortress to fire.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.640
And you'll be able to fight mobs down there.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.700
So that's kinda cool.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.320
So I'll be playing a little bit more of that this week.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.760
Did you build an arena down there?

33:40.760 --> 33:41.760
I'm going to.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.880
I'm going to build an arena.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.480
Does Minecraft have PvP yet?

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
No.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.640
You can lock a bunch of those ugly things in an arena and make them kill each other.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.640
You can do the chickens.

33:50.640 --> 33:55.440
You can lock a bunch of, yeah, cause you, if you take the egg and throw it, it makes

33:55.440 --> 33:56.440
a new chicken.

33:56.440 --> 33:57.680
Yeah, it doesn't do that every time though.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.080
You could have chicken fighting, illegal chicken fighting in your arena.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.540
I did find it funny though, sometimes I'll be inside the volcano thing like hollowing

34:06.540 --> 34:12.000
it out and I'll hear a cow catching fire cause it was stupid and walked into the lava.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.240
So that's kinda funny.

34:13.240 --> 34:19.480
And then the other game I played, ironically, was an Atari 2600 game.

34:19.480 --> 34:25.120
And it's an Atari 2600 game that's exclusive to the contest I'm playing which is for Ready

34:25.120 --> 34:26.120
Player One.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.580
I don't know if everyone heard, but Ready Player One, you know the wonderful book they

34:29.580 --> 34:33.340
keep talking about, they have an Easter egg hidden in the book.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.860
And they have a contest now that goes along with that Easter egg.

34:35.860 --> 34:39.960
You find the Easter egg, takes you to a website, you play this Atari 2600 game.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.600
You find the Easter egg in that, takes you to the next website which the game unlocks

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
there.

34:44.600 --> 34:48.080
July 1st and then you play through that game, then you get increasingly harder.

34:48.080 --> 34:52.360
And then the next game unlocks August 1st, kinda like the real hunt, except there is

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
a real prize.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.240
The real prize is a DeLorean.

34:55.240 --> 35:01.800
A DeLorean with a replica flux capacitor inside it that, you know, is being given away.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.360
Which sounds all kinds of amazing.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.360
Yes, so I...

35:04.360 --> 35:06.680
It makes me want to get into this book series.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.400
I, um, so I found...

35:08.400 --> 35:09.400
Or book.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.600
I found the Easter egg after a little bit of a hint from online.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.120
Someone mentioned that you have to look for a certain...

35:16.120 --> 35:18.640
Because I was looking through the book, I didn't really get a chance to look at it the

35:18.640 --> 35:19.640
first day and stuff.

35:19.640 --> 35:23.720
And I'm like, eh, I'm looking for a URL, but I didn't quite catch it.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.400
And then they mentioned, oh, well you have to look for this type of thing that's with

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
the letters.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.320
And then I'm like, oh, okay, there it is, I see it.

35:30.320 --> 35:35.580
So I went and played the game, beat the game, um, you know, after Josh went to bed.

35:35.580 --> 35:40.400
And I didn't even make the top 100, though, on Leaderboard, but then again, it doesn't

35:40.400 --> 35:44.280
matter because each game is time-unlocked, so it's not...

35:44.280 --> 35:49.120
The next game's not gonna start until July 1st, and then the final game's August 1st,

35:49.120 --> 35:55.400
and really the contest is whoever has all three games completed first is the winner.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.800
So how fast you are at the first game and second game doesn't really matter as long

35:58.800 --> 36:04.600
as you get the third game after completing the first two, as long as you're first in

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
second.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
So, I don't know.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.000
But Stax was kind of neat.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.620
It was like a throwback to, like, Pitfall.

36:10.620 --> 36:11.620
It was pretty hard.

36:11.620 --> 36:17.640
You had to, you know, it was weird, you have to jump over these, like, static charge things

36:17.640 --> 36:21.900
and avoid these things that look like squids, and then there's flashers.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.800
There's people trying to flash you like old dirty men.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.800
I don't really understand what that has to do with anything.

36:27.800 --> 36:32.040
But you're supposed to find, like, six puzzle pieces, and then once you find the six puzzle

36:32.040 --> 36:37.440
pieces, you have to find the Easter egg in the game, which is very reminiscent to Adventure,

36:37.440 --> 36:42.720
and then once you find that, you go back to, you know, a certain room and you find a QR

36:42.720 --> 36:50.680
code that unlocks the third place, and that's eventually where the game's gonna unlock next.

36:50.680 --> 36:54.520
And apparently people were aware of the website, like, I've been talking to Dark Tetsuya about

36:54.520 --> 36:57.720
the whole thing since, you know, he's into the whole, you know, game and kind of tried

36:57.720 --> 37:02.360
to help him out with the game, but, you know, he's like, oh hey, I knew about that website

37:02.360 --> 37:06.760
way a long time ago, but it wasn't necessarily because of the Easter egg in the book, it's

37:06.760 --> 37:09.560
just, you know, it's kind of obvious what the website is.

37:09.560 --> 37:15.200
But yeah, it was fun, it was kind of fun to get to play, like, an old game, and it's also

37:15.200 --> 37:19.220
fun to kind of participate in this, like, real life hunt thing.

37:19.220 --> 37:22.760
Although if I win a DeLorean, I don't really know what I'm gonna do with it since I don't

37:22.760 --> 37:26.760
know how to drive stick, and, you know, and then there's all the other stuff you don't

37:26.760 --> 37:31.000
think about, like, paying taxes, registration, and all that stuff, and shipping the car to

37:31.000 --> 37:33.320
you, I mean, that's expensive.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.320
But it's a fucking DeLorean.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.320
But you have a fucking DeLorean.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.320
Exactly.

37:36.320 --> 37:42.520
I'm like, I rolled that window down, fucking pop in the CD, because it does have a CD player

37:42.520 --> 37:47.760
that the guy put in it, and it's all Back to the Future soundtrack right there.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.680
Just blast that shit up the radio.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.360
Awesome.

37:52.360 --> 37:58.520
My gaming week, um, not too terribly thrilling, because I was gone for most of the week.

37:58.520 --> 38:04.000
I went to Los Angeles, I was not at E3, I always take E3 week off, but I went with Extifer

38:04.000 --> 38:06.880
from Hoard House and his significant other, Matt.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.800
We all went down to LA and went to, like, Universal Studios in Disneyland.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.760
I won't, you know, spend too much time talking about all of that, since there wasn't a whole

38:13.760 --> 38:19.280
lot of gaming involved, but I will say, that Mummy ride at Universal Studios is fucking

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
amazing.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.280
I loved it.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.160
Extifer and I were screaming like girls, I wish somebody got a YouTube of it, because

38:24.160 --> 38:26.080
you guys would have got a kick out of it.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.720
Anyway, on to games.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.480
When I got home, I did play some games.

38:29.480 --> 38:36.160
I played multiplayer Mass Effect a little bit this weekend, because Osfer from our chat

38:36.160 --> 38:39.760
room, and Acidic Vampire from our chat room, and Shane from Hoard House is also in chat.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.320
We all are, like, playing now, and there's an event going on this weekend.

38:43.320 --> 38:48.360
We were having fun last night, trying to survive a gold map, it didn't go very well.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.360
Actually, we got to, like, wave five, maybe.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.880
Also did some multiplayer over on PlayStation 3 with another listener, Stan.

38:55.880 --> 39:00.040
We had kind of a crappy connection, Soul Calibur, so we were trying to do that.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.160
We have a dude with a lightsaber doing the Running Man.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.320
I think that's Black Wolf.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.320
Anyway.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.240
Yeah, more dancing now.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.680
Ah, two Running Man.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.680
Now it's home!

39:10.680 --> 39:14.680
Yeah, Blender signed into the clubhouse, and I guess he accepted all these new people,

39:14.680 --> 39:15.680
so there you go.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.680
We got VX, Jason, XV.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.440
Alright, anyhow, hello, back to me.

39:21.440 --> 39:27.040
So there was multiplayer Soul Calibur, which sadly was too laggy, but Stan makes some hilarious

39:27.040 --> 39:28.040
characters.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.040
I loved his Mr. Slave.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.360
I was like, people can, like, get away with that in Soul Calibur.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.760
It was pretty risqué, we'll just leave it at that.

39:34.760 --> 39:40.000
Then played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, which I, that's really Alan's game, not my

39:40.000 --> 39:44.040
game, so I was pretty much button mashing, but hey, was having some fun.

39:44.040 --> 39:49.920
Also on PlayStation, thanks to the whole PlayStation Plus, thank you Sony, for all those free freaking

39:49.920 --> 39:51.440
games this week.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.440
I realize they're-

39:52.440 --> 39:54.040
Are you borrowing my copy of Little Big Planet 2?

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
No.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.040
Oh, okay.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.040
Nevermind.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.040
I don't think so.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.040
I don't have it anywhere.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.040
Maybe I didn't loan that to you yet.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.040
I don't think you did.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.240
So, um, what the hell is that shirt?

40:03.240 --> 40:05.240
It's like glowing, sorry, I'm distracted by hope.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.240
It's a DVR shirt.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.520
This is terrible radio!

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
What?

40:08.520 --> 40:12.440
It looks like he's not wearing pants, or is that like a Minecraft bottom?

40:12.440 --> 40:13.440
It's like, I don't know.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.720
Blender, what the hell are you wearing?

40:17.720 --> 40:21.640
It looks like he's not wearing pants, and it's like a censored butt.

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
Anyway.

40:22.640 --> 40:23.640
PlayStation.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.640
Games.

40:24.640 --> 40:27.520
Little Big Planet 2 was one of the free games.

40:27.520 --> 40:34.480
So finally, what, about two years late, I'm finally getting into Little Big Planet 2.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.100
It's great, obviously.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.680
I love the minigames.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.760
It's just a great platformer.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.720
I've barely scratched the surface of the game, to be honest, but it's everything I loved

40:44.720 --> 40:49.880
about the first one, now with, you know, grappling hooks from the very start, and more cutscene

40:49.880 --> 40:50.880
stuff.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.720
I will say the only thing I kind of didn't like is that the story is really weird in

40:55.720 --> 40:56.720
the beginning.

40:56.720 --> 41:02.100
I like the more ambiguous nature of the first game, which relied a lot heavier on the narrator

41:02.100 --> 41:03.100
and so forth.

41:03.100 --> 41:06.880
Now in this one, they're trying to like build a different story, and I'm not really into

41:06.880 --> 41:07.880
it.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.600
But that's my one tiny, tiny little bitch about it.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.560
Otherwise, it's Little Big Planet, and it's great, and I really don't know why it took

41:13.560 --> 41:15.520
me so long to get into part two.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.520
I really don't.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.800
I don't have an excuse.

41:17.800 --> 41:18.880
I was too busy playing Mass Effect.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
We'll say that.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.880
I still haven't really gotten into part two.

41:20.880 --> 41:29.360
I mean, I played maybe one level of it, and I was just like, other game.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.080
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.520
You know, the free Little Big Planet 2, Mass Effect, wow, Diablo, I played a little Diablo

41:34.520 --> 41:38.280
with Shane, started a witch doctor, got it up to level like six or something.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.960
Not too, enough to kill, enough to beat the beta.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.360
We got up to the Skeleton King, and then I was like, I gotta go eat, so.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.280
I killed the crap out of the Skeleton King.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.280
It actually was hard.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.280
A little.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.280
A little.

41:50.280 --> 41:54.080
All right, housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into E3 news.

41:54.080 --> 41:59.240
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

41:59.240 --> 42:03.280
Tell friends about the show, word of mouth, you know, again, we're not attached to a big

42:03.280 --> 42:04.280
magazine.

42:04.280 --> 42:09.920
We hope vognetwork.com will become all the rage someday, and geeks everywhere will visit

42:09.920 --> 42:12.680
it, and then we can say we have a big website behind us supporting us.

42:12.680 --> 42:15.960
What the hell is that?

42:15.960 --> 42:20.560
Is that one of those aliens from Men in Black or something?

42:20.560 --> 42:22.940
Blender is in home a lot.

42:22.940 --> 42:27.280
He's like the home expert, like look, he started the clubhouse, and look at how well decorated

42:27.280 --> 42:32.080
that is compared to the shitty one I made for OLR, which had like an airplane seat and

42:32.080 --> 42:35.280
a Pac-Man cabinet.

42:35.280 --> 42:38.080
So clearly if there's any weird shit in home, he has it.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.600
Anyway, stop getting distracted with the visual.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.640
It's terrible radio.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.200
It is one of the aliens.

42:43.200 --> 42:48.140
Hopefully vognetwork.com will be the shit someday, and geeks everywhere will be visiting

42:48.140 --> 42:52.160
it, but until then, we don't have a multimillion dollar website backing us or any of that stuff,

42:52.160 --> 42:56.120
so please tell friends about Orange Launch Radio and about VOG Network, because maybe

42:56.120 --> 43:01.700
if they hate Orange Launch Radio, they'll love one of the new shows on VOG Network's

43:01.700 --> 43:08.760
radio station, including Pod Culture on Monday nights, Anime Jam Session on Tuesday nights,

43:08.760 --> 43:14.740
Warcraft Wednesdays with Girls Gone Wow and Hoard House on Wednesdays, and plenty more

43:14.740 --> 43:15.740
to come soon.

43:15.740 --> 43:19.080
All right, let's get into E3 news.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.320
Loki is going to be taking this over.

43:21.320 --> 43:25.360
Since I was away at Disneyland and not paying attention to my TV, I was trying to follow

43:25.360 --> 43:31.200
the news best I could, but Loki, you were on top of everything, so let's run down the

43:31.200 --> 43:32.640
various press conferences.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.840
The first people up were Microsoft.

43:34.840 --> 43:40.440
Okay, so Microsoft had their press conference, and it was kind of weird, because they started

43:40.440 --> 43:43.320
off really strong, because they showed Halo 4.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.320
That's how you start off a fucking press conference.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.880
Halo 4.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.320
Here it is.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.320
Get excited.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.040
And yeah, it was pretty exciting.

43:51.040 --> 43:57.160
It's a pretty awesome looking game, and just going into a little bit more detail about

43:57.160 --> 44:01.360
what to kind of expect for it, and man, it looks nice.

44:01.360 --> 44:07.200
I mean, actually kind of excited about Halo again, since the last one I was excited about

44:07.200 --> 44:10.640
was Halo 3, so it might be interesting to pick up.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.320
Some other cool stuff that they showed off besides Halo.

44:14.320 --> 44:20.320
Of course, there was the unveiling of Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was an Ubisoft game.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.080
That looked pretty awesome, so they had a little clip of that.

44:25.080 --> 44:30.120
Of course, talking a little bit more about arcade.

44:30.120 --> 44:33.120
They had the summer of arcade stuff.

44:33.120 --> 44:37.800
They're talking about some of the games we can expect for that, and actually some interesting

44:37.800 --> 44:38.800
things.

44:38.800 --> 44:42.480
Some that we already knew about, and some that were kind of on the way.

44:42.480 --> 44:47.560
For example, they were talking Deadlight, which is going to be a new side scroller game.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.080
It's supposed to be coming out.

44:49.080 --> 44:53.880
It looked kind of like a zombie survivor horror type thing.

44:53.880 --> 44:59.160
Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, which is supposed to be out, I think, in a couple weeks.

44:59.160 --> 45:05.840
Dust and Elysian Tail was something that was actually supposed to be an indie game a while

45:05.840 --> 45:13.680
back, but they ended up getting it published because it looks fucking amazing.

45:13.680 --> 45:21.240
Let's see, also, Recettear, which is going to be the new Kinect game that's kind of like...

45:21.240 --> 45:23.160
People are kind of saying it's a little bit like Angry Birds.

45:23.160 --> 45:29.520
I think it's more of like, was it that, the blockbusting game that they had for the Wii.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.440
That looked, eh, it's okay.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.440
It's a Kinect game.

45:34.440 --> 45:39.480
I'm always kind of hesitant about those Kinect games.

45:39.480 --> 45:44.400
Other things that they were talking about, of course, entertainment was a big focus for

45:44.400 --> 45:50.040
Xbox since they were talking about making this center of entertainment for your household

45:50.040 --> 45:51.040
and stuff.

45:51.040 --> 45:56.960
Of course, more app announcements, including partnerships with Nickelodeon, Paramount,

45:56.960 --> 46:03.440
Makima, or Machinima, I guess, Univision, Televiso, yes.

46:03.440 --> 46:07.480
Hell yeah, until somebody on Twitter told me they were ending Sabato Higante this year.

46:07.480 --> 46:08.960
That's sad.

46:08.960 --> 46:15.200
NHL and ESPN, of course, is getting some new stuff.

46:15.200 --> 46:19.600
Other game announcements, other than Halo 4, Forza Horizon, which I knew was coming

46:19.600 --> 46:22.640
out, they announced a date, October 23rd for that.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.560
Fable the Journey is coming out this fall.

46:24.560 --> 46:28.460
Of course, we knew about Gears of War Judgment from the whole Game Informer thing.

46:28.460 --> 46:31.040
That's now coming in 2013.

46:31.040 --> 46:36.640
Dance Central 3 coming out, with a partnership with Usher in there.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.280
He's doing some of the choreography and some of his songs are in there.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.200
Also a new Nike Fitness game is going to be coming out.

46:44.200 --> 46:49.360
Kind of interesting, I guess, partnership with them.

46:49.360 --> 46:55.480
Then, of course, Xbox Music was another big thing that they were talking about, the entertainment

46:55.480 --> 46:56.480
thing.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.200
You're going to have 30 million tracks with that.

46:58.200 --> 47:02.440
Of course, it's going to support some of the new features like Smart Glass, which was another

47:02.440 --> 47:03.960
big unveiling.

47:03.960 --> 47:12.160
Smart Glass is basically this technology where they can use any iOS, Android, I'm assuming,

47:12.160 --> 47:18.160
Windows Phone, tablet, device, anything that you may have already.

47:18.160 --> 47:24.360
You download an app for it and it becomes a second screen, just like the Wii U or the

47:24.360 --> 47:27.240
Vita and the PlayStation 3.

47:27.240 --> 47:33.720
I was floored, personally, hearing that that's not exclusive to a Windows device, that they

47:33.720 --> 47:36.040
are going to open that up to iPads and so forth.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.200
I mean, it's smart.

47:37.200 --> 47:42.000
More people will adopt it because I think finally Microsoft had to admit, you know what,

47:42.000 --> 47:43.880
Apple's got a big bite here.

47:43.880 --> 47:48.640
We've seen Microsoft take little, like they dip their foot in the pool because there's

47:48.640 --> 47:53.160
a fully functional Xbox Live app for iPhone and iPad.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.980
It's a universal app that's actually quite good.

47:55.980 --> 47:57.680
It's very similar to the Xbox.com website.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.020
You can manage your friends list from it.

47:59.020 --> 48:00.720
You see your avatars.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.320
It's a full-fledged app.

48:02.320 --> 48:08.040
Microsoft doing stuff with Apple products is not unheard of, but I did not think they

48:08.040 --> 48:12.960
were going to just jump in the pool full in, so this was a pleasant surprise.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.080
Yeah, and this is not just for games.

48:15.080 --> 48:20.720
I mean, they did announce that Halo 4 and Madden are going to both support this technology,

48:20.720 --> 48:25.280
but it's pretty much for everything, including they're talking about some support for some

48:25.280 --> 48:26.720
of the apps that they had.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.000
One of the examples they gave was Game of Thrones.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.920
You could be watching Game of Thrones and getting supplemental information about the

48:32.920 --> 48:36.840
series on your tablet while you're watching the series.

48:36.840 --> 48:42.000
For example, they'd be showing different locations and it'll zoom in on a map to where those

48:42.000 --> 48:44.960
locations are in the whole world.

48:44.960 --> 48:48.960
Honestly, it reminds me a lot of the tie-in stuff that they have with some of these Blu-rays.

48:48.960 --> 48:55.740
I don't know if you've seen a lot of Blu-rays that have iPod apps or iPad apps that you

48:55.740 --> 49:00.240
can watch with the movie and it will have that supplemental information.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.720
This technology's been around out there, but now they're adopting it for the console.

49:03.720 --> 49:08.760
Plus, you'll be able to control your console using this as well.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
That's kind of neat.

49:09.760 --> 49:16.480
Of course, long-awaited finally announced Internet Explorer is coming to the Xbox.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.520
We will now have an internet browser.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.880
It will support the smart glass stuff.

49:20.880 --> 49:27.560
It'll also be connect-enabled and you'll be able to use voice commands to do searches

49:27.560 --> 49:31.160
and stuff like that.

49:31.160 --> 49:34.660
That's pretty cool.

49:34.660 --> 49:41.040
I'm not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, but hey, whatever, at least it's an option to

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
browse the internet.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.040
Cool.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.040
Honestly.

49:45.040 --> 49:49.560
It'll get porn on my 360, so yay for that.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.920
Xbox porn.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.640
What about emulators?

49:53.640 --> 49:57.760
Do we know if it's going to support Flash or Java or any of that?

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
No idea.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.760
Because you know, it isn't complete until you get Super Mario Brothers running on your

50:02.760 --> 50:03.760
Xbox.

50:03.760 --> 50:10.760
They already technically have that reset glitch Xboxes and they have the dual NAND reset glitch

50:10.760 --> 50:16.860
chips you can get where you have one mode that you can boot in that's hacked and one

50:16.860 --> 50:19.680
that's stock.

50:19.680 --> 50:23.800
Going to some comments from our chatroom at vognetwork.com, Osfer says, I can't wait for

50:23.800 --> 50:24.920
Halo 4.

50:24.920 --> 50:29.040
The Metroid atmosphere and look to it really pulled me in and Cortana looks better and

50:29.040 --> 50:30.840
more emotionally charged than ever.

50:30.840 --> 50:34.200
I've heard a lot of good things about it from people who were on the show floor.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.960
You know, I got to admit, I feel the same way as much as I wasn't super duper into the

50:37.960 --> 50:39.440
first person Metroid games.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
Well, that's not true.

50:40.440 --> 50:45.440
I did love Metroid Prime 3, but I mean, like just seeing that gameplay footage of Halo

50:45.440 --> 50:50.360
4 for me, sorry, I'm going backwards, but blame the chatroom.

50:50.360 --> 50:51.480
I was really into it.

50:51.480 --> 50:55.800
I mean, I, and I haven't really cared about Halo since Halo 3, which, you know, once I

50:55.800 --> 50:59.640
played Halo 3 wasn't, you know, it didn't throw me the same way Halo 2 did, but watching

50:59.640 --> 51:04.400
the Halo 4, I was like, you know, maybe the change in developers wasn't necessarily a

51:04.400 --> 51:09.400
bad thing because it forces them to kind of start over with some new ideas and you do

51:09.400 --> 51:13.400
see some of this other influence and I, you know, and that's no disrespect towards Bungie.

51:13.400 --> 51:17.160
They made a great game and I'm sure whatever they've got, this destiny thing is going to

51:17.160 --> 51:18.160
kick ass too.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.160
Well, let's look at it this way.

51:19.160 --> 51:23.160
I mean, look at you had people making need for speed games and granted the need for speed

51:23.160 --> 51:27.600
games are pretty good and now you have, you know, another company criterion making these

51:27.600 --> 51:31.800
need for speed games, you know, or making sequels to these need for speed games and

51:31.800 --> 51:32.800
they're better.

51:32.800 --> 51:37.640
You know, not saying that the old ones weren't good, but now they're, you know, they have

51:37.640 --> 51:43.680
a fresh take on them and so it's a little bit better.

51:43.680 --> 51:50.860
One other thing of, you know, kind of, it was a bit of a rumor, but now those $99 contract

51:50.860 --> 51:56.720
Xboxes or whatever are coming to more retailers other than Microsoft stores because Microsoft,

51:56.720 --> 52:02.320
they kind of figured, hey, we don't have a lot of stores out there, so best buys and

52:02.320 --> 52:08.760
also select GameStop locations and from what I hear also from my boss meeting with Microsoft,

52:08.760 --> 52:12.560
there is actually, anybody's going to be able to do it as long as you're willing, as long

52:12.560 --> 52:17.480
as you fit the criteria that they are looking for and there's like specific things that

52:17.480 --> 52:18.480
they need, so.

52:18.480 --> 52:22.720
By the way, this was on the OLR Twitter last week, just saying.

52:22.720 --> 52:27.640
Sometimes you get the secrets, little secrets, what we can, what little secrets we get, we

52:27.640 --> 52:30.080
will let you know.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.040
So there was all that stuff.

52:32.040 --> 52:38.240
Overall, I think they had a decent press conference just, you know, and I know a lot of the people

52:38.240 --> 52:42.280
that were kind of, oh, some other announcements that they made, of course, and some of the

52:42.280 --> 52:46.520
stuff, of course, they showed Black Ops 2, a little bit of that and they announced that

52:46.520 --> 52:48.920
they're getting DLC first for that.

52:48.920 --> 52:53.720
Game with South Park, The Stick of Truth is getting DLC for it first, it's coming out

52:53.720 --> 52:54.720
March 5th now.

52:54.720 --> 52:57.480
It's going to have Kinect support as well on the 360.

52:57.480 --> 53:02.240
Tomb Raider is getting the DLC first on Xbox and also Resident Evil 6 is getting DLC first

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
on there.

53:03.240 --> 53:07.660
I got to say, the South Park, The Stick of Truth, fucking amazing looking, is just, I

53:07.660 --> 53:08.780
cannot wait for that game.

53:08.780 --> 53:12.280
That game looks perfect.

53:12.280 --> 53:17.760
I really hope I'm not let down because sometimes trailers look good.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.760
It looks great.

53:18.760 --> 53:24.160
But yeah, a lot of the complaints about the press conference were, you know, hey, the

53:24.160 --> 53:26.520
whole entertainment stuff, hey, I'm here to see the games.

53:26.520 --> 53:33.440
I don't want to see, you know, all this garbage about Nickelodeon and Paramount and Xbox music.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.240
I don't fucking care about Xbox music.

53:35.240 --> 53:38.600
But eh, no K-Press conference.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.880
All right.

53:40.880 --> 53:41.880
So next up.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.760
How do you think overall Microsoft did?

53:43.760 --> 53:48.060
There were a lot of people online kind of razzing Microsoft, not fans of the press conference,

53:48.060 --> 53:52.600
but in a way I was kind of like, well, what the hell did you expect this year?

53:52.600 --> 53:54.680
You knew you weren't going to be seeing the new Xbox.

53:54.680 --> 53:55.680
They said that.

53:55.680 --> 53:59.040
I know people were saying, oh, because Destiny isn't being shown anymore.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.640
They're going to have to give us hints about the new.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.640
No, they don't.

54:01.640 --> 54:02.640
They're not going to do it.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.160
They'll just show more Halo, you know, which is probably what they did.

54:05.160 --> 54:09.440
Yeah, they did show a Halo and they showed some third party stuff.

54:09.440 --> 54:14.400
One of the things I'm kind of surprised they didn't show anything for was Fable The Journey.

54:14.400 --> 54:18.200
Not much other than announcing that it's going to be coming out fourth quarter.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.120
They didn't really show anything.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.360
That is interesting.

54:22.360 --> 54:26.720
I was, you know, I was hardcore thinking there was going to be something with Windows 8.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.720
And I guess I was wrong there.

54:28.720 --> 54:32.720
The smart glass thing kind of is going to be, I get like a half point.

54:32.720 --> 54:37.840
I think smart glass, well smart glass also supports, not only does it support tablet

54:37.840 --> 54:41.220
because not, let's be honest, not everybody has a tablet or smartphone.

54:41.220 --> 54:44.500
It also does support computers, like PCs and laptops.

54:44.500 --> 54:50.580
So if you have a laptop, you can also control your Xbox, although I asked then why the fuck

54:50.580 --> 54:54.920
do I need to, you know, view my content on the Xbox if I have my laptop in front of me,

54:54.920 --> 54:55.920
but whatever.

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
Hey, it's another option.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.400
Sometimes, you know, sometimes you have that party environment.

54:58.400 --> 55:02.980
You want to show multiple people at once, like, you know, remember, remember that one

55:02.980 --> 55:06.700
New Year's Eve party where we were looking up on the Wii.

55:06.700 --> 55:10.480
We had to see the dinosaur porn or what was that?

55:10.480 --> 55:12.200
The pterodactyl porno.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.960
Thank you, Wii browser.

55:14.960 --> 55:16.400
That's fantastic.

55:16.400 --> 55:22.000
One of those websites, yes, it is, it was a chick and some dude in a pterodactyl suit

55:22.000 --> 55:24.400
and it was the most hilarious thing.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.400
Ridiculous.

55:25.400 --> 55:30.640
Anyhow, from Microsoft to pterodactyl porn.

55:30.640 --> 55:33.120
Let's go to the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.

55:33.120 --> 55:38.320
A lot of props for South Park, Acidic Vampire says South Park looks great.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.600
Stan says, I think it will be good.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.280
The South Park creators are really involved in this game.

55:42.280 --> 55:46.480
Tiger Claw says, I liked how Trey Parker and Matt Stone trolled the Microsoft press conference

55:46.480 --> 55:47.800
when they showed up for their game.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
That was fantastic.

55:48.800 --> 55:49.800
Mm-hmm.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.880
And Degenerate Johnny says, I'm calling it.

55:51.880 --> 55:55.480
One of the South Park's DLC will be carbon's ass.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.800
Could be ass of fire.

55:57.800 --> 56:01.720
Well, they have, you know, it's very cool the way they're doing it.

56:01.720 --> 56:05.120
The Lemmywinks or whatever that was.

56:05.120 --> 56:09.920
They do have a Lemmywinks tie and one of the finishing or one of the summons you get is

56:09.920 --> 56:14.520
Mr. Slave and Mr. Slave sucks the enemy into his ass.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.520
Literally.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.640
Well, that was, that was that whole Paris Hilton episode or whatever it was.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.640
Yes.

56:20.640 --> 56:21.640
It's basically that.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.920
So, you know, nothing is off limits or sacred.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.660
It's interesting, but it's kind of cool though because you get to play as your own character

56:27.660 --> 56:28.660
in there.

56:28.660 --> 56:31.320
So you design your own character and that's kind of neat.

56:31.320 --> 56:32.680
Let me ask Dark Sakura.

56:32.680 --> 56:37.240
I know you're the classic gamer of the bunch, but is there anything on the Microsoft press

56:37.240 --> 56:39.080
conference that has you excited at all?

56:39.080 --> 56:43.080
Any halos or South Park's or no.

56:43.080 --> 56:48.160
I mean Halo 4, I guess Dan's going to get it, you know, cause he's Mr. Halo of the house,

56:48.160 --> 56:49.480
but I don't give a crap about South Park.

56:49.480 --> 56:52.800
What about the Tomb Raider reboot cause I don't like Tomb Raider.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
But it's a reboot.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
You never know.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.800
But I don't like Tomb Raider.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.840
I'm still looking forward to that.

56:56.840 --> 57:02.000
Although the delay, you know, having to see it two years in a row is a little bit like,

57:02.000 --> 57:06.320
but I suppose not the, it's not the first game that won't be the last that gets shown

57:06.320 --> 57:07.320
across multiple years.

57:07.320 --> 57:11.320
Unless I can lock the butler in the fridge and break her neck.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.320
I'm not interested.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.840
It's technically a prequel, so I don't think there's a butler.

57:15.840 --> 57:16.920
You crash on an island.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.440
It's uncharted Tomb Raider.

57:18.440 --> 57:21.060
I don't like uncharted anyway, so.

57:21.060 --> 57:22.060
It looks good.

57:22.060 --> 57:23.060
Go for it.

57:23.060 --> 57:24.400
I mean, it looks good.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
I'm glad they showed it again.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.400
Yeah.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.400
Cause you kind of forget about it.

57:28.400 --> 57:36.280
Okay, so next was Nintendo, and Nintendo, gotta love them, but I don't understand how

57:36.280 --> 57:39.080
they're able to pull something like this off.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.360
They had three press conferences, cause one was not enough.

57:42.360 --> 57:46.560
They had a conference that was a pre-E3 conference that talked a little bit about the Wii U.

57:46.560 --> 57:50.360
Then they had their regular conference, which talked mostly about the Wii U, and then they

57:50.360 --> 57:55.300
had a 3DS conference the following day.

57:55.300 --> 57:58.760
You have three press conferences, and yet you still don't show a lot of shit.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.080
I just don't understand how that works.

58:01.080 --> 58:05.120
But okay, so let's start off with the pre-press conference thing that they had, or pre-E3

58:05.120 --> 58:06.120
press conference.

58:06.120 --> 58:12.460
They talked some of the key features of the Wii U, and including this brand new interface,

58:12.460 --> 58:13.460
I guess.

58:13.460 --> 58:17.400
It's gonna be the Miiverse, and what Miiverse is, it's kind of an upgrade of the Mi Plaza.

58:17.400 --> 58:24.320
You basically see all your Mi's congregating Mi's from friends, Mi's of people playing

58:24.320 --> 58:27.660
different games, and you see them playing the different games, and plus you can talk

58:27.660 --> 58:32.120
to each other, not only in text chat, but you can picto chat with them as well.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.080
So it's Facebook for me?

58:34.080 --> 58:35.080
Something like that.

58:35.080 --> 58:40.000
You basically can interact with people in a really elaborate way.

58:40.000 --> 58:46.120
They've got, you know, I guess spoiler stuff that you can do in there where you can make

58:46.120 --> 58:49.520
it so that people don't see your post, don't want to get spoiled on the game, but they

58:49.520 --> 58:54.360
have this whole kind of, like you can post in different spots in games and stuff, like

58:54.360 --> 58:58.640
for example, oh, I'm having trouble in this area in the game, can anybody help me?

58:58.640 --> 59:02.000
And then like, you know, hey, I got through this part of the game like this.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.360
That's great and all, but I mean, that's kind of like what Game Facts is for, or something

59:07.360 --> 59:08.360
like that.

59:08.360 --> 59:12.200
I just, I guess it's neat that they have this feature and that they showed all this stuff,

59:12.200 --> 59:15.640
but I don't know, whatever.

59:15.640 --> 59:20.040
One of the other things they are showing off also is a brand new controller for the Wii

59:20.040 --> 59:25.960
U, the Wii U Pro Controller, which looks like an Xbox 360 controller with the analog stick

59:25.960 --> 59:29.920
and the face buttons flip flopped.

59:29.920 --> 59:31.480
Cool.

59:31.480 --> 59:37.480
I guess that'll be used also in conjunction with, you know, the Wii Pad and stuff if you

59:37.480 --> 59:42.000
want to play like regular games instead of using the Wii Remote, although it will support

59:42.000 --> 59:47.280
a Wii Remote and all the Wii accessories as well.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
So that's kind of neat.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.840
And then of course, you know, they talked about some of the revisions to the Wii Pad

59:51.840 --> 59:55.280
is what they're calling it now, the Wii Game Pad.

59:55.280 --> 01:00:02.140
And basically, you know, the mysterious buttons that were shown there, the one below the directional

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.200
pad is the near field communication thing, which is weird because I thought it would

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.640
be like on the screen.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.920
It seems to make more sense to me, but I guess they had to put it on the side or something.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.720
So they have a TV button on there.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:21.880
What the TV button is for is for actually using the tablet as a remote for your TV,

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880
like a universal remote.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.000
You can actually launch the system and everything from the pad before you even turn the system

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.160
on you or you can just switch the channel on your TV.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.360
I could do that with my Xbox controller.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.360
Good question from She-Hulk in our chat room.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.480
And I didn't catch this either.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.860
No Blu-ray or DVD for the Wii U?

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.240
They didn't say what they're using.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240
Huh.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.240
Interesting.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240
OK.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.680
They didn't say what kind of discs they're using.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.080
Maybe they feel it's not needed because I noticed Reggie did emphasize, and the way

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.240
he said it too is very interesting.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:03.280
He said, you know, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, it's there.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.600
You know, he's like, it's all there.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.200
Yes, of course it's there, but we want you to experience Miiverse, you know, it's kind

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
of interesting.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.680
Well, let's talk about stuff that people aren't going to care about, and let's talk more in

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.000
great detail about something else.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.800
But to his credit, what else are you going to say about Netflix and Amazon and Hulu?

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.920
Everybody knows that stuff already, you know?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920
They're there.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920
Yay!

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.520
That's really all there is to say.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
Yeah.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.520
You rhymed.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.640
Rama in our chat room says Wii U will support Blu-ray storage.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.640
OK.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.760
Well, I haven't seen anything yet, but I would assume it's Blu-ray unless they're going to

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.160
have their own proprietary format, which, you know, whatever.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.000
One, of course, the big game, the first game that they unveiled was Pikmin 3.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.480
You know, something that has been rumored to be coming to the Wii or the Wii U at some

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.120
point, and it is a launch title, so they showed off Pikmin 3, and it looks pretty, except

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.120
I don't care about Pikmin, so, you know, whatever.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.220
And as you mentioned, you know, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Instant Video

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.720
coming to the Wii U, hopefully at launch, because they like to announce things that

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.960
aren't necessarily going to be ready.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.480
Scribblenauts Unlimited was another game that they showed off that's pretty awesome.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:22.600
It does use the tablet, so you can actually create your own words in this, so that's kind

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
of cool.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.280
That's the neat feature there, and it can be played exclusively on the tablet if you

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280
want.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.720
And then they announced some stuff from Namco, which I honestly have never heard of before

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.080
today, but Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tank Tank Tank, where did that come from?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.200
I'm getting a Wii U.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.920
I did not hear these rumors.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.360
I would have never heard them on our show.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.880
We would never have, you know, known about that a few weeks ago.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880
Yeah.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.960
And then of course, a surprise, they're trying to Director's Cut coming to the Wii U, which

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960
is neat.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.760
Now, I might have missed this because I was playing in a home over there for a second

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.320
checking out the awesome backyard that Blender built for the clubhouse, but Mass Effect 3,

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320
Wii U?

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.600
Mass Effect 3 is turned to the Wii U.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.960
Which has a lot of us kind of wondering, how is that going to work, because, I mean, you

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960
can't...

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.480
Maybe you target on your little monitor.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.280
Well, yeah, no, that part I figure maybe the biotics and the gun stuff is on the monitor

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.380
or whatever, but I'm kind of like, how can you just skip Mass Effect 2?

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.080
Like Mass Effect 1, I can see people skipping, although I don't recommend it.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.100
I could see you skipping that, but you can't skip Mass Effect 2.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.480
You can't.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.120
So Mass Effect 3 is going to have to really have something special to separate it from

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.660
the other versions to get me to want to buy it.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.400
Although Mass Effect 3 does have a pretty awesome multiplayer, so it'll be interesting

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.440
to see if that's pulled off as well on the Nintendo system.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.480
Plus, microtransaction hell, again, I wonder if that's going to be pulled off as seamlessly

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480
on the Wii U.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.800
They must think so.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.160
So I think that tells us a lot right there about Nintendo's online structure.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.000
If EA's willing to put Mass Effect 3 on it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.760
Another title that they announced was Sing, which is being developed by the DJ Hero developers,

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.200
and Sing is your generic karaoke game with the words on the Wii pad.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Whoopty shit.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.740
That's what I have to say about that.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.400
And admit it, Call Me Maybe was stuck in your head all week long after that, and it's the

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.400
number one song on iTunes.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Nope.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400
It was not.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400
Honestly.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.400
I've never heard of that before.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.680
I would play it for you, but you'd slap me.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.680
Is it that bad?

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.680
It's pretty bad.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.320
3DS stuff, they talked a little bit about Paper Mario, that's supposed to be coming

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.400
out this season, holiday season.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.560
New Super Mario Brothers 2, which is headed to the 3DS on August 19th.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:48.000
Also Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon for the 3DS this holiday.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.060
They of course announced, I thought it was going to be New Super Mario Brothers Me, oh,

01:04:55.060 --> 01:05:01.680
but they had to trump me, and it's now called New Super Mario Brothers U, which is announced,

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.200
and it will have multiplayer games.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.200
Gotcha.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Oh!

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
Nintendo.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.840
And so they have that coming.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:14.000
Batman Arkham City Armored Edition is headed to the Wii U, and basically the Game of the

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.120
Year edition with some extra bells and whistles in there.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.120
Let's see.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.800
I just want to say real quick, because some of the folks in the chat room are commenting,

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.640
we're about a minute lagged from when we say things to when they get encoded and people

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640
hear them.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.360
So people in chat right now are talking about Mass Effect 3.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:35.300
Acidic Vampire says, no Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the Wii U equals fail.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.820
And Act Deft reminds us, PlayStation 3 skipped Mass Effect 1.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.640
But again, I'm saying Mass Effect 1 is okay to skip.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.640
I don't recommend it, but it's okay.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.760
But they had though, to be fair, they had a motion comic.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.000
Yes, and What Up G reminds us that they did have that bridge.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.080
So Technus says Bioware will just do another interactive graphic comic.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.580
And that's certainly kind of the likely thing.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:00.620
Now Dark Tetsuya linked us in chat to the story on MyNintendoNews that mentions that

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.880
Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back, which I guess is what they're calling the Wii U version,

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.920
will include an enhanced storyline from the original game on PlayStation, oh no, this

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.800
says PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.540
I think he got the stuff mixed up, because I was going to say Take Earth Back I heard

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:23.160
was a DLC expansion that's possibly coming in the future.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.000
So never mind, I guess that's not about the Wii U.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.660
That's what I get for trying to do stories live.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.920
And of course, and I'm surprised that they did this, because I didn't think it's that

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:38.360
popular anymore, but I guess it is, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no, it said the original game,

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.720
so this is about the Wii U version, it's the original game on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720
and PC.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.400
Sorry, I'm just, I'm seeing this for the first time, so I'm trying to process this myself

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400
here.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.360
Because it hasn't spoken about the enhanced content, and they're saying hopefully it's

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.720
not just going to be the reworked ending.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.960
But I had heard a rumor previously that Take Earth Back was supposed to be some type of

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.480
expansion for the multiplayer game that had more maps, and more human classes.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.760
It's just probably the game of the year edition of Mass Effect 3 is what they're getting.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:09.800
And I mean, that's pretty much what it is, and with some extra bells and whistles, that's,

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.880
that is a lot of their launch line up.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880
Whatever.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880
Anyhow, move on.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:19.560
So then of course, you know, there was also talk, well they announced also Wii Fit U,

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.880
which is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, and they showed that it had like a pedometer

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.840
attachment that's available as well, so you'll be able to interact with that.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.320
And then also, you know, some of these Wii U games, they showed that you can play them

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:40.680
without actually having the system on the TV, so you can exercise and stuff like that

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.960
without looking at the TV, I don't know, it just looks stupid if you're working with the

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:53.320
Wii Fit balance board and Wii U tablet, I mean just, come on, it's just, whatever.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.840
And then finally also, the Wii U will support two different Wii gamepads, however there

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.560
will be a hit in frames per second, it will actually be halved, so the upper limit will

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:09.920
be 30 frames per second on both Wii U tablets, which, eh, whatever.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:18.440
Finally, I guess, you know the big thing for me with the Wii U, oh, oh, I forgot my most

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:25.920
favorite one unveiled that they had, Lego City Stories, which is now Lego City Undercover,

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.040
is coming to the 3DS and the Wii U, and it looks pretty awesome.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.600
I think it's a different developer now, because before it looked like Grand Theft Auto, it

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.240
still has that kind of sandbox thing to it, but it definitely doesn't look like Grand

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.480
Theft Auto anymore, but it looks pretty amazing, definitely one of the launch games to have

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.720
on that.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.340
However, it doesn't sell me a system, and I still am worried that they didn't talk enough

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.360
about what their online plan is.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.560
Yeah, we know about Miiverse and I can talk with people, leave them little notes about

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.700
shit in-game, but that doesn't tell me what your infrastructure is, or how you're playing

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.440
to do all this stuff.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:11.320
You know, in the games that they announced for launch, half of them are stuff that's

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.320
already been out.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:20.960
You have Ninja Gaiden 3, you've got Batman Arkham City, and Darksiders 2, which are going

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.840
to have already been out for a few months by the time the system launches.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:32.000
You know, Assassin's Creed 3 looks pretty cool, but why should I buy another system

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.040
to play a game that I can already play on my system right now, and it will look pretty

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.840
much the same, but it's going to have a few extra gimmicks with it, with this new controller.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.180
That's the problem that doesn't sell me on this stuff.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:49.040
For the Wii, for the people that own a Wii, yes, it's a great upgrade to the system that

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.760
you already have, but you can also get that same kind of upgrade with an Xbox or PlayStation

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.560
3.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560
That's the problem I have.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.960
There's just not a lot to launch, you know, the lineup is not that great for me.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.000
Also, new Super Mario Brothers U.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.600
You mean you don't want Nintendo Land?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.240
Oh yeah, how am I forgetting about Nintendo Land?

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.240
Nintendo Land.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.240
I was going to say, I haven't heard of Nintendo Land yet.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.240
Nintendo Land.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.080
Um, basically the Wii Sports Wii Play, whatever, Tech Demo Land.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.400
The giant cocktease land, because there's my F-Zero, did you see that?

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.960
It is basically Tech Demo Land, that is what it is, it's their fucking spinning tech demos

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960
together.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960
Well.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.080
I will bet you anything that will be a fucking packing game.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.240
It has to be.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.840
What was Wii Sports?

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.960
What was Wii Sports?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.640
It was Tech Demo Land.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.840
And it was the pack-in game.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.920
So of course Nintendo Land is the pack-in game.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.440
They might not necessarily have a pack-in game, but I think it might be the pack-in

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.440
game.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440
Which is great.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.480
Maybe they'll have two, they might have two SKUs where one is the, kind of like, remember

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.360
the old old school NES, how they actually had three versions of that when that first

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360
came out.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.700
There was the robot pack that came with Rob the Robot and like Gyromite.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.800
And then there was the action pack that came with the Zapper and Super Mario Brothers Duck

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800
Hunt.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.040
And then there was the vanilla ass pack, I don't remember what it was called.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040
The core.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040
The core?

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.040
Did they call things core back then?

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
I think it was called the core system.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
Hmm.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.880
Well whatever, it was just the NES and Super Mario Brothers basically.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.680
So I wonder if the Wii U won't launch with a similar type of thing where you could have

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.680
just the plain Jane system or you get the extra, maybe the extra Wii U controllers since

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.640
we hear that they will support two players.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.240
Yeah, here's the thing though, they're gonna support two players, but not any of the launch

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.520
titles are gonna support two players on those pads.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.360
So it's something that's coming way down the line.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:42.080
But I'm sorry, it just doesn't, you have a brand new system that you're launching and

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.560
then you, like your Mario game, New Super Mario Brothers U, don't get me wrong, New

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.640
Super Mario Brothers is probably an awesome game.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.440
I didn't play much of the first game, but you know what, I played New Super Mario Brothers

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.160
on the DS and it was great.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.560
It was a great game.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.380
And I'm sure Wii, New Super Mario Brothers was pretty awesome.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:06.320
And then you've got New Super Mario Brothers for the 3DS, New Super Mario Brothers 2.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.340
And now you have New Super Mario Brothers U.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.120
The problem is, that game looks last gen.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.240
And that game looks like a Wii game.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.680
And yes, I know, you know, it's a great game and you're launching it on the system, but

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.960
you, I think you need, if you want to show off this game, this system, you need to like

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.660
come out with something big, like a Super Mario Galaxy type of game or a Mario 64.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:33.200
Something like, holy shit, I did not expect to see Mario like that instead of, hey look,

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.880
it's slightly prettier New Super Mario Brothers.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.120
It just doesn't look good.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.440
As much as I, like, I do want that Mario Brothers Wii U game, but I'm not sure I'm totally sold

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.840
on this system yet.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.800
But just to be devil's advocate for a minute, doesn't Pikmin 3 kind of show off some of

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.320
those capabilities a little better?

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320
Tank.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.320
Yeah, but Pikmin.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.080
Pikmin 3 is not a game I think that's going to appeal to everybody.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.080
I don't think it, Pikmin doesn't have, it has a following, but it doesn't have a huge

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080
following.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080
It's a niche game.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080
Let's be honest, it's a niche game.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.840
It didn't sell that great.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.320
It's not a Super Mario Brothers.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.560
Rama's reminding me of a couple other Nintendo packs that I forgot earlier.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.960
There was the Power Pack when the Power Pad came out.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960
That was later.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.440
But yeah, the MarioBrothers.com world class track meet.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.240
And he says that there was one that was Hogan's Alley in Duck Hunt.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.600
I don't remember Hogan's Alley ever being a pack-in game, but maybe it was like, it

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.680
wasn't very well distributed.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.280
I remember Hogan's Alley as a launch game, and that would make sense as like a zapper

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.240
pack or something, but anyway.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.000
Orange Launch Radio reporting the news from 25 years ago.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.180
But I mean, that's just my problem though, is they don't have, there's still a lot of

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.040
information that we need from Nintendo.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.600
A price and a date, for God's sake.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.920
Well, but they did that with the Wii.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.320
They came out later around Tokyo Game Show time, because they don't do Tokyo Game Show,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.840
but they'll do their own little thing, and that's when they'll announce it.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.240
Well, cool, but I need to know more about the system.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.840
And right now, as it stands, I'm not buying one.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.760
I'm not even buying one near launch.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.320
I just, I don't want it.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.320
I don't...

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.440
I'm kind of with you, but the price will, I mean, A, the price, and B, my disposable

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.040
income, which I may or may not have at that end of the year, will really factor into my

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040
decision.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.560
One other thing too is just, I don't, I learned my lesson with the Wii.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.680
The Wii was awesome, I had fun, but see, the Wii compared to what was already currently

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.480
available was very, very different.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.960
This is just, hey look, I have a traditional controller with a goddamn screen on it.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.880
Here's my problem with it.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.400
You know all these cool things that you're talking about with that controller?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400
Well guess what?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.620
You've had two screens for fucking years now with the DS, and how many really truly unique

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.520
games have you seen come out of it?

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520
Probably a handful.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.880
You can count them on one hand.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.040
Of games that are really using both screens, just in an amazing way.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.520
But I don't think we're gonna get a lot of these really big games, because you just,

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.240
I mean you've had time to do something unique with this, and you're just not gonna use these

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.240
two screens.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.240
It's gonna be a gimmick.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.280
I will say this though to Nintendo's credit, is that even though the Wii U lineup left

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.320
me feeling, and I think a lot of us feeling a little, eh, especially when they ended with

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.760
Nintendo Land, I think that was a big, eh.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.760
Oh, yeah.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.760
That was just kinda, that's it?

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.760
Yeah, that was too bad.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.760
There was no Zelda or something?

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.000
But, the 3DS lineup looked great.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I gotta say.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.160
That new, you know, the Golden Coins Mario game looked great.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.440
The Castlevania game especially looked great.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.320
So I feel like the 3DS, I kinda wish they'd shown, I mean I realize they did that whole

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.680
second press conference where they showed more, but I was kinda hoping for a little

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.400
more at the big show, because there's a lot of good stuff going on in the 3DS.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.160
Was there something that was missing?

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.560
The redesign of the 3DS?

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.840
Well, that too, but, Animal Crossing.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840
No Animal Crossing.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.640
It was missing, wasn't it?

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640
Delayed.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.440
Don't think it's coming out this year.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.600
Delayed!

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.600
Not coming out this year.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600
Swept under the rug.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600
Delayed.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600
I betcha.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.760
I, you know what, I guarantee that's not coming out this year.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.400
Too many, there's too many games that they have first party that are coming out that

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400
they won't put out this year.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.600
It's not ready.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.360
I think the Wii U might end up suffering a little bit like the 3DS did.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.440
Not a strong enough launch, and next year they cut the price.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:21.500
It is a very, I gotta say, I mean, you're gonna have a hard time selling somebody on,

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:26.640
let's just, you know, an average parent or whatever, okay, I can buy this system now,

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.720
well who knows what the Wii's gonna be, you know, dropping down to, I mean, let's say

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:37.200
it goes down to, you know, 99 bucks or something, oh man, 99 dollar Wii, that'd be crazy, but,

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.800
you know, you've got the Wii system right now, and I can buy new Super Mario Brothers,

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.360
and it's pretty awesome, I mean, the people aren't gonna know, oh hey, oh that's the Wii

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:51.200
U version, you know, and honestly, the Wii U stuff, aside from, oh cool, I, you know,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.640
I can play on my Wii pad or whatever when, um, you know, someone's on the TV, fuck, that's

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.000
not how you're supposed to be selling your system.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.800
You're not supposed to be selling your system, hey, when someone wants to watch TV, you can

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.000
play your game system on this pad, no, you're supposed to say, hey, when someone's playing

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.800
something on the TV, you bop out your fucking 3DS and you play New Super Mario Brothers

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.960
2 on there, that's how you fucking solve that situation, you sell them on the portable system

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.560
and the regular system, you don't say, hey, you don't fucking need the portable system

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.280
because, hey, you got the stupid tablet now, they're fucking stupid, I mean, it's just

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280
dumb.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.160
Let's, we're at an hour 18, so, before we move on this, let me read some comments from

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.400
chat on this whole thing, um, Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, at, um, vognetwork.com

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.920
live chat says, I would like a new platformer of Black Tiger for the Wii U and that would

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.480
help convince me to buy one, I have the PlayStation 2 compilation pack with Black Tiger and Dungeon

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.080
Buster chimes in saying, I'd snatch one up day one if it had something like that, everybody's

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.560
got their dream game, you know, I've been sitting here saying F-Zero, F-Zero, F-Zero,

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.960
god damn it, F-Zero, you know, everybody's got their game that they want to have, um,

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:02.040
let's see, uh, Acidic Vampire says, screw a 3DS Castlevania, give me a next gen Castlevania

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:07.080
a la Symphony of the Night, amen to that, shadow next gen, who is at the show, chimes

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:16.600
in, most of the Wii U titles shown at E3 are launch titles, so, no, no, no, no, no, true,

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:22.960
true and not true, launch window titles, no, I'm serious, they're not launch day titles,

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.720
they're launch window and that's, and although what he's saying is mostly true, Nintendo

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.400
doesn't, I mean, Nintendo certainly doesn't project, let's say, quite as badly as Sony,

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:41.160
Last Guardian, or Microsoft, Halo 4 last year and Tomb Raider, do, but, Nintendo did, really,

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.240
troll us, what, really, they, they don't project, not as bad, I'm not saying, but I will, I

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.480
am saying, Nintendo did do that whole Smash Brothers thing last year, and we know that

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.640
that's a good three years away, but, but, but, but, they didn't show anything, and they

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.800
said, we're announcing it, it'll come out eventually, ooh, Rob, Raginator's calling

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:10.920
on you, what, why, what, F-Zero is overrated, get out, someone smack him with a fish, is

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.460
he in the home, is he in the home, cause I'm gonna go bop him in the head and Sony home

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:19.900
right now, I'm on the hunt, where's Raginator, I'm gonna go smack him, meanwhile, speaking

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:27.160
of Sony, let's talk a little bit about Sony, Sony had some pretty interesting things, they

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:35.800
came out talking about, you know, their Sony mascot Battle Royale, Sony All Stars Battle

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.620
Royale game, did announce two new characters for it, and kind of confirming that there

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.700
are gonna be some third party characters in there, they announced Big Daddy's gonna be

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.080
one of the playable characters, and also Nathan Drake, which is kind of a duh, but those are

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:59.360
gonna be available as well, I'm sure they've got a lot more to unveil there, they did talk

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:11.080
a little bit about some interesting ideas, I guess, one of them was this, I don't even

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:17.600
know why, a Wonder Book, it kind of makes me wonder why they would come out with this,

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.440
Wonder Book is basically this paper book that has AR tags in it, and it interacts with,

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.440
not necessarily, well the move, it does interact with that, but it interacts with the Playstation

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:35.600
I, and it's supposed to make reading more like TV, and one of the first games, if you

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:42.400
will, that's gonna use it is JK Rowling's Book of Spells, and you know, they're kind

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:49.320
of selling it on, oh hey, she wrote it, and it's all this all new stuff, and hey, check

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:55.880
it out, it's pretty sweet, it was pretty fucking boring, it was probably the worst thing that

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.880
they had of their whole.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.300
Here's the thing though, now keep in mind, we weren't watching the press conference,

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:05.760
we were only reading the tweets, because we were in line for Indiana Jones, or something

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:12.800
at the time, so while you guys were kind of like seeing that, and I guess bored with the

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.480
presentation, those of us were kind of reading about it, and we actually sat there going,

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:22.480
that is a brilliant move by Sony, because the part there that you glossed over that

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.080
I think is crucial, they have fucking JK Rowling in their back pocket now, don't underestimate

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.440
the power of that woman, Pottermore ain't that great either, Pottermore is actually

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:39.580
pretty neat, and people, but I suck at mixing spells, MC people, there's a lot of people

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:50.400
going crazy over it, Pottermore is also very age broad, true, I just think, I think there's

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.920
a lot more to this, especially with the whole, you know, Sony does have a family friendly

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:58.640
thing that they need to try to get a little bit of that Nintendo audience, and I think

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.000
the Wonder Book is a way to kind of push that, don't underestimate it, that's all I'm saying,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.800
you know what, I understand where you're coming from there, but it's, you're asking someone

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.120
to purchase, if they don't own a Playstation 3, you're asking them to purchase a Playstation

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:18.440
3, a Playstation Move set up, and then this Wonder Book on top of it, like a $400 investment

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.960
for a fucking lame ass looking game, but, I keep saying Wonder Book and I think of Super

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:28.120
Book, but, right, what if you're the soccer mom sitting there deciding which one of those

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.660
three systems to put under the tree at Christmas, the Playstation 3, the 360, or the Wii U,

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:39.240
and you've got a decision to make, one of them has JK Rowling in it, oh, well, I enjoy

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.800
the Harry Potter books myself, being a soccer mom, I might buy that one instead.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.160
Well, you know what, that's fine, because at least they'll be disappointed and they'll

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.520
still have a capable gaming system when they're done wasting their time with Book of Spells,

01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:04.440
but honestly, I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but to buy that for that specific thing,

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:09.680
it looks terrible, it looks fucking terrible, and if you think about it, Rob, they also

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.840
have Harry Potter for Kinect, so if you want to go that bullshit route of, well, they have

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.960
JK Rowling to this Book of Things, yeah, I could read a fucking book and pretend to do

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.360
magic or I could become fucking Harry Potter!

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360
Alright.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.400
I think becoming Harry Potter wins!

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.400
Fine, you made your point.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.640
I'm in fucking Hogwarts, my creepy face is on that stupid avatar!

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.200
Fine, you made your point, let's move on, we're spending more time talking about Wonder

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.880
Book than they did at the conference.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.540
So anyways, other things that they talked about besides Wonder Book, of course, a lot

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:44.120
of cool stuff for Playstation Plus, Playstation Plus, as we mentioned, you're gonna get a

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.120
lot of free content, and they announced, you know, the Playstation Plus members are gonna

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:54.960
get 12 new games starting this month, and of course, you know, full free games, if you're

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.520
a subscriber of Playstation Plus, and they're gonna be adding more as time goes on.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.560
Also, Playstation 1 classics are coming back to the Vita, no duh there, that's kind of,

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.240
you know, been leaked out already, and they're gonna slowly roll those out, starting with

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:16.520
I think Final Fantasy VII, and maybe Tomb Raider, some other stuff.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
That's pretty amazing.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:24.080
Also, some Vita titles, um, not a whole lot of, like, first-party Vita titles that are

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.640
gonna be coming out for, you know, the, um...

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.800
I was also shocked at the lack of Vita.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.800
It was basically, I mean, all the stuff that was coming out this fall is pretty much stuff

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.800
we already knew about.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.600
I mean, you know, LittleBigPlanet carding, and, um, LittleBigPlanet.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.880
To be fair, some of that may show up at Tokyo Game Show.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.920
After all, Sony is a Japanese company, some of that may be in their back pocket for Tokyo

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
Game Show.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.320
At least, I hope to hell that's what happens.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.960
Um, and then of course, also, um, you know, there's the Playstation, um, you know, All

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.640
Stars Battle Royale, which is gonna be on the Vita as well.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.200
Um, another pretty cool thing...

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.280
I gotta say this, Shadownextgen in our chatroom says, where is the Vita price drop?

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.720
That was made up by the internet.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.640
I don't, I think people assume just because the 3DS had a price drop, the Vita was gonna

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640
get one too.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.680
It's too soon, they're not gonna announce a price drop yet.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.040
Yeah, I kind of agree, and I think the tech in the Vita, it would be a bigger loss to

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.880
Sony to do something like that.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.840
They're not gonna, first off, they're not gonna announce, I mean, a price drop three

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.800
months after it's come out, that's gonna be like, oh, yeah, we failed.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.480
I mean, they're not gonna do that.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.520
They're not gonna also, I mean, they're not gonna announce, hey, we're gonna drop the

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.920
price in, uh, October.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.320
That being said, however, now that they've kind of ignored it at this show, now they

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.240
might have painted themselves in a corner to have to do that.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.120
Tokyo Game Show is gonna be critical to the future of the Vita.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120
Believe it.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.960
Um, they did talk about, you know, some games that are kind of a big does, um, Call of Duty

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.640
Black Ops Declassified, not necessarily gonna be the same Black Ops 2 game, so, it's a little

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.280
disappointing to me, but, I have to see what it is, and then Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation,

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.080
which is gonna be its own kind of unique game with its own character, which is kind of cool.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.880
Um, that launches October 30th as well.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:18.680
Um, and then, of course, you know, the big, big reveal that they had was the brand new,

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:27.560
um, was it, uh, Quadric Dream Game, which is Beyond Two Souls, and, um, just such an

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.640
amazing looking game.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.520
Basically, kind of taking everything that you liked from Heavy Rain and just amping

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.520
it up.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:42.680
Just the motion capture in it now is just ridiculous how well that looks, um, and, you

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:48.320
know, big name stars, you know, behind it as well, just, it's cool, I mean, definitely

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.800
gotta check it out, um, they have now, um, oh god, who's the fucking actress, I hate

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800
myself.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.800
Ellen Page.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:02.720
Ellen Page, yes, Ellen Page is now, um, Juno, doing the mocap, and, uh, Kitty Pride.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720
That too.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.720
Kitty Pride.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.720
Doing the mocap and the, um, you know, the voice work for that game.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.520
I saw the screens from it, it looks really good.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.120
It's interesting, it's kind of like a supernatural, uh, Heavy Rain almost.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.040
You've got, you know, you're playing as the spirit and you're also playing as her, and

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:25.160
so the spirit thing can, you know, interact with the environment and stuff, um, it's neat.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.560
It looked, it looked pretty cool, and, you know, if you don't like the quick time events

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.880
stuff, then maybe not for you, but, um, you know, then you probably didn't like Heavy

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.880
Rain either.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.160
So, uh, I, I need to go watch that trailer, I heard a lot of excitement about it.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.120
Granted, I kind of miss the boat on Heavy Rain, but, yeah, definitely watch the demo

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.120
footage.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.120
They have 20 minutes from the game, it looks awesome.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.540
I'm gonna check it out, for sure.

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.540
Really cool.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.920
But, uh, so overall Sony's conference, yeah, uh, it's pretty cool.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:48.920
Oh, and one more thing.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.460
Oh, Big Planet 2 is getting some DLC, um, that's gonna turn the Vita into a controller

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.460
for the game.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:55.460
That's pretty cool.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:56.460
That's cool.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.460
That's very cool.

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.460
A lot of cross play stuff there.

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.200
I think, honestly, um, out of the three, I think they have the strongest, because they

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.400
showed off, um, this really amazing game, a new property for them, a new IP.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.960
And then, of course, um, you know, they were showing off some of, like, the stuff that

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.960
they had.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.320
Third party was pretty awesome.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.840
It didn't seem like there was a lot that bored me too much.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:22.080
Wonder Book was pretty eh, I mean, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like Nintendo's press

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.200
conference was just like, okay, when we get into the good stuff, when we get into the

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.200
good stuff, it's over?

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.200
It's over?

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.040
I mean, it's like, when are we getting to these, like, holy crap, holy crap, I need

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.640
to buy this system for this game, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool, and I mean.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.480
I think next year's Nintendo's press conference, it better be anyway, it's gonna be a lot like

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.380
that one a couple years ago.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.960
Remember that year, I think this was two years ago, where Reggie came out on stage and was

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:53.480
basically like, you want games, fine, here's some games, bam, bam, bam, bam, and he showed

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.880
like eight of them off in a row and he's like, there's all your fucking games, goodnight.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.720
For real, like that, that's how we do it, but like, that's what he's gonna have to do

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.720
next year.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.920
The problem with the Wii U thing was, they had like the three conferences, and it was

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.000
just like, we have to explain to you why the Wii U is important, fuck, I don't care, I

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.720
want to see the goddamn games, I'll figure it out by the game footage that you have.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.200
You can explain to me later if I go, I don't understand why the game is cool, you know,

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.440
I just, I don't know, whatever.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.120
Zappy in our chatroom says, Nintendo needs to learn the magic of one more thing, harness

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.120
the Steve Jobs.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.120
Perhaps.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.520
He did that with fucking Metroid, remember that?

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.160
One more thing, fucking Metroid games, like, that's awesome.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.800
Metroid game by Team Ninja, that sounds awesome and will be okay when it comes out.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.280
Alright, anyhow, was that, I think that might have been the same year, no, that was the

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.840
year before, I think.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.000
It was the year that that Metroid game was actually coming out, that I think was the

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.320
year where Reggie was like, we got this, we got this, we got this, and if any of you fuckers

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.360
write that no games are coming out for the Wii, I will personally come to your house

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
and beat your ass.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
At least, that's what I heard.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.720
My body is ready to kick some ass.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:10.680
Alright, quickly, the third party crest conferences, because we're already at that one and a half.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:15.400
They didn't have that many this year, but Ubisoft did, sorry off of them, of course.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.800
Konami had the online one that showed lots and lots of Metal Gear Rising, which, granted,

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.000
if you like violence, looks great.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
It sounds cool.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.080
I didn't watch that one, unfortunately.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.840
Ubisoft, they had Just Dance 4, duh.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.560
It is going to have some Wii U specific features, including a puppet master mode where you can

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.520
change up the dance moves on the fly.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.840
Yeah, that's kind of fun if you're in a party environment, I guess.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth, which is coming to the Wii U, and Kinect.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.560
Uh, and it also is supposed to be like, kind of, they said drawing from the Secret Invasion

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.560
universe.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.440
It has like, Skrulls posing as superheroes and stuff, but it looks terrible.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.480
The Secret Invasion thing was crap.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.280
It looks fucking terrible.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.580
It was even worse than Civil War.

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:06.640
The gameplay looks bad, just saying.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.440
Um, and they have like the X-Men in there, so I don't understand how that's Avengers,

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.440
but whatever.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.080
Never involved in Wolverines in every team in the Marvel universe, ever.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.080
It's true.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.080
Hey, he's gotta work.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.680
He even powered up, he even hung out with Power Pack.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.240
Hey, time for a total tangent where I derail the show.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.960
I finally saw the Avengers this weekend.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.960
Wasn't it good?

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.960
Did you stay for the whole thing?

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.960
It was pretty good.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960
The whole thing?

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.680
No, we thought once we saw the dude, we thought it was over, and then we realized in the car

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.560
on the way home, wasn't Jamie talking about a scene with Bla Bla Bla?

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.280
Oh, god damn it, there must have been more after the credits.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:52.400
This is why you always, always, always, always, always stay through the entire credits of

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.480
a Marvel movie, because they will fuck with you.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.200
One does not simply leave a movie.

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.640
Leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.640
Okay, I made a mistake.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.640
It's on YouTube.

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.680
That means, that means, we're gonna go back and see it.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.120
Rayman Legends was another game that they showed off, and that was the sequel to Rayman

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.640
Origins.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640
Pretty awesome.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.080
It's gonna have five player co-op with the Wii U, and also the Pro Controller and Wiimote

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:21.320
are supported, and the gameplay looks just awesome.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:28.000
Just really, really cool stuff that they've got going there with that, so very cool.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.520
One of the games that I thought was a joke when they were showing it originally on the

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:38.000
Wii U pre-E3 conference, which was a zombie game that this really dorky guy was just kind

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
of being all cliche about, and like, I need help!

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Help me, internet!

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.120
I need to know how to beat this boss!

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.120
I need to show him!

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.240
That commercial was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.440
But it's a real game.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.360
Zombie U is the name of it.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.240
It's a fucking stupid name.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.560
It was originally Killer Freaks from Outer Space, which was gonna be a neat looking game

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.680
that had almost evil rabbits looking characters, but now it's a generic zombie shooter game.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:12.960
But they're gonna have some interesting uses of the Wii controller, and honestly, to me,

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.200
this game looks like it's gonna be another Red Steel, which some people may like Red

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.920
Steel, but Red Steel ended up being one of those games that, hey, it looked pretty cool

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.160
at E3, and then when it came out, it was not very cool.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.120
It was just kinda, ehhh.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:31.520
But we'll see, I mean, zombie game, neat.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:40.440
And then, of course, they talked a little bit about Far Cry 3, which, oh, that trailer

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.080
that they showed was a bit graphic.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:47.640
It was boobies, hey, boobies, and apparently, you know, I know Bobby was talking a little

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:52.120
bit about it, how, and I even asked him, like, hey, were you watching this online, or were

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.480
you watching this on, like, Spike or G4 or something like that?

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.200
Did they censor those fuckin' tits on TV?

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.680
Nope, they did not.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.960
So that's a little problem.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.920
And Boobiesoft hashtag was launched from there.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.920
And then, um.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.960
By the way, I love Aisha Tyler, and I think it's great that she got to emcee, I think

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.200
she, it's funny, because what do her and Joel McHale have in common?

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.320
They've both hosted the soup on E.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.280
Aisha Tyler was the host before.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.600
So I love her, I think she's great.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.040
She's got a podcast, too, Girl, I almost said Girl's Gone Wow, but that's not her show.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.120
That's not her show.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.400
It's Girl on Guy, I think is the name of the show, and it's pretty good.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.400
Alan's a really big fan.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.160
But she's actually a gamer, so that's kinda cool.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.520
And she has a big lady boner for Halo.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.520
I like her a lot.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520
She's funny.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.520
I've met her.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.240
I would love to have her on the show.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.120
I know that will never happen, because she, like, does the talk on CBS.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.480
But I would just love to chat with Aisha Tyler.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480
She was funny.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.840
I met her in person once, but, um.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.500
I don't know, it's.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:07.000
She was not that annoying, but the other guy, oh my fucking god.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.400
Why was he there?

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.780
He was so fucking annoying, and the banter was just annoying.

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.280
And then finally, they also, they were talking a little bit about their service that they've

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280
got.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.640
They have some free games that you can play, including, they've added Trials Evolution,

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:26.200
and Beyond Good and Evil HD, I Am Alive, and some more stuff to their free play service.

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:30.200
So that's pretty awesome that they've got that as well.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.020
And last but not least, the big thing.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:38.560
And they're kind of like a, you know, proponent of the, oh yeah.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.160
And we got one more thing we have to show you.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:47.480
So, um, their one more thing that they showed off was this game, a brand new IP called Watch

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.320
Dogs.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.320
That game looked rad.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.320
And it looks fantastic.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320
I did watch that.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320
That looked rad.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.320
And you know what?

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.260
Most people were going around saying, Ubisoft won E3, I mean, whatever the hell that means.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.440
You won, congratulations, you win an E3.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440
I think they did.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:07.120
They based on that almost single-handedly, that.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.100
It had more people talking than anything else.

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.180
That was an amazing game.

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:16.280
It's basically this kind of futuristic game where you play this guy who has, he's hijacked

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.560
control of this, it's in the future, it's Chicago, and basically this computer runs

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.560
the whole city.

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.560
Everything.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.440
Every telephone networks, you know, street lights, you know, whatever.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:33.080
He has this, almost like a magic phone that he can dial in and hack anything, you find

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.700
out information about people, and it's just this whole espionage, you know, stealth kind

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.800
of action game, and there's a shooter element in there as well.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.520
And just the integration with your phone, it's supposed to, you know, kind of use the

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.820
smart glass stuff.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:47.820
Really cool-looking thing.

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:52.360
Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Nintendo, but A, was that game announced for Wii U?

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.360
Nope.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.360
Because I don't think it was.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:59.000
And B, I think that's a real problem when more, that's a real problem when more people

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.400
are talking about somebody else's game that's not coming to your system more so than your

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.400
brand new system.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.400
That is very bad.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.720
Well, here's the other bad thing, too, is when you're thinking about it, it's technically

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.800
a system that is capable of graphics that are on these two other systems that have this

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.800
game, and it has a fucking tablet controller already that could support this stuff, and

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.940
yet it's not on your system.

01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:24.940
So that's a problem.

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.940
However-

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:30.000
Yeah, I mean, to be fair, yet, we never know what might ultimately pan out before the launch.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Well, they keep insisting-

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.400
It may not be a launch window game.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.280
Remember, Reggie was focusing on launch window games.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.280
This may not be-

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.800
This definitely isn't launch window.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.800
That's for sure.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:39.800
That could be the problem.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.000
Well, here's the other thing, too, is-

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.520
And Shadow Next Gen says it wasn't announced for any system.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.520
It wasn't announced for 360 or PS3 either.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.160
The press site they have listed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.560
Everyone thinks it's for Next Gen, though, and it could be.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.240
It looks very Next Gen, that's for sure.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.480
Another game that was not at Ubisoft at all, which is kind of surprising, was Rainbow Six

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.480
Patriots.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480
Where was that?

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480
That was just missing.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:12.120
So, who knows where that's been, but I don't know.

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.120
Pretty exciting show.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.120
Let's line up.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.120
Let's quickly do EA.

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.320
We were running long for part A, but we knew we would.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.320
It's E3 week.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.000
EA, real quick, they had lots of sports games to show off.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.320
Of course, brand new.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.000
Madden now, it's a brand new engine that's going to be running.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.160
The new Infinity Engine has really awesome physics and stuff, so that looks pretty cool.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.720
They talked a little bit about some new games.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.600
Dead Space 3, which is kind of a duh that's coming out in February.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.040
Need for Speed Most Wanted being rebooted by Criterion.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.960
Looks like Burnout with Cops, Burnout Paradise with Cops, great.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:48.200
Sim City that's going to be now online only, which is kind of annoying.

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.200
Boo.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.240
That decision is going to tank that franchise.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240
Watch.

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.360
Because what they're saying, and Bobby went into this a little bit on his show tonight,

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.440
and I totally am agreeing with his sentiment, is that it's getting away from that whole

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.440
sandbox thing.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.920
Like, remember how you could, like, unleash Godzilla and a nuclear strike and all that

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920
on your city?

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.080
And then, okay, just go back and load your save file.

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.360
You can't do that.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.640
When it's online only, there's no save files now.

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.840
People like doing that in the Sims.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.200
It's just, why would you do that to your franchise?

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.880
I think that is a really bad decision.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:19.880
Watch.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.440
It worked for Diablo.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.100
It's not going to work for you, EA.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:29.240
People were used to, Diablo being online only, I mean, not that everybody's okay with that

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:35.520
anyway, but so many people were already playing that game online that it wasn't a deal breaker.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.000
But SimCity, you don't play that online.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Ever.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.560
And it's sad, too, because that's a game that I would like to play offline, and it looks

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.880
like an amazing game.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.680
It's just, eh.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.400
Unless you do have a local file.

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.680
Because for some online franchises, they do pull your data off a local file.

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.840
So that could work.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.320
But not likely.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.560
Yeah, I don't think that they're going to, because Diablo 3, if you think about it, could

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:04.080
have done that as well, but they didn't go that route.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.840
I think they just shot the franchise in the foot with that decision.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840
Watch.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840
They can always change it.

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840
They've got time.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840
I don't think they're going to.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.360
I think the whole thing is they're trying to combat piracy, and they think that online

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360
only is the way to go.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.040
But, I don't know.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.280
Once again, you're hurting the legitimate users of it.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.160
Medal of Honor Warfighter looks amazing.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.400
Very realistic looking game.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.240
Crisis 3 is just kind of weird, I don't understand why I need to use a bow and arrow in this

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.240
game.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.240
Neat.

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.600
I mean, it's a beautiful looking game, that's for sure.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:40.800
SimCity Social for Facebook, they announced, which, cool.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.840
Battlefield 3, of course, they were, you know, the Battlefield 3 premium service, they announced

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.840
that.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:52.280
It's out on PS3 first, and then PC and Xbox, kind of opposite of Call of Duty Elite.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.160
Star Wars Old Republic is sort of going free to play.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.440
They're going free to play up to level 15, and they're going to also be adding new content

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.480
as well.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.680
Also Madden NFL kind of jumping on the social bandwagon that they have with FIFA, and they

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.560
actually have some interesting stuff now.

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.480
The new game has like a fake Twitter feed that's on there that comments on your performance

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.840
and stuff like you're having real fans comment on your game, which is kind of cool.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:27.520
They've got that going, plus a lot of other presentation perks that they added with that.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:34.600
Last but not least, the big one, EA has secured the UFC franchise, so that's going to be coming

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:42.220
to EA now, and they bought it from THQ for an unset amount of money, and basically the

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:47.320
reasoning behind that was UFC 3, which was the last UFC game to come out from THQ, didn't

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.520
make their money, so they have to cut it, and that's what they did.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.800
They cut the franchise and sold it to EA, although I'm worried now if it's going to

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.920
be like EA Sports MMA, which is kind of terrible.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.580
All right, well, thank you.

01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:07.560
That was a lot of news from E3, but I think we kind of covered it all there and gave our

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.800
feedback as well as you guys there in our chat room, and we do have some more to talk

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.800
about.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.800
We're not done with the show yet.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.280
We're going to get into some of the little stuff in the next half.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.680
What's kind of sad that we didn't see was no Dead Rising 3 announcement.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.520
That is interesting.

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.880
That didn't end up happening.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.000
Why do you think that is?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.760
Maybe it's one of those things, like I've been hearing from a lot of different developers

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.100
and publishers, it's not ready to show.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:31.200
They're not ready to show it yet, or they're not ready to talk about that yet.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.040
Which is the whole excuse behind Last Guardian.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.680
Yeah, Last Guardian.

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.960
Capcom had a few things that they were showing off, obviously Street Fighter.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960
You know what?

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960
I don't really know.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.840
They referred the Vita, and then they also had Lost Planet 3, which was a big thing.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.840
Devil May Cry.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.640
They were kind of focusing on those franchises.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.840
If you think about it, those are coming out quarter one, so this might be a fourth quarter

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840
game.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.760
It might be something for next E3, or maybe something that they announced at the Tokyo

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.760
Game Show.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760
Who knows?

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.760
So, it may just not be ready yet.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.760
Hmm.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.760
Interesting.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.760
All right.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.000
Well, we're running a bit long, but we do have a few more segments we want to get in

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.240
here before we get to part B tonight.

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.120
Some people prefer it long.

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates on what is coming

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
out a little sooner than any of the games we just talked about.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.480
This week, we don't have a whole ton, but we've got Lollipop Chainsaw on PS3 and 360,

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.640
and that's sometimes all you need.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.200
Dirt Showdown's supposed to be coming out this week, although I'm not sure if it's actually

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.400
going to be coming out on Tuesday, because they're having production problems.

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.880
But sometime, hopefully, this week.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.520
That's on PS3 and 360.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.480
And then, not a whole lot else.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.680
You're a fan of the Nickelodeon series iCarly.

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.160
There's a Groovy Foodie game coming out on Nintendo DS.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.040
On the Vita, getting a couple games, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Gravity Rush.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.520
Gravity Rush looks pretty awesome, so hopefully that'll be pretty cool.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.800
And then, I believe that's it.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.900
All right, traveling to Japan.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.880
Not a whole, whole lot over there, but on the Nintendo 3DS, gone.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:08.840
Baku Baku Baku Adventure comes out this week, as well as Heavy Fire, The Chosen Few.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.680
Again, that's the 3DS in Japan.

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.360
Going over to the PlayStation Vita.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360
Oh, I lied.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.680
This is a big week, because there's a lot of people that are going to want this.

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.800
Persona 4, The Golden, comes out in Japan this week.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.960
There's a whole little accessory set, as well, that you can get for the Vita.

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.840
There's also a Super Monkey Ball game called Tokumori Asobita comes out this week, as well,

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.440
on the PlayStation Vita.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.240
I have a feeling more people will be crazy about the Persona 4.

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:36.000
I know there's a lot of fans of that here in the US.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.880
Going to the PlayStation 3, Lollipop Chainsaw in Japan, as well, and also a game called

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.520
Lord of Sorcery, as well as some new joystick adapters coming for you.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.640
Is that Lord of Sorcery from Sony?

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.960
I believe that is just Sorcery here.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:52.960
It is from Sony.

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.960
Yeah, that's Sorcery.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.120
And that's a move integrated game.

01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.520
FIFA 12 gets a price reduction, as well, on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:08.800
Quickly taking a look at the Xbox 360, Akai Katana Shin gets a price reduction this Friday,

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.960
as well as Eshatos gets a price reduction, as well, and Lollipop Chainsaw on the 360,

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:14.960
as well.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.960
And that's Japan.

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:16.960
Dark Sakura?

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:23.040
Well, we have a few things in the UK, and I would tell everybody if my thing would pull

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.040
up.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.040
There we go.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:31.320
We have coming up on the 13th, Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock, and Gravity Rush.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.200
And then on the 15th, we have Combat Wings, the Great Battles of World War II, Heroes

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:42.840
of Ruin, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Lollipop Chainsaw.

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.720
And that would do it for the UK.

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.720
All right.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:52.160
Well, let's go way back, back past E3 and past what's coming out this week, and go way

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.000
back in time to when things were a little bit simpler.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.360
Back when you had to read about E3 and Nintendo Power.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360
Okay, maybe not that long ago, but still, pretty far back.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.000
It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week, where Dark Sakura's gonna go into

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.160
the gaming vault and pull out an old-ass video game.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.560
She thinks, hey, while you guys are waiting for all this stuff to come out, respect a

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.560
classic.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.400
This is one from, literally from the vault, which is how I decided.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:19.400
All right.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.800
I picked a box of PS games, and this was the second one on them.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.440
And what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.440
Policemauts.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.960
Policemauts is one of the cinematic adventure games.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.840
It was done by Hideo Kojima.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.840
It has...

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.840
Yeah.

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:37.840
It was a Konami game.

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.840
The old Konami logo.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:39.840
Aw.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.480
I missed that.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:48.440
It was initially released for the PC 9821 in 1994.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.760
And then they remade versions for the 3DO, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn in 96.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.580
It has never officially been released outside of Japan, although they were going to localize

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.120
it on the Saturn.

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:06.920
And then on August 24th, in honor of the 46th birthday of Hideo Kojima, there was an unofficial

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.400
translation patch that came out on the internet.

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:15.260
Policemauts is a, I would say, a spiritual successor to Snatcher.

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:18.280
It's the same type of game.

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:25.600
With this one, it's a very interesting game because it really refers back to different

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:34.040
references like to Lethal Weapon and Urashima Taro, which is an old Japanese tale.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:39.920
The game is about a detective who travels to a space colony to investigate his ex-wife's

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.480
murder and her new husband's disappearance.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:48.800
So it is first person, point and click interface, and you play as the protagonist, Jonathan

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:55.680
Ingram, who is a policeman, basically, a former police officer trained to be a police officer

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.680
in space.

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:03.180
With the console, you use the mouse, but on the Saturn version you can use the light gun

01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:10.840
for shooting parts of the game, so it's actually a little bit more rich in terms of play.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:14.480
But on the other consoles, it's basically point and click, first person shooter type

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:23.280
stuff, with random saves and everything, and it actually has an easter egg that, if you've

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:30.360
got a save file of Tokimeki Memorial, it refers back to it, so pretty funny.

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.960
And of course, that came up in Metal Gear Solid, where it read your save files on your

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960
PlayStation card.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.800
Ooh, you are a careful man who saves often.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:47.280
So basically, again, like I said, he is, Jonathan Ingram is a police snot who is assigned to

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.600
Beyond Coast, which is the first functional space colony in 2013, so next year, or apparently

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600
colonizing space.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:01.600
So he goes to see what happened to Lorraine, who is his ex-wife, and her husband's vanished,

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.000
so he has to find out what's going on.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:11.260
He works with his buddy from the LAPD, Ed Brown, who is helping him with the investigation.

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.640
And so, it really is just that, point and click.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.920
Now, for different versions that came out, I did mention it originally was on the NEC

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:26.600
PC 9821, and it was one CD-ROM that had an installation floppy disk, and the cutscenes

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:33.040
were rendered in hand-drawn pixel art, instead of full motion video.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.120
It also is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:43.440
Then it came out on the 3DO on September 29th, 1995, that was two CD-ROMs, and it had animated

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.440
cutscenes.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440
It was CG animation.

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.640
All the graphics were completely redrawn for it.

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.400
The PS version came out on January 19th, 1996, on two disks.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.400
That's the version I have.

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.120
Actually, I have the best hits version of that, just to say.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:01.840
Then it came out on the Sega Saturn on September 13th, 1996, and it used, like I said, the

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.160
light gun.

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:08.400
Other versions that have been out is that there was the Policenauts pilot disk for 3DO

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:13.940
that had a playable demo of the backstory of the game, featurettes, and information

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.700
on the voice actors and developers.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:19.520
Then there was the Policenauts private collection that came out on the Playstation February

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520
9th, 1996.

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.600
It had a lot of the same content, and an earlier version of the game's script.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.680
The Playstation 1 has been reissued twice.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:33.160
There's the Konami The Best version, which is the one that I have, and then it came out

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:41.520
for the Playstation Store, making it downloadable for Playstation Portable and for PS3.

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.820
There was a plan to localize it on the Saturn.

01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:49.200
There actually is cover art that exists for this, and there's a fan translation that was

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:57.480
done for the Playstation, which you can actually use through Emulator.

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.400
I've seen a bunch of it through that.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.560
I've played through half of it in Japanese with a copy of that script.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:12.960
There was also a soundtrack that was released, and then Policenauts FN, which is a range

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:16.420
of versions of the music from the soundtrack.

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:21.720
There was the MIDI Power Pro 3, so there was a MIDI arrangement of the Policenauts music,

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:23.680
and the Snatcher Policenauts music disc.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.880
It was called Music Collection of Hideo Kojima Black Disc.

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:32.720
And there you go, Policenauts.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.800
If I may say so, there's also references to Policenauts and Snatcher in the Metal Gear

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.440
games.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.720
When it detects your save files and all that.

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:51.280
In fact, here's an obvious one, there's a scene where Otacon is flashed back to being

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:58.000
a big nerd, and there's scenes from Policenauts and Snatcher in his flashbacks.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.160
Baconbits in our chatroom asks, is there an official release on the US Playstation Network?

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160
No.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160
Nope.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160
But maybe someday.

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160
Bug him enough.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:11.400
However, however, you can find Policenauts, I think, relatively inexpensive if you're

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.440
getting the re-release.

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:17.480
And again, you can play it on an emulator with an English patch.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.960
So if you want to go to the trouble.

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:22.800
Or if you happen to be able to read and understand Japanese, you can play it on a PS3.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.120
And there's the way I played it.

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:29.320
I sat down with a freaking script that gave me my options.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.000
It was a pain in the ass.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
But you did it.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.600
But I did it.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:39.920
We beat the freaking Rurouni Kenshin game, the RPG, with a copy of the script.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.800
And we beat Grandia, we played through half of Grandia with my friend Krista there because

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.480
she could read everything.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:48.740
So I will tell you this right now.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.040
My Japanese reading is like a literate five year old.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.040
Seriously.

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.040
I know maybe 30 Kanji.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.200
That's it.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.200
Keep trying.

01:52:58.200 --> 01:52:59.300
You might get up to a six year old soon.

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:00.300
Maybe when I move.

01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.300
All right.

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.300
We're going to take a break.

01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:04.200
We're almost two hours with no break here.

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:08.500
And I need to go check into the show tonight at vognetwork.com and get my vog points so

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.200
I can get more loot.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:11.680
And hopefully you guys will do the same thing.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.800
Or you might join us in the VOG Network Clubhouse.

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.360
Again, just search for VOG in the PlayStation Home.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.880
And there's VOG Network all in caps.

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.800
I think we're going to fill this place tonight.

01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:23.420
Blender's already like, do we need a second clubhouse?

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:24.760
We might.

01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:28.420
So anyhow, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a minute with more of

01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:37.100
Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:42.800
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 460 for this June the 10th

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.800
of 2012.

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.280
We are live at vognetwork.com.

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.640
Be sure to check into the show.

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:52.000
Get your points and maybe some hidden loot there.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.520
Also we're live in the PlayStation Network Clubhouse.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.720
This is the last time most people have left, honestly.

01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:02.720
And I don't know how, we need to convince Sony somehow to give us more than 30 people

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.720
to get in that clubhouse.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:06.760
But I was checking out, Blender put in all these little like arcade games you can play

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:11.160
and I was playing Electro Kid, which I didn't realize, I mean, I knew there were some mini

01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.160
games.

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:15.320
Like I remember there was like a Arknoid clone breakout type thing that was kind of basic

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:18.120
and some other little things that were in there when home first launch.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.560
Like that Electro Kid I was just playing was kind of like a old school 8-bit platformer.

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.320
I was like, wow, I kind of behind the times on home.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.480
Like the Namco games or something that you could do?

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:33.200
Well, they tied into the, like all it would do, it was a launcher for the Namco collection

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.200
game.

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.720
Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.220
But still kind of neat and it looks like they are building more and more games into home.

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:41.600
So that's, that's pretty cool.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.040
So I was checking that out a little bit during the break.

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:50.320
Also before we get back into some long news here, I was asked to plug another show and

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.860
I'm like, all right, whatever, I'm, I'm, I'm a supporter of indie podcasts and so forth.

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.860
This isn't a podcast.

01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:56.860
It's a live show.

01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:58.760
It's one of our listeners who's PMing me here.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.440
Vince Raven hosts a show called Back in Time.

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:10.360
It airs live Wednesdays at 10 PM on his college's website, ehc.edu.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.280
It's W-E-H-C-F-M.

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.360
He does music and movie reviews and all that stuff.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:19.680
It's 10 o'clock Eastern, ehc.edu.

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.720
And you know what?

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:21.720
Why not?

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.080
I'll plug something one of the listeners wants to plug.

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.240
Plus I have to admit, I got my start on college radio too.

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:34.520
I used to DJ for KCSC 95.5 in Chico, California, even though that wasn't a real radio frequency.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:35.800
You had to have this little thing.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.520
It was cable radio.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:40.960
You had to hook up the cable to your radio.

01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.920
Yeah.

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:46.400
I probably have way more listeners now than I did back then.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.400
That's for sure.

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.840
But we all have to get our start somewhere.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:55.060
So hey, maybe someday Vince Raven will have his own network that he started after college

01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.060
radio.

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:57.060
Who knows?

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.060
He'll have his own network somewhere.

01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.060
All right.

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:03.000
Anyhow, also at vognetwork.com, be sure to participate in the forums.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.880
We are running forums again.

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.640
They look very generic right now, but I know that's on the plate for Bobby to expand this

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640
week.

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.920
Bobby has been working nonstop on the site.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.600
You have to remember, VOG Network has only been up in its full form for a week.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.700
And for a while, about a month before that, he was coding the version that you saw on

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:20.880
Friday when it launched.

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.200
And he's been still coding nonstop that week.

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.800
And I'm always like, Bobby, you should take a break.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.680
Bobby, you should go to Disneyland like I did.

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:29.160
Bobby, you should get away from your computer.

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.680
He's like, we've got to do a mobile site.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.040
We've got to do this other thing.

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.040
Things I can't talk about.

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.040
We've got to do this other thing.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.520
And I'm just like, Bobby.

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.680
So he's working very, very hard behind the scenes.

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:41.740
I know, Dar Sacher, you did some of the graphic stuffs.

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:43.440
So some of the pretty colors.

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.920
And there's other things coming up.

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:45.920
That's right.

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:46.920
Content-wise.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:49.640
That directly involves our listeners.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.560
But should I?

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560
I should.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.560
Drop a hint.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.920
VOG10 and VOGblog.

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.520
All right.

01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:00.280
We do have VOGvlog.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:02.200
There'll be more for that a little later.

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:03.200
All right.

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:07.280
Anyhow, let's get back into some actual gaming news out of E3.

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:10.860
First, some rapid fire news starting with Loki.

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.480
So let's talk a little bit about Dawnguard.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:19.400
The new expansion for Elder Scrolls Skyrim sounds awesome.

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.360
And it's coming out very soon.

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:26.300
Actually in a few weeks, the tentative date right now is the 26th of June.

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:32.000
And that'll be on Xbox 360 only right now because they are getting the DLC first.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.240
And so there is currently a beta right now, which they have not accepted me.

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:37.320
Very disappointed there.

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.880
But that will be hopefully very soon.

01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.120
We'll get to play the full thing.

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.760
And I will definitely be picking that up.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:48.240
And I may actually get into a game that's not Minecraft for a little bit.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240
Yay.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:53.440
And there is a sequel announced to Dead Rising, Dead Rising Riptide.

01:57:53.440 --> 01:58:01.400
It is coming out soon, probably this fall, I mentioned, or imagine.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.400
Consoles and PC.

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:07.760
Doesn't really say when, but there's supposed to be an extensive reveal this summer.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.480
So probably the fall.

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:14.520
And last but not least was a game that wasn't shown during the press conferences.

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:21.360
But Project P100, a Wii U launch title, which is going to be coming to us from Platinum

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.440
Games.

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:27.600
And it kind of looks like a cross between Viewtiful Joe and Pikmin.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.800
And you basically play like these superheroes that get other superheroes and other citizens

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.640
to kind of form together to attack monsters that are attacking Earth.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.880
I saw somebody in chat, and I'm sorry I forget who, said that that was their game of the

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.880
show.

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.820
So some people are already excited about this.

01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:45.120
It's pretty cool.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.160
Alright, moving on.

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:54.400
WarioWare makes a showing at E3, but not in the way you might think.

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:57.640
It's part of Game and Wario.

01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:02.020
That's just something that kind of was on the E3 page but not really seen at the show.

01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:06.160
Why wasn't that show instead of like, you know, half the amount of...

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.760
Because it's not a launch window title, probably.

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:13.280
Anyhow, the description says, Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action.

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:17.720
Game and Wario features a collection of games that use only the Wii U gamepad controller.

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:21.840
The games retain the original flair and character of the microgames from the WarioWare series.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:26.600
So it sounds like it's maybe a more fleshed-out version of WarioWare, which could be very

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.660
interesting.

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:33.480
Some games called Arrow and Ski and Shudder sound a lot like, you know, one-word WarioWare

01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.480
games.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:35.480
But, yeah, unfortunately it's not WarioWare.

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.740
I mean, if it was WarioWare, ha-ha.

01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.160
It's not, but it sounds like it kind of might be.

01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:40.800
Like it might be the spiritual successor.

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:41.800
You know that term?

01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:42.800
I don't want a spiritual successor.

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.800
I want an actual successor.

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.920
Screw the spiritual successor stuff.

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:50.000
We don't need spiritual successes.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.120
That's if your franchise didn't do very well.

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:54.480
This is WarioWare that we're talking about.

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:59.400
Well, when I think of characters in Sega franchises that ought to turn up in Sonic and All-Stars

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:04.400
Racing Transformed, I don't necessarily think of Danica Patrick, NASCAR Racing Star.

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:05.400
But guess what?

02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:09.000
She's going to be a playable character in Sonic and All-Star Racing Transformed.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.760
That's kind of cool.

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:11.760
That is kind of cool.

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:16.520
You know, and I realize especially, she's a good role model for women because she's

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:20.400
in there doing a boy sport that has a lot of, you know, and she's, well, you're kind

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.520
of giving me stank face a little bit.

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.520
No.

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:26.680
Well, I hate the term men's sport when...

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.680
I know.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:28.680
I don't...

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:29.680
It's driving a car.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:32.440
I don't like it either, but let's say male dominated.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.440
Okay.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440
That works.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440
All right.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.840
And, you know, she's, she kind of kicks a lot of ass and, you know, has done very well

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:42.160
for herself being a spokesperson for various sites and so forth, and now she's going to

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:43.800
be playable in a video game.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.320
So that'll be pretty cool.

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.880
Clover Nikon in our chat room though says, I want Alex Kidd to be playable.

02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:51.640
How about the return of Alex Kidd?

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.360
Where the hell has he been?

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.400
We need Alex Kidd in Shinobi World 2.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:56.400
Dream on.

02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:00.520
I want to say that, like, I remember the first game had a lot of like old Sega characters.

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:04.360
I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.280
There are some Danica haters, cue the Danica haters in our chat room.

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.920
Hey, you want to talk about a franchise that could, you know, or a company that could use

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:16.880
one of those, like, oh, hey, our mascots are fighting a battle royale type thing.

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.480
Sega would be pretty amazing.

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.480
I would.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:20.720
Didn't they do something like that?

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.040
I thought they had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.040
No, I'm sorry.

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:25.480
That was Ubisoft.

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:26.760
Let me read the haters.

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:27.760
It's the internet.

02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.760
There's always going to be haters.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:32.680
DJ Morpheus says, great, another avenue that shows Danica can't drive.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:35.960
Blender says, Danica sucks, I'm ho.

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:41.400
So every fandom has their haters, all right.

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.040
Moving on.

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.040
It's hard to laugh and then go into a story like this because stories like this are never

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.240
easy to report on, but yet again, another studio has closed.

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.080
It's THQ's San Diego studio.

02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.020
They were the ones doing the UFC license, mostly was the stuff they were doing those

02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.020
games.

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:06.560
So because the license has transitioned elsewhere to Electronic Arts, the San Diego studio has

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.760
been closed.

02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:11.520
Maybe they can get hired at EA.

02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:13.920
That's the tiny little silver lining in this.

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:14.920
We'll see.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.420
Moving on to some more rapid fire news, Dark Sakura.

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:19.920
Let's see what we've got.

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.140
Well, first of all, the Humble Indie Bundle 5 has three new additions to it.

02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:32.320
If you pay above the minimum, which is right now at $8.14, you get Braid, Super Meat Boy,

02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.320
and Lone Survivor.

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:42.200
Now, I think this is pretty cool for the Minecraft fan in the room, that Marcus Pearson actually

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:51.800
paid $9,999.99.

02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.200
Next up, Portal 2 in Motion.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.760
It actually is going to use the PlayStation Move.

02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:58.760
And you know what?

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.760
I don't give a crap about that because I played on the PC.

02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:07.560
It's basically the stuff that they had, remember, that was the N, I think it was like Sixth

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:10.480
Sense or N Sense or some weird like N Space.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.000
It uses the same from the Razer Hydra.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Yeah, Razer Hydra.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.480
I was just gonna keep naming random names.

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:19.000
Yeah, you know the motion controller, I mean it sucks.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.840
Well, not suck, but no one's buying it for the PC.

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.020
So why not recycle the content here?

02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:29.640
It pissed me off because Sony showed that in one of their little compilations of footage

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:31.960
and we were like, holy shit, a new Portal game.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.240
Holy shit, yay, yay, yay.

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.000
And then it's, oh, it's Move DLC.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.280
Whatever, DLC is DLC.

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.280
I guess.

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:39.280
I follow that under, I don't give a shit.

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.280
I guess.

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.880
And well, how about Sony stuff anyway?

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:43.880
Tokyo Jungle.

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.200
We're getting it, we're getting it.

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.800
We don't have to import it.

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.400
I can be a gazelle.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.760
This was the game we lost our shit on last week and said it should be the new President

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.760
Cat.

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.760
Well, that didn't take long.

02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:56.840
They are bringing it to North America, yay.

02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:05.080
Well, in fact, this actually was, I'm trying to find the guy's name.

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:12.560
Scott Rode, who was the Sony VP of Product Development and Worldwide, he says, it'll

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.600
ship here, it'll ship everywhere.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.840
And to him, I'm going to read this directly from the article.

02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:25.960
To him, Tokyo Jungle's worldwide release is emblematic of Sony's crazy innovative approach.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:29.900
He says the game is just wacky, but in a good way because we like to show that there's still

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.880
an art form and you can still experiment.

02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:36.000
I want the hell out of this game.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Just saying.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I know.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I kind of want it to.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
It's going to be awesome.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'm lusting in my heart after it.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.240
All right.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.400
And lusting in your heart is lusting for real.

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.120
Well, now we're to the part of the show where we're going to get to the foogle question

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:53.240
of the week.

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.080
What the hell is a foogle, you might be asking?

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.320
Well, it's Facebook and Google Plus combined.

02:04:57.320 --> 02:04:59.360
You get a foogle.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:02.840
We ask a question on Facebook and Google Plus and you guys answer it.

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.120
And we read some of the answers.

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.360
There's a lot of answers tonight.

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.360
I can't read them all.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.360
I just can't.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.160
We read some of the answers here live on the show.

02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:12.640
But if you want to see all the answers, check us out on Google Plus.

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.440
The link is on our website because you can't get a short URL on Google Plus yet.

02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:20.280
You just go to orangelandtrader.com and in the upper right hand corner is a box that

02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.280
says extended play.

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:24.360
Just click on that Google Plus logo and you can add us there.

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.520
And yes, there are people using Google Plus because we got a couple of responses over

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.520
there.

02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.840
Tonight we have Michael D answering our question of the week which was, what in your opinion

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:36.440
was the highlight of E3 this year?

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.760
What is the thing you are looking forward to most of all?

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:43.920
And Michael D says from the press conferences, oh excuse me, he did sign it, Technus, my

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.920
bad.

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:48.240
Technus says from the press conferences, I'd say what Ubisoft announced pretty much blew

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.240
the big three away.

02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:53.320
They had a great combination of going in strong with their existing IPs and finishing with

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:56.800
Watch Dogs, a game that sounds as amazing as it looks.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.320
I would also like to mention that the tech demos for the new next gen engines, i.e.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:05.240
Unreal Engine 4, CryEngine 3, Final Fantasy tech demo, look extremely impressive.

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:07.600
Overall, I was pleased with this E3.

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:11.560
Except for Microsoft in which I asked, please stick to the game, save the multimedia info

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:14.560
for CES.

02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:19.320
Good point there about the tech demos for the next gen stuff.

02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:22.620
Some of that stuff was really impressive and finally, you know, just when you think the

02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:27.760
graphics can't get any better, there they go, they get better.

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:33.800
Lastly, going to a comment from Rababa on Google Plus says, I think the understated

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.560
highlight was smart glass.

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.560
If they use this potential, it will pretty much derail the Wii U tablet controller.

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:42.160
Don't get me wrong, I want the Wii U to succeed, but it will have to be truly awesome

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.160
to be successful.

02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:46.800
I'm still waiting for the delay in release to 2013 because their marketing should be

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.880
almost full swing by now to release in the fall, predicting that Wii U may just delay.

02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.040
I don't think Nintendo can afford it.

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:57.840
Their stocks next year would plummet, or the earnings and all that.

02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:59.840
It has to come out.

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:03.240
I most look forward to saving money from not buying games this year.

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:08.280
Clothes, Gears of War, Yawn, I just don't like too many shooters.

02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:11.240
Let's go to Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:14.600
Picaruno answered and said, probably going to get some shit from someone for this, but

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:20.000
apart from Assassin's Creed 3, none of the games on offer wowed me.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.080
Wonder Book is a great idea, but its implementation on the Playstation 3 is stupid.

02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.520
It would sell a lot better on iOS.

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.920
Here's what I'm going to say about Wonder Book.

02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:31.280
It's going to bomb as bad as Eye of Judgment.

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.360
Dark Glass actually interests me a lot more than the Wii U, mainly because it works with

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.040
all your existing gear.

02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:41.000
Its applications are nothing new, but I think they'd be a welcome addition to the Xbox 360's

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
capabilities.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.360
Also, where the fuck were the Vita games, Sony?

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:50.120
Flaco Jones says, beyond two souls, it looked like they took heavy rain's gameplay and improved

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.120
everything.

02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:53.440
Again, the thing that most excited you about E3.

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.960
Rhetortainment says, ditto on what Picaruno said.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.680
I want to see more from Metal Gear Revengerance, such as gameplay.

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.840
Quantic Dreams Beyond Two Souls stood out for me.

02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:03.840
I loved Heavy Rain.

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:06.120
I bought a Playstation move just to play again.

02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:09.520
When I saw Beyond Two Souls, I made a mental note to buy this game.

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:13.560
Then I made a note on my droid that reads, buy Beyond Two Souls the day that it comes

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.560
out.

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.640
That's two people in a row excited about Beyond Two Souls.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.720
Metal Gear Solid game, or not Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising game actually looked pretty

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:21.720
awesome.

02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:25.660
Shane from Hoard House commented and said, I'd have an addition to my previous statement,

02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:27.160
which was about Mass Effect 3.

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.880
I'd say Mass Effect 3 Wii U, Beyond Two Souls.

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.880
Here it is again.

02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.920
Watch Dogs and Last of Us were the only things I cared about at E3.

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.800
I'm super hyped for those games.

02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.160
Yes, completely forgot about Last of Us, one of the big games that they showed, and that

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:41.320
was one of their two IPs that they introduced.

02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:43.480
But granted, we knew about that one already.

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:44.480
Yeah.

02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:45.480
The Last Opus.

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.560
I'm sad it's no longer The Last Opus.

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:52.560
Tiger Caw says, I think the highlights for this year's E3 was Ubisoft with their accidental

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.620
nip slips up courtesy of Far Cry 3, and the unveiling of the new game Watch Dogs.

02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:01.640
The new game from the creators of Heavy Rain called Beyond Two Souls during the Sony press

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.640
conference.

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:04.840
As for Nintendo, Zombie Reggie.

02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.840
That is all.

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:06.840
What?

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:07.840
Okay.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:11.360
Did you happen to watch the video of the pre-E3 conference?

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.360
A little bit.

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:13.360
I skipped around.

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:18.120
What the fuck is up with Miyamoto holding a god damn, or, Iwata, holding a banana.

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.840
A bunch of bananas for no reason.

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.720
He wanted to be a gif.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.640
Ronnie B says, I agree with Picaruno.

02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:27.280
Assassin's Creed 3 and the concept for Beyond were the only games that stood out for me,

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.280
really.

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:29.720
I hate what they've done with Dead Space.

02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.120
Stan says, hate on me all you want, but Pikmin 3 looks so fun.

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.440
I almost went out and bought Pikmin 1 and 2 just from watching 3's trailer.

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.440
Well, now would be a great time to re-buy 2, because didn't the new control version come

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.440
out?

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.440
Loki?

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:43.440
Is that out here in the States?

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.440
Yeah.

02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:45.440
It just came up today.

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:46.440
There you go.

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:51.440
Acidic Vampire says, I'm stoked for South Park RPG Tomb Raider, Beyond Two Souls, The

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.880
Last Opus, Pikmin 3 and Dead Space 3.

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:58.920
Oh, and the upcoming PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 with a gimmicky controller, aka the Wii U.

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:01.960
Actually, I'm not enthralled by it.

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:05.120
Red the Haze says, Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising.

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.280
Screw the haters saying that they're similar.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.320
They should shut up about games that aren't out and that they haven't played before.

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:17.440
Oh, and the Ellen Page waifu simulators, which is the new emerging video game genre.

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:20.760
That's because Ellen Page is heavily inspired in The Last of Us, right?

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:23.440
In one of the characters based off her, sort of?

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.440
Looks likers.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.440
Looks likers.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.000
All right, let me do one more comment here.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.440
Actually, two more.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.640
Critical Myth said, Highlight was the Square Enix next gen demo, but for right now I'm

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:38.240
most looking forward to The Last of Us.

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.040
At least we have a good idea when it's hitting the shelves.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:44.080
And lastly, from Dark Charger, nothing particularly stood out.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.360
E3 this year is about the whole show being greater than the sum of its parts.

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:52.480
Despite the lack of a single bombshell, the many games, mostly third parties, were enough

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:56.720
to keep it not only my attention, but have me checking the calendar for several important

02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:57.720
releases.

02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:03.200
Perhaps entering E3 with tempered expectations ensures that I, or the gamer in general, always

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.200
wins.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.200
Interesting.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.720
Final note, but a good one, I think.

02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:08.720
Setting the bar low.

02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:16.680
See, the problem with next year's E3 is the bar is really high, because we have Sony and

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:21.600
Microsoft hopefully debuting their new consoles, although honestly, guys, nothing's set in

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.600
place.

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:28.720
Especially if the Wii U kinda goes pfft when it launches, which it very well might, I think

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.360
a lot of pressure would be off by Microsoft and Sony.

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.960
The longer they wait, the better the consoles will be, and the more trouble Nintendo will

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.160
be when they do launch.

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.400
Let them sit in the oven a little longer, right?

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.120
Seriously, because they're in no hurry.

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.760
They were talking about a console that's basically spec-wise the same as, you know, PlayStation

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:47.680
3 and Xbox 360.

02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:53.440
Now that's not necessarily a thing that's gonna be a detriment to them, but, I mean,

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.280
because the Wii did take off.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:01.080
However, I don't think that this console's that different than the Wii, and your average

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:06.600
soccer mom, if you will, is not gonna go, I need to have this, because it's like, well,

02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.080
it kinda does the same thing the Wii does.

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:10.080
It's gonna be interesting.

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.040
I'm really curious to see what happens, because, you know, when the Wii first came out, there

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:19.880
was a lot of us going, what the hell's that name, and, but it would, it worked, so we'll

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:20.880
see.

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.880
And the Wii U.

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:22.880
Hey, whatever.

02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:30.000
Hey, you know what, at the very least, we still have the Kung Pao jokes, and any attention

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.800
given back to Kung Pao is more attention and possibility for a sequel to that movie.

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.600
Shadow Next Gen brings up a good point, the DVD format on the 360 is becoming a serious

02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:41.600
issue.

02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.360
Maybe, maybe, uh, it can't afford to be DVD only much longer.

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.680
I mean, I guess there is always digital, but, I mean, it's not really gonna help.

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:55.080
They can always, I think that there's always a possibility that they'll have game installs.

02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:59.240
They have it on the PlayStation 3, so just have it now where it comes with ships on three

02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.120
discs, but you only need one, you can install the other two.

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:06.080
But technically, you can buy an Xbox 360 without a hard drive, so that shit shouldn't be required.

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.560
Yeah, technically, it still has four gigs.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.720
That's not enough for some games.

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.480
Alright, let's move on with some more stories, we're gonna get to the mailbag of the Effies

02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:18.000
of the Week, and of course, your phone calls, but let's try to get through these stories

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
kind of quick here.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Loki.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:27.640
Alright, so, real quick, um, apparently Vivendi is looking to sell, um, part of, a part or

02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:35.640
all of their stock in Activision, and of course, Vivendi, um, owns 61% of the controlling stake

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:41.400
in, uh, Activision, and apparently they're holding a meeting on the 22nd of this month

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:47.880
to discuss the potential for the sale of, um, part or all of its holdings, and, um,

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:54.800
basically, I think they're trying to drum up some more money, and, um, you know, basically,

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.320
they're saying, uh, some people believe that Vivendi's worth more if it's split up into

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:04.120
various parts, and the potential split doesn't really mean anything for Activision other

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:12.400
than a lot of shares on the market all at once, so, yeah, I don't really think it means

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:17.120
a whole lot, other than, you know, one company's not really gonna own anything, although, it's

02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.320
kinda sad when you think about Vivendi, they purchased all these other companies when they

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.560
bought Activision, and...

02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.920
It seems like a weird time to sell it off, I mean, I don't know, I didn't think there

02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.360
was bad news necessarily coming out of there right now.

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.720
It's bad news, maybe they just need more money, maybe, you know, that section...

02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:32.720
That could be!

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.720
Maybe that section of their business is doing okay, but they want, you know, they want their

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.040
fat paycheck.

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:41.920
Perhaps, or maybe they think it's good now, but maybe they're not so excited about the

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:42.920
future, but...

02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:44.920
Maybe they gotta go, ew, it's all sticky!

02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.200
Get rid of it!

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.100
Maybe they're a little worried about some of this Diablo 3 fallout, and maybe they're

02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:53.100
worried about the next WoW expansion, and maybe this new Blizzard product, I'm focusing

02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:54.880
on Blizzard, but I can't help myself.

02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:58.080
I don't think that's, I think I just want money.

02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.080
Sell off some shares.

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:00.080
And who doesn't?

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:01.080
Retire.

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.960
Well Sega doesn't want money, clearly, because they took Hatsune Miku Project Diva F for

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:11.920
the Vita to E3 to show it off, and then said, oh, it's not coming out of North America.

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:16.120
Which is very weird, it's very weird, usually games don't show up at E3 that aren't coming

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:21.480
out of North America, but according to a Sega rep, it was a sneak peek of a game coming

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:22.480
to Japan.

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.000
There are many Project Diva fans out there, like Dark Sakura, so it is disappointing to

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.960
hear that this will not be coming out.

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.840
However, Vita is region free, right?

02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.840
That's true.

02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:40.440
So maybe this is all hint, hint, hint, it's not coming to America, hint, wink, import.

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.640
Let's go to the mailbag.

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:47.180
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:49.320
emails here on the show.

02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:53.800
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst again at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:55.960
and pick out some of her favorite emails to read right now.

02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.640
Well, I'm going to read all the ones that are in there.

02:15:58.640 --> 02:15:59.640
They're not very long.

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:02.040
Hey OLR, quick question for all three hosts.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.520
Of all the games you saw presented at this year's E3, which ones are you planning to

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.680
buy on day one, if any?

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:13.160
And I'm honestly, I'm interested in Beyond Two Souls, and I want to play Tank Tank Tank,

02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.400
because I'm sorry, that game is freaking addictive as hell.

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:21.360
Otherwise I'm not super interested in hardly anything, so.

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:26.440
I'm a little behind still, I feel, but I definitely want that new Tomb Raider game.

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:35.200
I'll probably end up getting the Wii U, I don't know, to be determined.

02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:41.880
That Ubisoft game Watch Dogs looks really good too, I might have to check that out.

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.820
Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U.

02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:51.760
Borderlands 2, for sure, South Park, The Sick of Truth, and...

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:57.720
Oh yeah, I totally want that South Park game too.

02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:59.520
Really, those are the only two that jumped out right now.

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:01.720
Grand Theft Auto 5, whenever the hell that fucking comes out.

02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:02.720
Yeah, where was that?

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:04.920
Eh, it's not ready yet.

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:09.280
They probably think, hey, well, Take Two's not really at, you know, they aren't really

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.280
at E3.

02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.920
Their booth always has no electric fence.

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:15.960
And so they probably, you know, maybe it's just not ready to show off yet, because I

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:20.200
mean, if you think about it, it's probably about a year away from being released, so...

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.640
They'll just have their own fucking splash, but hey, fucking Grand Theft Auto 5, you're

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:26.520
buying this shit, you know it.

02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:27.520
Let's continue.

02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.960
I'm pretty sure Dan would want to get Halo 4, so.

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:34.200
And then, Ospher, who wrote the email, says, for me, Halo 4 and Beyond Two Souls 4 must

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:35.200
have titles.

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.360
Except I misread it as titties, so.

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:38.360
Sincerely, Ospher.

02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:42.280
P.S., all my love goes to the Krogan, but I guess I can spare some for my fellow Mass

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.280
Effect gamers.

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.280
Heart!

02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:47.800
You know, actually, speaking of titties, Far Cry 3 actually looks pretty awesome.

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:49.920
I actually may pick that up day one.

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.080
You know what game looked ridiculous?

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.140
Alan made me watch the trailer last night.

02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.140
That Hitman Absolut-tion.

02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:58.840
Okay, well, the trailer was ridiculous.

02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:03.400
The trailer was totally ridiculous, with the stripper nuns and guns.

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:05.960
They're trying to think, like, this is all the things that boys like.

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:06.960
Well, they even...

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:07.960
Don't forget exploding toilets.

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:11.680
They even, well, even, like, a lot of people in the industry are just like, what the fuck

02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.680
was that trailer?

02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:14.200
That just makes no sense.

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:15.720
The game looks pretty good.

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.720
Anyhow.

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:17.720
Next email!

02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:20.720
Um, Robert M. here.

02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:24.360
You guys mentioned Retro City Rampage's Meat Boy minigame on last week's pre-taped...

02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:27.280
I hate that word!

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.280
Taped show.

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.700
Last month's Nintendo Power had a feature on the game for WiiWare, including a Splosion

02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.240
Man minigame as well.

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:37.240
Not sure how that works license-wise.

02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:42.320
I get the impression that this will join Meat Boy and Spelunky as unreleased, especially

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.500
this late in the Wii's life cycle.

02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:47.320
For what other consoles is it scheduled?

02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:48.320
As for the...

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:49.320
Oh, go ahead.

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.320
You were gonna say?

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:56.040
Uh, Xbox Live Arcade, uh, PlayStation Network for both, um, PlayStation 3 and the Vita as

02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:57.040
PC.

02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.040
Nice.

02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.040
Okay.

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.640
As for the voice of Geeks Network, how practical do you expect it'll be for shows doing video

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.320
content, under Sedation Live in particular, to have a video podcast feed?

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:13.440
I know when he was doing Friday Night Gaming, Bobby said such a feed would be three gigabytes

02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:14.440
an episode.

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:22.040
Uh, yeah, the problem is you have to compress the video and then it's tricky.

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.160
It's tricky to do something like that.

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.680
Um, you know, yeah, video podcasts are hard and there haven't been a lot of successful

02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:29.680
ones that are over.

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.860
I mean, most of them are like five minutes long.

02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:38.080
That's how they deliver the video podcast because five minutes worth of HD video is

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.380
like our three hour show, you know?

02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:41.380
They're about the same size.

02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:44.120
There's plenty of them that use, um, just post them to YouTube.

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.120
Yeah, that's true.

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.160
Um, you know, I think Travis has been putting clips on YouTube and so forth and I'd certainly

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.700
encourage him to continue doing that.

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:58.360
But for now, I think him particularly is very about getting people in for the live experience.

02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.100
So I don't think he's going to take a whole lot of effort to try and get the video up

02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:04.140
when he is putting the audio out there at least.

02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:07.480
So at least, and I will say this, give mad props to Travis.

02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:09.640
He's got that shit on same day turnaround now.

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:10.640
Like forever.

02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:13.000
We were like, Travis, get season five up, Travis, get season five.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.960
He's worked out a system where he's on same day turnaround now.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:15.960
So props to him.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:18.840
I think that's, I think that is important too.

02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:23.840
I finally saw the disco thing and disco disco Lord.

02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:26.680
It made me glad I didn't have a webcam at the time.

02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:29.740
Uh, Oh God, did he put that on YouTube?

02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:30.740
I don't think so.

02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:31.740
Phew.

02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:32.740
Phew.

02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:33.740
Um, I don't know.

02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:34.740
I didn't look.

02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:35.740
Um, I will say this.

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:39.440
We are looking at doing more type of like vlog content cause like Travis did that studio

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.440
tour that went up during the week.

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:45.960
And I'm going to do one that's a little more talking head, but I've got one coming up in

02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:49.680
the next week that I'll, I'll, should I spoil it?

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.680
Spoil.

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:53.060
I'll, I'll say this much, I'll drop a hint.

02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:57.840
I'm going to explain why I am not doing a particular podcast.

02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:00.700
People have been asking me to do a podcast on a certain topic and I'm going to explain

02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:02.800
in depth why that's not going to happen.

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:03.800
And sorry.

02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:04.800
Mm hmm.

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.440
Um, so to continue with the email as for the voice of geeks network, how proud, Oh, nevermind.

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:12.440
I already read that.

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:13.440
Blah.

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.440
Next email.

02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:16.200
Um, Hey guys, die.

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:17.200
You're sexist.

02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:18.200
Um, sorry.

02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:24.520
Um, so I just finished watching the E3 press conference conferences while I was really

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:28.200
looking forward to what Microsoft and Nintendo had to offer and didn't really expect much

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:33.000
from Sony ended up liking the fact that Sony focused on games for the most part as really

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.940
considering the Wii U since I thought it would be next gen system that would get all the

02:21:36.940 --> 02:21:40.420
new games for other, that other systems shared plus Mario and Zelda.

02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:43.640
Unfortunately after their press conference, it seemed like they were focusing too much

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:47.720
on the gimmicks and the multi console games were all out of date.

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:49.640
So I guess I'll have to pass on that.

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.120
I did think the new Kinect features and the smart glass that Microsoft presented were

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:54.120
cool.

02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:59.300
However, when it comes to games, I just don't care about getting into Halo or Gears of War

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:02.880
after all this time and they didn't offer anything new game wise.

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.880
Sony still won me over with their exclusives.

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.320
I love to have you rain, so I will be buying beyond right away.

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.600
The last of us looked like a great way to tell a different kind of story with the already

02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:18.880
proven uncharted game engine and while I don't care much about God of war or PlayStation

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.720
all sores, it's all stars, not all sores.

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:22.720
All sores.

02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:27.040
It's the amazing game where you fight STDs.

02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.440
That is important.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:30.440
Oh God.

02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:31.440
It's herpes man.

02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:39.640
Herpes, that sores herpes man versus Mrs. Gonorrhea, ringworm gun, ringworm gym, ringworm

02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:41.280
gun.

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.640
Anyway, um, all stars.

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:50.080
It's still nice that Sony is delivering for fans of those types of games as well.

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:53.800
I just wish Wii U wasn't trying to ram this new controller down our throats more like

02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:55.200
up your ass.

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.720
Um, seriously, it's not just swallow it.

02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.760
It's take it as a suppository too.

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:06.000
Um, I had high hopes when I saw the pro controller that there would be an alternative, but there,

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.360
but they aren't even getting the awesome looking Watch Dogs game, at least not when it comes

02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.360
out.

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:14.800
That means no Mario or Zelda for me, as long as they keep pushing gimmicky controls and

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.800
that's from Flacco Jones.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.440
There's the other thing too, like once again, it gets me thinking about the Wii U, um, their

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:24.640
biggest features that they like were pimping out.

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:28.280
This system can be played when someone wants to watch TV.

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:30.000
I just don't understand that.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
You're supposed to, okay, this system is supposed to be so awesome that you want to play it

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.000
on your TV.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.760
And I know a lot of people probably have multiple TVs they can play it on.

02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:40.520
I don't understand why that's necessarily a feature that we need to be pimping out.

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:46.160
And, and once again, just like the Wii was, they're pimping it as like this party environment

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:51.360
that all these party games, you know, like Just Dance has this, you know, Poppy Master

02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:52.360
Mode.

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:53.360
Hey, guess what?

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:57.880
I hardly ever have people over to my house to play games nowadays because I have a kid.

02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:02.320
I can't just be getting the party going and you know, oh, hey, we gotta be quiet because

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:05.320
we have the kid there, you know, so I don't have that.

02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:12.880
So the fact that, you know, Super Mario, um, New Super Mario Brothers, you or, you know,

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:14.600
Rayman Legends has five player co-op.

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.920
I can't get two player co-op in my household, let alone five people.

02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:22.580
Let me get out here a couple points on Wii U from our chat room.

02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:27.500
Shadownextgen in our chat room at vognetwork.com, click on live chat says, I love how no one

02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.640
can see what is happening.

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.600
Mass Effect 3, for example, will obviously be late to the Wii U, but with EA BioWare

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:38.320
being on board with Wii U, that means Mass Effect 4 will be day date with the other consoles.

02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:42.080
Black Wolf says, you know, if they didn't spend all that time discussing the new controller,

02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.600
we would have been like, wait, why did you not give us more information on the controller?

02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:47.920
No, we wouldn't have.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:50.040
Yes, they would have.

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.640
I agree with them.

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:53.600
Unless you're just in the same boat that I am.

02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.700
Don't care.

02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:57.880
What more information did we get about their controller?

02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:02.120
The quote unquote final design, and the whole fact that you can use two of them now, which

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:03.720
was a big thing people were bitching about last year.

02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:06.280
That's not important though, but if you think about it, that's not important, because we

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:09.480
didn't see any games that used two of them, so who knows how that's going to be utilized,

02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.320
and we already saw the final design and got leaked out already.

02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:15.660
So what did we need to know about the controller that we didn't know already?

02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:16.660
Back to the email.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:17.660
Can I read the last email?

02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:21.000
Greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.660
I thought I'd say hi and keep up the good work.

02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:26.680
Your show helps make my Mondays bearable at work.

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:29.440
I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions of E3.

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:30.440
One last thing.

02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.480
I just bought my first smartphone and was wondering if there are any apps and or games.

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.520
Do you think I'd be crazy not to get?

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:38.920
Peace and Chicken Grease, Serious Turtle.

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:39.920
Yes.

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:42.600
And we need to know what kind of phone you have too.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:43.600
We don't know what kind of phone.

02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:46.280
There's a big difference between Android and iOS.

02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:49.160
There's some games that are between both.

02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:53.560
I like Cut the Rope, personally, and Temple Run.

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.400
I'm so addicted to Temple Run recently.

02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:59.920
I got Bubble Bobble, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble, Best of Move.

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:02.400
I played the crap out of it.

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:12.120
And seriously, it is, you know, that I actually really liked Espigobluda too.

02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:18.080
And I really, you know, as far as apps, I know I'm looking at my phone right now.

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.240
The Midway Arcade Collection isn't bad, especially because I think it was 99 cents or

02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.320
relatively low cost, and it does have a lot in it, even though I kind of hate using the

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.080
touch screen controls.

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.160
Bejeweled Blitz is a free PopCap game.

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.160
That's pretty cool.

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.160
Pinball Arcade.

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:36.160
Oh, oh, yes, the Pinball games.

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:37.160
Oh my gosh.

02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:40.680
There's Zen Pinball has a Pinball version, and then there's that new one too.

02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:41.680
Yeah, Pinball Arcade.

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:42.680
There's Juke Beat.

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:43.820
I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy.

02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:44.820
Both are worth getting.

02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:45.820
Absolutely.

02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:46.820
Robot Unicorn Attack, Peggle.

02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:47.820
Plants vs. Zombies.

02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:49.320
Beat Hazard is on iOS now.

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.220
You know, Plants vs. Zombies, I don't really like so much on the iPhone.

02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.680
It would need a larger thing.

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.300
R-Type, actually, believe it or not, R-Type is one of the few shooters that works very

02:26:58.300 --> 02:26:59.300
well on the iPhone.

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.720
Well, I'm just seeing what else I have.

02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.140
As far as like regular apps, you know, I've got Facebook.

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:06.560
For Twitter, I use Echo Phone.

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:08.660
I paid for Echo Phone, and it's worth it.

02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:12.340
If you're on iOS, Flipboard.

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.480
I have the Tumblr app, Goodreads, because I like to share my books.

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.600
The Steam app, AIM, Pinterest, you know, I've got all the usual stuff.

02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:20.600
And then...

02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.600
XTube?

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:22.600
Not Jamie.

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:23.600
Just kidding.

02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.480
I've also got a program that, when I go to eat out, I use called Check, Please, that

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:34.840
actually splits your meal, includes or dis-includes tip, and lets you go up to 30% tip.

02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:36.560
Ah, downloading that right now.

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:39.800
QR Reader, because of all the stuff using QR codes now.

02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:43.240
And actually a really neat little clock program called Nuka.

02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:47.760
Nuka does all these interesting different digital watches, and the Nuka app is actually

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:51.920
pretty fun to play with, and has neat timers and everything.

02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:55.400
I have Secret Garden that Ikuma JP did.

02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:56.960
I use Shazam all the time.

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:59.080
You're not going to go through all seven pages of your phone, are you?

02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:00.080
No, I'm not.

02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:01.320
I'm just picking the best ones.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.840
I have the Kindle app, but I love Shazam because I go to Pinkberry and like the music, so I'll

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.480
tag the music at Pinkberry, and then I usually go and download albums.

02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:12.640
If you're playing Mass Effect 3, get the data pad.

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.400
I mean, there's just lots of good stuff, and, you know, when you go to Disneyland, use Mouse

02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.240
Plate, you know, so that you know how long you have to wait for Space Mountain.

02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:27.240
But really, those are just some good ones, and that was the last email.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.640
Awesome.

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:32.440
Just root your phone and download them all for free.

02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:37.480
Alright, let's move on with the FUs of the week, because some things that E3 might have

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.320
made us angry, or maybe stuff IRL.

02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:57.080
We're going to find out right now.

02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:01.640
I'm not really upset about anything, except for my nail polish deciding that it all wanted

02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:07.040
to come off tonight, and my nails are kind of brittle, so.

02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:11.520
Fucking in my throat for being sore, it's not really, I don't know, it's like a weird

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:12.520
thing.

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:15.960
I don't know if it's allergies, or if it's cold, or strep throat, or what, but for like

02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.520
the last two weeks, my throat's just been like, I'll get sharp pains every now and then,

02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:25.600
and you might, I feel really raspy right now at this talk that I've made.

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.760
But like, I'll just all of a sudden, I'll be like talking, and like, ah, tickle, I have

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:34.480
to cough, and it hasn't gone away, and I really wish it would go away, because it's annoying.

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:38.000
I hope it's not strep throat, because then that means I have to have my tonsils out.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I haven't had that happen yet.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:45.120
I like to keep all my body parts intact, even the unnecessary ones.

02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:50.520
They are necessary, they do serve a purpose until they get infected.

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:54.280
You know, I still have everything I was born with except for my wisdom teeth.

02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.280
Lucky you.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.280
I'm missing a gallbladder, I'm missing wisdom teeth, anyway.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:03.320
Uh, moving on, um, my F.U. of the week goes to, believe it or not, this is going to shock

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:04.320
you.

02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:05.320
Disneyland.

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:09.400
Yep, Disneyland on Wednesday was a fucking hot mess, oh my gosh.

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:13.040
I guess all those people were there for the Cars Land preview, the cast members, and that

02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:16.440
must have been all the veteran cast members, because the noobs were running the place.

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.080
And uh, yeah, just, just so crowded, especially for a Wednesday.

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:25.560
And I get that it's summer, but I've gone E3 week the last like three years, and I've

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:27.560
never had an experience as terrible as last week.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:29.240
Like, every other year's been relatively good.

02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.240
Okay, Rob.

02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:31.240
I don't know, because I didn't get to go.

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:33.940
Tell me, how bad did the Mad Tea Party blow?

02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:37.480
I think it wasn't running weeknights, but I did see the decorations.

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:40.560
The decorations looked great, they spent a lot of money on them, which kind of pissed

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:41.560
me off.

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:46.240
My friends were there this past weekend, they said it was the worst thing to ever happen.

02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:47.240
That's too bad.

02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:48.240
Yeah.

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:51.000
It was basically, what did you call it, the Mad Suck Party or something?

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
The Mad Flop Party.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:53.000
That was the Mad Flop Party.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.640
I like to call it the Mad Flop Party.

02:30:54.640 --> 02:31:00.800
Um, but yeah, the one thing that bugged me most of all is that Disney don't, don't give

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:04.620
celebrities the royal treatment and shut down the entire fucking ride just because one celebrity

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:05.620
wants to ride it.

02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:09.420
They need to, I'm not saying, look, I get if you want to have the little ushers, bring

02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:12.600
them up the exit and give them a little bit of special treatment, but you don't stop the

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:14.480
entire fucking ride because the celebrity's on it.

02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:15.480
I don't care.

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:17.080
I don't care if it's Barack Obama.

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:18.080
I don't care who it is.

02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:19.140
That is kind of lame.

02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:21.080
You don't stop for everybody else.

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:22.760
Who was a celebrity?

02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:25.240
Uh, David Beckham and his wife Posh Spice.

02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:26.240
Lame.

02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:32.960
Yeah, they could do it at least for like a real celebrity like Neil Patrick Harris.

02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.800
Anyhow that just kind of ticked me off.

02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:39.900
So meanwhile, let's get back into, I know, I know, I, I, I, I just did not have a good

02:31:39.900 --> 02:31:42.760
experience on Wednesday and that ticked me off cause it was like extra for Matt's first

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.940
experience at Disneyland and they enjoyed themselves cause we had a really good time

02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:46.940
on Monday.

02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:50.160
It wasn't nearly as bad and we got to fit in a lot of the good stuff, but Wednesday

02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:53.480
was, was a mess.

02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:55.800
I could go on and on, but I won't.

02:31:55.800 --> 02:32:00.960
So meanwhile, Loki, let's get back into the gaming news, uh, uh, Twitter topics, a few,

02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:03.160
and then Skypline most of all in a little bit.

02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:07.640
So one of the rumors that we were supposed to get out of E3 was that one of these, um,

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:11.700
streaming companies is supposed to be partner of a console, but they didn't see that.

02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:15.040
No OnLive or no, uh, Gaikai teaming up with consoles.

02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:22.040
But OnLive did say that they are going to be teaming up with smart TV, um, manufacturers

02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:27.640
including LG smart TVs with Google TV and internet browsers as well.

02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:33.920
Um, they're going to be allowing the online service to be used in browser, um, which is

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:34.920
kind of neat.

02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:39.640
And of course if you have a, one of those smart TVs, you can download an app that will

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:44.320
allow you to stream stuff and then you just have to buy the controller as well.

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:46.960
Um, that's kind of neat.

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:53.000
I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen smart TVs, you know, take off yet, but I mean, I'm

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.720
sure in the future we're going to see that.

02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:56.960
I mean, everything's fucking connected to the internet now.

02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:59.840
So pretty cool.

02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:04.960
And of course when the games are showing on there's Borderlands, it looks sexy, of course.

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:09.460
Um, some other little details about the Wii U is some actually really good news because

02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:13.420
Nintendo could have made the bad decision here, but they made the good decision.

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:16.640
So we need to, you know, I know we've been giving Nintendo a little bit of a hard time

02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:21.000
tonight, but we need to applaud this decision and that is that Nintendo is working on the

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.360
system to figure out how Wii owners are going to transfer their content to the Wii U.

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:33.120
Designer Katsuya Iguchi said, uh, we are readying the system, yes, to transfer saves and everything

02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.520
you've bought.

02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:38.120
So the good news is if you bought virtual console stuff and WiiWare stuff, they're going

02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:41.360
to transfer over to the Wii U and it doesn't sound like they're going to charge you more

02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.360
for it or try to sell it to you again.

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:44.360
Yay.

02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:46.960
Oh, that's good.

02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:48.080
That is very good.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.080
Have a cookie, Nintendo.

02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:53.300
I wonder if it's being done with the friend code for the, cause that'll be tied to the

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:54.300
console.

02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.300
Who knows?

02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:56.300
Who knows?

02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:59.360
Now, while there's good news, we have to of course follow that up with a little bit of

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:00.360
WTF news.

02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:06.960
Uh, that whole Miiverse thing, it came out after the, uh, show that Miiverse, which will

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:08.880
allow you to kind of like post messages.

02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:11.920
It's kind of like the Nintendo social network, I guess, for lack of a better term.

02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:16.320
Uh, Satoru Iwata said there will be filtering on the Miiverse content.

02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.880
The first will be automatic content filtering.

02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.480
So if you post something that's like, fuck you and your fucking dog, it's going to hit

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:25.960
that filter cause it says the F word and won't post.

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:34.000
However, the second, there will be a moderator reading all posts before they're published.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.520
That seems crazy, but yes, live people will be screening all the messages and they say

02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.680
it may take about 30 minutes between the time you post something and the time it's actually

02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:45.640
visible because of that delay.

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.600
Lastly, users can also flag if something is missed, which we know will happen at some

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:50.600
point.

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:51.600
That's lame.

02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:52.600
That is extreme.

02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:58.140
I mean, I get, I get that, you know, it's kind of like a forum so you can post stuff

02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:00.440
and there should be moderators for that stuff.

02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:02.040
That's fine.

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:08.260
I have a problem with them going all 1984 and just let's monitor every single thing.

02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:13.920
And also being an adult owning a console, I don't give a fuck if the word fuck is in,

02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:14.920
you know, something.

02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:15.920
If they're like, fuck this boss.

02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:16.920
I hate it.

02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:18.600
I fucking died nine times.

02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:19.600
That's acceptable to me.

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:20.880
I'm not a fucking little child.

02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:24.560
I don't need to be, Oh, let's start.

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:25.620
Little children will be using it.

02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:26.620
I understand that.

02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:27.620
But you know what?

02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:33.420
They have, they have wonderful parental technology, you know, that you can block this stuff so

02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:36.720
you can put content filtering for those age groups.

02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:38.800
They'll figure out how to override by themselves.

02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.600
Well then you gotta be smart and fucking that maybe, well maybe this system will get overridden

02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:44.600
too.

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:46.920
I, I want to be able to go post and Loki's me verse.

02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:47.920
Fuck you.

02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:48.920
You fucking fuck.

02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:52.320
That should, that should be, that's what X-Box is for.

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:53.320
Rob.

02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:55.360
No, that's for saying far worse words.

02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:56.360
Go ahead.

02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:57.360
Frisbee.

02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:58.360
Everyone learned lead.

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:02.320
Um, by the way, probably moderators will know a little tangent here.

02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:05.160
What about FIFA, FIFA and the whole connect thing.

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:09.720
If you fucking swear, you get, you get flagged by the shit is funny.

02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:10.720
I'm sorry.

02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.720
That is funny.

02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:12.720
I know.

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:13.720
Yeah.

02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:14.720
That's funny.

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.560
Like the, to me, the whole fact that the connect will pick it up if you're saying like, fuck

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:19.400
you flag.

02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:20.400
That's funny.

02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.040
If you don't like it, unplug the connect.

02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:27.080
But if they have that technology, why don't we apply it to the goddamn X-Box service?

02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.920
That's a little too big brother.

02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.980
And if I want to say like, if we're playing mass effect online and I want to be like this

02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:37.880
fucking Banshee bitch can S my D, you know, then I should be able to say I should be able

02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:38.880
to swear on my TV.

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.120
But then again, here's the thing is that if I were to ever play FIFA, which is not going

02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:46.840
to happen, I'm not going to fucking use connect.

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:48.120
Fuck that shit.

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:50.360
All right.

02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:56.580
That's my, we, you news, uh, Esperanto.

02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:57.580
You know what?

02:36:57.580 --> 02:36:59.080
Actually, that's a great idea.

02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:02.900
You know what, the average person actually can look at a page written in Esperanto and

02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:06.580
figure out what it says because that's the purpose of the language.

02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:10.240
Anyone who knows any little bit of Latin, which just about every English speaker does

02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.840
know a little bit of Latin and Greek is part of the basis of our language and the romance

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:15.840
languages.

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:18.040
No Esperanto.

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:20.560
I've read a page in Esperanto and I've never learned it.

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:21.560
How do I say fuck you?

02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.160
You fucking fucking Esperanto Frick year.

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:25.160
I don't know.

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.880
I'm going to look it up actually.

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:29.160
Well, read a story first.

02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:34.960
Oh yeah, that, um, is being bitches.

02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:36.720
That's my official title of this.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:43.480
They're not going to copy steam 75% off sales because they think it cheapens the IP and

02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.040
they don't want to copy that practice.

02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:51.040
Um, there's a quote from David Demartini, the origin boss.

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.760
Um, obviously they think it's the right thing to do after a certain amount of time.

02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.000
I think it, I just think it cheapens your intellectual property.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.480
Um, honestly, steam is successful.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:08.880
It clearly works and people are still forking out the money to buy the games.

02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:13.240
So what about it is cheapening the IP if it's bringing it to a wider audience?

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.520
And it's not like steam's just going, okay, we're going to charge less for your game.

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:17.520
They're good.

02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:20.880
They're coordinating with these different developers and publishers and saying, okay,

02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:26.480
hey, we want to mark it down to drive up some, you know, business and you drive up some sales

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.640
for you guys as well as maybe bringing a little bit of, you know, exposure to your product

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.400
and then EA saying, ah, fuck it.

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:34.400
We don't care.

02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:35.920
You know, well, you know what?

02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:37.600
No one has to purchase stuff through origin.

02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:40.160
Just saying, you know, there are other services out there.

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:43.720
So if you don't want to put your stuff on sale, then fine.

02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:44.720
Someone else will.

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:49.040
Well, and here's another thing that he's saying is what steam does might be teaching the customer.

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:52.880
I might not want it in the first month, but if I look at it in four or five months, I'll

02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:56.320
get one of those weekend sales and I'll buy it at that time at 75% off.

02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:01.920
What he's not realizing is that people who are into the game will buy it when it comes

02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:02.920
out.

02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:05.000
They don't care about waiting for a sale.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.120
They'll get it when it comes out.

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:11.360
You know, when portal two came out, now true, I didn't buy it for myself cause I knew I

02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:16.720
was getting it for Christmas slash Hanukkah slash Kwanzaa slash Festivus, whatever, which

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:17.720
I did.

02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.360
Um, but I was all hot and bothered to buy it when it came out.

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.360
You know, so I've bought, like I bought fractal when it came out, you know, I've bought tons

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:31.060
of games when they've come out, even though I knew, like for example, okay, here, here's

02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:32.560
a good example.

02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:38.860
Um, Marvel versus Capcom three or no, um, not Marvel versus, yeah, I bought it right

02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:39.860
when it came out.

02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:41.200
Well, Dan bought it right when it came out.

02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.860
As soon as ultimate Marvel and we knew ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three would be out and

02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:45.860
guess what?

02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:46.860
We bought that too.

02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:49.520
It just, if someone wants it, they don't care.

02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:50.520
They're going to go get it.

02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:53.920
The sheer amount of games I've purchased on steam, well, mostly through the Humblelandy

02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:59.600
bundles, but I have not played most of them and I have a lot of people, you know, my coworkers

02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:03.920
and stuff that buy stuff on steam that say, yeah, I'll see this game for like five bucks.

02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:07.960
I'm like, fuck, I'm going to pick that up because I may play it eventually.

02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:14.680
So there's a lot of really quick, um, just spontaneous purchases because of these sales.

02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.160
And I think it's, you know, sure.

02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:23.920
Keep your game at $20, you know, and someone may pick it up or drop the $5 and the check

02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:24.920
stand purchase.

02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:25.920
Yeah.

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:28.680
It's, you know, when you're in line at the grocery store and go, Oh man, I love Twix

02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:29.680
two for a buck.

02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:32.760
And it's usually a lot of these independent games that most people aren't like aware of

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.760
that.

02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:34.760
Oh, I sense all.

02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:35.760
Yeah, sure.

02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:39.440
I'll try it for, if it's a buck, you know, if it sucks, whatever I paid five bucks for

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:44.360
a game, just, you know, like I've played the binding of Isaac for like five minutes, which

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:46.600
was another game I played this week.

02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:47.600
Oops.

02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:48.720
Um, but you know, it's good.

02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.680
It's something I can go back, you know, if I'm feeling kind of bored, I don't have anything

02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:56.820
to do, then I can go in and play cave story, which I, you know, bought on the hundle indie

02:40:56.820 --> 02:40:59.180
bundle before too.

02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:07.600
So it's, he's not, he's using a business, the business mentality and not real world

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:08.600
common sense.

02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:14.120
Well, at the end of story, origin is not as big of a deal as steam is at the end of the

02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:15.120
day.

02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:16.700
What brought people into steam?

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:17.700
Those sales.

02:41:17.700 --> 02:41:18.700
Duh.

02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:23.680
Well, and here's another thing that he says, um, we don't believe in the drop it down,

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:27.440
spring it up 75% off approach, which is not necessarily what steam is doing.

02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:32.040
Um, but we've got something else that we do believe in that we'll be rolling out.

02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:35.880
I don't know what that is and honestly I don't care because I'm only going to ever play one

02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:36.880
game on origin.

02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:41.120
If I have to buy 10 get one free and they're stupid anyways because they're like, Oh, we

02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.660
don't believe in marking stuff down and bringing it back up and price clearly don't believe

02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:45.660
in making money.

02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:52.160
Well, apparently you're, you didn't have no idea what your, you know, iOS team is doing

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.560
because there's a lot of EA games that go down the 99 cents when those properties are

02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.240
like $7 or whatever.

02:41:58.240 --> 02:41:59.240
Well said.

02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:05.200
Well, so it's like, I mean, Hey, you, you're talking this talk right here, but at the same

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.680
time you're doing something completely different in this platform.

02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:08.680
So you know why?

02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:09.680
Who gives a fuck?

02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:12.480
What do you want to do and you know, people hate it and then they'll just won't go to

02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:13.480
your service.

02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:18.020
You'll eventually fold if it doesn't work for you that whatever your plan is, that's

02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.020
the way it is.

02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:20.020
All right.

02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:21.020
Two more stories.

02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:22.020
And then the Skypline Loki.

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:27.280
So there's a new app that's going to be coming to Xbox, um, pretty soon.

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.640
And it's the Virgin gaming app.

02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:33.980
And what the Virgin gaming app is going to do is it's going to run a tournament service.

02:42:33.980 --> 02:42:39.980
And so you can, um, launch into a bunch of different Xbox live tournaments, including,

02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:44.600
and this of course is, you know, with, uh, Xbox gold.

02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:47.640
Um, apparently you can, uh, enter different tournaments.

02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:52.880
Some are free, some are with a paid entry and you can compete in a variety of different

02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:54.960
games, um, through their service.

02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.400
I think they actually do this right now through their website, um, Virgin gaming.

02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:05.180
But I guess right now they're going to be partnering with EA sports, 2k sports and Ubisoft,

02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:09.200
and they're going to have different, like, you know, matchmaking, um, stuff.

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:19.800
And also, I don't know, some, uh, different services was it pay to have pays to have game

02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:22.080
as their tagline for Virgin gaming.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.000
It'll be interesting to see what it is.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.400
I'm curious on how that's really going to work and, um, you know, how we can leverage

02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:32.980
it to have tournaments for OLR and VOG network and so forth.

02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:33.980
But, uh, we'll see.

02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:34.980
Too bad.

02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:38.420
Too bad they didn't do this shit back in the day when Grand Theft Auto wasn't modded the

02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:43.720
fucking hell because I kicked a lot of ass in vanilla Grand Theft Auto and episodes from

02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:44.720
Liberty City.

02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:46.280
Well, there's always Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:47.280
There is.

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.120
I will fucking own that shit again.

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:50.620
I am ready.

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:51.620
Your body is ready.

02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:55.720
I need, I need to play Max Payne 3 because that's supposed to be pretty awesome, but

02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.760
Grand Theft Auto 5, I will dedicate my life to that game.

02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:00.760
Alright, let's move on to one last story here.

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.400
I want to end on a good note with the stories tonight and this is a great note.

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:07.320
And, uh, you know, we talked a little bit last week about, you know, Curt Schilling's

02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:11.920
studio and all the closures and all that, but a big, huge games, one of the studios

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:18.320
that was, uh, closed in that whole 38 Studios, uh, debacle from a couple weeks ago has basically

02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:21.960
been gobbled up by Epic Games.

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:25.820
And this is good news because Epic Games is going to open a brand new studio called Epic

02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:30.000
Baltimore and it's made up of the folks from Big Huge Games.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
I think that's quite awesome that basically, um, they, they've helped them find jobs.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.660
Of course, not everybody's going to go cause some people might, you know, decide to do

02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:40.800
something else, but most of them sounds like you're going over to this.

02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.320
The official quote on this from Epic Games President Michael Capps quote, on Wednesday,

02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:51.000
the ex, uh, BHG, Big Huge Games leadership game leadership team contacted us.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.600
They wanted to start a new company and keep together some of the key talent displaced

02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:59.300
by the layoff and hope that they could use an Epic IP as a starting point for a new game.

02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:02.900
We love that they all wanted to keep working together, but it was pretty clear they'd have

02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:07.520
trouble building a demo and securing funding before their personal savings ran out.

02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:08.640
So there they go.

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.700
They are going to be working on a big IP.

02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:12.040
Who knows what it is?

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:18.120
It won't be reckoning to though, unless Epic ends up buying that IP because I believe the

02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.080
state of Maryland owns that now or Rhode Island, excuse me, also their thing was, is we make

02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:24.080
IP.

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:27.080
We don't buy IP, so they're not going to buy the IP.

02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:33.000
Uh, Blackwell ventures a guest that Epic Baltimore could be making infinity blade for consoles.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:38.000
That is a pretty big, uh, Epic IP that, you know, wouldn't surprise me.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:43.720
You know what would fit down, uh, fit right with, um, Epic in that it's something that

02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:47.760
kind of got canceled a long time ago, even though it looked really awesome.

02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:50.120
Project offset would have been fucking amazing.

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:54.440
It was that first person, like fantasy RPG game that was like a first person shooter

02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.560
almost, but like with giant dragons and shit, it looked really amazing.

02:45:58.560 --> 02:45:59.560
That would be cool.

02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:05.120
Like a project offset game, but developed by Epic, like an RPG fantasy game, but like

02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.040
Gears of War, I guess.

02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:08.280
Let's open up the Skype line.

02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:13.200
It is open one eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.240
Certainly you have something to say about the news tonight, so give us a call and we

02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:20.280
will talk E3 or whatever it is that's on your mind tonight.

02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:24.360
In the meantime, um, quickly, let's try to fit in a couple of last minute stories here.

02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.360
Loki.

02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:29.360
Um, so yes, let's, uh, I don't have anything pulled up again.

02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:30.360
Oh, you don't?

02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:31.360
That's all right.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:32.360
I can go to Twitter.

02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.360
All right, let me go to Twitter real quick.

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:37.840
Let me bring it up cause I wasn't prepared for that either.

02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:38.840
That's okay.

02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:39.840
All right.

02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:43.320
We do have some tweets at twitter.com slash O L R. Oh, and how convenient.

02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:44.800
Skypline's already going off.

02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:48.640
Now you have some time to pull up the other stuff higher on orange house radio.

02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:49.640
Who's this?

02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:50.640
It's Shane.

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:51.640
Hey, hey, hey Shane.

02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:52.760
How you doing?

02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:56.260
I'm tired and hungry and grouchy.

02:46:56.260 --> 02:46:57.260
Why are you grouchy?

02:46:57.260 --> 02:46:59.720
Cause I can't eat or drink anything.

02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:02.000
So are you supposed to be fasting for something?

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:03.800
No, I have surgery tomorrow.

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:06.160
So I'm not supposed to eat or drink.

02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:07.400
So you're fasting for something.

02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:08.400
I guess.

02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:09.400
Okay, fine.

02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:10.400
Yeah.

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:12.400
But not a good reason.

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:18.560
Well, good luck with all of that stuff and can't wait to talk to you when you're on drugs.

02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.680
I know that will be why you should tune into Horde house on Tuesday, which by the way gets

02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:25.840
it's, well, they, they don't hear it on Tuesday.

02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.600
They hear it on Wednesday, Wednesday live, not live.

02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:30.600
Damn it.

02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:32.040
It's new for us.

02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:37.720
Should I just hang up and we could start this over premiered at vog network.com on Warcraft

02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:40.280
Wednesdays and then on the podcast feed Wednesday night.

02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:41.280
All right.

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:42.560
Anyhow, they don't need to know it's tape Tuesdays.

02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:43.560
All right.

02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:44.840
So Shane, what are you talking about?

02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:46.040
It's not taped on Tuesday.

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:47.040
That's right.

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.400
It's taped really quickly.

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:49.400
Live.

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.400
All right.

02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:55.100
Shane's been playing guru for me in private messages for Mass Effect so that I actually

02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:59.020
will not go to Noveria first.

02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:00.020
It's what I do.

02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:01.020
All right.

02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:02.020
You do too.

02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:03.160
What did you want to call on the show about tonight?

02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:04.160
Shane?

02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:05.160
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:06.160
No, wait.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:07.160
I don't want to hear what you have to say.

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.160
I want to talk about your corgi.

02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:10.160
I want to talk about your corgi.

02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:11.160
Yes.

02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:14.140
My corgi that I will have this weekend.

02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:16.220
So he's not your corgi yet.

02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:17.760
He's my corgi.

02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:19.720
You put a deposit down on the corgi.

02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:20.720
Yes.

02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.120
Because that specific one that I showed you a picture of the corgi can exactly help you

02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:26.120
recover from surgery.

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:29.760
In fact, that might make things worse.

02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:30.760
Hopefully but I don't care.

02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.280
I'm going to share with everyone what I shared with Shane earlier.

02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:34.280
What?

02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:35.280
You know what corgi means?

02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:36.840
Sheepdog in Welsh.

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:37.840
So you're getting a sheep.

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:38.840
Wait a minute.

02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:39.840
But you're afraid of sheep.

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:41.680
Then it will run it away clearly.

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:44.600
That's what sheepdogs before they heard sheep.

02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:45.600
Away from me.

02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:46.600
Yes.

02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:47.600
All right.

02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:48.600
Fair enough.

02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:49.600
All right.

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:50.600
What?

02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:51.600
Okay.

02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:52.600
Now I'll hear what you have to say.

02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:53.600
What did you, what did you really want to call in about tonight?

02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.240
I just wanted to gloat because clearly I won that list list from a couple of weeks ago.

02:48:58.240 --> 02:48:59.240
What makes you say that?

02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:02.200
It's a segment of the show where we come up with a definitive list.

02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:03.200
Yes.

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:04.200
Yeah.

02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:09.360
And we had to say what we wanted on Wii U and of everything we all said, me talking

02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:13.280
about Mass Effect was the only thing that came true.

02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:15.640
Well congratulations, Shane.

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:17.920
You get a no prize.

02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:18.920
Yeah.

02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:19.920
You get a new version of Mass Effect.

02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:20.920
I know.

02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:24.120
Shane can have a raspberry.

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:28.520
I can someday give you a free piece of loot on voggenetwork.com.

02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:29.520
How's that sound?

02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:30.520
No.

02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:31.520
I want something worth something.

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:32.520
Hey now.

02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:36.880
Hey now don't devalue the loot at voggenetwork.com.

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:41.160
I can't sell it or make money off of it.

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:46.360
You can soon post it on your profile like you're supposed to be able to do in home.

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:47.360
What have a profile?

02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:48.360
Yeah.

02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:52.360
You can have one night alone with Kayden.

02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:53.360
How about that?

02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:57.640
I don't know.

02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:04.080
You're like, just one.

02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:10.100
What if they decide in Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U, they're just going to not have Kayden

02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:12.960
in it because they're just going to say, you know what, we're going to just go with this

02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:14.840
storyline from the first game.

02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:18.840
What if, because it's on Nintendo console, they cut out all the sex scenes?

02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:24.520
Oh, oh, I don't know if I could get it then.

02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:27.320
I'm still waiting for the Garrisnookie, so.

02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:29.280
You have to wait till, well I should just go.

02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:30.280
I know.

02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:31.280
It's in the second one.

02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:32.280
I know.

02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:33.280
All right.

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:36.680
So in the first one I've decided that I am going to bang the hell out of Kayden.

02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:38.240
Just out of support for Shayne.

02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:39.240
Good.

02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:40.240
Thank you.

02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.240
What?

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:42.240
That's the right way to play the game.

02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:43.240
Because Ashley's a bitch.

02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:44.240
Yes.

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:45.240
Oh, I've taught you well.

02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:46.240
I don't like her.

02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:53.320
I like Tali, but she's kind of dumb.

02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:59.440
The other thing I was calling in about, because I care, so other people should care.

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:04.980
The new DJ Maxx game on Vita, while it doesn't have a release date, I guess Pentavision confirmed

02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:08.760
that there will be a collector's edition in America.

02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:14.960
And they announced three of the licenses already, which are just songs from the previous games.

02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:18.600
But it's still something important because we actually get a real honest to goodness

02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:20.600
K-pop license.

02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:21.600
That's cool.

02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:26.760
What bands are we expecting to see under the...

02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:32.460
Right now we've only got a K-pop group called Cara, I don't know how to say it, with their

02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:34.800
song Step from Technica.

02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:41.120
And then a guy named Mr. Funky, who does a lot of music for the later DJ Maxx games with

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:47.740
Rockstar and Signalize by Paul Bazuka, who again does a lot of music for the later games.

02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:51.240
But what's interesting is that I don't know where Step is from.

02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:57.400
I know it's from a Technica game, but Rockstar and Signalize are both from the latest Technica

02:51:57.400 --> 02:51:59.560
game that came out, Technica 3.

02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:05.880
So we might see more transplants from current music instead of stuff from way back when.

02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:09.000
And that makes me happy.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.120
That sounds like it would be worthy, I believe.

02:52:12.120 --> 02:52:13.120
Yes.

02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:16.840
I just need to know how many hundreds of dollars I'm going to spend on this collector's edition,

02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:18.680
because that will happen.

02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:23.200
It'll probably only be like $10 or $20 more than retail.

02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:24.200
Yeah, probably.

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:28.080
And it won't come with anything that's worth anything, like they haven't in a while.

02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:36.280
I used to get awesome puzzles and face masks, and in the last one I got a CD and a crappy

02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:37.440
book.

02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:40.200
So it might not actually be worth it, I'll just download the game instead.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:43.960
All right, Shane, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls.

02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:45.280
Whatever, that's fine.

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:47.360
All right, talk to you later in the week.

02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:48.360
Okay.

02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:49.360
Happy surgery.

02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:50.360
Thank you.

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:51.360
Bye.

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:52.360
Bye.

02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:55.960
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:56.960
Sorry about that, guys.

02:52:56.960 --> 02:52:59.800
We just had Bugmageddon here in the studio.

02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:01.760
I don't know why, like tons of bugs.

02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:03.720
They just love the light.

02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:07.960
And Alan's trying to do laundry outside and had to run in, and all the bugs followed him.

02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:08.960
It's gross.

02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:09.960
Raid everywhere.

02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:15.160
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:17.040
Are you ready for last minute stories now, Loki?

02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:18.440
You just have one thing.

02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:19.440
All right, that's fine.

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:20.440
I'll go to tweets after that.

02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:21.440
All right.

02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:26.440
So there is a new Kickstarter for a sword fighting game called Klang.

02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:30.680
And you know, it's always good to have a good video to, you know, get people interested

02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:32.400
about your property.

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:36.520
Well, they got Gabe Newell in there.

02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:41.860
Apparently, he is quite handy with blacksmithing.

02:53:41.860 --> 02:53:45.840
And so of course, he was in there to poke fun at the fact that Half-Life 3 is not out

02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:47.400
and he was a jerk.

02:53:47.400 --> 02:53:49.120
He was forging a new crowbar.

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:50.120
All right.

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:51.120
Let me go to the phones.

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:52.120
We had another call on the line.

02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:53.120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:54.120
Who's this?

02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:56.120
Chugga chugga choo choo, motherfuckers.

02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:57.120
It's Jim Sally.

02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:58.120
Hey, hey.

02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:00.080
Hey, and you can say that word on this show.

02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:01.080
I'm sorry.

02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.080
You know that, right, man?

02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:06.040
I'm so sick of being held back on Bobby's show.

02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:08.880
Hey, he's just taking the Nintendo approach.

02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:09.880
It's all right.

02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:10.880
Oh, fuck.

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:11.880
I love this.

02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:14.880
You guys, I love this new Nintendo approach with moderating everyone's shit.

02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:19.880
I don't, I don't, listen, I know most people are complaining about this bullshit that they're

02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:22.360
going to monitor everything before you post it up or whatever.

02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:24.720
I'm thinking cha-ching, cha-ching, motherfuckers.

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:25.960
I just sent my resume off.

02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:29.800
I could, I could probably weed through that shit at home all day.

02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:35.000
Maybe there will actually be some type of like Nintendo reality show where people audition

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.080
to be one of the moderators and they'll call it The Moderator.

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:40.640
Oh, that's a genius idea.

02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:42.200
And it'll be on the Nintendo network.

02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:46.400
It sounds like, it sounds like something a Japanese company would do for sure.

02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:47.400
And you could compete.

02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:49.160
Fucking right I can.

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:51.640
I mean, friggin' right I can.

02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:52.640
All right.

02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:55.920
So what, no, really, what are your thoughts on E3 this week, Jim Salley?

02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:58.040
It was all next to nothing.

02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:02.360
Like, every time I watch E3, I'm just, I don't want to say I'm depressed afterwards, but

02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:05.960
like, I feel like I was let down the last couple of years.

02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:08.320
You wouldn't say you're depressed because you look for the cyanide?

02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:11.480
No, I didn't, no, I didn't make the Kool-Aid.

02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:15.760
I didn't make Kool-Aid with Vocky in it, because I thought we were going to get some crazy

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:19.960
shit to see, but nope, we didn't get nothing.

02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:22.600
Wii U is pretty weird though, it's strange.

02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:25.080
What about the stuff that everybody's going crazy about?

02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:28.160
What about the Watch Dogs and the Beyond Two Swords?

02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:35.080
Ah, that's all garbage to Jim Salley, listen, if it's not, if it's not Halo 4, it's everything

02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:36.080
else.

02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:37.080
That's all I'm going to say.

02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:38.720
So you're a Halo 4 fan?

02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:40.400
Who doesn't love, who isn't a Halo game?

02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.040
Who doesn't love Halo?

02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:48.840
Well, I have fallen out of love with Halo a bit since all the stuff after 3, but I will

02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:51.760
say Halo 4 looks pretty darn interesting.

02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:54.840
What do you think kind of about the different look, it has kind of a different look to it,

02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:56.560
what do you think of it?

02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.920
I think it's about time we changed it up a little bit anyway, I was getting kind of drab

02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.360
before, almost like redundant before, so we're not changing up a little bit.

02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:10.200
I'm really concerned though with the online, I wonder how well they'll do, because Bungie

02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:11.200
kind of babied us.

02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.200
They did it right for a long time.

02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:16.280
So do you think the change in studio was a good thing?

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.520
Ah, yeah, because to be honest with you, I don't think Bungie could keep it up, they

02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.600
said it themselves, that they were getting kind of sick of, not honestly sick, but they

02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:29.080
were getting kind of bored with doing Halo, right, and if they're not going to have that

02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:33.440
same drive to build the great Halos like they did in the past, then it is time to pass the

02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:36.000
torch on to someone new.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.400
And I can agree with that, I mean, especially, it actually has to do with I think anything

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.400
that one is working on, if you don't have the enthusiasm, it's going to show in the

02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:44.400
end product.

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:49.280
Exactly, right, which is why we see a lot of Obsidian games, when they're just, they

02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:52.160
know they're only getting the sequel, right, they just pump it out as quick as they can,

02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:55.040
because they just need to get their money and they want to be done with it, they don't

02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:57.040
care, they want to move on.

02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:58.040
Yeah.

02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:00.840
It's sad, it was an error though, man.

02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.560
So what else does the Jim Sally train want to share with us tonight here on OLR?

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:06.520
Is Loki there, or is he eating pizza right now?

02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:07.520
I'm right here.

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:13.560
Listen, I'm really ashamed of myself, I'm going to admit this to you, but I've been

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:20.680
at the very last mission of Grand Theft Auto IV for about a year, and I can't fly a fucking

02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:22.280
helicopter to save my life.

02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:25.200
That's alright, their controls are kind of terrible.

02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:28.920
Is there like a cheat though, or something I can do, like, it's got to be some sort of

02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:29.920
a cheat.

02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:31.280
To control the helicopter better?

02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:35.920
I don't know, like a helicopter doesn't die mode or something?

02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:42.760
Well you can put in your god mode code and just bring up your phone, and then when you

02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:51.800
have the phone up, you can just keep hitting the health, it's the GTA555-0100 is the number,

02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:56.320
and then basically you just keep hitting that and you'll keep replenishing the health on

02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:57.880
the helicopter.

02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:06.240
Really though, it's difficult to keep shooting down the bad guy in the game.

02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:10.360
So really my best bet is to go get a kid from the elementary school to come over and just

02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:11.360
do it for me?

02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:18.680
Yeah, you could do that, or I mean, you can hack it even further, but it's probably just

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:22.520
easier just to use that cheat code if that's the way you want to go.

02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:24.520
But I have to type that in as I'm falling to my death?

02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:28.680
No, no, you just type it into your phone beforehand so you have that cheat up, and then you bring

02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:33.720
it up on your cheats menu in the phone, and then you can just keep hitting A over and

02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:39.800
over or X or whatever, and each time you hit it, it'll recover the health in your helicopter,

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:45.600
or you can just wait until your helicopter starts smoking or whatever, and it'll replenish

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:49.640
the health on the helicopter.

02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:53.720
You're my best friend, Loki.

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:54.720
There you go.

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:57.720
Friends are made, and now you have something to do right after the show.

02:58:57.720 --> 02:58:58.720
Right after the show, baby!

02:58:58.720 --> 02:58:59.720
It's time to go finish.

02:58:59.720 --> 02:59:00.720
GTA 5-5-5!

02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:01.720
All right.

02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:05.320
Jim, Sally, I gotta let you go so we can get into some more calls, but thanks so much for

02:59:05.320 --> 02:59:06.320
stopping in tonight.

02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:07.320
Okay, man.

02:59:07.320 --> 02:59:09.520
I just want to dedicate this call to my buddy Birdman.

02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:13.120
Listen, Bird, if you've been drinking too much and I gotta call your brother to come

02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:17.960
over and take you home at the party, then maybe you've had too many beers, Birdy, or

02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:19.520
not enough.

02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:20.520
And don't drink and drive, ever.

02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:21.520
Don't drink and drive.

02:59:21.520 --> 02:59:22.520
That's why I called your brother.

02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:24.120
You drunk fuck, Bird.

02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:25.120
Jesus Christ, man.

02:59:25.120 --> 02:59:26.120
All right, Birdman.

02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:28.520
Don't drive your car to my house and drink a six-pack of beers.

02:59:28.520 --> 02:59:29.520
Get the fuck out of here, Bird.

02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:30.520
Go with your brother.

02:59:30.520 --> 02:59:31.520
I love you, Sky.

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:32.520
All right.

02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:33.520
Love you, too.

02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:34.520
Take care.

02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:35.520
All right, thanks.

02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:36.520
Thanks, Loki.

02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:37.520
No problem.

02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:38.520
Oh, I see how it is.

02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:42.520
I was gonna say bye, Darkie, but I guess not now.

02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:43.520
Aww.

02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:44.520
Heart.

02:59:44.520 --> 02:59:45.520
Bye, sweet Darkie.

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:46.520
Heart face.

02:59:46.520 --> 02:59:47.520
Little bum.

02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:48.520
I made the little bum thing for you.

02:59:48.520 --> 02:59:49.520
Making duck face.

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:50.520
With the three.

02:59:50.520 --> 02:59:51.520
With the number three.

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:52.520
I'm hanging up now.

02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:53.520
Bye, Jim Sally.

02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:59.520
Everybody look at my bum.

02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:01.520
That was a great note to end on.

03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:02.520
1-877-GAME-OLR.

03:00:02.520 --> 03:00:07.120
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:10.520
If you think you can follow that call, good luck to you.

03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:15.020
Meanwhile, I'm gonna try to do Twitter topics here.

03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:18.520
Every time I've done it, though, I've been derailed, though, but we'll go to a couple

03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:19.520
tweets here.

03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:27.520
TigerClaw305 sent us a tweet about Nexon pays $685 million for 14.7% of NCSoft.

03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:28.520
NCSoft.

03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:30.520
They've made games like Guild Wars.

03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:31.520
I know it's one of their big titles.

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.520
Ion.

03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:34.520
They've done a couple other MMOs as well.

03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.520
They are now the largest shareholder in NCSoft.

03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:40.520
So, there you go.

03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:41.520
Very cool.

03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:46.520
That's part of a two-year agreement between these two South Korean gaming companies.

03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:51.520
So, we'll see what is born of that partnership later on.

03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:58.520
TigerClaw sent us another tweet about Kojima seeing social and core games converging together.

03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:01.520
And this is kind of some of what you saw in some of Nintendo's presentation.

03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:03.520
That's what Kojima said.

03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:06.520
In an interview with CVG, he said, quote,

03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:09.520
I don't think social and core games are separate.

03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:14.520
Both will evolve together, and at some point, I feel the social side of things will converge

03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:15.520
with the core gamers.

03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:21.520
I think in the future, maybe Metal Gear will change in certain ways to integrate social aspects.

03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:25.520
If you look at other games on the market now, you can see it's already happening.

03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:28.520
So, Metal Gear may at some point get involved.

03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:30.520
How do you guys feel about that?

03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:34.520
Do you think he's onto something there, or do you think maybe too far?

03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:36.520
Casual Metal Gear game?

03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:38.520
Yeah, I don't know about that.

03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:40.520
That's very interesting.

03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:48.520
I mean, I thought what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network did was already kind of social,

03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:51.520
and not that it's always showing the best parts of society.

03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:54.520
But, you know, I kind of thought that was the social gaming.

03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.520
Because what used to be social gaming arcades.

03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:01.520
And look what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network has done to arcades.

03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:03.520
I don't know.

03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:07.520
I don't think, I mean, when I hear this, I think Facebook games.

03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:10.520
And there's very few Facebook games I get excited about.

03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:11.520
Very, very few.

03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:14.520
Although, I will say, you don't know Jack is pretty fucking awesome on Facebook.

03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:16.520
Just saying.

03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:18.520
Hmm.

03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:20.520
I've derailed the chat room, and this is epic.

03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:23.520
We're talking about Filipino food now.

03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:28.520
One more call, or one more, time for one more call, and I'll get to one more tweet here.

03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:33.520
1877 game OLR again, or a username on Skype is orangeonsradiolastcall for calls.

03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:36.520
Meanwhile, we got one more tweet here from actdeft.

03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:41.520
The Nubuo Summer Bundle Kickstarter.

03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:43.520
So it's a Kickstarter that he's linked us to.

03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:46.520
It's music inspired by video games.

03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:47.520
And it's a Kickstarter.

03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:50.520
They're trying to raise $8,000.

03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:51.520
And why are they doing this?

03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:56.520
Well, they're trying to do video game music information in English and Japanese.

03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:01.520
A two-CD original and arranged soundtrack album for the browser game Rokochan.

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:03.520
And doing some different design work there.

03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:07.520
Proceeds of the Kickstarter will benefit the bundle's eight participating musicians.

03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:10.520
And will be the first source of funding for the Rokochan team.

03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:16.520
So I guess it's kind of like a little bit of a startup company here slash get a cool little soundtrack album.

03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:19.520
I will say this though, some of the albums that are included in this,

03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:26.520
Super Meat Boy Choice Piano Cuts, Splatterhouse Volume 1 Volume 2, and Splatterhouse Butchered.

03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:29.520
So if you're a Splatterhouse fan, also in there in the arranged pack,

03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:34.520
Looks like our friend Mega Ran who was on the show a few weeks ago is involved there with Black Materia the remixes.

03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:36.520
As well as some stuff by Metroid Metal.

03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:38.520
So those are some groups you should know of.

03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:43.520
So go onto Kickstarter and search for N-U-B-U-W-O.

03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:45.520
Nubwo.

03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:46.520
There it is.

03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:48.520
That's it for tweets.

03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:49.520
The phone ain't going off.

03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:52.520
So I'm thinking the show's about over.

03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:56.520
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight to our little program.

03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:02.520
We really appreciate you guys tuning in every week and supporting independent podcasting.

03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:03.520
We really appreciate your support.

03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:10.520
Again, if you like what you hear, leave us a nice review on iTunes or whatever pod software site you use to get this.

03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:11.520
There's a new one now.

03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:12.520
There's Stitcher Radio.

03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:17.520
If you don't download podcasts directly to your device, there's an app in the App Store.

03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:20.520
And it's also, it's iOS and it's Android called Stitcher Radio.

03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:23.520
And you can give us thumbs up and likes and stuff.

03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:25.520
And there actually is like a chart that ranks shows.

03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:28.520
And I think last I looked, we were number 40 or something in games.

03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:30.520
And we can go a little higher, right?

03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:32.520
Give us some thumbs up.

03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:33.520
Stitcher's free.

03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:34.520
So go get it.

03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:35.520
Give us some thumbs up.

03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:36.520
It's on the web too.

03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:40.520
I'll have to get the link for the website or Tiger Claw will beat me to it in about five seconds here.

03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:43.520
We could definitely use your thumbs up and your likes over there on Stitcher Radio.

03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:45.520
We'd really appreciate that.

03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:46.520
Or just tell a friend.

03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:52.520
Word of mouth is how we spread the good word of Orange Launch Radio and grow the O.L. Army.

03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:56.520
Before we conclude tonight, though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:58.520
Dark Sakura, we'll start you tonight. Ladies first.

03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:00.520
I'm changing the fortune cookie.

03:05:00.520 --> 03:05:01.520
You can't do that.

03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:02.520
Yes, I can.

03:05:02.520 --> 03:05:04.520
Alright, fine. You can change the fortune cookie.

03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:06.520
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:09.520
I have to get off Kickstarter. It's dangerous.

03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:11.520
Spending too much money?

03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:14.520
Well, no, I've been luckily not spending too much money.

03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:17.520
But I'll talk to you out there about stuff.

03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:22.520
I don't know. I've just seen some of these ideas that people come up with.

03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:23.520
It's just like, really?

03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:25.520
No, we're not doing a Kickstarter.

03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:27.520
No, no, no, no, no.

03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:28.520
Not at all.

03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:29.520
Alright.

03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:31.520
Not at all. There's definitely no one I'm getting at.

03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:32.520
Alright.

03:05:32.520 --> 03:05:40.520
My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to eating what's in that crock pot right over there in the corner of the room.

03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:47.520
And all those bugs can go die of raid poisoning. Stupid bugs.

03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:50.520
That's it. We're done. We're out of here.

03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:53.520
Thank you everybody so much for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:53.520 --> 03:05:55.520
And we'll see you again next week.

03:05:55.520 --> 03:05:59.520
We didn't mention it all tonight, surprisingly, just because E3 has kind of dominated everything.

03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:06.520
But I will mention now, we are two weeks away from the ten year Orange Lounge Radio anniversary show.

03:06:06.520 --> 03:06:07.520
If you can believe it.

03:06:07.520 --> 03:06:08.520
That's a long time.

03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:10.520
Two weeks away.

03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:12.520
Are you going to be here?

03:06:12.520 --> 03:06:13.520
Yeah, I'll be here.

03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:15.520
Okay, there was a week you weren't going to be here.

03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:16.520
That was supposed to be this week.

03:06:16.520 --> 03:06:17.520
Oh, but you made it anyway.

03:06:17.520 --> 03:06:18.520
Yeah.

03:06:18.520 --> 03:06:19.520
Oh, hooray.

03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:20.520
