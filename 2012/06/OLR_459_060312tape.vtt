00:00.000 --> 00:21.080
Tonight, June 3, 2012, rumored new Wii U functionality is revealed, details emerge on the next Skyrim

00:21.080 --> 00:31.640
expansion, and Apple answers rumors about an Apple console.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.160 --> 00:39.360
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.640
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.760
First off, the one, the only, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.400
Yo, dog, what up?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.880
How you doin'?

00:49.880 --> 00:53.120
Um, I'm full of curry.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.520
Hurry hurry hurry, get your rice and curry.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
It was really good.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.480
It was Thai, not Indian, thank you.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.800
Nerds out there will know that song.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.520
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.520
Hi.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.520
How are you doing, Loki?

01:05.520 --> 01:06.520
I'm doing fine.

01:06.520 --> 01:07.520
Alright.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
Now, tonight's a little bit different of a show.

01:09.520 --> 01:15.080
Usually I would introduce our chat room at vognetwork.com, but unfortunately we, well,

01:15.080 --> 01:20.480
I mean, fortunately and unfortunately we are taping in advance of Sunday night, so if you're

01:20.480 --> 01:24.660
listening to this live on Sunday night at the VOG Network, congrats, you're hearing the

01:24.660 --> 01:31.080
premiere of this episode, but we're actually taping here on Thursday, May the 31st.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.200
So a little disclaimer before we get into the news too much tonight, especially with

01:34.200 --> 01:39.480
all the E3 stuff starting to come out, things may have changed between the night we taped

01:39.480 --> 01:41.800
this and the night you guys hear it.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.280
Why did we do that this week?

01:43.280 --> 01:46.880
Well, as I mentioned on last week's show, I'm going to be out of town, therefore the

01:46.880 --> 01:50.880
OLR studio will be closed that night and Loki really wants a night to sit at home and play

01:50.880 --> 01:52.800
Minecraft all night uninterrupted.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.400
Well, it's not uninterrupted, but it'll be longer than a few hours.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
There you go.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.960
So Minecraft all day Sunday.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.280
My God, it's getting bad.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.280
You were telling me before the show, just now you've cheated even worse in Minecraft

02:06.280 --> 02:07.280
360, right?

02:07.280 --> 02:09.000
I wouldn't even really consider it cheating.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.400
Exploiting, stretching the limits of the rules.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.400
It is cheating, but I mean, really when you think about it, it's just, I've basically

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
enabled God mode.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.760
I've rigged it so that the health is so high that I don't die, but it's really, it's for

02:24.760 --> 02:29.440
the poor programming of the game because like for example, the future updates and stuff,

02:29.440 --> 02:34.120
when you're digging underground, you know, if there's lava, you know, one brick away

02:34.120 --> 02:37.920
from where you're digging, you don't in this game.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.880
So you're digging all of a sudden, Oh crap, lava killing me.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.920
Yeah, the first tip I got about playing Minecraft is never dig straight down.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.640
Well, I wasn't digging straight down.

02:46.640 --> 02:52.520
I was digging straight forward and then all of a sudden I hit a block and lava flow dead.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.520
I was like, thanks.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.280
All right.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.600
Anyhow, we'll talk more about our gaming weeks in a little bit, but first, as I mentioned,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.920
we are getting into E3 week.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.760
Finally it's uh, it's here a little strange E3 for us here at orange launch radio this

03:07.760 --> 03:08.760
year.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.040
And you know, as I'm sure a lot of you guys know, E3 kind of scaled back on the amount

03:12.040 --> 03:16.480
of people they invite and OLR is not exactly on the guest list anymore.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.880
So um, you know, we're just trying to make the best of it and uh, I'm going to Disneyland

03:19.880 --> 03:20.880
instead.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.880
LOL.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.680
Uh, but I think a Loki dark soccer, you guys may or may not be watching it at home.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.240
Loki, you still took the time off from work, so you kind of watch it, right?

03:28.240 --> 03:32.200
I didn't take any time off work, but I'll still be watching it.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.640
But technically it's related to your job so you can kind of get away with it.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.640
Yeah.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.640
And because I'm awesome like that.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.120
I kind of think that my work is more interesting.

03:40.120 --> 03:45.360
Well, this year especially, you know, I, I'm, I'm feeling a little eh about E3 this year.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.120
I mean, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and to go into it with low expectations is

03:49.120 --> 03:50.720
probably a good place to be.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.600
But you know, um, I think Bobby put it best, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, the man who you

03:56.600 --> 03:59.160
hear before us on Sunday nights at VOG network.

03:59.160 --> 04:07.180
Um, he said, you know, if I had to miss my first E3 in, I think he said it was 16 years

04:07.180 --> 04:08.180
I think.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.180
15, 16 years.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.680
I probably got that wrong.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.560
Um, it, this is probably a good one to miss.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.800
Why do you think the bar is so low this year?

04:16.800 --> 04:19.320
I mean, we do have a new, I mean, everybody's saying, well, there's no new consoles.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.320
Well, there is.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.560
I mean, there is the Wii U.

04:21.560 --> 04:25.880
I mean, is, is excitement really that low about Wii U or what?

04:25.880 --> 04:30.400
I don't think the Wii U is doing enough different to make it like, Ooh, wow.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.360
It's not like the graphics are like, Whoa, that much better.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.640
Or you know, Whoa, this is a totally new technology, you know, way of controlling things.

04:37.640 --> 04:45.200
It's basically, Hey, look, we took, we made a big DS minus other minus a D.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.480
But isn't this a good place for Nintendo to be though?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.540
I mean, I know that sounds really weird.

04:49.540 --> 04:54.300
Like you, you know, nobody likes the negative buzz and obviously E3 kind of left them with

04:54.300 --> 04:58.740
a very meh feeling, a lot of people walking out of the Wii U, but I mean, when the bar

04:58.740 --> 05:03.280
is low, they really have the potential to exceed expectations.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.280
True.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.880
And well, with what they're doing right now, the technology seems to be more familiar to

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
the developers.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.640
So they're able to port stuff over that, you know, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are getting.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.920
I don't know how that's going to look when the new systems come out, but you know, that's

05:17.920 --> 05:19.160
still a ways off.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.720
For a whole year, they'll be on the cutting edge.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.880
And even still, you know, even those new systems, you remember the very first, you know, games

05:25.880 --> 05:30.100
are coming out in the, you know, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 just kind of look like

05:30.100 --> 05:37.160
a Brezzed PlayStation 2 and Xbox games, so it's not always, you know, the biggest, best

05:37.160 --> 05:41.720
looking, well definitely never the best looking games at launch, it's just, you know, ways

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
after that.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
All right.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.680
So quickly, I know we kind of talked about this a little more in depth a couple weeks

05:47.680 --> 05:51.240
ago, so I don't want to dwell on this topic too long, but since this is our last chance

05:51.240 --> 05:56.860
before E3 officially hits and the press conferences start, what are your final predictions out

05:56.860 --> 05:57.860
of E3?

05:57.860 --> 05:59.760
One prediction each for the big three.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.200
What are your final big predictions out of E3?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.200
Loki?

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
Or Dark Sakura?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.480
Um, that I'll be asleep when they're made.

06:07.480 --> 06:13.560
Do you, well let me ask you, Darkside, do you have any interest in Wii U at all?

06:13.560 --> 06:14.560
Not really.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.560
Why not?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.560
I don't know.

06:16.560 --> 06:23.280
I mean, really, I'm just, my apathy is kind of overwhelming about it because I'm, I mean,

06:23.280 --> 06:26.660
we'll probably get one, I guess.

06:26.660 --> 06:34.220
It's just, I'm really getting to the point that a lot of big hype about stuff just makes

06:34.220 --> 06:36.080
me not care.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.920
I don't, I don't want to speculate.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.080
I just want to see it when it's out.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.880
Because when you say you're apathetic and you don't care, it makes me think that Nintendo's

06:42.880 --> 06:46.140
just not doing anything to excite you, that there's nothing that's happening there that

06:46.140 --> 06:48.360
you go, oh, this is new and fascinating.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.660
They're really not.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.900
The technology isn't anything new.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.480
We've got touchscreen stuff.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
We've got tablets.

06:55.480 --> 07:00.920
You know, using a tablet, they've had that interactivity from a handheld before when

07:00.920 --> 07:06.680
they had the game link with the GBA.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.880
So it's nothing really new.

07:08.880 --> 07:13.280
It's them just saying, oh, well, we're making a part of the Wii now.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.760
I'm not really excited about it.

07:14.760 --> 07:19.920
I don't, I'm not going to be excited until I actually sit down and see it.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.600
And granted, I feel somewhat similar, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

07:24.600 --> 07:30.040
I'm really hoping there's that one game that I've got to have, but we'll see.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.460
Loki, predictions for the big three?

07:33.460 --> 07:38.360
I don't really know what Nintendo's, just based on what they've rumored to be coming

07:38.360 --> 07:42.840
out in the new Mario game, New Super Mario Bros. me, which I think is what it's supposed

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
to be.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.720
I was just like, I'm, seriously, that does not appeal to me at all.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.400
New Super Mario Bros. didn't ever appeal to me.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
I mean, I understand.

07:51.400 --> 07:57.240
Well, one of the DS was pretty cool, and then the Wii one came out, and then number two's

07:57.240 --> 07:59.480
coming out, and they all look the same.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.680
It's just, I don't care.

08:02.680 --> 08:09.420
I wish, I don't know, I wish it would do something innovative, like take one of those franchises

08:09.420 --> 08:14.680
like Mario or Zelda and do like a little big planet thing with it.

08:14.680 --> 08:19.240
You know, have this fucking amazing level editor with it and just, you could even make

08:19.240 --> 08:25.440
it like an old, you know, the 16-bit Zelda, like do that, re-release that and have this

08:25.440 --> 08:28.840
fucking amazing level editor where you can share it online and stuff like that.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.720
I'm gonna bring you back, because this isn't a prediction, this is wank.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.440
This is what you want to see, this isn't what you're gonna see.

08:37.440 --> 08:44.640
I'm prepared to be completely underwhelmed by Nintendo, that's my prediction, that they'll

08:44.640 --> 08:48.960
talk about all this wonderful stuff that the Wii U can do, and it'll be just these stupid

08:48.960 --> 08:56.680
games that, hey look, it's WWE 13, but with this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Darksiders

08:56.680 --> 09:02.560
2, but this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Batman Arkham City that came out last year,

09:02.560 --> 09:04.840
but it has this extra feature.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.280
I don't fucking care, that's not gonna make me, I'm not buying another console because

09:08.280 --> 09:10.200
it has a cool gimmick.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.120
I mean, I want something that's gonna be a little bit different.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.120
The Wii was very different than what was out there on the market, that's why I was interested

09:17.120 --> 09:22.320
in it, and it was completely boring later on, because there was nothing really good

09:22.320 --> 09:23.840
for it.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.560
Nothing I really needed to have.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.320
How about Microsoft and Sony?

09:28.320 --> 09:33.180
Microsoft, I'm waiting for a lot of announcements from them, because they really don't know

09:33.180 --> 09:37.200
a whole ton of what's coming out, and obviously they're gonna talk about the new Gears of

09:37.200 --> 09:41.740
War game, which really don't care about that.

09:41.740 --> 09:49.120
I'm hoping we'll see, they'll probably announce their TV thing, the whole initiative where

09:49.120 --> 09:53.720
they're gonna have some sort of IPTV, that'd be kinda nice, because all these little apps

09:53.720 --> 09:58.920
that they have that are tied to your cable, hey you can have the Xfinity app, oh but you

09:58.920 --> 10:02.480
have to have Xfinity in order to actually view any of the content on there, well fuck,

10:02.480 --> 10:07.200
you know what, I can do that on my PC, why do I need your stupid app?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.320
It's very useless for me.

10:09.320 --> 10:14.760
If it's something like, hey you pay for Xbox Live and you get TV content with that, awesome,

10:14.760 --> 10:20.040
cool then I don't have to pay for cable, of course cable doesn't want you to do that,

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
but we'll see.

10:21.040 --> 10:28.400
And then for PlayStation, Sony, I mean, I don't know, it's really, it kinda, it's going

10:28.400 --> 10:32.440
back to what we were saying before, it's very meh, there's nothing I'm really expecting,

10:32.440 --> 10:38.680
that's the thing, it's nothing like, oh I can't wait to hear about this, I just don't

10:38.680 --> 10:43.560
think anything's gonna happen, I mean, I would like to, I'm predicting that they'll talk

10:43.560 --> 10:47.840
about new Vita titles, because I gotta tell you right now, the two that I was looking

10:47.840 --> 10:55.360
forward to, Resistance and Gravity Rush, Resistance apparently is pretty terrible, and that's

10:55.360 --> 10:59.440
not good, Gravity Rush I hear is kind of okay, there's a demo out for Gravity Rush, there's

10:59.440 --> 11:03.760
a demo out for both, but I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet, but I hear, I mean

11:03.760 --> 11:07.360
I hear it's okay, but it's not like, woo, gotta have that, Resistance was one of those

11:07.360 --> 11:11.120
things, I was like, ooh, first person shooter, that might be really cool, and then here it's

11:11.120 --> 11:16.920
just kinda meh, and so, I'm like, well crap, now I have to wait until the fall for some

11:16.920 --> 11:22.720
good games to come out, and we're back to the 3DS again, where it's just like, well

11:22.720 --> 11:26.840
crap, you know, I gotta wait until the fall for some good games to come out, it's like,

11:26.840 --> 11:28.720
am I gonna have to sell this system too?

11:28.720 --> 11:35.560
Alright, I'll go real quick, I think Nintendo, I obviously, is gonna be very heavy on the

11:35.560 --> 11:40.680
Wii U and the 3DS, I, this may just be the fanboy wank in me, but I kinda think they're

11:40.680 --> 11:44.280
gonna drop F-Zero on us, and I'm gonna have to get one, I think that's, I think that's

11:44.280 --> 11:48.080
what's gonna ultimately happen, and I think there'll be something kinda cool where that

11:48.080 --> 11:53.000
little tablet's gonna have like the map, and kinda like the racer's cockpit or something,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.360
and maybe something like being able to use like power-ups and stuff will be all on the

11:56.360 --> 12:01.400
little touch screen, and then the HD screen will be nothing but gorgeousness, you know,

12:01.400 --> 12:05.920
and possible fan wank, but I just, there are rumors that that could be the big one that's

12:05.920 --> 12:11.400
being dropped, so I'm just gonna remain hopeful, I really hope this is Nintendo's chance to

12:11.400 --> 12:16.680
finally prove that they get online, and I think they are gonna show that they get online

12:16.680 --> 12:21.800
finally, but no more so than say Sony, you know, it's not gonna be like, oh my god, Nintendo's

12:21.800 --> 12:27.000
the must-have online, so I think they'll do about as well as Sony.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.200
Microsoft, I really don't know what they can do to impress me at this point, especially

12:32.200 --> 12:35.560
if they are gonna be hedging their bets on two big first-person shooters, which usually

12:35.560 --> 12:39.360
aren't my kinda game, I don't know what to think.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.920
I wanna see new franchises.

12:40.920 --> 12:46.920
I really do too, and I want something to be on Kinect that's interesting, there was that

12:46.920 --> 12:50.200
whole gladiator game they showed last year that we never really heard anything about

12:50.200 --> 12:53.960
again, and I imagine they're gonna show more of that this year, but I'm not, mmm.

12:53.960 --> 12:59.360
It's Fable, The Journey is gonna be their big Kinect game, it's not on Rails!

12:59.360 --> 13:04.520
Well, you know what, again, and a great example of where the bar is really effing low, and

13:04.520 --> 13:08.840
here's a chance to blow me away, so maybe, maybe, cause I liked Fable 2.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.600
I don't think there's ever gonna be another good Fable.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.600
We'll see.

13:12.600 --> 13:17.440
I think only the bet rises and you come out for this console.

13:17.440 --> 13:21.760
The other thing I wanna say about Microsoft though is I still think Windows 8, I think

13:21.760 --> 13:25.040
Windows 8 gets dropped at some point during the conference, it's Microsoft's big push

13:25.040 --> 13:29.560
at the end of the year, as a company, that whole synergy, there's gonna be something

13:29.560 --> 13:31.200
with your Xbox and Windows 8.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Just wait.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
Ooh, fantastic!

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
Yep.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.200
Exactly.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.640
I was watching a video of that interface today, and granted, there are things that they've

13:38.640 --> 13:43.840
made improvements to, but that fuckin' Metro desktop is...

13:43.840 --> 13:45.080
That is all optional, right?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.720
I don't have to use that, right?

13:46.720 --> 13:47.720
I don't know.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
Question mark?

13:48.720 --> 13:49.720
Oh boy.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.720
That replaces the start menu.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.720
Oh boy, alright.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.840
Um, Sony.

13:52.840 --> 13:57.960
You know, Sony is so unpredictable, and yet, I think is really predictable, I mean, obviously

13:57.960 --> 14:02.480
you're gonna have the God of War, you're gonna have probably more hints of the Last Guardian

14:02.480 --> 14:06.960
and the PlayStation fighting game, but at the same time, I feel like last year we thought

14:06.960 --> 14:12.140
we knew everything Sony was gonna do, and they did kinda have a lot of surprises still.

14:12.140 --> 14:18.040
So I have faith that Sony could still shock us with something, but I just, you know, I'm

14:18.040 --> 14:21.200
hoping again it's that game I haven't seen yet.

14:21.200 --> 14:26.160
So I, and I think there will still be, of course, more Vita, and I'm hoping for more

14:26.160 --> 14:31.080
Vita, PlayStation 3 kinda, you know, togetherness.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.640
So we'll see.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.360
There is that, what was that dungeon crawler game that never ended up coming out with the

14:37.360 --> 14:38.360
Vita's launch?

14:38.360 --> 14:39.360
I don't remember what it's called now.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.360
Paperware the game?

14:40.360 --> 14:41.360
No, something...

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
I know what you're talking about.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
It's like Diablo, but not...

14:43.360 --> 14:44.360
They showed that off last year, I imagine more of that.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.840
Well they had, they had the one that was at launch, the Ubisoft title that ties in, I

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
think.

14:48.840 --> 14:49.840
No, no, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
No, I know what you're talking about, the Sony one.

14:50.840 --> 14:51.840
I don't remember what the hell it's called.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.840
It's not Sorcery either.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
No, it's not Sorcery.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.840
That's the Vita.

14:54.840 --> 14:55.840
No, I know what you're talking about.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.840
Yeah.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.520
Because they just were talking about like, oh hey, where's that game?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.420
And yeah, I don't know.

15:00.420 --> 15:05.960
But again, I'm hoping it's not just, you know, I mean, again, last year, despite, I think

15:05.960 --> 15:09.560
there was a leak a couple weeks in advance, but otherwise that Twisted Metal game kinda,

15:09.560 --> 15:10.960
you know, was a surprise.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.560
You know, I'm hoping for some surprises, but we'll, we'll see.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.560
Anyhow.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.700
New franchises.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.200
That's all I'm saying.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.120
Each one should come out with a new franchise.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.560
I mean, there's, there's some pretty cool ideas that they have for new franchises, like

15:23.560 --> 15:27.360
remember Cameo, the launch title for the 360?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.820
That was like really cool looking when they showed it off at E3, and it was okay when

15:30.820 --> 15:35.280
it came out, but it could have been a good sequel, huh?

15:35.280 --> 15:37.440
It could have been a good title.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.520
Like that, that type of game was pretty cool and not something that really the Xbox has

15:41.520 --> 15:42.520
from Microsoft.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.400
They don't have that type of platforming, like a Ratchet and Clank or something.

15:46.400 --> 15:50.160
They need something like that.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.400
Alrighty I'm gonna move on here and start to get into tonight's news just to kinda wrap

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
things up though.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.320
Again, hopefully, hopefully we're all pleasantly surprised.

15:58.320 --> 16:03.160
I know we're feeling kinda eh about this year's E3.

16:03.160 --> 16:09.960
I really hope it gets people buzzed because this Christmas could be quite a disaster for

16:09.960 --> 16:14.320
video games in general if, you know, there's not anything to get excited about.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.640
That could be bad.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.640
Here's one thing though.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.080
If the video game market could live through a recession, I don't know that it's gonna

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
have a problem.

16:22.080 --> 16:27.920
Well, but if this year is bad, that could have a real impact on the Sony Microsoft consoles

16:27.920 --> 16:28.920
next year.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.920
Oh please.

16:29.920 --> 16:30.920
Grand Theft Auto for October.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.640
Please Grand Theft Auto for October.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.640
We'll see.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
You know, actually, what was that?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.360
The Lego City stories.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.400
Still wanna hear about that.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.800
That actually would, might sell me a Wii U.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
Maybe.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.760
Alright, I'm gonna get into some housekeeping real quick here.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.040
First off, again, I wanna plug the live show even though we're taped tonight.

16:50.040 --> 16:55.000
We will be back next week, June 10th, to talk about everything that happened at E3.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.120
And that'll be available at vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right

17:00.120 --> 17:02.040
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

17:02.040 --> 17:08.000
Also, by the time you guys hear this, the full vognetwork.com website should have launched.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.740
We had, or we're having, I have to think what tense to use here.

17:12.740 --> 17:18.140
So, since you guys are hearing this Sunday, we had a special on Friday talking about the

17:18.140 --> 17:19.600
future of the network.

17:19.600 --> 17:24.200
I don't wanna repeat it here because it's like 95% ago right now, but there is a chance

17:24.200 --> 17:25.480
it could be delayed to the 8th.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.480
We will has had.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.560
Yes, you will has had by this point.

17:28.560 --> 17:32.240
My hope is, though, by the time you guys are hearing this, the full vognetwork.com website

17:32.240 --> 17:37.920
did in fact launch, so check it out, and just, it's gonna be awesome.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.680
There were unicorns and rainbows and- I don't know about unicorns, but there may

17:41.680 --> 17:42.780
be rainbows.

17:42.780 --> 17:46.000
There was definitely a unicorn on the test site, but I think that's being removed for

17:46.000 --> 17:47.240
the full.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
There were sheep.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
That was interesting.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
There were sheep.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.240
Oh, did you see that?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.520
I saw that.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.520
That was my graphic design.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.800
There were sheep and men in underwear.

17:56.800 --> 18:04.300
All right, anyhow, vognetwork.com should be live 24-7 now as well, and a full website

18:04.300 --> 18:05.300
for you guys to see.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.300
So, that'll be fun.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.920
All right, anyhow, moving on.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.840
Let's talk about the news.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.560
Loki, why don't you start us off?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.560
And no gaming week?

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
Oh, shit.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.520
Yeah, we should talk about our gaming weeks, huh?

18:17.520 --> 18:18.520
Dark soccer.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.360
All the E3 talk got me sidetracked.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.240
Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.400
We've only had half a week, too.

18:24.400 --> 18:31.440
I played- actually, Dan got the new Arkham City expansion, the Harley Quinn's Revenge.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.760
Oh, yeah, that looked really neat.

18:32.760 --> 18:36.880
I watched about half of it, and then I had to go to bed, because I had taken NyQuil,

18:36.880 --> 18:39.260
and I was like, ugh.

18:39.260 --> 18:46.460
You play a lot of it as Robin, and as much as I liked Harley Quinn's voice actor, she

18:46.460 --> 18:51.680
gets really annoying after a while, so whatever.

18:51.680 --> 18:58.400
And also, for fans of certain little Easter eggs that were found in the game before, you

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
can get pissed off.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
So, just saying.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.720
Don't get your hopes up, wah.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.400
I already know exactly what it's got to be.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
All right.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
Yeah.

19:08.400 --> 19:17.480
So, anyway, I played- I had this really good streak in Fractal, which I love that fucking

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
game.

19:18.480 --> 19:23.120
Fractal is so fun, and I had a really good streak, and then I got pissed off at the game

19:23.120 --> 19:25.520
again and stopped playing.

19:25.520 --> 19:32.800
So then I played some WoW, and played some Star Trek Online, only to find out that they

19:32.800 --> 19:41.660
completely redid your skills, and it's stupid, so I'm like, ugh, I don't have my kickass

19:41.660 --> 19:42.660
bomb skills anymore.

19:42.660 --> 19:46.680
Don't you hate that when you leave an MMO and then you come back and they change everything?

19:46.680 --> 19:48.680
Yeah.

19:48.680 --> 19:53.800
But apparently, like, some of the stuff I have, my legacy items, are pretty good, so.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.800
Oh, that's good.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.680
I'm still an admiral piloting a Defiant.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.400
Are you still playing with all the Scottish people?

20:00.400 --> 20:03.560
They weren't on, only a couple people were on, and they weren't the Scotsmen.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.960
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.800
They're apparently all still there, they're just there at weird times.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.800
Probably.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.800
All right.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I played Minecraft.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Of course you did!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.840
I played lots of Minecraft.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.320
I built a giant pig.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.680
Oh, God, I saw the pictures on your Twitter.

20:23.680 --> 20:29.080
When you say you built a giant pig, you must have found the pixel layout somewhere online.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.800
There's a guide online.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.120
Oh my gosh.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.160
I love, it was like a hollow pig.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
You could climb up the ladder.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.720
Yeah, you can climb up the ladder into it.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
It's a house.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
You can live in its butt.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.720
You can live inside.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.720
And guess, actually, here's the best part.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.400
It's like the dinosaurs in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.160
Remember when they go to watch the sunrise?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.540
You can live in a pig's ass.

20:46.540 --> 20:50.740
You can live inside the pig, and not only that, near its ass, because it's on the inside

20:50.740 --> 20:52.200
of its ass, there's a chest.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
What's inside the chest?

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
Pork chops!

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
Yes!

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
Yes!

20:56.200 --> 20:58.000
The pork chops are in there.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.280
Oh, dog, I heard you like pigs, so I put pig in your pig.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.280
Exactly.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
So you could be a pig.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.280
I don't know.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
I just thought that would be fun.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.280
What do I want to build next?

21:07.280 --> 21:08.280
I'll build a giant pig.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.880
That thing is scary, because I'll be running through, and then I'll look out the window

21:11.880 --> 21:13.480
and see this pig.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.360
And it's just like, it's always there, staring at you.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.680
Hey, hey, hey, I have a question for you.

21:18.680 --> 21:24.220
Can you make a slide, because you could totally make a tongue slide for your pig?

21:24.220 --> 21:26.880
You can make a water slide.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.400
You should make a drooling pig water slide.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.160
Are you going to make a water slide out of its bum, because that's kind of gross.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.160
No.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.080
Do it in its mouth so it can be the drooling pig.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.280
I thought about making, see, I was going to have that pig, and I was going to have another

21:37.280 --> 21:44.000
pig to re-skin, to make it all evil looking, with glowing eyes and fire, and spikes sticking

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
up.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Darth Pig!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Darth Pig!

21:47.000 --> 21:50.800
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink!

21:50.800 --> 21:54.360
It was funny, though, because all the pigs keep wandering around the giant pig.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.200
It's like they're worshipping the idol.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.200
Wow.

21:58.200 --> 22:03.620
All hail our bacony god!

22:03.620 --> 22:08.520
But yeah, and another thing, too, Robson, since we're on the same map.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.520
If you go to...

22:09.520 --> 22:11.920
You know I started a new map, actually, a long time ago.

22:11.920 --> 22:12.920
What?!

22:12.920 --> 22:13.920
Yeah, I'm on seed OLR.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.400
I'm not on seed VoG anymore.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
I got sick of VoG.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
But I'm sick of OLR, too.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.240
You need to go back to VoG, because you know why?

22:21.240 --> 22:28.280
Because if you go to the bottom, the southwestern portion of the map, there's this giant hole

22:28.280 --> 22:31.720
that goes straight into the ground with a waterfall in it and stuff, and it's pretty

22:31.720 --> 22:33.160
awesome inside there.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.460
That's cool.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
You know what you need to do?

22:35.460 --> 22:37.680
You need to put a video on YouTube of your giant pig.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.680
Once I'm done.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.200
Da, da, da, da, da, da!

22:43.200 --> 22:44.880
Well I'm going to have...

22:44.880 --> 22:45.880
I've already...

22:45.880 --> 22:49.600
I'm planning on making a giant rollercoaster ride thing, or possibly...

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
Oh my god!

22:50.600 --> 22:53.280
They even have water slides that you can make.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.880
You can make a water slide thing with jumps and all this cool stuff.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.800
What has happened just three months ago?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.440
I should go find a clip from this show just three months ago.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.440
Minecraft?

23:01.440 --> 23:02.440
What the hell?

23:02.440 --> 23:03.440
Why do people play Minecraft?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
I don't get this game.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
Or just ask Dark Sakura.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.440
Hey, Dark Sakura, what do you think of Minecraft?

23:08.440 --> 23:13.720
Yeah, and then Loki in the meantime, I'm going to make a fucking Minecraft theme park, woo!

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
You know what, though?

23:14.720 --> 23:19.860
As soon as somebody either pays for me to have an account or gets it to me for free

23:19.860 --> 23:20.860
somehow.

23:20.860 --> 23:21.860
Let's play the demo.

23:21.860 --> 23:22.860
No, I don't like demos.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.120
I'll pay for you to quit complaining.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.600
Hold on, I think I have a dollar.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
Hold on.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
Here, hold on.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.600
Let me just dig in my pocket.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.560
I'll take that dollar too, and I'll stop complaining for five seconds.

23:33.560 --> 23:37.640
Here, alright, I'm putting one dollar, this is a great radio show, here's my dollar, and

23:37.640 --> 23:42.280
I'm putting it in the Dark Sakura Quit Your Bitchin' and Buy Minecraft Fund.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.280
There it is.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
I have a dollar.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.280
Pinkberry!

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
Here, take your dollar.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.280
I don't want your dirty money.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.280
No.

23:48.280 --> 23:54.160
That is the most non-Jewish thing you've ever done.

23:54.160 --> 24:00.800
Remember back when I popped up the volume, and the little thing said, give me a dollar?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.640
People did send me dollars.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
A couple people.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.080
Someone sent me a two dollar bill.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.800
Kickstarter to buy Jamie Minecraft.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.160
This was before Kickstarter, they should be paying me.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.600
Alright, anyhow, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

24:11.600 --> 24:14.720
I played a little bit of Call of Duty, we actually played a Kill Confirmed game with

24:14.720 --> 24:18.040
just the three of us, so that was fun.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.720
We just don't play a lot of Call of Duty anymore, because everyone's really busy and my coworker's

24:21.720 --> 24:24.760
out for a couple weeks, and it's just...

24:24.760 --> 24:28.720
So I get more Minecraft time then.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.600
But yeah, I started getting bored though, because I'm like, well, I don't know really

24:32.600 --> 24:36.840
what else to do in here, and so I don't know, we'll see.

24:36.840 --> 24:42.160
So I may actually go start a new seed at some point, but I don't know, how's the old RC?

24:42.160 --> 24:45.240
Not that great, actually, but then again I haven't explored the entire map, but I can

24:45.240 --> 24:50.120
tell you, the underground really annoys the hell out of me, and there's some weird...

24:50.120 --> 24:54.880
There's like, okay, if you want like just this gigantic mountain where the bottom half

24:54.880 --> 24:59.480
is all cave and it's the weirdest thing, it's available on that map.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.280
I would almost play it just to see how different it is.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.720
There's some seeds I've seen that are really crazy, like just valleys inside of a mountain

25:06.720 --> 25:09.440
with lava and water and all sorts of strange stuff.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.880
Well whenever we get those VoG forums that may or may not be there, when you hear this...

25:12.880 --> 25:15.360
I have no idea what the crap you guys are talking about.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.680
You should share some of your awesome seeds for Minecraft.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.800
All right, look, let's move on.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.800
What seed?

25:20.800 --> 25:21.800
Like what...

25:21.800 --> 25:26.600
You tell it what word you give it, you can give it random numbers and letters or capital,

25:26.600 --> 25:30.920
you know, you give it a word and you can make a world that uses that as the seed.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.800
But the good thing about that is that like if I use capital V, capital O, capital G,

25:34.800 --> 25:39.240
and he uses the same thing, we have the same world essentially, even though it's kind of

25:39.240 --> 25:41.380
randomized, if that makes sense.

25:41.380 --> 25:47.000
I'm just thinking of Final Fantasy VIII now, where there were seed members in their gardens.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
No, no.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.360
All right, my gaming week.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.800
Honestly, I've been working on the website, not as much as Bobby has, but I still have

25:53.800 --> 25:56.760
been working on that quite a bit this week, so I haven't had a whole lot of time to game.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.920
When I have gamed, I've played a little bit of Warcraft.

25:59.920 --> 26:03.420
Shane and I have been running some dungeons to get heirlooms for the monks, we will inevitably

26:03.420 --> 26:05.220
roll in the expansion.

26:05.220 --> 26:09.760
And otherwise, I checked out the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer expansion, the... is it the

26:09.760 --> 26:11.520
Rebellion Pack, or was that the last one?

26:11.520 --> 26:12.520
I don't know.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.520
Yeah, I remember.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.520
Oh, Recruit...

26:14.520 --> 26:15.520
Something war-related.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.600
Another freaking multiplayer pack came out this week, and it adds the two male Quarians,

26:19.600 --> 26:23.920
the two Cerberus defectors, and the two Vortia.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.520
And dang, people are already unlocking shit.

26:26.520 --> 26:31.400
I went into a random, and I already was playing with a male Quarian, which was kind of neat,

26:31.400 --> 26:32.960
to just kind of see one running around.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.880
And I got to play on one of the new maps.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.400
So there are two new maps, one of them is, I think it's Thessia was the one I was playing

26:39.400 --> 26:42.840
on, because it's based off that one, well I don't want to spoil it because it's staged

26:42.840 --> 26:45.680
near the end of the game, but something big happens there.

26:45.680 --> 26:50.520
So I was, yeah, I was having a good time on that map, and apparently there's a new type

26:50.520 --> 26:53.060
of credit game, too.

26:53.060 --> 26:56.840
On the third, sixth, and tenth wave, you have to do something different than just killing

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
everybody.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.760
It's either like, hit the four beacons, or upload all the data.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.360
Now there's a new one that's kind of like, fetch it and bring it back.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.560
So, and it's kind of like Murderball, where the person who's carrying it walks really

27:09.560 --> 27:13.000
slow, and is more vulnerable to attack, so I kind of like that they're doing different

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
things with it.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.360
You know, Mass Effect, good times.

27:16.360 --> 27:20.140
After finally having played the entire fucking trilogy up to this point, it's kind of nice

27:20.140 --> 27:24.120
to be current, and get to experience a lot of this Mass Effect hub-a-loo when it's current,

27:24.120 --> 27:25.680
so that part's cool.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.080
All right, now we can do gaming news, right?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.080
Yes.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.080
All right, let's do it.

27:30.080 --> 27:36.760
All right, let's talk a little bit about rumors, and apparently Sony is rumored to be looking

27:36.760 --> 27:43.320
to buy a cloud gaming service, whether it's going to be Gaikai or OnLive.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.000
The thought, though, is it's probably going to be-

27:45.000 --> 27:48.600
Or the Phantom.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.600
Well you have to have a cloud gaming service first, you can't just say, hey, we've got

27:52.600 --> 27:56.780
this cloud gaming service, it's behind that wall over there, but trust us, it's there.

27:56.780 --> 27:59.560
This giant E3 booth we have.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.520
It works great.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.320
Seriously.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.320
It's awesome.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.320
Yeah, our first game-

28:05.320 --> 28:06.320
Take our word for it.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.320
We can't show it to you, it's awesome.

28:07.320 --> 28:11.280
Our first game coming out for it's called Snake Oil.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
Forget it.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
Yeah.

28:13.280 --> 28:21.080
So, and I guess the speculation also kind of goes along with what Gaikai was saying

28:21.080 --> 28:25.960
about E3, saying that, you know what, there may not be new consoles, because if you think

28:25.960 --> 28:33.520
about it, if the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 adapt cloud gaming, there really doesn't need

28:33.520 --> 28:37.400
to be a new console, because they just upgrade the stuff that's on the server side.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.600
Oh, they'll always find a way to sell you something.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.320
It's never going to happen, people.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
It's never going to happen.

28:42.320 --> 28:48.560
It may happen to coexist with regular stuff like renting titles or stuff like that, but

28:48.560 --> 28:51.560
it's never going to be, you just-

28:51.560 --> 28:56.520
Until it's the holodeck, there will always be a need for another console.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.520
Or, Intella will suck your dick, let's be real.

29:00.520 --> 29:05.400
The console either has to be the holodeck, or if they build the console, then they don't

29:05.400 --> 29:06.400
need anything else.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.400
If I lose out-

29:07.400 --> 29:08.400
What?

29:08.400 --> 29:09.400
Well, I'm losing out there.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.400
Well, no, no, no.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.400
It'll be the holodeck.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
You can demand horizontal holodeck.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.720
They'll be an inverter for women.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.880
But I'm just saying, though, there's never-

29:15.880 --> 29:18.820
It comes with a vacuum attachment.

29:18.820 --> 29:23.560
There's never- Well, even when the blowjob machine and the holodeck come out, they're

29:23.560 --> 29:25.100
going to need to make improvements to that.

29:25.100 --> 29:28.720
There's always going to be improvements done to everything.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
That's true.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.640
It would be too bad if you get a glitchy hoe.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

29:34.920 --> 29:35.920
Let it go.

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
Let it go.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
Let it go.

29:37.920 --> 29:38.920
No!

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
Female attachment!

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
Not the male attachment.

29:41.920 --> 29:42.920
Bad.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.920
Anyways.

29:43.920 --> 29:50.520
So, yeah, I mean, it could be interesting.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.920
I guess we'll have to wait and see what's going on there.

29:52.920 --> 29:57.840
I'm sure that announcement next week will be in the works if they are going to do something

29:57.840 --> 29:59.640
like that.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.240
It makes a lot of sense.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

30:02.240 --> 30:07.160
I mean, they could do a lot of different- I mean, I don't think it's going to be only

30:07.160 --> 30:08.160
that.

30:08.160 --> 30:13.920
Because, you know, another thing that they can consider, at least Sony did, was making

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
it online only.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.920
Yeah.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.040
Think about this, though, real quick.

30:19.040 --> 30:24.720
If they do adopt, like, a cloud gaming thing, then they can have all the fucking control.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
You know what I mean?

30:25.720 --> 30:26.720
Think about it.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.880
Because when it's in there, they get all of the fucking control.

30:28.880 --> 30:33.240
Like, they could release, like, a beta game or something that you could play for, like,

30:33.240 --> 30:34.760
an hour, and then it's, like, pulled.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
You know?

30:35.760 --> 30:38.560
And then the advertisement's right in the middle of it, and there's nothing you can

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
do about it.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.720
Like, that part of it's kind of interesting to me.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.800
Yeah, they could do that, and then everybody else doesn't do that, and then no one plays

30:46.800 --> 30:47.800
it.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.800
So, um, I don't know.

30:51.800 --> 30:57.040
But yeah, basically they ultimately rejected the idea of a download-only console because

30:57.040 --> 31:01.320
they remembered, hey, we released something called the PlayStation Portable Go, and that

31:01.320 --> 31:03.280
sucked.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.240
So they didn't, they decided not to do that instead.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.960
Maybe we're just not ready for online-only yet.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.720
That's, that's probably true.

31:11.720 --> 31:16.800
I mean, especially when, you know, you can't, it would look really stupid to have one article

31:16.800 --> 31:22.720
come out about Sony PlayStation 4 to be online-only right next to the article that comes out and

31:22.720 --> 31:27.800
says Comcast finally firms up their plan on how to enforce their bandwidth caps and starting

31:27.800 --> 31:29.300
at 300 gigs.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.300
Or even better.

31:30.300 --> 31:33.320
It's like Sony puts out online-only consoles.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.740
Servers for online console are being throttled.

31:35.740 --> 31:38.640
No one can play anything on their console.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.880
Fantastic.

31:39.880 --> 31:45.360
But if you buy the special Xfinity version, then it won't count against your cap.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.960
Comcast subsidized two-year agreement.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.960
I'm telling you.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.000
I mean, seriously, if it goes online-only, hey, guess what?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Guess what, console makers?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.160
Here's a little, little fact for you.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.360
You know we don't have to buy consoles.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.920
You know there are things called PCs that are open platforms that, oh my god, there's

32:01.920 --> 32:03.600
not these fucking restrictions on.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.240
I mean, they may be on certain games, but guess what, we don't play those games.

32:07.240 --> 32:10.120
So no one's forcing us to buy these consoles.

32:10.120 --> 32:16.000
Well, it's funny you bring up PC games because Diablo III is one of the big PC games, of

32:16.000 --> 32:17.740
course, in the world right now.

32:17.740 --> 32:20.480
And as you know, they've been having quite a few issues.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.520
You know, especially launch day was really bad.

32:22.520 --> 32:26.160
It got a little better for a little bit, but just within the past couple days before we're

32:26.160 --> 32:27.160
taping this show.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.840
Unfortunately, there's been more Error 37s, the auction house has been delayed, and so

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
on.

32:31.840 --> 32:36.160
Well, one country is taking this shit seriously, and it's Korea.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.560
The Korean Federal Trade Commission-

32:37.560 --> 32:40.780
They take their Diablo series, they take all their Blizzard games seriously.

32:40.780 --> 32:46.520
Like when I say seriously, like no joke, the Federal Trade Commission in Korea raided Blizzard's

32:46.520 --> 32:48.840
Seoul office earlier this week.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.360
That's, you know, South Korea.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.360
Because of consumer claims-

32:52.360 --> 32:57.740
And those WoW subscriptions were expensive, but man, that they're collecting souls now?

32:57.740 --> 32:58.740
That's just ridiculous.

32:58.740 --> 32:59.740
Stop it.

32:59.740 --> 33:04.720
Uh, Blizzard apparently refused to refund Diablo III to Korean players who should have

33:04.720 --> 33:07.040
been eligible after consumer complaints.

33:07.040 --> 33:12.440
The FTC thinks that Blizzard is violating Korean law on electronic commerce and commercial

33:12.440 --> 33:13.440
contracts.

33:13.440 --> 33:17.280
They're trying to gather evidence and so forth related to this raid.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.300
Korean players are frustrated with the server issues happening in Diablo III and asking

33:21.300 --> 33:22.300
for refunds.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.680
The user denied it, saying contract terms.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.040
You know that whole little thing that you scroll through real quick and agree to play

33:28.040 --> 33:29.040
the game?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.040
Yeah, that's contract.

33:30.040 --> 33:35.760
Um, the FTC is considering these terms to not be good to the player base, as you can

33:35.760 --> 33:36.760
imagine.

33:36.760 --> 33:40.520
Quote, we have received many complaints from Diablo III users.

33:40.520 --> 33:45.720
So just like people here complain to the government, it's happening in Korea too, and they raided

33:45.720 --> 33:46.720
the office.

33:46.720 --> 33:51.600
Well, I always have a problem with those contracts, if you will, anyways, because I'm not presented

33:51.600 --> 33:53.700
that contract before I purchase the item.

33:53.700 --> 33:58.120
It's like, I get this sprung upon me once I open the box and try and install and play

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
the game.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.600
At that point, it's like, too fucking late, haha, you either agree to this or you get

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
nothing.

34:04.600 --> 34:11.240
Um, now, one very interesting note I want to share is, according to the Korea Times,

34:11.240 --> 34:17.500
the FTC is investigating if Blizzard should be liable for its ill preparation in regards

34:17.500 --> 34:19.880
to player traffic.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.880
I don't know if I've ever heard anything like that before.

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
That's interesting.

34:23.880 --> 34:29.520
Basically, that Blizzard could be responsible for not being prepared for how big their game

34:29.520 --> 34:31.520
was going to be.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.880
I don't know why, but I find that fucking fascinating.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.200
And I think that they should be liable, because they had a beta, they knew how much traffic

34:39.200 --> 34:42.840
was going to be in there, and they need to have enough servers, and they didn't.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.740
I mean, come on.

34:44.740 --> 34:48.360
You're telling me that you don't realize how many copies of your game are out there?

34:48.360 --> 34:51.720
You know how many copies you printed, and you're just assuming that not everyone's going

34:51.720 --> 34:53.280
to be online at the same time.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.280
Which was a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing to do.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.680
You need to expect the worst case scenario.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.520
You need to have those extra servers.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.040
Stop trying to cut costs.

35:01.040 --> 35:06.240
Because, you know what, you didn't have to make this an online only fucking game.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.760
That's your fault.

35:07.760 --> 35:12.880
Now, um, you know, looking ahead here, if something were to happen, and let's say the

35:12.880 --> 35:17.800
game gets pulled in Korea or something, it's not actually the worst case scenario for Blizzard,

35:17.800 --> 35:22.000
because the real money auction house already doesn't exist in Asia, and I believe that

35:22.000 --> 35:23.160
was also because of Korea.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.520
I wouldn't let them do it.

35:24.520 --> 35:28.840
So, um, it's still one to watch, though.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.940
This is kind of unprecedented.

35:30.940 --> 35:34.720
So I'm very curious to see what comes of this.

35:34.720 --> 35:38.480
If anything, this could also just be, you know, for headlines, and, you know, to let

35:38.480 --> 35:41.960
everybody know we are not messing around, people.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.520
This could just end up being a big slap on the wrist and negative press.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
Who knows?

35:45.520 --> 35:48.120
There's no such thing as negative press.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.240
There's only press.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.240
Interesting way to look at it.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.240
Well, it's true.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.240
I know.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.240
What about press with a negative slant?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.240
What about Lee press-on-nails?

35:56.240 --> 35:57.240
Ew.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
Tacky.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.240
In more ways than one.

36:02.240 --> 36:11.920
Well, speaking of tacky, Konami, bitches, so, how many of us were led to believe that

36:11.920 --> 36:16.280
the Silent Hill HD Collection was a port?

36:16.280 --> 36:19.880
They were porting and then rescanning and redoing voices and stuff.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.320
Up to the part with the fog?

36:21.320 --> 36:23.120
Yeah, I kind of thought that.

36:23.120 --> 36:27.320
Well, it was actually not ported from the final version of the game.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.520
It was ported from incomplete source code.

36:31.520 --> 36:38.240
They actually lost the source codes for the Silent Hill games.

36:38.240 --> 36:44.080
The missing source code parts were replaced with frog DNA, and that's how they got Jurassic

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
Park.

36:45.080 --> 36:51.420
Well, here is what the producer Tom Hewlett had to say.

36:51.420 --> 36:55.880
We got all the source code that Konami had on file, which in turn wasn't the final release

36:55.880 --> 36:57.220
of the games.

36:57.220 --> 37:04.140
So during the debug, we didn't just have to deal with the expected porting bugs, but also

37:04.140 --> 37:08.320
had to squash some bugs that the original team obviously removed prior to release that

37:08.320 --> 37:10.640
we had never seen before.

37:10.640 --> 37:15.400
So it looks like they just were working with what was left over.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.680
It was sort of like what you do when you've got left over spaghetti, but you don't have

37:18.680 --> 37:20.640
enough to make a full meal out of it.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.720
So you like make a sandwich or something out of your spaghetti.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.840
A spaghetti sandwich?

37:24.840 --> 37:25.840
I've done it.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.840
Wow.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
I was in college.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
You know what, ladies and gentlemen?

37:28.840 --> 37:32.360
I don't think any other gaming podcast in the history of ever would compare Silent Hill

37:32.360 --> 37:34.960
HD to a spaghetti sandwich, but there you go.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.560
They're both terrible.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
I don't know.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.560
Spaghetti sandwiches.

37:39.560 --> 37:43.480
Cold spaghetti sandwich on sourdough bread is actually okay.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.120
Just saying, just saying.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.960
It's like kind of like a sloppy joe with noodles.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.520
Subway sells meatball sandwiches.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.520
That's the other half.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.520
They're not very good either.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.240
I was going to say, though, that that's the problem.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.640
That's why we had all the issues, because they used frog DNA instead of fog DNA.

37:57.640 --> 38:01.920
You know, there's no fog in there because they didn't use the right DNA.

38:01.920 --> 38:07.240
You didn't say the magic word, uh, uh, uh.

38:07.240 --> 38:11.400
Well, the other thing, the other quote in here was saying, um, and this is actually

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
pretty funny.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
I'm going to read this.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
Okay.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.280
A lot of issues such as textures and sound had to be taken out of the compiled game.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.060
And that brings with it a host of unique issues, especially when taken on top of the tricky

38:22.060 --> 38:24.240
coding workarounds that play in the original games.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.680
We certainly had our hands full.

38:25.680 --> 38:30.080
I think at one point Heather was blue.

38:30.080 --> 38:35.000
La la la la la la la la la la killing pyramid had wrong game.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.900
Well, if you can't cut it, then don't make the game.

38:39.900 --> 38:45.360
But there's deadlines and investors and stuff.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.600
Angry internets.

38:46.600 --> 38:54.880
I mean, if, if people have decompiled, because you know, people have decompiled the, um,

38:54.880 --> 38:58.080
release versions of the games, why couldn't they just do the same thing?

38:58.080 --> 39:05.720
Well I look at shit like that Sonic HD that like outdid Sonic for episode one and I kind

39:05.720 --> 39:09.080
of go, they did it without the original source code.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.080
Yeah.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.080
No.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.080
All right.

39:12.080 --> 39:17.280
This street, wasn't the streets of rage HD collection done with completely original programming?

39:17.280 --> 39:18.280
Uh, yeah.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.280
There was that fan one.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.280
Yeah.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.280
Yeah.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.640
So those are all both like 2d stuff.

39:22.640 --> 39:27.200
And then once again, this wasn't necessarily something that they needed to make.

39:27.200 --> 39:30.640
They had put these games out before.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.640
Why did they feel compelled?

39:31.640 --> 39:35.560
Oh, I know money because they wanted quick, but we're also, I'm glad I didn't buy it.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.320
We're honestly, where did they put the source code?

39:38.320 --> 39:46.560
Like you would think that kind of stuff goes, uh, smuggled it out in his butt, clearly.

39:46.560 --> 39:51.280
He left Konami and took it with him or, I mean, I guess a drive could get demagnetized

39:51.280 --> 39:53.760
or something, but I mean, how do you lose source code?

39:53.760 --> 39:57.240
That's why you make back ups.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
Someone could find it on eBay.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.840
Did you check behind the couch?

39:59.840 --> 40:01.080
I'm going to look online.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.680
Silent Hill source code.

40:02.680 --> 40:03.680
All right.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.680
Moving on.

40:04.680 --> 40:08.240
Let's travel around the world and check out some, uh, release dates for games coming to

40:08.240 --> 40:11.080
a store near you that are hopefully finished.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.360
Well, there's never a guarantee anymore.

40:13.360 --> 40:18.860
I mean, considering that, you know, the amount of patches and stuff that we get, but this

40:18.860 --> 40:20.360
week we've gotten a few things.

40:20.360 --> 40:27.480
Um, nothing terribly exciting, starting off with, uh, inversion on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
360.

40:28.480 --> 40:33.520
It's like a third person shooter, but you can manipulate gravity.

40:33.520 --> 40:39.640
And then of course Madagascar 3, tying in the new movie that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox

40:39.640 --> 40:43.600
360, Wii, 3DS and DS.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.440
Um, the new play control stuff is being re-released.

40:47.440 --> 40:53.640
We've got the Mario Power Tennis on the Wii, which is a port of the GameCube game.

40:53.640 --> 40:58.520
And then Pikmin 2, because Pikmin 2 never came out over here for some reason.

40:58.520 --> 41:02.960
One of those, oh hey, we localized this game, but oh, we forgot to release it in the other

41:02.960 --> 41:03.960
territory.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.440
That whole new play control thing, right?

41:06.440 --> 41:10.000
It just, well yeah, it came out like a couple in 2009.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.840
We should put out a game on the Wii.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.160
No, it's, it's seriously, hey, hey.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.560
You know that the Wii's just like a GameCube.

41:17.560 --> 41:21.880
We could take GameCube games and we'll add the Wii controls to it.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.440
Yes, you kind of have to add the Wii controls to it because there are no GameCube controls.

41:26.440 --> 41:31.320
In fact, that's actually a guarantee on some of the new consoles because there's no GameCube

41:31.320 --> 41:33.120
controller ports.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.440
Or backwards compatibility anymore.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.560
Or backwards compatibility, yes, very true.

41:37.560 --> 41:45.680
Um, so there's a, oh, oh, oh, and if you're a Sims 3 fan, Jamie.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
I lost count.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.640
The Sims 3 Katy Perry Sweet Treats pack.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.640
Ew!

41:50.640 --> 41:52.200
Mark Katy Perry!

41:52.200 --> 41:53.520
Just in time for the movie.

41:53.520 --> 41:58.040
I have actually officially stopped playing Sims 3.

41:58.040 --> 42:03.560
Because they never, every time they would release it, they would never work out how

42:03.560 --> 42:07.600
to get it to not have the crappy slowdown issue with your add-ons and stuff.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.640
You know what this calls for?

42:09.640 --> 42:11.240
Katy Perry Simlish music!

42:11.240 --> 42:13.240
That was a good video.

42:13.240 --> 42:21.120
That sounds about the same.

42:21.120 --> 42:25.920
I honestly can't tell it's different.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.800
It actually is a cute little video.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.360
She's not a, oh, I forget it.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.360
I need to stop shading.

42:32.360 --> 42:37.840
Alright, and that's, I kid you not, that's literally it.

42:37.840 --> 42:42.000
Unless you count Max Payne 3, which, you know, technically for us is coming out tomorrow,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.200
but it would have been out on Friday, yeah.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
Alright.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
On PC.

42:47.200 --> 42:51.160
Let's travel to Japan and check out the release dates over there.

42:51.160 --> 42:54.280
Not a whole lot to get excited about, but there's a couple games here and there.

42:54.280 --> 43:00.160
On the Playstation 3, Tokyo Jungle comes out this week, and I'm not sure exactly what this

43:00.160 --> 43:01.160
game is.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.640
It sounds like a zombie game.

43:02.640 --> 43:03.880
Fucking amazing is what it is.

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
Is it?

43:04.880 --> 43:05.880
It is awesome.

43:05.880 --> 43:06.880
Let's see, the description here.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.640
Humans disappeared from Tokyo all of a sudden, oh, so it's like 28 days later, leaving the

43:10.640 --> 43:13.160
animals to fend for themselves.

43:13.160 --> 43:16.480
Play the game as various animals in this apocalyptic scene.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
Learn to hunt, gather, and mark territory?

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
Pee.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
Game of the year!

43:20.480 --> 43:22.840
No, I'm serious, this is fucking amazing.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.840
You need to watch this.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
You play by pee?

43:24.840 --> 43:25.840
Right now.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.560
Okay, I will watch this right now if it will load properly.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.200
This is Africa good.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.200
Africa good.

43:32.200 --> 43:33.200
Africa.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.200
Well, where is it?

43:34.200 --> 43:38.280
Just type in YouTube, just type the game's title into YouTube, you'll find it.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.280
Hey, Tokyo Jungle.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.300
Where did you hear about this?

43:41.300 --> 43:42.520
From them talking about Tokyo Jungle.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.920
Is this coming out here?

43:43.920 --> 43:46.000
No, but at least I don't think it is.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.440
It very well could.

43:47.440 --> 43:52.480
I posted actually a thing on Twitter about it, because they were talking about, you know,

43:52.480 --> 43:57.620
like dogs and stuff like that, you know, pomeranes.

43:57.620 --> 43:58.620
You get to be a pomeranian?

43:58.620 --> 43:59.620
Yes, you can be a pomerane.

43:59.620 --> 44:00.620
Oh.

44:00.620 --> 44:01.620
This is a stinkin' add-on.

44:01.620 --> 44:02.620
Let's wait for this.

44:02.620 --> 44:03.620
Boo.

44:03.620 --> 44:04.620
Buy me 30 seconds.

44:04.620 --> 44:09.680
So anyways, yeah, they have pomeranians, they have like wolves you can play as, like, you

44:09.680 --> 44:13.280
know, horses, cows, and they have different rabbits.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.720
Can you be a fox?

44:14.720 --> 44:16.720
I think you can be a fox, you might be able to.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.320
And then, the best part about it is you unlock costumes for them, so you can get an elephant

44:20.320 --> 44:22.940
and roller skates, and you can dress them up.

44:22.940 --> 44:27.120
But it's a ridiculous looking game, I mean, it's just...

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
I need this game.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
It's just crazy.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
Okay, anyways, so now...

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Here we go.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.120
All right, Tokyo Jungle.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.960
It is by Sony.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.560
Or published by Sony.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.560
Oh, it's Japan Studio, okay.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.560
Crispies!

44:41.560 --> 44:45.480
How many freakin' publishers...

44:45.480 --> 44:46.480
Okay.

44:46.480 --> 44:50.640
Okay, so we just see, like, an abandoned city.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.640
Tokyo.

44:51.640 --> 44:52.640
Tokyo.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.640
Dog.

44:53.640 --> 45:03.880
I wasn't a dog, I was, like, a panther person.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.400
This is really terrible radio, y'all.

45:06.400 --> 45:11.160
I'm trying to remember, there was Akotaku, there was it, and I think it was today, there

45:11.160 --> 45:13.080
was a video on there.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.080
Tokyo Jungle.

45:14.080 --> 45:19.160
All right, now it should be, come on, kick into gear, show me the peeing.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.920
I want to see some dogs peeing.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.920
Lions, and bulldogs, and gazelles, and beagles.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.920
Wow, you're...

45:28.920 --> 45:32.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck was that?

45:32.080 --> 45:34.960
It was a dog in a freakin' sumo outfit.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.160
No, that was, like, a...

45:36.160 --> 45:38.560
That looked like a Native American dress thing.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.760
No, look at the big rope behind it, see?

45:40.760 --> 45:41.760
It's got, um...

45:41.760 --> 45:42.760
Oh, it is.

45:42.760 --> 45:43.760
Those are, uh, from Shinto shrines.

45:43.760 --> 45:44.760
Shrines.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.760
That's, like...

45:45.760 --> 45:47.200
Actually, it's just like an Ainu, look at the robe.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.360
He's like the Lion King, but a dog.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.320
He's the Doggin King.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
Giraffes.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
The hell game.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.320
Cow.

45:55.320 --> 45:58.840
Dude, I want to be...

45:58.840 --> 46:02.600
I want to fight between...

46:02.600 --> 46:04.120
Panda bears killing each other.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.120
That was a brown bear and a panda bear.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.120
That's pandemonium.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.120
Chicken, chickies, and piggies.

46:08.120 --> 46:11.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.120
Did we see...

46:12.120 --> 46:15.040
Those two dogs were about to mount each other.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.400
Okay.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.720
Where the fuck is this game?

46:19.720 --> 46:21.760
I will import this shit if I have to.

46:21.760 --> 46:22.760
This looks astoun...

46:22.760 --> 46:23.760
This looks amazing.

46:23.760 --> 46:26.200
Are they going to show this at E3 next week?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.200
I don't know.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.200
That would be hilarious.

46:28.200 --> 46:31.800
Rob, let's get this game, since there's no region coding.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.040
Animal dance.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.040
Animal dance.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.360
Da da da da da da da da.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.360
Animal dance.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
Like, they could set the trailer to that music.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
It would be amazing.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.360
No, you know what they should set it to?

46:40.360 --> 46:41.360
What?

46:41.360 --> 46:42.360
Um, Gilda Radner.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.920
Let's talk Geordi to the animals.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.680
This is the new President Cat, as far as I'm concerned.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
Let's face it, y'all.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
President Cat ain't happening.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.680
Now, I want Tokyo Jungle.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.640
I posted a link on my Twitter.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.640
It was today.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.640
All right.

46:53.640 --> 46:59.320
The story is, like, in Tokyo, little dogs are the king of the jungle, and it's basically

46:59.320 --> 47:00.880
talking about...

47:00.880 --> 47:03.840
It's the commercial, I guess, I think, for the game.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.320
But yeah, it's seriously awesome.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.320
All right.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.520
So yeah, that is now one to kind of keep your eye on, is Tokyo Jungle.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.520
I want...

47:10.520 --> 47:11.520
Oh, man.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.520
Watch.

47:12.520 --> 47:13.520
That'll be like...

47:13.520 --> 47:14.520
Oh, Vida.

47:14.520 --> 47:18.360
That'll be in the corner of the Sony booth somewhere, like, some poor intern doesn't

47:18.360 --> 47:22.440
even know anything about the game and has to show it, and it's just, oh, my gosh.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.440
Africa.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.440
Africa.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.520
But that's what Africa should have been.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.520
That was Africa with killing.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.520
Tokyo.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.160
Tokyo Jungle.

47:31.160 --> 47:36.480
On the PlayStation Vida, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny, and a Hello Kitty game.

47:36.480 --> 47:41.040
Hello Kitty Tohiso Block Crash 5, but let's be real.

47:41.040 --> 47:44.480
You're all waiting for June 14th when Persona 4 comes out on the Vida.

47:44.480 --> 47:48.480
Let's just be real right there, exactly.

47:48.480 --> 47:52.080
Moving on, lastly, to the Xbox 360.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.160
No, nothing until Lollipop Chainsaw on the 14th.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.680
I want to play that.

47:56.680 --> 47:57.680
It does look pretty awesome, huh?

47:57.680 --> 48:00.480
All right, let's move on to the UK.

48:00.480 --> 48:04.560
On June 5th, Madagascar 3, the video game.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.720
I was having to do my...

48:05.720 --> 48:07.720
I should do my riff raff voice.

48:07.720 --> 48:08.720
Master...

48:08.720 --> 48:09.720
No.

48:09.720 --> 48:17.920
On June 6th, we have Virtual Fighter V Final Showdown, and June 8th, Dungeon Bowl, which

48:17.920 --> 48:21.320
I have no idea what it's about, but hey, it's got a neat name.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.320
Chair of Swords for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.320
I'm sorry.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.320
Game of Boring.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.920
I mean, Thrones.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.520
Chair of Swords.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.520
And Rayman Origins.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.520
Chair of Swords.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.520
All right, just a few more stories for you guys.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.560
I did see one cool thing having to do with that show.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.560
What?

48:38.560 --> 48:40.360
We're sitting on the throne.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.720
Just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.760
But first, Loki.

48:44.760 --> 48:49.440
So there are a couple court cases resolved themselves this week.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.640
Epic has one lawsuit against Silicon Knights.

48:52.640 --> 48:58.400
As you may remember, Silicon Knights was complaining that Unreal Engine is too hard to program

48:58.400 --> 48:59.400
in.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
That's why two humans sucked.

49:00.400 --> 49:05.520
It wasn't because we can't make a good game.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.520
And they lost.

49:06.520 --> 49:14.040
So they owe now $4.45 million to Epic, and yeah.

49:14.040 --> 49:19.320
Of course, they are disappointed with the outcome, Silicon Knights, and they're going

49:19.320 --> 49:23.640
to appeal, because it can never end.

49:23.640 --> 49:29.960
And then finally, Activision is also expected back in court again, because Judge has okayed,

49:29.960 --> 49:36.040
no doubt, to continue their lawsuit for their appearance in Band Hero.

49:36.040 --> 49:41.320
You may remember that they claimed the agreement was that they would sing their songs as their

49:41.320 --> 49:44.080
characters, because they have themselves in the game.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.160
However, you can sing anybody's songs with anybody's characters, and so some people took

49:48.160 --> 49:49.840
offense to that.

49:49.840 --> 49:54.880
And so now they apparently can file their lawsuit.

49:54.880 --> 50:00.040
I keep feeling like every few months we hear that that lawsuit has slowly progressed.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.760
Well, I mean, dude, it was originally filed in 2009.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.120
It's been a long time.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.480
Our justice system at work.

50:08.480 --> 50:11.280
Moving on, the Wii U.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.840
More rumors just ahead of E3.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.720
Any day now we'll see if this is true or not, but why not?

50:16.720 --> 50:22.560
We'll engage these rumors, because it's from NeoGaf, so clearly it's true.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.600
But hey, you never know.

50:23.600 --> 50:24.600
You never know.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.480
Some people laughed at some of the things we've posted before, and they ended up being

50:27.480 --> 50:29.000
true, so who knows?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.440
Plus, most of this sounds plausible.

50:31.440 --> 50:35.120
So here's the latest features in the latest dev kit.

50:35.120 --> 50:39.320
Video chat available, but it must be from the main menu of the system, not while playing

50:39.320 --> 50:40.440
a game.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.440
That seems plausible.

50:42.440 --> 50:46.000
Voice commands available.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Why not?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.800
Facial recognition, similar to the Xbox Kinect.

50:49.800 --> 50:54.480
I don't know how well that works, even on the Kinect, and it's something I never use.

50:54.480 --> 50:59.080
And they can technically do it on the DSi and all that, so I mean, yeah, it'll be there,

50:59.080 --> 51:01.960
but it's not going to have a point.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.600
The ability to suspend games, similar to the 3DS.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.560
That'd be cool, and I don't see why not, because they can do that on the Vita, too.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.320
Yeah, duh to that.

51:09.320 --> 51:14.520
Ability to share achievements with friends by sending videos or screenshots with drawings

51:14.520 --> 51:15.520
on them.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.800
That would be pretty cool.

51:17.800 --> 51:22.360
That could make the internet a lot more fun, if you think about it.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.000
The TTP possibilities with that are quite quick.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.760
Yeah, so that could-

51:26.760 --> 51:27.760
Achievement, penis!

51:27.760 --> 51:35.840
Imagine that the game, right up to you getting the achievement, actually takes a video, not

51:35.840 --> 51:39.480
just of your feeding game, but also video of your face.

51:39.480 --> 51:40.480
Like Burnout.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.720
You remember that Burnout game that would show video of you?

51:42.720 --> 51:44.920
So basically it's Pikura.

51:44.920 --> 51:47.680
This could be interesting.

51:47.680 --> 51:51.200
Other interesting one, I want to know if you think this is plausible.

51:51.200 --> 51:55.240
Watch a friend play online.

51:55.240 --> 51:58.880
Well they kind of have that with spectating, but not all games support that, like on Xbox

51:58.880 --> 52:02.120
360, so maybe.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.120
Why not?

52:03.120 --> 52:06.280
It would definitely seem the technology's there, and people are doing it with Ustream

52:06.280 --> 52:08.520
and Twitch TV and all this stuff.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.000
People are just sitting there watching other people play games.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
It would be cool, I mean, I don't know, maybe.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
It'd be interesting.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.480
And lastly, multitasking.

52:17.480 --> 52:22.120
For example, keep a text or video walkthrough open from the site while playing the game.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.880
Swap back and forth as needed.

52:23.880 --> 52:28.120
Can't you do that already with the, well you can on the Vita, I don't remember if you can

52:28.120 --> 52:29.120
do that on the 3DS.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.520
You sort of can.

52:31.520 --> 52:35.480
You can't like have the internet and your game going.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.240
Because those are two different applications, but you can have your game going and then

52:39.240 --> 52:44.600
you can like, I don't, there's not a lot you can do with the game suspended, I don't think.

52:44.600 --> 52:49.280
Because you really, like if you launch anything else, it says, you can go look at your friends

52:49.280 --> 52:50.280
list.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.280
On the 3DS.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.280
And your notifications.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.280
That's about it.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.280
You can.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.920
Because you can like open stuff, as long as you're not trying to run two games at the

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
same time.

52:57.920 --> 53:02.000
I can see that it's possible, also with the other screen, maybe, you know, have a walkthrough

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
on there.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Could be.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.360
So I, hey, if this is all true, especially kind of like the video screenshot drawing

53:09.360 --> 53:13.280
stuff, that's the kind of stuff that I would like Nintendo to surprise us with.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.060
That would make me go, oh okay, maybe they do get online.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.120
So we'll see.

53:18.120 --> 53:21.200
Of course this could just all be fan wank and come visit my website.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.440
Well, and the other thing too, is I don't know how much of this they would actually

53:24.440 --> 53:27.160
be talking about at E3, you know what I mean?

53:27.160 --> 53:29.440
That's a lot of bullet points for stuff.

53:29.440 --> 53:35.080
Oh well, I think all that would come to light in the press announcements or the behind the

53:35.080 --> 53:40.160
scenes, like it's not gonna be at the keynote, but it would, you'd see it behind the scenes.

53:40.160 --> 53:45.160
A lot of that stuff tends to come out of interviews and stuff and sites going in asking the questions,

53:45.160 --> 53:46.520
is this true, is this true?

53:46.520 --> 53:48.640
You know, and some of the stuff they read on the internet.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.640
So.

53:49.640 --> 53:55.600
Alright, well, enough of all this new fangled Wii U drawing penises on your achievement

53:55.600 --> 53:59.480
stuff, let's go back to a time when games were a little bit simpler.

53:59.480 --> 54:03.880
Take a trip down memory lane with a classic game of the week.

54:03.880 --> 54:08.600
Dark Soccer's gonna step into the vault and pull out one game that she thinks, hey, play

54:08.600 --> 54:09.600
this.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.600
Or GTFO.

54:10.600 --> 54:14.920
We didn't have GTFO when I was little, it was get off my lawn.

54:14.920 --> 54:17.240
Here it is, your classic game of the week.

54:17.240 --> 54:23.800
It's Guitar Freaks, wow, is a music game by Konami where you use a guitar.

54:23.800 --> 54:28.920
That should just be all there is to know, but let's go a bit further than that.

54:28.920 --> 54:32.680
Basically it's mostly rock and J-pop.

54:32.680 --> 54:40.680
It's seriously, even every source that you look at is gonna say, oh, that's what led

54:40.680 --> 54:45.300
to Guitar Hero, even though they tried to deny it in my living room that it was because

54:45.300 --> 54:47.720
of Guitar Freaks.

54:47.720 --> 54:54.400
Now it's on its 19th version, Guitar Freaks V8, which came out March 28th, 2011.

54:54.400 --> 55:00.080
And it is said to be the final release of Guitar Freaks V.

55:00.080 --> 55:05.480
There will be a spinoff, Guitar Freaks XG, actually, well, there was one that came out

55:05.480 --> 55:08.800
in Japanese arcades on March 10th, 2010.

55:08.800 --> 55:12.400
Add two more buttons, add it to the fret bar instead of the three.

55:12.400 --> 55:19.560
And there is a sequel called Guitar Freaks XG2 that came out March 9th, 2011.

55:19.560 --> 55:23.560
So the controller looks kind of like a Fender Jazzmaster or a Fender Mustang.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.760
It has three buttons, red, green, and blue.

55:26.760 --> 55:38.440
And it has a pick lever so that you also have a knob that you can use as an effector and

55:38.440 --> 55:42.480
it'll add like chorus and delay effects to your guitar.

55:42.480 --> 55:54.920
Anyway, so it really plays a lot like a reverse pop music or reverse BeatMania 2DX where everything

55:54.920 --> 56:00.560
scrolls very DDR style, you know, from bottom to top, except it uses the bars and you have

56:00.560 --> 56:06.600
to use your strum lever while you hold the appropriate colored button.

56:06.600 --> 56:10.960
And you can pull your bar back when you see a little guitar flashing on the screen and

56:10.960 --> 56:13.400
you get a wailing bonus.

56:13.400 --> 56:19.480
And in some cases you even have hidden things that you can play that will populate this

56:19.480 --> 56:24.000
new, I'm glad you picked that song because that's like one of the best songs ever.

56:24.000 --> 56:35.480
It'll populate a, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh yeah, a new series of items to play

56:35.480 --> 56:37.080
on the screen.

56:37.080 --> 56:40.320
I was actually very distracted because Rob picked Fire, you should play a little bit

56:40.320 --> 56:41.320
of that.

56:41.320 --> 56:42.320
Cool.

56:42.320 --> 56:50.880
My husband and I would play the crap out of this song.

56:50.880 --> 56:55.240
So anyway, basically your life is powered by your...

56:55.240 --> 56:59.880
Wait a minute, this is somebody who edited Fire to be the Mega Man song, that's not the

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
song.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.880
No, but I meant, that's not the song.

57:04.880 --> 57:08.280
That actually is kind of rad though.

57:08.280 --> 57:10.640
Yeah, well I knew it sounded wrong, but I like it.

57:10.640 --> 57:11.640
Alright, let me find the real Fire.

57:11.640 --> 57:14.560
Find the real Fire, because real Fire is good.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.480
Although it sounds very MIDI like.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.480
That is pretty awesome.

57:17.480 --> 57:21.400
See there's the right one.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.400
Yeah this is it.

57:23.400 --> 57:26.480
This is the full version.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.280
That's fine.

57:28.280 --> 57:33.680
Let me get to where the guitar is.

57:33.680 --> 57:38.960
I like the...

57:38.960 --> 57:42.120
I can totally hear where somebody heard the Mega Man song in that though.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.120
Yeah.

57:43.120 --> 57:48.960
Anyway, your scoring depends on how accurate you are with hitting low key.

57:48.960 --> 57:52.560
You have perfect, great, good, poor, and miss.

57:52.560 --> 57:57.520
Ratings of poor and miss will deplete your group gauge, perfect and great will replenish

57:57.520 --> 57:58.520
it.

57:58.520 --> 58:04.160
If your group gauge is empty completely, you fail, and the game is over.

58:04.160 --> 58:10.320
Um, to determine how the cabinet is set up, you have one to five songs, and you can earn

58:10.320 --> 58:16.040
additional songs in some versions of the game like a bonus.

58:16.040 --> 58:22.280
You also have session link, which would hook up the Guitar Freaks with the Dramania, and

58:22.280 --> 58:25.380
basically you have like a little band set up.

58:25.380 --> 58:28.760
But back in the day, we had Super Session.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.240
I miss this so much.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.880
So do I.

58:31.880 --> 58:37.000
There were only two versions of Guitar Freaks and Dramania that had Super Session.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.320
It hooked up with the Keyboard Mania third mix, and that worked with Guitar Freaks fifth

58:42.320 --> 58:47.000
Dramania fourth, and Guitar Freaks sixth Dramania fifth.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.520
And you only have like a handful of songs that you could play on the Super Session,

58:51.520 --> 58:53.840
but they were freaking cool.

58:53.840 --> 59:01.040
Like um, what was the one that we would always, always play that was um, I could not tell

59:01.040 --> 59:03.680
you of this, this far after.

59:03.680 --> 59:12.320
The one that had a really cool drum beat um, Right On Time, that was it.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.320
Wow.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
We would always play Right On Time.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
That's amazing, you remember that.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.800
I actually just listened to that song the other day, but I had the Japanese version

59:19.800 --> 59:21.520
of it, so anyway.

59:21.520 --> 59:26.400
Um, so yeah, there's something like over 500 songs available for Guitar Freaks because

59:26.400 --> 59:31.200
there's been so many versions, thank you Rob.

59:31.200 --> 59:44.880
And uh, this is Right On Time, the drum, when you play this in the uh, medium mode, it was

59:44.880 --> 59:45.880
just like constant.

59:45.880 --> 59:49.800
I could do it for a while, and remember those calluses I had on my hands from playing the

59:49.800 --> 59:54.640
damn drum, because we would buy our own drumsticks, and use our own drumsticks.

59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.800
Um, but um, as far as the different versions of them, I don't even know if I have time

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.880
to list them all because there's so many.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.200
Yeah, let's not.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.400
Well, I'll put it this way.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400
Fuck tons.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.200
We've been everything, we've had regular mixes up to 11th, and then there was an 8th mix

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:23.680
of power-up versions, we've had V2, V3, V4, Rock X Rock, or Rock X Cross Rock, V5, Rock

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:33.840
to Infinity, V6 Blazing, XG, V7, XG2, Groove to Live, V8, XG3 that came out February 2012,

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:42.560
Guitar Freaks V4 and V2 Infinity that were, um, uh, looks like, uh, European releases.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.280
So there's just been all kinds of different versions, and also, um, for, uh, the Drummania

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:54.280
ones over in, um, other countries they were called Percussion Freaks, just saying.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280
So that's it.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.560
I still was waiting for Sax Maniacs.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560
Someday.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Someday.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560
Don't give up hope.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.280
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.520
Guitar Freaks, originally in the arcade, but eventually on the Playstation in Japan.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.760
And uh, clearly part of the inspiration for Guitar Hero, because again, Red Octane, who

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:20.080
funded the original Guitar Hero, used to make, used to make, uh, those controllers for Guitar

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.120
Freaks, which had five buttons on them at one point, which Guitar Freaks never had five

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.280
buttons, and everybody was like, why are they putting out five button controllers?

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.520
XG has it now, ew.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
Alright.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.800
Anyhow, um, we were gonna go right into rapid fire news, I think in light of the power outage

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.960
a couple weeks ago, I think I should save what we've done so far, so let's do a quick

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:49.200
in-studio break, we'll be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.360
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, not live, on this June the 3rd of 2012, but

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.200
psst, it's a radio trick, we're taping on May 31st a few days beforehand, but uh, thanks

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.280
to those of you that showed up to chat along with the show anyway at vognetwork.com, and

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:11.560
we will be back live next week, June the 10th of 2012, and podcast folks, hey, you got another

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.760
show this week, so, enjoy, even though it'll be a little bit shorter tonight, because we're

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.320
missing the live interaction, and just, since it's earlier in the week, there's not as much

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.720
to talk about, but hey, we do still have plenty of news, including tonight's rapid fire news,

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.360
which Loki's gonna start us off with.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.840
Yes, there is a new Ratchet & Clank game announced, it will also be, well actually, it's only

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.160
gonna be released on the Playstation Network, kind of like what they did with the second

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.880
Ratchet & Clank game, or no, there's like a middle Ratchet & Clank game, like the second

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.240
and the third one was out on the consoles, but it's Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault,

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.500
and it's coming this fall.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.000
All those Ratchet & Clank games have kind of suggestive names, don't they?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.120
Yeah, I mean, the last one that was released only on the Playstation Network was Ratchet

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:06.200
& Clank Future Quest for Booty, so, I don't know, but yeah, it looks interesting, if you're

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200
a Ratchet.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.600
Did they find the booty?

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:15.080
They probably did, of course, it's been rumored for a while that Battlefield 3 is gonna try

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.600
to pull Call of Duty Elite and come out with their own service, and they have, it actually

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.760
leaked out, and then they finally announced it, well actually, no, I believe it leaked

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.040
out and they, I don't know if they've confirmed it or whatever, but what ended up happening

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.560
is there's this Battlefield 3 premium service, it's gonna cost you 50 bucks, and includes

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.280
five themed expansion packs, some of which have already been announced, and actually

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.560
one that's already out, back to Carcland, which was a pre-order bonus if you bought

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:52.320
the game, and then of course the Close Quarters DLC, which I think is out, or it's coming

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:59.180
out, no, it's coming out next week, on June 4th, and then they have, let's see, Armored

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.480
Kill, Aftermath, and Endgame are the next three as well, and apparently you're gonna

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:11.480
get exclusive weapons and also two weeks access early to said packs as well of other unique

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.960
in-game items if you pay 50 bucks.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.360
I don't know, it seems like they're trying to copy what they're doing with Call of the

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.680
Elite, and of course they're gonna want to do that because, if it works, if the shoe

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.920
fits, they made quite a bit of money, but originally it came out, it was on the European

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:32.280
PlayStation Network store, and then it got pulled, but, you know, once it's on the internet,

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.160
that's right, screenshots, so, alright, well moving on, if you want to get some good games

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.760
and do some good, there's always the Humble Indie Bundle available at HumbleBundle.com,

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.560
and you know, every time one of these bundles comes out, the internet blows up with, best

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.960
one yet, well, the fifth one, Humble Indie Bundle 5, was just announced today, and guess

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:59.720
what, best one yet, I already bought it, like for real, like, okay, here's the deal, Psychonauts,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.720
Limbo, Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery, EP, and Amnesia are all available, and if you

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:12.560
pay above the average price, you get Bastion, which, you know, all, there's tons of great

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.240
games, every single one of those games is something, got it for five dollars and sixty

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.840
cents to get Bastion, I'm sure that the average price is way higher, I've already got most

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.560
of those, yeah, I know, I have Amnesia, but you know what, it's not just about being able

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.340
to get the games cheap, but that you are doing some good, because the money doesn't just

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.120
go to the developers, but it goes to, if you want, again, you get to choose how you divvy

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.720
up the money, it goes to the Humble Indie Bundle, or Child's Play Charity EFF, so if

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.580
you want, you can plunk down fifteen bucks, give it all to Child's Play Charity, and say

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.880
to everybody else, none for you, buy, and that's how, you know, you divvy up the money.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.480
Right now, as of the taping of the show, the minimum is seven dollars and fifty-one cents,

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.640
I imagine that's gonna climb closer to ten bucks by the time, it's still worth it, shit,

01:05:53.640 --> 01:06:01.320
these games together, easily worth sixty, for, honestly, the price of a regular retail

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.320
game, why not? So, if you're feeling charitable, or shit, you just want some good games, head

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.000
over to HumbleBundle.com, again, it's been, it's been out for one day, already up to one

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.720
hundred and eighty-seven thousand, one hundred and, this number's just climbing, forty-six,

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.940
eight, fifty, just keeps climbing, I imagine by the time Sunday rolls around, they'll easily

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:28.900
be at a half million. Easily. Easy. So, Humble Indie Bundle 5. Uh, we kinda mentioned this

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:33.680
already earlier in the show, but, if you missed it, Game Informer Magazine is teasing, in

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:39.960
the shadows, a new Gears of War, apparently to be on the July issue of their magazine,

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.760
obviously, if this is, you know, what it is, it could be Gears of War 4, it could be a

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:50.360
Gears of War spin-off game, it's a prequel, so, just like pre-Gears of War. It's a prequel,

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.720
Gears of Battle. It's a prequel because of spoilers regarding the main characters, so.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.400
I see, okay. There, there, there cannot be a sequel with the main character. Well, that,

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.280
it doesn't, whoever said it had to be the main character, it could be the main, look,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.040
in one of the Mass Effect games, it's Phoenix, they kill Shepard and bring him back, and

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.360
that's not a spoiler because that's in the very beginning of the game, Mass Effect 2,

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:18.360
so anything is possible, you know? I always love when people say, oh no, they can't do

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.440
it, it's a prequel. Time travel and shit, they can do whatever they want, look what

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.600
they did with Star Trek, for fuck's sake. It's another Gears of War game. They found

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.680
a way to maybe bring Con back, although they swear up and down it's not gonna happen. Whatever,

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:34.640
it's another Gears of War game. Alright, well whatever it is, it's coming soon, as in E3

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:42.040
soon. Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura. Um, yeah. Some more stuff, how about Spy Hunter?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.760
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Well, I was playing that

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:50.040
on my iPad, actually, the Spy Hunter, which, the control sucks, because it's no steering

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:57.460
wheel, you have to tilt your iPad. Well, um, basically it's a reboot on the handhelds,

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:08.000
it's basically super spy racing type game. Ooh. Um, basically you are the, uh, the spy,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.720
and you have to go catch bad guys. And you do that in a fast vehicle, and you destroy

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:20.080
enemy vehicles. Your car is called the G-6155 Interceptor, which is, uh, supposed to transform

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.320
from a supercar to offer an assault vehicle to a speedboat. So, you can, uh, go hunt and

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.120
capture those nasty, nasty spies. But the real question is, did they license the theme

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.440
from Peter Gunn, because if not, forget it. Uh, they have the theme in the, um, a remix

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.880
dubstep of the, oh god. Dubstep is evil. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.820
doo doo doo doo doo. Anyways, Bingdom by Warner Brothers Interactive, um, and, uh, yeah. It's

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:54.720
supposed to be on 3DS and PS Vita in the fall. You know. What do dubstep and downtown Julie

01:08:54.720 --> 01:09:02.200
Brown have in common. Wubba wubba. Wubba wubba wubba! So Capcom has registered a trademark

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:08.320
for a potential game called Remember Me. We don't really know anything else about that

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:14.520
except that it was filed on May 22nd this year, in both the US and Europe. So maybe

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.360
this will be something at E3? Who knows? Who cares? It could be the subtitle to another

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:29.440
game too, right? It may not necessarily be a standalone game. Maybe. Remember Me, the

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.240
sensible Capcom, they put out regular games that were fun and people liked buying them

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.480
and we didn't have download content that was on disk. Remember Me, sensible Capcom? Well,

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.640
I'm gone forever. And now it's time for a joke that nobody but maybe two of our listeners

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:57.840
will get. Actually, you know what I was distracted by, Rob? A story about this guy eating his

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.160
roommate's brain and heart. Ew, that's like that grody old, have you read about all that

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.920
crap coming out of Canada? That doesn't happen in Canada. The guy eating faces in Florida,

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.080
but if I lived in Florida I'd probably go crazy too. What is wrong with humanity right

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.440
now? This guy was in Maryland, I think he was too close to the capitol. Is it the moon?

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.640
Is it that big moon going on causing people to eat people's faces? Well, it's always something

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:30.080
like that. Asteroid, moon, virus, Wednesday, I don't know, it causes zombies. But the guy

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.200
was turned in actually by his dad. People stop being ridiculous. Oh, that guy in Canada

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:41.800
got caught finally? No, no, this guy named Alexander Kinyua ate his roommate's heart

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:49.200
and brain and his dad found him with the head and hands in a bucket in his basement. His

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.080
dad turned him in. Do not Google that guy who they want in Canada because you'll read

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.560
all these stories about it. He didn't just do fucked up things to humans and you will

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:04.800
get mad. You will get mad. Allegedly, I have to say allegedly. But there was a guy in Japan

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.800
who killed a couple of women and ate them and now he's a celebrity and does tours. What?

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.600
Serious. And no evidence. It's gone. He wrote. That sounds like the plot of natural born

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.520
killers. Did you ever see that? No, that was Robert Downey Jr. back when he was on drugs.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.800
I'll find the guy's name. But he he he did it like 30 years ago and now he like goes

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:31.320
around doing tours about what it's like to eat people. That's totally sounds like the

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.920
plot to natural born killers. All right. Ayo. Moving on. I need some happiness and cheerfulness.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.920
So let's look at video games. Loki. I got his name. No, I don't want it. His name is

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:46.960
Issei Sagawa. Send it back. You know, there's nothing more happier and cheerful than Doom

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:56.300
3. Doom 3 is getting the HD treatment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. And not only

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:02.760
are you getting Doom 3 with HD graphics, extra levels, 3D support. They even have head mounted

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.840
display support, which I'm not really sure there's that many head mounted displays out

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.040
there. I know that apparently John Carmack made one and it had duct tape on it. Here's

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:19.640
the thing. John Carmack has one. So that's why it's in the game. Oh, yeah. So he's supporting

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:26.560
it. And yeah, Doom one and two are also included and it's supposed to be out this fall. So

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:35.000
that's kind of cool, I guess. I mean, here's another awesome question. Why Doom 3? Because

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.440
just because maybe it was kind of over, I don't want to say it was overlooked, but it

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:44.040
certainly didn't have that same cultural grab that the first two did. Well, Doom 3, because

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:54.080
they are new game rage bombed. Why not Quake 3? Well, Quake 3 was Quake. It's basically

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.200
Quake Live now. Yeah, Quake Live, which I think, don't they have Quake 3 on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.800
They do, you're right, they do. I actually have it. And technically they're releasing

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.560
Quake, well they actually are releasing Quake 4 again. Really? Quake 4 wasn't very good.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.600
On Xbox 360. That was one of the launch titles for 360, remember that? Yeah, here's the thing

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.600
I want to kind of know about it though, is remember, the launch title, and hopefully

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.720
you can find it dirt cheap now, it, I mean the game wasn't very good, but it came with

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:29.080
Quake 2 on another disc. Which was good. That's right. The even, the even numbered Quakes,

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.000
it's like the opposite of Star Trek, the even numbered Quakes are not very good. Quake 2

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.840
was pretty good. It wasn't a fan. Quake 3 was great. Compared to 1 and 3, I mean 3 was

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.320
like the best. Ascii Quake, Rob. It's only gonna be 20 bucks, it's supposed to be coming

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.840
out in like two weeks. Well that's pretty awesome. Or you can buy one of the original

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:54.600
copies for probably like 5 bucks, and get it now. Alright. Well if you're not into first

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.580
person shooters, maybe you're into first person role playing games, and one of the biggest

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:04.320
ones out there right now is Skyrim, and guess what, finally an expansion coming, we don't

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.760
know exactly when yet, but we do finally have a title. This is one of those like, pre-E3

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.080
leaks where the companies try to get a jump on all that press coverage that's gonna be,

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.780
you know, cause everybody's fighting for time during E3 week. Like literally, I mean things

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:21.200
get brutal during E3 week, like literally there's invites out there that are telling

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.700
people, hey cancel your meeting and come to our booth. Like, really? That's how desperate

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:32.360
people are to get seen at E3. So some people get the jump on it. So Bethesda leaked the

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.840
trailer for Skyrim Dawnguard, the expansion, a little bit early. And you know there's a

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.100
whole trailer out there that doesn't really say a whole lot except that there's gonna

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.800
be a crossbow weapon, which we kinda already knew from some of the patch things. What is

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.120
this? You can turn into a bunch of bats, so there's a vampire theme going on, which was

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.440
already in the game, right? You can already be a vampire, but this actually shows like

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.120
you can transform into like a giant bat thing and like fly, like kind of a really weird

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.480
No no no no no no no bat thing. You know, bat thing, I don't know. You know, once again

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.840
though the graphics, you know, look pretty good cause it's all in the, you know, Skyrim

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.720
engine which looked good to begin with. Here's the somewhat bummer, if you were playing this

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.360
on the Playstation 3 like I was or the PC like Alan was, you're shit out of luck cause

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:23.820
this is coming to the Xbox 360 first for 1600 Microsoft points, that's 20 bucks in real

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:30.920
money soon, as in this summer soon. 30 days later is when the rest of us can play it because

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:39.400
Microsoft basically sold their soul to get this and so can you in the expansion to Skyrim.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:44.920
Because Microsoft gives it up better. So, I like the little castle on fire, the little

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:51.520
like dark castle looking thing. It's like the little obsidian portal in Minecraft, but

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.800
prettier. Uh, Loki, you played way more Skyrim than I did, what's your interest level in

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.120
this? I'm interested in it, um, I'm not as excited as before, you know, cause I was like

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.640
oh I'm gonna get whatever expansion they put out, but like it has to do with vampires.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.760
I haven't really done anything with vampires, I've been just trying to make sure I don't

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.640
turn into a vampire because it's lame. Um, not because of Twilight, but I just don't

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.320
want to be a vampire or a werewolf in the game. I like that horse that was on fire though.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.040
I like that map. But, we'll see. That glowing electron. Oh I think that was the Elder Scrolls.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.560
Um, you know what though, when you said that you were interested in that it totally made

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.680
me think of Alucard. I'm interested in this. That is kinda, it does look like you can play

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.720
as Alucard in this. That would be cool. I would play Skyrim if I could be Alucard. I

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:42.320
just wish. You can name your character Alucard. I mean, it would be really impossible for

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.880
them to add it later on cause it's such a rewrite of code, but I just want, you know,

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.120
I know that they have Skyrim, or not Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, which is really weird

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.000
because it gets lamer and lamer each update that they put out on it. It's like every update

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.200
that there is for it, I get less and less interested in this game. But, I really wish

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:10.400
there was just like co-op. Like four player co-op in Skyrim would be fucking awesome.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:16.280
Alright. Well, this is the part of the show where we'd move into the mailbag segment,

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:23.200
except there's no emails tonight. So, instead we're gonna plug and say, email us! Mailbag

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:29.360
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us. And we'll read your email next week. Shirley,

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.760
with E3 going on, there's gonna be something that makes you want to email us and have your

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.600
voice heard. So, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. And don't call them Shirley. Alright, let's

01:17:37.600 --> 01:18:00.480
get into the FUs of the week. Lack of email makes us angsty. Um, my FD goes to this continuously

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:10.040
not having a voice. So, yeah. Boo. Loki? Um, FU to the fact that I can't go to E3. I kind

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.760
of miss going to E3 each year. It's been a couple years now that I haven't been able

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.800
to go. Even if it is a lame E3, I still like going and playing this stuff. And my co-worker,

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:29.080
well not my co-worker, my boss and his boss get to go. They go to meetings. It's like,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.360
so what did you go check out at E3? Oh, we didn't even go on the show floor. The fuck

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:38.720
are you doing there then? Oh, I'm going to meetings. Oh, because you can't have meetings.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.440
To be fair. I understand. It is business. No, okay, no. I understand. It's business.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.600
But then they go through like, oh, we went through a couple of booth walkthroughs of

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.600
like, like what was it? Last year. I'm trying to think of what they saw last year. It was

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:01.440
something very lame. I don't even remember what it was. It may have been Bethesda. But

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:08.440
yeah, it's just, they waste time there. We would like to display our new game cat butthole.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.320
No, no, no. I do take that back. It is their fault because you know why? Because they only

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.200
go down for like one or two days. They miss a day or two of the time there and like, what

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.760
the fuck? You could be hitting the show floor. But here's the thing. They don't fucking care

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:32.920
and his boss. I'm sorry. Look, maybe next year, maybe next year. Um, I F you to just

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.240
too much to do and not enough time to do it and F you to the fact that I kind of bring

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:43.120
that on myself. So F you to that. That's what you get for procrastinating. It's not even

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.960
procrastinating. It's just maybe, maybe I don't know how to say no. And maybe I need

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.560
to learn that has nothing to do with this program or vog or anything like that. It's

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:58.000
just other things in life that maybe I need to just say, maybe it's time to stop because

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:08.280
I'm just too damn busy. So what? It is possible to say no. I say it to you all the time. No.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:14.900
All right. Anyhow, that's it for the F you to the week. Let's get into a few more stories

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:20.680
for you guys before we say good night. Loki. Um, there's rumor that, well, there's always

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:26.200
a rumor that there's going to be an announcement of an, a redesign of the three ds, but, um,

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.480
it's actually looking like that it may actually happen this year. Um, and the reason behind

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.140
that is Amazon has stopped carrying the three ds. Um, not necessarily that they've stopped

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:41.040
selling it, but they themselves have stopped selling it on the website. It's only available

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.360
through third party. Um, you know, providing like, cause you know, like any, anybody can

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:52.020
go on Amazon sell stuff, but there's actually stuff that's sold directly by Amazon and that's

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:58.220
in the U S region. Not only that, but in Japan they also have stopped, um, having the three

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:03.800
ds available. So why do you think they've stopped selling the three ds? Maybe because

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.560
there's another three ds coming out. Did somebody report the original three ds is flawed to

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.700
Amazon and they stopped selling it. That could have happened too. Maybe. No. So I, well,

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.940
what about the new color? I know that's crazy, but weren't they going to discontinue like

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.020
blue or something because of the new color pan. They just continue. I'm talking about

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:27.780
all colors, every single color in the U S right now. It will maybe not purple, but everything

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:35.340
Aqua blue, Pearl, pink, um, Cosmo, black and flame red are all being shipped. Um, never

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:40.100
fulfilled by Amazon. In other words, you know, they were doing the shipping, but not sold

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:49.300
by Amazon. Um, so it's interesting. Um, the other thing is, you know, there, the thoughts

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:54.020
are that there's a rumor that they're going to announce monster Hunter for, um, the three

01:21:54.020 --> 01:22:03.540
ds coming, you know, this E3 as well for the North American region. All right. I mean,

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:11.420
there's going to be a redesign. It's just when I think it could be this holiday. Uh,

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:17.860
this is pretty shitty is a rumors and fakeness all over the interwebs. And, uh, I, I, I did

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.860
want to bring it up though because there was a part of me that went, well, what if square

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.900
Unix announced what's going to be at their booth? That part's not a lie. And what I thought

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.780
was interesting was completely missing from that list was final fantasy versus 13 because

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.660
it's like, shouldn't that fucking game be out by now? Like how long has that been in

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:38.160
development and we've, you know, whatever. So the thought out there is, well, maybe it's

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.540
like a secret. Maybe something's happening with it and they're going to show it at one

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:47.940
of the conferences or something. So this crazy ass rumor came out complete with fake footage

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:55.060
that final fantasy versus 13 was renamed to final fantasy 15 to be fair. That part I'd

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:59.100
actually believe. I know a lot of people poo pooing that idea. I'd actually believe that.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:03.020
I still don't understand how they tie with each other. And you know what? I believe more

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:07.980
that they renamed final fantasy versus 13 to final fantasy 14. What do you mean there

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:18.220
was already a, just shh, but there's already a file fancy for shh. Anyhow, uh, it's just,

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.380
and apparently the game was going to be coming to the Wii U. Now people, and I guess it's

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:27.460
because of the footage was, I didn't even watch the footage, but I'm looking at it here.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:34.340
This like one minute clip here. Oh God, you can just tell that that's an overlaid thing.

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.220
But apparently, you know, people are watching this footage or whatever, and then you see

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:47.300
the logo for final fantasy 15 and yeah, it doesn't look too convincing. Um, but it did

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:52.220
kind of make me stop and go, well, why couldn't it be on the Wii U? I mean the Wii U is supposed

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:57.540
to be getting all this other stuff. Here's why they wouldn't put it all only on the Wii

01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:01.740
U. It's because we're supposed to be fair with PlayStation three and Wii U like somebody

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.340
took out the Xbox logo and put the Wii U logo. They're not going to do that. I mean, come

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.380
on. They know, they know that they need to make money on this stuff. They're not going

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:17.180
to cut out the Xbox just because the Wii U, I mean they're, they, they sold plenty of

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.660
copies of, you know, final fantasy 13 and 13 two on the Xbox that they're not going

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.540
to ignore that 14 was cut for totally different reasons that had to do with the Xbox live

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:30.900
infrastructure rules that were bent from final fantasy 11. Microsoft would not bend on again

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:36.820
because 11 didn't do that well on Xbox. So it, I, they're not going to do that. I'm sorry

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:42.940
if it's anything going to be for the Wii U or even like it's always been their own game

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:47.340
that's been kind of lame on the Wii. So I think if there's anything on the Wii U, it's

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:54.540
going to be another lame Crystal Chronicles game. Same. You never know. Well that if that

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.700
whole Wii U being similar to the Game Boy Advance linking to the GameCube, there was

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:03.300
that final fantasy game that was specifically for that setup. So it'd be very easy to make

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:08.060
a sequel to that. Just don't see them doing, I don't, I don't see them coming out with,

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:12.020
cause I've seen like rumors, of course, everybody's making up fucking rumors. I mean, there's,

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.780
there's a rumor I read and even open the page because it just looks stupid. They're talking

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:21.820
about, oh, Kingdom Hearts remix. It's going to have all these different characters and

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.220
stuff from all these games. It's only going to be on the Wii. I'm like, no, it's not.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.080
They're not going to do that. Could Square be withholding Kingdom Hearts 3? Can I wish?

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.260
Can I wish? They've got, they've got plenty of stuff that they're working on right now.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.760
If wishes and musts were buckets of, or no, damn it. If wishes and musts were clusters

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.620
of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola. I screwed that up the first time. Sorry. It's

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:50.900
a tongue twister. All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the end

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:55.740
of the show cause there's no Skypline tonight cause we're not live, but Dark Saga. Well,

01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:02.100
it is official according to Tim Cook with Apple. Um, they don't really care about doing

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.780
consoles. They're not interested in doing it right now. Maybe someday, but not now.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:13.420
They're, I mean, basically they're cool with the little, uh, IOS games. That's cool. In

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:18.100
fact, he says customers love games and this makes me think of bitches love games, you

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.780
know, but, um, he goes on a record saying, I'm not interested in being in the console

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:27.420
business and what is thought of as traditional gaming, but Apple is a big player today and

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:33.000
things in the future will only make that bigger. Well, if the rumor is true that they're building

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.980
their own TVs and shit, then they can just take the iPad, iPhone stuff over to the TV.

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.980
That's their money. It's just not console in the traditional sense. That's all. But

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:46.320
you can't deny it. Apple's a player in gaming right now. They're probably thinking that

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:53.980
they're beyond consoles anyway, so we're bigger than console. Really? Yeah. I mean, Smurfs

01:26:53.980 --> 01:27:01.140
village just, you know, puts that gears award a shame. They just, they really don't need

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:05.380
it. I mean this, to be honest, they don't need, I don't want to see Apple do a console.

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:09.500
What they're doing right now is challenging the industry enough. I think, you know, especially

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:14.660
Nintendo, the handheld market, they are, you can't deny that the iPhones and iPads are

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:21.340
breathing a lot of heat on not just the Vita, but the, you know, three DS to the point where

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:27.780
shareholders are calling on Nintendo to put Mario on the iPhone, which is, don't be terrible.

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:32.420
I actually agree. It would be terrible cause the touch controls just wouldn't work. On

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:38.740
a whim. I got mega man two on the iPhone. It is ass. It is the stuff that comes from

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:42.660
the stuff comes out of an ass. You know what they could do though on the iPhone that would

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:47.500
work is, um, like a Zelda game, like they have on the three. Yes. It was all stylist

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:55.220
control. Oh yeah. It worked. It might work, but it's still side. All right, well that

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:59.140
brings us to the end of the show. I checked Twitter earlier and nothing was sent today

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.380
and uh, we don't have the Skype line cause we're not live. So that really brings us to

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.460
the end of the show. I will ask Loki if there was anything we didn't cover tonight that

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.420
he wanted to talk about last minute stories or dark soccer. Oh, you do have one. All right.

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:18.860
Guitar P. It is a guitar P urinal that basically has like little strum bars in it and a big

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.420
fret bar coming out of the top that you can pee in it and then you can actually get a

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:28.460
code to download your piece on later. You know what's sad is that as a second time we've

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:32.700
talked about P based games in a month. I, that's why I brought it up. I weep for our

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:40.220
society is apparently a video up of what guitar P sounds like. No thank you. Yeah. Um, yeah,

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.740
I do have a few things I was just going to cover real quick. So someone supported super

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:51.580
road blaster to the SNES now super road blaster. Um, or I should say a road blaster, which

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:57.540
was a 1985 laser disc arcade game with animations like full motion video thing like a dragon's

01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:04.180
layer or something like that. Um, he's actually created a rom file. That's 6,320 megabits.

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:09.720
Although when you compare that with the largest SMES cartridge, which is like 48 megabits,

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.780
it's a little impossible to run without special software. Um, you can actually get a card

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:21.180
or SD, um, to SNES, uh, SD card adapter. They'll allow you to run the game on a physical SNES

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:26.420
and it actually, it works and you can download the rom, which is 118 megs over it. Well,

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:31.900
for a super Nintendo rom, that's huge. Um, and uh, it plays a full motion video and everything.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.740
It's pretty amazing. So that cartridge back in the day probably would have cost about

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:44.780
$900. Yeah. It would have had to be like a super gigantic box. It would be the size of

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:51.860
a constantly the size of the super NAS basically. Um, so they have that, uh, CD project red.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:56.820
Um, they announced a cyberpunk, um, which is going to be based off the pen and paper

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.820
game. And I'm all about, you know, RPGs are like, you know, the cyberpunk stuff. So that

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:05.980
looks pretty cool. I do have a late tweet. We got a tweet just now, uh, or I should say

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.900
an hour ago, but that was, uh, while we were in the middle of the show. So here's a question

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:15.260
from Oscar who sent a legit question for the show tonight. So we need to entertain it here.

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:22.260
Oscar tweets us at twitter.com slash O L R asking tweet for the show. What is a game that frustrated

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:31.300
you like no other, a game that frustrated you like no other puzzle and Dessu was one.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:36.260
Why is that? Just cause some of the puzzles get really hard and fast. I mean, it was just

01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:42.220
a pain. And then, um, shoot at something that actually will fractal actually for a little

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:47.820
while was getting me super frustrated because, um, I'm on the part now where you have splits

01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:54.540
in weird places and um, it'll like completely mess up. You're trying to get your blooms.

01:30:54.540 --> 01:31:03.460
So it's pretty fucked up. And a few, um, games with puzzles in them, few puzzles. For me,

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:07.380
super meat boy, let me put it this way. Alan used to like ask me to play super meat boy

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.380
cause he used to giggle when I would get really frustrated with the game. Like it was some

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:14.540
type of satisfaction for him. So, uh, definitely super meat boy. But that's the whole point

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:19.960
of that game is to get frustrated and want to throw the controller. Loki. Um, VVVVV.

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:25.920
Oh God. Yes. Oh my God. I know what the, here's the thing is I played that game without downloading

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:32.180
on steam and then I just now download it on steam. I can't import my safe. I'm like, fuck

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:37.980
that. You can actually copy it, copy it directly out of the safe folder. I hope so. Cause I

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.980
Not fucking doing that again

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:45.000
On the on the 3ds. I'm just stuck in one level that I'm never gonna get past

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.900
It's when that little asshole is following you and you can't get him killed either

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:55.600
I finished all that but I have one more like little shiny object thing to get and it's just like

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.280
No, I'm no I'm not doing it quit

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.740
Quit I don't care all right. There's the tweet. Sorry any other stories Loki

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:10.940
um yeah retro city rampage speaking of super meat boy has this cool little trailer that they put out for a

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:18.380
Game within the game called the virtual meat boy. It's done like virtual the virtual boy, but you're playing as meat boy

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.380
Oh, that's awesome

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:21.260
And you also get to play as me boy in the game, too

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:26.540
And it has 3d with like the red red blue glasses if you wanted that's funny because

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:31.920
Super meat boy kind of had those throwback stages like there was the NES stages, and there was a gameboy stage

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:36.720
I a virtual boy stage makes a lot of sense. That's kind of funny actually yeah, that's pretty awesome

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.760
And then the last thing I was gonna mention real quick well actually two things

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.760
Nintendo's patented a new kind of input device for the 3ds. It's a vibrating stylus

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.960
It's gonna allow you to have some sort of haptic feedback for

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.760
stuff based on the position I guess of

01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:00.520
Where the stylus is the camera? I guess the vibrating stylus has changed things around you know usually

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520
We have a saying on the show called

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:09.360
TTP whenever there's a new piece of hardware coming out, and that's time to penis, but I think this one's gonna be time to but

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.760
TTB

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:19.560
Maybe boob or V and then the last last one was kind of in the line of

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.520
Why the fuck did they make this CTA did?

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.320
our CTA

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.020
Company that makes accessories, and I think they've made they made that

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.100
I
