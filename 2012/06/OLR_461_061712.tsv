0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	8000	Who's your hosts?
8000	13000	Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
14000	16000	Tonight, June 17th, 2012
16000	19000	Have new details leaked out on the next Xbox?
19000	23000	Rumors intensify that Star Wars The Old Republic may go free to play
23000	26000	And did Nintendo withhold some big games from E3?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio
39000	42000	Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network
42000	44000	Or the Voice of Geeks Network
44000	46000	www.vognetwork.com
46000	49000	Where we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
49000	52000	Every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
52000	54000	But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well
54000	56000	And that's okay too
56000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host
59000	63000	To talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys
63000	66000	First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
66000	68000	People are confusing
68000	69000	Why?
69000	70000	Just because
70000	71000	Am I sending you mixed signals?
71000	75000	No, I'm just wondering why I'm like actually in a somewhat good mood
75000	77000	And everybody else is pissy
77000	79000	You're not pissy
79000	80000	You've thrown off the balance
80000	81000	Yeah, I'm not pissy
81000	84000	I maybe wasn't as chipper in the opening as I usually am
84000	88000	But that's because I had the coffee an hour ago as opposed to five minutes ago
88000	90000	I just finished my coffee, it was fantastic
90000	91000	It was delicious
91000	94000	But I've noticed at Whole Foods there's two types of people
94000	98000	There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods, what are you doing here?
98000	101000	And then there's the, oh let me, go ahead of me
101000	106000	Like the lady, I had like my salad, she's like, why don't you check out ahead of me? Go on
106000	107000	You sure?
107000	108000	Yeah, go ahead
108000	110000	I wish there was more people like that in the world
110000	118000	So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods
118000	121000	Alright, say hello as well to tech master Loki
121000	122000	Hello
122000	124000	Who is not at Whole Foods today
124000	125000	No
125000	126000	How you doing, Loki?
126000	132000	I tend to like to buy my food in, you know, the whole form
132000	134000	Is that like a Costco endorsement? I'm not sure
134000	138000	No, I'm just saying that like, you know, I don't want half foods
138000	140000	I see, alright, I get it, there's a joke there
140000	144000	Alright, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room
144000	147000	If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com
147000	151000	The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room
151000	156000	And checking the comments in our chat room, I'm not sure
156000	160000	Let's see, I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts, I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac
160000	162000	You know, I checked out that game this week
162000	165000	I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago
165000	167000	That game's messed up
167000	168000	It is, it really is
168000	170000	That's a disturbing little game
170000	174000	And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy
174000	175000	But it's a very different kind of game
175000	178000	It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it
178000	180000	But looks can be deceiving, it's more like a twin stick shooter
180000	182000	In Zelda's kind of box
182000	185000	I have wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks
185000	189000	It may work, you can do like a, it tells you, it's weird
189000	192000	When you go into the options, it tells you, use joy to pad
192000	194000	To use whatever joystick
194000	195000	I've just been using the keyboard
195000	197000	If someone says, don't know what it is? Google it
197000	198000	Which I found funny
198000	200000	I've just been using keyboard
200000	203000	But I was just, I thought it was very strange
203000	206000	Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo
206000	208000	Which I might find treasure in
208000	209000	And I was like, this is
209000	210000	The hell is this?
210000	213000	I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him
213000	214000	But I won't spoil it, I won't spoil it
214000	215000	This crazy mom
215000	217000	Did you get any of the items?
217000	221000	Cause one of the first items you get is mom's underpants
221000	222000	And I was like
222000	224000	I actually didn't get too far into it
224000	225000	This creeper right there
225000	227000	Cause I had mass effect
227000	231000	Alright, well we are going to talk about our gaming weeks
231000	233000	And all the games that we've been playing this week
233000	236000	But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things
236000	237000	At the top of the show here
237000	239000	For one, if you were listening to Bobby
239000	241000	When he gave us a call there at the end of the show
241000	244000	He said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting
244000	245000	And that's correct
245000	248000	You know next year, or next year, next week
248000	252000	Is the ten year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio
252000	253000	If you can believe it
253000	255000	We had our very first show
255000	257000	Way back on the live 365 network
257000	261000	June 23rd of 2002
261000	263000	And here we are, ten years later
263000	265000	For some reason, still doing this
265000	269000	And no, I know why we still do this
269000	271000	But it's interesting because a lot of shows
271000	272000	You know, I'm not
272000	275000	I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows
275000	277000	Cause you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts
277000	278000	And all that other stuff
278000	280000	But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?
280000	282000	You know, there's a lot of shows that don't make it
282000	284000	You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last
284000	286000	Heck, two or three years even
286000	289000	It's a milestone to get to one year
289000	293000	What do you think has caused us to go for ten whole years
293000	296000	Where other people don't make it?
296000	298000	We've set the bar really low
298000	301000	That's true
301000	303000	You know, we don't have a huge audience
303000	304000	And that's okay
304000	307000	You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show
307000	308000	I mean, we were doing
308000	309000	That first show
309000	310000	You're doing better than twelve
310000	312000	The first show was for twelve people
312000	314000	And for internet radio, that was huge
314000	316000	You know, we were really excited
316000	318000	To have twelve people who gave a shit enough to listen to us
318000	320000	And that's the way it was for many years
320000	322000	It wasn't really till a couple things happened
322000	324000	We got a couple Konami exclusives
324000	325000	With some of the DDR games
325000	327000	Which helped bring a lot of eyes to our show
327000	328000	You know, a few years ago
328000	329000	Before we went to the podcast format
329000	330000	And then certainly
330000	332000	Being a video game podcast that existed
332000	335000	When iTunes launched podcasting
335000	338000	We never will have a week that big again
338000	339000	That's for sure
339000	341000	That was a huge week
341000	345000	And, you know, now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts
345000	346000	All over the iTunes market
346000	348000	So it gets a little harder to stand out
348000	351000	If you're not, you know, IGN or 1UP
351000	355000	Or one of the, you know, big deep pocketed producers out there
355000	358000	But, you know, I'm really happy with the following that we do have
358000	360000	And it does seem like, you know, the folks that do show up
360000	362000	And participate with our show every week
362000	364000	Are really the reason for me that
364000	366000	Kind of we keep doing this, you know
366000	369000	There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week
369000	370000	Thanks to this show
370000	373000	And it is a way for me to hang out with Darkstalker and Loki
373000	374000	Who are, you know, they're okay
374000	375000	Eh
376000	377000	Jamie, what's-
377000	378000	Were you talking?
378000	380000	Jamie, what's motivated you for the past ten years?
383000	384000	She's thinking
384000	386000	It was at my house
386000	387000	For a while
387000	388000	For a little bit
388000	389000	But not in the beginning
389000	391000	Dan says he misses the show being at the house
391000	392000	Does he?
392000	393000	That's actually kind of a nice compliment
394000	395000	Um
395000	396000	My ego
396000	397000	Mhm
397000	398000	Spite
399000	402000	I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show
402000	403000	You're not getting paid for it
403000	404000	Me, me, me
404000	405000	Bitch, please
406000	407000	It's a hobby
407000	409000	It's something you do for fun, you know
409000	411000	I do it for more than just for fun
411000	415000	I do it for the people who are waiting to listen to us
415000	417000	We do have an audience
417000	418000	Mhm
418000	419000	You know, I'm
419000	422000	Even if it's all of 50 people
422000	423000	Right
423000	424000	I don't care
424000	425000	It's more that download it
425000	426000	Mhm
426000	427000	You know, clearly by the numbers
427000	428000	Right
428000	430000	And even if they can't make it into the chat room live
430000	432000	Or catch the podcast later on, you know
432000	436000	I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason
436000	437000	I'm doing it
437000	438000	I mean, I enjoy it
438000	439000	Except your ego
439000	441000	Well, except my ego, of course
441000	442000	Make my ego grow!
442000	443000	Um
443000	444000	But, no
444000	445000	I
445000	447000	I just do it because I like attention
447000	449000	I mean, because I like all of you
449000	451000	That's why I kinda, I don't know
451000	453000	That's why, and I've talked a little bit about this
453000	455000	And I don't want to be very direct
455000	457000	Because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily
457000	462000	But I get a little uncomfortable
462000	466000	When I see people who have been doing a podcast
466000	469000	For like one or two years
469000	471000	You know, or whatever, maybe three, I don't know
471000	473000	Kinda stop doing it
473000	477000	And then request a heck of a lot of money to do it again
477000	478000	Mhm
478000	479000	It's like, what's your motivator?
479000	480000	We have integrity
480000	482000	What's your motivator there?
482000	483000	We have integrity
483000	484000	We really do
484000	485000	Mhm
485000	487000	You know, you ask, we deliver
487000	488000	Mhm
488000	489000	Unless you're being bitches
489000	490000	And then we'll, you know, tell you off
490000	492000	Or Rob will have a hissy fit
492000	495000	So, I don't know
495000	498000	Yeah, it's certainly, let me tell you this
498000	500000	It's certainly not money that motivates us
500000	502000	I'll tell you that much, that's for sure
502000	504000	We've had some generous people
504000	508000	And we've had good things fall into our laps
508000	511000	And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer
511000	513000	Ronma, mostly, wasn't it?
513000	515000	I mean
515000	517000	It was a variety of people
517000	518000	Yeah
518000	520000	Yeah, I don't wanna give one person more credit than another
520000	522000	But that was, that was a really great
522000	524000	And I also
524000	525000	Gesture
525000	527000	I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep
527000	530000	You know that too
530000	531000	So
531000	532000	Oh, hi Shane
532000	535000	By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network
535000	537000	I was a little slow in activating the check-in
537000	539000	Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer
539000	540000	I have to put a button to do it
540000	541000	Lazy
541000	543000	But you can now check into the show
543000	544000	Robleslacker
544000	546000	At live.vognetwork.com and get your points
546000	547000	Sorry about that
547000	548000	Slacker
548000	549000	I just wanted you, I just wanted you to wait for it
549000	551000	He was busy playing that game on his iPad
551000	552000	The
552000	553000	The Pocket Planes
553000	554000	Pocket Planes
554000	555000	Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute
555000	557000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks
557000	558000	PokePlane, PokePlane
558000	560000	How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
560000	562000	We'll start with you
562000	564000	I played Mass Effect
564000	566000	And I played, um
566000	568000	I started a new guild
568000	570000	So anyone who plays World of Warcraft
570000	572000	I made an all druid guild
572000	574000	So you have to be a druid to be in it
574000	576000	And, uh, it's called Druidia
576000	578000	And if you don't get the joke
578000	580000	Then I feel very, very sorry for you
580000	582000	And probably a little old
582000	584000	I was also, I was either gonna name it that
584000	586000	Or Jewish Princesses
586000	588000	Or Order of Vespa
588000	590000	So, you should all get where that comes from
590000	592000	And I played, like, a little Lotor
592000	594000	But, you know, I, I
594000	596000	This week has really been kind of exhausting for me
596000	598000	And next week is gonna be exhausting as well
598000	600000	I've had some design work
600000	602000	Come onto my plate
602000	604000	That I'm getting a little bit for
604000	606000	I did a book cover
606000	608000	So, um, I really haven't
608000	610000	I've been playing more games than usual, though
610000	612000	I've played some Fractal
612000	614000	You know, I love freaking Fractal
614000	616000	That game pisses me off and I love it for it
616000	618000	It's like an abusive boyfriend
618000	620000	So, I was right that you, uh
620000	622000	Are gonna really like Mass Effect
622000	624000	Even though you're on the first game
624000	626000	Like you'll play through the series
626000	628000	Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me
628000	630000	That was messed up
630000	632000	What you were telling me about that
632000	634000	But, like I was telling you in chat last night
634000	636000	I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in
636000	638000	That's, you know, I'm still gonna play it
638000	640000	Cause I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head
640000	642000	And you will, you, I mean, there's so many subplots
642000	644000	About the various characters
644000	646000	But not so much in one, I hate to say it
646000	648000	But when you get to two, there's a lot
648000	650000	I'm looking forward to Miranda
650000	652000	Miranda's great, Miranda's hot
652000	656000	Yeah, if not for my overwhelming just fandom of Garrus
656000	658000	I would totally romance that bitch
658000	660000	You can't as a fem chef
660000	662000	Sucks!
662000	664000	You can only lez out with Liara, I think
664000	666000	Ashley, Ashley's a bitch
666000	668000	And Liara's too skinny
668000	670000	You can't be lesbian, lesbianic with Ashley
670000	672000	I don't think, no, I'm pretty sure you can't
672000	674000	You know what character I'm also looking forward to?
674000	676000	Jack
676000	678000	Jack is awesome
678000	680000	Yeah, it's a great story
680000	682000	My friend Gary's sister
682000	684000	Just saying
684000	686000	I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay
686000	688000	But yeah, she was pretty cool
688000	690000	Infinel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
690000	692000	So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head
692000	694000	That's true, and you know what, DarkSakura?
694000	696000	By the time you get to three
696000	698000	There's gonna be that extra content
698000	700000	That's the enriched ending
700000	702000	Which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet
702000	704000	It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles
704000	706000	Like pop-up video?
706000	708000	Exactly
708000	710000	See, this is what this meant
710000	712000	In case you didn't get it
712000	714000	Tigerclaw in chat says
714000	716000	It's all about Miranda's assets
716000	718000	Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass
718000	720000	She is a nice war asset
720000	722000	It's round
722000	724000	It's round and plump
724000	726000	And you just wanna reach in the screen and get squished
726000	728000	It's modeled after the voice actress
728000	730000	You know who I love too?
730000	732000	Talk about genetic perfection
732000	734000	Not that I'm into aliens
734000	736000	I'm very secure in my homosexuality
736000	738000	But if I were to get it on with a fam alien
738000	740000	Samara's kinda hot
740000	742000	Just sayin'
742000	744000	Even though her children are apparently fucked up
744000	746000	Aha! You haven't even played to yet
746000	748000	You know this
748000	750000	No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki
750000	752000	The Mass Effect wiki
752000	754000	And it came up with whatever it is that they have
754000	756000	And I know one of them's like addicted to
756000	758000	Yeah, yeah
758000	760000	And so I actually, out of curiosity
760000	762000	I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it
762000	764000	With the crazy chick
764000	766000	And of course, dead
766000	768000	So that was pretty funny
768000	770000	And I also
770000	772000	I've decided that if I play through it as a dude
772000	774000	I'm totally going after Tali
774000	776000	Cause she's just funny and cute
776000	778000	Oh, there's so much I wanna say
778000	780000	But I can't, just keep playing, keep going
780000	782000	Mass Effect lounge radio
782000	784000	I can't believe I missed this series
784000	786000	For so many years
786000	788000	It's so flippin' good
788000	790000	Anyway
790000	792000	At any rate, I've been averaging like
792000	794000	A planet a play
794000	796000	If that makes sense, Rob
796000	798000	So, like, I just
798000	800000	Well, actually no, two plays
800000	802000	Got me all the way through
802000	804000	The Citadel stuff
804000	806000	And then, cause I had a better idea of what I was doing
806000	808000	Cause I'd already played that
808000	810000	And then instead of going to
810000	812000	Naveria like I did the first time
812000	814000	I actually went to
814000	816000	Pick up Liara
816000	818000	And then, now I'm heading back to Naveria
818000	820000	Which, I should at least
820000	822000	Be where I was
822000	824000	Probably by the end of
824000	826000	The night one night when I'm playing
826000	828000	Cause I tend to, you know, play
828000	830000	And chat with people at the same time
830000	832000	I multitask, I multitask
832000	834000	And Acidic Vampire asked me who my
834000	836000	Favorite character is so far in the first game
836000	838000	And, I mean, Shepard's actually
838000	840000	Pretty, pretty badass
840000	842000	I dig her
842000	844000	I'm assuming you're playing Paragon, cause everybody plays Paragon the first time
844000	846000	Actually, I'm playing neutral
846000	848000	I'm holding it neutral
848000	850000	And my Renegade actually points
850000	852000	Are about even right now
852000	854000	Well, between my, uh
854000	856000	My charm and Intimidate
856000	858000	If that makes sense
858000	860000	So, but I'd have to say
860000	862000	Of anyone other than
862000	864000	Shepard, Garrus
864000	866000	He's just so
866000	868000	He can be a dick
868000	870000	And you love him and he's like Thor, kind of
870000	872000	Except, you know, not as the invalid
872000	874000	Wearing his mother's drapes
874000	876000	I think all boys that play Mass Effect
876000	878000	Go on a bromance, Garrus, too
878000	880000	Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy
880000	882000	That's it
882000	884000	He can be kind of a jerk
884000	886000	But he's a good jerk and you like him
886000	888000	He's just a nice, jerky
888000	890000	He's like your husband
890000	892000	He's like Dan, he's really like Dan
892000	894000	And you just can't help but be charmed
894000	896000	By his degrees of arrogance
896000	898000	By the way, I do
898000	900000	I don't mean to veer off
900000	902000	Track too much, but we are
902000	904000	Currently in the
904000	906000	VOG Network Clubhouse on Sony Home
906000	908000	And if you want to log into PlayStation Home
908000	910000	And search for VOG Network
910000	912000	Just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up
912000	914000	VOG Network
914000	916000	I don't know, what the hell is Spazinator wearing?
916000	918000	It's like a chicken costume
918000	920000	It is a turkey costume with the head of
920000	922000	Sweet Tooth and I'm not sure
922000	924000	The glowing thing is
924000	926000	That is disturbing me
926000	928000	I'm not looking at that anymore
928000	930000	There's also somebody with a sack boy and there's a mime
930000	932000	Well, yeah, Blender's the mime, I get that
932000	934000	I also really like Rex
934000	936000	Rex is cuddly
936000	938000	He's just
938000	940000	I like the gruff, sort of, you know
940000	942000	Mercenary attitude, I mean, I've always
942000	944000	Had a thing for that kind of character
944000	946000	While I'm at it, okay, Liara
946000	948000	Is too talkative and she needs to
948000	950000	Shut up sometimes, I mean, there's one
950000	952000	Thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they
952000	954000	Take things and run away with it
954000	956000	Ashley's a bitch, I thought I would like her
956000	958000	But she's really just kind of a bitch hoe bag
958000	960000	And, uh
960000	962000	Kate, I hate to say it
962000	964000	Caden is just too
964000	966000	Mr. Generic Pretty Guy
966000	968000	Get out of my house
968000	970000	I'm sorry, you know what I mean
970000	972000	He's, he's, I mean
972000	974000	Maybe he'll get better
974000	976000	I haven't used him that much
976000	978000	I really think that Tali is adorable
978000	980000	She's just so cute
980000	982000	Alright, I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat
982000	984000	But going to some of the comments from our chat room
984000	986000	At vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says
986000	988000	Garris is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad
988000	990000	When he does bad things
990000	992000	Not as much as Liara
992000	994000	It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things
994000	996000	Moving on, anything else for your
996000	998000	Gaming week, DarkSakura?
998000	1000000	I would not have Romanced Rex, I'm sorry
1000000	1002000	But that's too much like doing it
1002000	1004000	With, um
1004000	1006000	I can't even say with
1006000	1008000	Like, Jabba the Hutt
1008000	1010000	Sorry
1010000	1012000	Alright, Loki, how is your gaming? I know you're not a Mass Effect
1012000	1014000	Addict, so you have something else going on
1014000	1016000	Oh, thank god
1016000	1018000	This is turning into like a soap opera
1018000	1020000	Just talking about all the people that you would have sex with
1020000	1022000	In Mass Effect
1022000	1024000	So how many block people have you Romanced in Minecraft?
1024000	1026000	There are no block people in Minecraft
1026000	1028000	There's just blocks
1028000	1030000	And farm animals
1030000	1032000	How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?
1032000	1034000	How many farm animals have you Romanced?
1034000	1036000	How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?
1036000	1038000	None, because I'm playing on peaceful
1038000	1040000	So there's none
1040000	1042000	It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things
1042000	1044000	You know, sneak up on you
1044000	1046000	I tunneled from
1046000	1048000	My original track
1048000	1050000	That went from the one station to the next
1050000	1052000	To my volcanic layer now
1052000	1054000	And so I have that
1054000	1056000	I love that you have an evil underground layer
1056000	1058000	Oh, it's above ground
1058000	1060000	It's the tallest mountain in the
1060000	1062000	I thought it was in the volcano
1062000	1064000	It is in a volcano
1064000	1066000	Aren't a lot of evil layers in volcan- I swear that was in a James Bond movie
1066000	1068000	I swear
1068000	1070000	It was also in, uh, you know, Austin Powers
1070000	1072000	That's true
1072000	1074000	But
1074000	1076000	I was, uh, hollowing out the volcano
1076000	1078000	To build more stuff
1078000	1080000	Although I'm starting to kind of wonder what the hell
1080000	1082000	I'm supposed to fill this volcano with
1082000	1084000	Um, I tried making
1084000	1086000	A library
1086000	1088000	But apparently if the library
1088000	1090000	Or the bookshelves
1090000	1092000	Are too close to lava
1092000	1094000	Even though the lava could be, like, on several
1094000	1096000	You know, on the other side of a wall
1096000	1098000	Several layers away
1098000	1100000	It'll still catch those books on fire
1100000	1102000	So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap
1102000	1104000	I need more, uh, more materials
1104000	1106000	To build in my library
1106000	1108000	Come back and the whole library burned down
1108000	1110000	I'm like, ah, dammit
1110000	1112000	Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories
1112000	1114000	But we are going to talk a little bit about some things
1114000	1116000	That changed in Minecraft this week
1116000	1118000	And one of them is the removal of the duping bug
1118000	1120000	How are you feeling about that, Loki?
1120000	1122000	I just haven't updated yet
1122000	1124000	Never! I'll never update
1124000	1126000	No, I will update, it's just, it's a little annoying
1126000	1128000	This is how I built, like, a huge old
1128000	1130000	Storage facility now that I'm slowly filling
1130000	1132000	Stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring
1132000	1134000	Duping stuff
1134000	1136000	Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version
1136000	1138000	They'll have creative mode in there
1138000	1140000	Yeah, they're gonna have creative mode
1140000	1142000	But even technically that they patched out the duping
1142000	1144000	There are still ways for me to get stuff
1144000	1146000	That I want to have a save file editor
1146000	1148000	That you can edit what you have in your inventory
1148000	1150000	So I can still dupe that way if I wanted
1150000	1152000	But it's just a pain to, like, pull the save off
1152000	1154000	And do this
1154000	1156000	And I know they fixed the, um, you know
1156000	1158000	The clay spawn rate and stuff
1158000	1160000	So you can actually find clay now
1160000	1162000	Instead of it being, like, diamond
1162000	1164000	You know, like, searching for a diamond
1164000	1166000	But even though diamond's a lot easier to find
1166000	1168000	Than this right now
1168000	1170000	And you have to start a new world
1170000	1172000	In order for all those update effects
1172000	1174000	To take effect in your world
1174000	1176000	So, like, if we respawn the vogseed
1176000	1178000	Or whatever, it'd actually have different things in it
1178000	1180000	And they're gonna do the same thing again with pistons
1180000	1182000	So, right now I'm just gonna stick with this world
1182000	1184000	And I'm not gonna bother starting a new one
1184000	1186000	Just to get more clay cause I don't really want clay
1186000	1188000	And, um
1188000	1190000	I think I'm gonna start over
1190000	1192000	I need to do some work in Peaceful
1192000	1194000	Like, that's what was slowing me down before
1194000	1196000	Was that I was too, like, I could not get to stuff
1196000	1198000	Because of the stupid creepers
1198000	1200000	And all that stuff
1200000	1202000	And I realize that's kinda part of the fun of the game
1202000	1204000	But I would like to just do Peaceful
1204000	1206000	And then, once I have my underground lair built
1206000	1208000	I will turn on the monsters
1208000	1210000	Make it the point to go out and destroy them all
1210000	1212000	Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna do
1212000	1214000	But right now, it's just kinda fun
1214000	1216000	If I could stop playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
1216000	1218000	I would do that
1218000	1220000	For the record, the chatroom and I are talking about Mass Effect still
1220000	1222000	Don't spoil it for Jamie
1222000	1224000	She's in the same position I was in about three months ago
1224000	1226000	She really doesn't know a whole lot about what's upcoming
1226000	1228000	So, just saying that
1228000	1230000	Be kind
1230000	1232000	So, I played that stuff
1232000	1234000	What else did I do?
1234000	1236000	Um
1236000	1238000	I played Call of Duty
1238000	1240000	Modern Warfare 3 a little bit
1240000	1242000	A little bit of the System Link stuff
1242000	1244000	Still, wish I had some more maps to play
1244000	1246000	Because a lot of them are really big
1246000	1248000	Whereas the first game, you know, Modern Warfare
1248000	1250000	Just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small
1250000	1252000	That we could actually play on
1252000	1254000	And it wasn't, you know, such a big deal
1254000	1256000	There was only, like, a couple that were too big
1256000	1258000	And now it's like the reverse problem
1258000	1260000	Um, so hopefully there will be
1260000	1262000	Some more maps that we can check out
1262000	1264000	Hopefully for free
1264000	1266000	Because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody
1266000	1268000	And then, um, I was gonna play
1268000	1270000	Gravity Rush
1270000	1272000	But I
1272000	1274000	What the fuck?
1274000	1276000	I don't know
1276000	1278000	Home is interesting
1278000	1280000	That's all I can really say
1280000	1282000	Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says
1282000	1284000	It gets hard
1284000	1286000	Get your minds out of the gutter
1286000	1288000	It's a big piece of wood
1288000	1290000	I'm not helping, am I?
1290000	1292000	That says it gets hard
1292000	1294000	There's a lot of these double entendres
1294000	1296000	In Sony Home
1296000	1298000	Dirty ass people who play Home
1298000	1300000	Like me
1300000	1302000	But yeah, I've been good this weekend
1302000	1304000	I have not played any Minecraft this weekend
1304000	1306000	I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that
1306000	1308000	Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that
1308000	1310000	But, um, I did not play any Minecraft
1310000	1312000	Today, or yesterday
1312000	1314000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1314000	1316000	Uh, that's it
1316000	1318000	Not a lot for me to report
1318000	1320000	I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects
1320000	1322000	As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
1322000	1324000	Still kinda consumes
1324000	1326000	Sentinel, who's awesome
1326000	1328000	Uh, I considered
1328000	1330000	Buying Mass Effect 3 on PC
1330000	1332000	Just so I could play with Alan
1332000	1334000	Who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC
1334000	1336000	But now I'm not gonna be able to
1336000	1338000	Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real
1338000	1340000	We think it's the power supply
1340000	1342000	Like, he was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours
1342000	1344000	Yesterday
1344000	1346000	And finally there was just this loud
1346000	1348000	It was during Undersedation Live and I was listening
1348000	1350000	There's just loud pfft
1350000	1352000	Damn it, I forgot your game
1352000	1354000	Come to my house next week
1354000	1356000	We'll see
1356000	1358000	Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway
1358000	1360000	Anyway, off-air discussion
1360000	1362000	Where was I? Damn it, you threw me off
1362000	1364000	Oh, Mass Effect
1364000	1366000	So, Alan's computer broke
1366000	1368000	So the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC
1368000	1370000	I ended up having to buy a power supply
1370000	1372000	For Alan's computer, so
1372000	1374000	You know, maybe in the future
1374000	1376000	But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect
1376000	1378000	As Renegade on Xbox 360
1378000	1380000	Other stuff
1380000	1382000	I have been playing that's
1382000	1384000	Non-Mass Effect
1384000	1386000	I checked out a little more of Sony Playstation Home this week
1386000	1388000	Thanks to the VOG Clubhouse
1388000	1390000	It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more
1390000	1392000	There's positives and negatives
1392000	1394000	Positives is there's a whole lot more
1394000	1396000	It seems like to do
1396000	1398000	In Home now
1398000	1400000	A lot more of these mini-games
1400000	1402000	That are pretty well rounded
1402000	1404000	I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house
1404000	1406000	You can just walk up to it and play it
1406000	1408000	It's called Cluster Puck
1408000	1410000	Which is kind of a
1410000	1412000	I don't know, it's like
1412000	1414000	Tetris Attack meets
1414000	1416000	I don't know
1416000	1418000	There's this weird mechanic where you move
1418000	1420000	You can actually move pieces
1420000	1422000	Up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling
1422000	1424000	And once you attach it to another piece
1424000	1426000	It becomes part of the big block
1426000	1428000	That you're moving, and then when they all fall down
1428000	1430000	If you have three in a row
1430000	1432000	They go away, it was weird
1432000	1434000	But I liked it, it was a pretty cool, kind of different little puzzle game
1434000	1436000	And you unlock dumb little rewards for it
1436000	1438000	I was checking out Sony's E3 booth
1438000	1440000	I checked out some type of
1440000	1442000	What is it, Midway thing?
1442000	1444000	But, they
1444000	1446000	Won 99 cents for 50 tickets
1446000	1448000	To actually play the games
1448000	1450000	And it's all a contest
1450000	1452000	And I was like, I don't think I want to do that
1452000	1454000	My only real complaint about Home is that
1454000	1456000	Some of it's really slow
1456000	1458000	And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer
1458000	1460000	A lot, like
1460000	1462000	You know, if it's your first time in Home
1462000	1464000	You have to download everything
1464000	1466000	For a little while, and I like to think I have a fast connection
1466000	1468000	That's really the only thing
1468000	1470000	That really bums me out though
1470000	1472000	Is that Home is kind of
1472000	1474000	Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something
1474000	1476000	That you could launch
1476000	1478000	Other games from
1478000	1480000	And it was going to be literally Home
1480000	1482000	Like, you wouldn't go into your crossbar
1482000	1484000	You'd go into Home
1484000	1486000	And kind of do everything from there
1486000	1488000	It's too slow, you could never do anything like that
1488000	1490000	It's like a computer
1490000	1492000	From the 1980's
1492000	1494000	It takes two and a half minutes to boot
1494000	1496000	Sometimes, you know, that's the only
1496000	1498000	When it loads, and when you have things
1498000	1500000	Cached, if you've loaded all the areas
1500000	1502000	Or whatever, it's pretty cool
1502000	1504000	Once you get in there, once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse
1504000	1506000	And all that, it's pretty cool, but
1506000	1508000	Moving seamlessly is a little rough still
1508000	1510000	But I do like, they've really
1510000	1512000	If you haven't checked out Home since it first
1512000	1514000	Launched three years ago
1514000	1516000	There's like a million more things in there now
1516000	1518000	And tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters
1518000	1520000	That's pretty cool, I like that
1520000	1522000	Multiple theatres
1522000	1524000	Dedicated to the Twilight trailer
1524000	1526000	Oh, really?
1526000	1528000	No, I'm just making shit up
1528000	1530000	I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home
1530000	1532000	Is it a Sony movie? I don't know
1532000	1534000	When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out
1534000	1536000	You better believe they do stuff like that in Home
1536000	1538000	Oh, by the way, Rob
1538000	1540000	Before I forget
1540000	1542000	Actually, there's one more game that I'm playing
1542000	1544000	I'm doing the
1544000	1546000	Mass Effect 3
1546000	1548000	I
1548000	1550000	It's like a Facebook game, yeah
1550000	1552000	Yeah, but I'm already
1552000	1554000	Preparing for Mass Effect 3
1554000	1556000	You're committed
1556000	1558000	I've also been playing an iOS game and it's
1558000	1560000	Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game
1560000	1562000	From the makers of Tiny Tower
1562000	1564000	Where now you fly planes
1564000	1566000	Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?
1566000	1568000	Right
1568000	1570000	No, Pocket Planes is not a ripoff of
1570000	1572000	Dream Heights
1572000	1574000	I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though
1574000	1576000	But yes, you
1576000	1578000	Go to airports, you buy planes
1578000	1580000	And you ship people and cargo between them
1580000	1582000	Exact same art as assets from Tiny Tower
1582000	1584000	Although, obviously, they had to go in
1584000	1586000	And draw planes and clouds
1586000	1588000	But it's like the same style, the same universe
1588000	1590000	I kind of like that they have the two
1590000	1592000	Very different kind of games yet in the same universe
1592000	1594000	I've heard from some people, though, they don't care
1594000	1596000	For Pocket Planes
1596000	1598000	It's not as easy to get
1598000	1600000	As Tiny Tower was
1600000	1602000	Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get
1602000	1604000	Pocket Planes is a little
1604000	1606000	The airport, you have to manage the planes
1606000	1608000	So you're not just managing a tower
1608000	1610000	You're kind of having to juggle two things
1610000	1612000	There's a lot more places to sink money
1612000	1614000	As well, and there's Twitter
1614000	1616000	Integration and all this
1616000	1618000	The one reason why nimble bits games do so well, though
1618000	1620000	Is that you really do get the full experience for free
1620000	1622000	And it doesn't nag you ever
1622000	1624000	About buying things
1624000	1626000	But if you want to buy the little bucks that make things
1626000	1628000	Go faster, sure, you can go get a handful
1628000	1630000	Of those easy
1630000	1632000	For 99 cents or 5 bucks or whatever
1632000	1634000	But the nice thing is
1634000	1636000	The game will give you bucks
1636000	1638000	Slowly
1638000	1640000	You'll start to get bucks, but
1640000	1642000	You have to be patient if you don't want to pay
1642000	1644000	To go all the way
1644000	1646000	We do have a whole little flight team
1646000	1648000	Or was it flight squad?
1648000	1650000	It's just VOG
1650000	1652000	If you put in as the tag
1652000	1654000	And you can see how you're doing in the world events
1654000	1656000	With folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf
1656000	1658000	And whoever else on the network is playing
1658000	1660000	The Pocket Planes
1660000	1662000	That's it for my gaming week
1662000	1664000	I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever
1664000	1666000	Let's move on
1666000	1668000	Let's get into tonight's gaming news
1668000	1670000	I'll quickly say housekeeping

1678000	1680000	We are going to get a notice out there
1680000	1682000	So hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this
1682000	1684000	But our 10 year anniversary special
1684000	1686000	Is next week
1686000	1688000	I do know we're going to have some guests
1688000	1690000	We don't hardly ever have guests anymore
1690000	1692000	In studio
1692000	1694000	But I know we're going to have some next week
1694000	1696000	That are going to show up
1696000	1698000	That part is of course inevitable
1698000	1700000	That there's going to be people who want to come out for the 10th anniversary
1700000	1702000	We have some people traveling a great distance to be here
1702000	1704000	So that's going to be very cool
1704000	1706000	And some clips from the oldies episodes
1706000	1708000	And so forth
1708000	1710000	I really encourage you guys to be here live
1710000	1712000	For that
1712000	1714000	Please participate with us
1714000	1716000	At vognetwork.com
1716000	1718000	We have some special piece of loot in it for you
1718000	1720000	Can't say too much but maybe
1720000	1722000	It will be on the podcast feed though
1722000	1724000	If you absolutely have another commitment
1724000	1726000	Sunday nights of course it will be on the podcast feed
1726000	1728000	We would just love to see you live
1728000	1730000	Cancel them
1730000	1732000	Cancel them for us
1732000	1734000	We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time
1734000	1736000	And
1736000	1738000	After tonight's show
1738000	1740000	If you want to leave a message for the 10 year anniversary show

1746000	1748000	After the show
1748000	1750000	But that will be open
1750000	1752000	We encourage our fellow podcasters to call
1752000	1754000	Our fans to call
1754000	1756000	My only suggestion because we are anticipating
1756000	1758000	There will be a handful
1758000	1760000	Not to be all ego
1760000	1762000	A lot of people have been asking
1762000	1764000	We are anticipating a lot
1764000	1766000	So try to keep your messages brief
1766000	1768000	If you ramble on for 5 minutes I can't play it
1768000	1770000	We're not going to have the time next week
1770000	1772000	But if you make it 30 seconds
1772000	1774000	Again more details on Twitter and Facebook
1774000	1776000	After the show tonight
1776000	1778000	Alright now we can get into some gaming news
1778000	1780000	Loki start us off tonight please
1780000	1782000	Ok so there's some more details regarding the Wii U
1782000	1784000	Some of the programming stuff
1784000	1786000	First off they have infrastructure
1786000	1788000	In place to allow free to play games
1788000	1790000	Which is kind of interesting when you think about it
1790000	1792000	Because they've made many comments
1792000	1794000	In the past about how they
1794000	1796000	Didn't like the fact that some of the games
1796000	1798000	On the iOS platform and stuff like that
1798000	1800000	Were too cheap and devaluing everything else
1800000	1802000	But apparently they said
1802000	1804000	We've designed a system
1804000	1806000	From a technical standpoint to allow developers
1806000	1808000	To freely take advantage of things like free to play
1808000	1810000	And microtransactions
1810000	1812000	So that's kind of nice
1812000	1814000	We'll see some of that stuff coming that way
1814000	1816000	And of course they're saying
1816000	1818000	Currently
1818000	1820000	They're not actively looking to
1820000	1822000	Enter the free to play market
1822000	1824000	For their first party content
1824000	1826000	But
1826000	1828000	They are making it available
1828000	1830000	For anybody else that may want to
1830000	1832000	Make a free to play game
1832000	1834000	Nintendo's not going to do that
1834000	1836000	And then of course
1836000	1838000	There's some
1838000	1840000	There was some
1840000	1842000	Rumors that they may be getting away
1842000	1844000	From doing friend codes for
1844000	1846000	This new system and god I wish
1846000	1848000	That were the case but apparently
1848000	1850000	They're not
1850000	1852000	Friend codes are still going to be a part
1852000	1854000	Of the online service
1854000	1856000	However they're going to change
1856000	1858000	They're not
1858000	1860000	Saying exactly how
1860000	1862000	Just saying that
1862000	1864000	Friends codes
1864000	1866000	They're going to be there
1866000	1868000	But not the existing friend code system
1868000	1870000	You'll be able to identify people as friends
1870000	1872000	And have a certain level of interaction
1872000	1874000	Versus different level of interaction
1874000	1876000	For more general
1876000	1878000	Population
1878000	1880000	So
1880000	1882000	I don't know is that like
1882000	1884000	The Google groups or something like that
1884000	1886000	You can do that with Google plus or something
1886000	1888000	Who knows but still
1888000	1890000	Kind of annoying that you have to do that
1890000	1892000	But whatever
1892000	1894000	And then of course they also said that the system
1894000	1896000	Will allow achievements in games
1896000	1898000	However it's not mandatory
1898000	1900000	So some games will have
1900000	1902000	Achievements and some may not
1902000	1904000	I just get this
1904000	1906000	Feeling from reading some of the
1906000	1908000	Stuff that it's like Nintendo's
1908000	1910000	Putting a lot of this
1910000	1912000	You know stuff that they have available for
1912000	1914000	Other platforms right now
1914000	1916000	Like achievements or trophies
1916000	1918000	And some of this other
1918000	1920000	Like you know different online places
1920000	1922000	And they have this
1922000	1924000	Available for third parties but
1924000	1926000	Nintendo themselves aren't really
1926000	1928000	Taking advantage of it it's like
1928000	1930000	Oh yeah we're just going to
1930000	1932000	Kind of do things the way we have been doing them
1932000	1934000	And we're not really going to do
1934000	1936000	A lot of this online stuff
1936000	1938000	Or you know have achievements
1938000	1940000	And things like that I mean it'd be nice
1940000	1942000	If they did but I don't know
1942000	1944000	I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be
1944000	1946000	Kind of doing all this new fancy stuff
1946000	1948000	They're just kind of be you know repeating what
1948000	1950000	They've done before
1950000	1952000	We don't like to do what everybody
1952000	1954000	Else does we're going to do our thing
1954000	1956000	If everyone jumped off the bridge would you?
1956000	1958000	Perhaps
1958000	1960000	How high is the bridge?
1964000	1966000	What do you think though about that achievement part
1966000	1968000	Not being mandatory I find that kind of interesting
1968000	1970000	Because it seems like the makers
1970000	1972000	Of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want
1972000	1974000	I mean some might kind of make it
1974000	1976000	In parity with whatever's on 360
1976000	1978000	And Steam and so forth but others
1978000	1980000	May just decide not to do it
1980000	1982000	It kind of reminds me of Steam though because Steam has that kind of thing
1982000	1984000	Where some games do have you know
1984000	1986000	Achievements and some don't I don't think it's
1986000	1988000	Necessarily a deal breaker it's kind of
1988000	1990000	Disappointing that there's not going to be achievements
1990000	1992000	Along there I mean
1992000	1994000	It just for me it seems like
1994000	1996000	Eh we don't really want to
1996000	1998000	Do that so but I know
1998000	2000000	You guys want to so we're going to go ahead and
2000000	2002000	Allow you to do it but we're not going to do it
2002000	2004000	I mean it just kind of seems like
2004000	2006000	They're just taking the easy way out
2006000	2008000	For a lot of this stuff I mean how hard
2008000	2010000	Have they straight up said the Pikmin's not going to have them?
2010000	2012000	They haven't said it yet but
2012000	2014000	Pikmin doesn't have certain things that they
2014000	2016000	You know kind of hinted
2016000	2018000	That it would have and then of course
2018000	2020000	Their reasoning for why it doesn't have said
2020000	2022000	You know feature is because
2022000	2024000	It's too hard
2024000	2026000	So you know
2026000	2028000	I don't know
2028000	2030000	We'll get to that later but
2030000	2032000	It's just it's stupid
2032000	2034000	Do you think they could land some big free to play games?
2034000	2036000	You know I don't know you're thinking of
2036000	2038000	Steam and so forth like I don't know
2038000	2040000	Well DC Universe is a Sony game so no
2040000	2042000	But maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?
2042000	2044000	You know it's good that they have
2044000	2046000	That infrastructure in place so they could
2046000	2048000	Possibly do that and also it would be nice
2048000	2050000	To see if they have like more of like an MMO
2050000	2052000	Type thing in place I'd imagine
2052000	2054000	It's free to play with microtransactions
2054000	2056000	I wouldn't see it being too
2056000	2058000	Difficult for them to have microtransactions
2058000	2060000	For like you know subscription
2060000	2062000	Models and stuff like that but
2062000	2064000	It's nice to have the options there
2064000	2066000	But at the same time I just kind of wish
2066000	2068000	There was a little bit of a parity between
2068000	2070000	Everything that they're doing
2070000	2072000	Uh BlackWolf
2072000	2074000	In our chatroom says certain Nintendo
2074000	2076000	Things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza
2076000	2078000	But suck too
2078000	2080000	Alright moving on
2080000	2082000	One of the other big things that came out of E3
2082000	2084000	Was obviously Microsoft Smart Glass
2084000	2086000	And this is the whole iPhone
2086000	2088000	iOS and Android
2088000	2090000	And likely you know whatever Windows tablets
2090000	2092000	Have is the whole
2092000	2094000	They're all gonna be able to run this Smart Glass app
2094000	2096000	And a lot of people
2096000	2098000	When they saw that said
2098000	2100000	Oh Wii U just got stolen
2100000	2102000	And done better, Wii U's dead, Wii U's gone
2102000	2104000	So of course Nintendo
2104000	2106000	Was asked to comment on this whole situation
2106000	2108000	How does Nintendo intend to differentiate
2108000	2110000	Between what Microsoft's doing with
2110000	2112000	Smart Glass and what Nintendo's doing
2112000	2114000	And essentially according to Satoru Iwata
2114000	2116000	Who was interviewed here
2116000	2118000	He said that
2118000	2120000	Basically it boils down to the fact that
2120000	2122000	The controls on the tablet devices
2122000	2124000	Often suck
2124000	2126000	Quote
2126000	2128000	From what we have seen so far
2128000	2130000	It looks to us as what they are able to offer
2130000	2132000	Really is only a small facet
2132000	2134000	Of what the Wii U is capable of
2134000	2136000	We know that the core users
2136000	2138000	Who love playing video games like controllers
2138000	2140000	That you hold with two hands
2140000	2142000	What you don't have on smartphones and tablets
2142000	2144000	Are the buttons and the control sticks
2144000	2146000	They prefer to use
2146000	2148000	Now if they could hold a controller with two hands
2148000	2150000	And hold a tablet or a smartphone with another hand
2150000	2152000	There would be no issue
2152000	2154000	Unfortunately this is not possible for humans to do that
2154000	2156000	That sounds like a challenge
2156000	2158000	You can't play a game in a way you can play
2158000	2160000	With the Wii U
2160000	2162000	And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website
2162000	2164000	You can check that out
2164000	2166000	In that interview
2166000	2168000	That's also officially full of shit
2168000	2170000	Really?
2170000	2172000	Let's see here
2172000	2174000	What they are describing is basically saying
2174000	2176000	Because the Wii U tablet has the buttons
2176000	2178000	And stuff like that
2178000	2180000	You can play games
2180000	2182000	Using that you can't play regularly
2182000	2184000	But at the same time
2184000	2186000	Look at the games that they are showcasing
2186000	2188000	That use that tablet and stuff
2188000	2190000	They have a game where you flick ninja stars
2190000	2192000	At the screen
2192000	2194000	That uses buttons because
2194000	2196000	I don't see any buttons being used there on the touch screen
2196000	2198000	Or some of the other games
2198000	2200000	That use that as a secondary display
2200000	2202000	You know
2202000	2204000	I don't necessarily have to hold the tablet
2204000	2206000	To have a secondary display
2206000	2208000	I can sit it down on the coffee table
2208000	2210000	Or something like that
2210000	2212000	They may not require you to necessarily have
2212000	2214000	To hold that
2214000	2216000	To play these games
2216000	2218000	I just think that they are
2218000	2220000	They are not going to say
2220000	2222000	Oh shit they are right
2222000	2224000	They are going to steal our thunder
2224000	2226000	Well we should have thought better next time
2226000	2228000	They are not going to say anything like that
2228000	2230000	Of course they are going to talk it down
2230000	2232000	Now along similar lines here since we are talking about smart glass
2232000	2234000	I think it is worth bringing up that the official
2234000	2236000	Xbox Live app on iOS
2236000	2238000	Was updated
2238000	2240000	And yes there is a Microsoft
2240000	2242000	Xbox app on iOS
2242000	2244000	Officially by Microsoft
2244000	2246000	It was updated this week
2246000	2248000	With the smart glass features in it
2248000	2250000	Now this feature only works on the phone for some reason
2250000	2252000	And not on the iPad which I found a little strange
2252000	2254000	But what you can do with it
2254000	2256000	Once you update it you hit the little button
2256000	2258000	When your Xbox is on that says connect to Xbox
2258000	2260000	And your iPhone essentially becomes a controller
2260000	2262000	For the Xbox
2262000	2264000	It actually has a little A button in the middle
2264000	2266000	So you can kind of use it like a TV remote
2266000	2268000	But you can also use it to launch a game
2268000	2270000	And then when you launch a game
2270000	2272000	The little iPhone turns into a display
2272000	2274000	That tells you about the game
2274000	2276000	It is nothing really that great
2276000	2278000	It is kind of a pain to set up
2278000	2280000	Because you have to do it each and every time
2280000	2282000	So it is not like a big time saving thing
2282000	2284000	But it is certainly showing hints of what is to come
2284000	2286000	What they are trying to do with this whole second screen technology
2286000	2288000	It is a little weird that it is not on the iPad yet
2288000	2290000	But it is available definitely on the iPhone
2290000	2292000	And that is up now
2292000	2294000	You can download that now
2294000	2296000	The other thing you can argue with Nintendo
2296000	2298000	Is that I don't have to buy another system
2298000	2300000	To be able to have this technology
2300000	2302000	Or whatever
2302000	2304000	It is going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet
2304000	2306000	But at the same time, like I said last week
2306000	2308000	I am just worried we are going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff
2308000	2310000	Not necessarily
2310000	2312000	First off, I literally think we are going to get DS stuff
2312000	2314000	I think they are going to do Virtual Console with the DS
2314000	2316000	I mean, duh
2316000	2318000	It has got the same setup
2318000	2320000	So we are going to see that eventually
2320000	2322000	But literally it is just going to be
2322000	2324000	Using
2324000	2326000	The second screen for just crap that you would have
2326000	2328000	Like in a start menu or something
2328000	2330000	Because there was a lot of
2330000	2332000	Games on the DS
2332000	2334000	It just didn't really need that second screen
2334000	2336000	But it was there
2336000	2338000	So they used it for like
2338000	2340000	Here is a map
2340000	2342000	Here is some neat touch screen things you can do
2342000	2344000	Some things were really cool though
2344000	2346000	Like Elite Beat Agents
2346000	2348000	But I don't see that really working on the Wii U
2348000	2350000	It is kind of like everything is there on the touch screen
2350000	2352000	So it is like, why would I look up
2352000	2354000	And look at my TV ever
2354000	2356000	There is really not a lot to do
2356000	2358000	So I am curious
2358000	2360000	To see further developments
2360000	2362000	Of what is actually coming out for Wii U
2362000	2364000	And unfortunately E3
2364000	2366000	Kind of didn't show enough
2366000	2368000	But we will have more on that a little later
2368000	2370000	In the meantime DarkSakura
2370000	2372000	Let's switch on to the
2372000	2374000	Xbox thing
2374000	2376000	Not under the name of the lube
2376000	2378000	Unfortunately
2378000	2380000	Because that would have been awesome
2380000	2382000	There is a document leak
2382000	2384000	About an X
2384000	2386000	I should just say for the new listeners of OLR
2386000	2388000	We kind of missed that
2388000	2390000	We had a naming contest
2390000	2392000	In our popular list list segment a couple months ago
2392000	2394000	We decided the official name
2394000	2396000	Of the next Xbox here on OLR
2396000	2398000	Is the Xbox lube
2398000	2400000	So if you are wondering where the hell did that come from
2400000	2402000	We are done
2402000	2404000	Well at any rate
2404000	2406000	There was a 56 page document
2406000	2408000	That was leaked
2408000	2410000	For what was listed as the Xbox 720
2410000	2412000	Which I am pretty sure
2412000	2414000	That is not going to be the final name
2414000	2416000	It looks kind of like a squishy dreamcast
2416000	2418000	So I think that is funny
2418000	2420000	But it was talking about
2420000	2422000	Having new things like a metro dashboard
2422000	2424000	Xbox TV apps
2424000	2426000	Smart glass of course
2426000	2428000	And then
2428000	2430000	It was really
2430000	2432000	Do you remember Rob that E3
2432000	2434000	When they announced the 360
2434000	2436000	And all the stuff they wanted it to do
2436000	2438000	And how they wanted it to be a big hub
2438000	2440000	It looks like they are still trying
2440000	2442000	To keep that hub
2442000	2444000	Thing going on with the new one
2444000	2446000	But it is also supposed to have
2446000	2448000	Blu ray support
2448000	2450000	Native 3D output
2450000	2452000	And glasses
2452000	2454000	Concurrent apps
2454000	2456000	Peripheral support
2456000	2458000	Sensors
2458000	2460000	Additional sensors sorry
2460000	2462000	It says something about a connect 2
2462000	2464000	And that they are debating whether or not to use
2464000	2466000	6 or 8
2466000	2468000	ARM or the
2468000	2470000	They are just
2470000	2472000	Really pretty much debating processors
2472000	2474000	Debating memory
2474000	2476000	Debating the cores
2476000	2478000	But they are basically trying to make
2478000	2480000	It be the be all end all
2480000	2482000	Of anything that you should have
2482000	2484000	In your living room
2484000	2486000	They are putting a price point on it
2486000	2488000	Of $299 with a projected
2488000	2490000	10 year life cycle
2490000	2492000	And they think that they will sell more than 100 million
2492000	2494000	Units and it is supposed to be out in 2013
2494000	2496000	The one thing on here
2496000	2498000	That I think is kind of neat
2498000	2500000	Is what they are calling project
2500000	2502000	Fortaleza I guess
2502000	2504000	The connect glasses
2504000	2506000	Where basically it is kind of like a VR
2506000	2508000	Thing
2508000	2510000	You can actually see all those lasers that the connect
2510000	2512000	Is actually firing out
2512000	2514000	If you saw some of those early videos
2514000	2516000	What was it, infrared?
2516000	2518000	If you actually look at the connect in infrared
2518000	2520000	It is like oh my god my room is full of lasers
2520000	2522000	Well the thing that I think is kind of cool
2522000	2524000	About this
2524000	2526000	Is that
2526000	2528000	It is like an in person interactivity kind of thing
2528000	2530000	Which I don't know if you have to have
2530000	2532000	A decent living room
2532000	2534000	Or if it is adjustable or whatever the crap
2534000	2536000	But
2536000	2538000	It makes me think of a kind of
2538000	2540000	Augmented reality kind of thing
2540000	2542000	Which honestly I think is fully possible
2542000	2544000	I don't know if you saw
2544000	2546000	For anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr
2546000	2548000	Which is
2548000	2550000	I will post it later
2550000	2552000	On my Tumblr I posted a link about
2552000	2554000	These new
2554000	2556000	That are
2556000	2558000	Full on display that basically
2558000	2560000	Will
2560000	2562000	Project an image directly to the retina
2562000	2564000	And
2564000	2566000	They are using it as enhancing
2566000	2568000	Poor eyesight and
2568000	2570000	Portable television that you can watch
2570000	2572000	With your eyes closed pretty much
2572000	2574000	And
2574000	2576000	I am thinking that if they have gone that far
2576000	2578000	That this is simple
2578000	2580000	This would be simple technology in comparison
2580000	2582000	Also
2582000	2584000	The document that was leaked
2584000	2586000	Was removed
2586000	2588000	So even if they are saying
2588000	2590000	Oh no that is not true
2590000	2592000	It was removed at the request of
2592000	2594000	Covington and Burlington LLP
2594000	2596000	The international law firm
2596000	2598000	That Microsoft has hired
2598000	2600000	Hmm
2600000	2602000	The plot thickens
2602000	2604000	Oh and by the way
2604000	2606000	Those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014
2606000	2608000	Loki I know you have been
2608000	2610000	Following this new story as well
2610000	2612000	Do you think it is fanboy wank
2612000	2614000	Or do you think it is the real deal
2614000	2616000	Well I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down
2616000	2618000	So there is something in it
2618000	2620000	Basically it is two years old
2620000	2622000	The document is not exactly
2622000	2624000	Brand new but a lot of stuff
2624000	2626000	It is interesting
2626000	2628000	I do not know
2628000	2630000	How much
2630000	2632000	It is all speculation
2632000	2634000	They are just kind of talking about
2634000	2636000	And thinking about something that is not necessarily
2636000	2638000	Their step by step plan
2638000	2640000	I did think it is interesting
2640000	2642000	How they are talking about acquiring
2642000	2644000	On live and that one of the things
2644000	2646000	That they are going to incorporate
2646000	2648000	Later on like in 2015 or something
2648000	2650000	After the console would launch
2650000	2652000	Would be that you would never
2652000	2654000	Need another console again
2654000	2656000	Any time that you would need to
2656000	2658000	Upgrade to games and the platform
2658000	2660000	Can't handle it, it is just streamed
2660000	2662000	I do not know if that is necessarily
2662000	2664000	Going to work
2664000	2666000	But a better Kinect is something
2666000	2668000	That we would expect
2668000	2670000	More processing power
2670000	2672000	The glass thing looks weird
2672000	2674000	It is kind of like that project glass
2674000	2676000	That Google did
2676000	2678000	And it does not mean it is going to happen
2678000	2680000	I think that is important to say too
2680000	2682000	Just because they are talking about this two years ago
2682000	2684000	Does not mean it is actually going to happen
2684000	2686000	I mean look at something like the Wii Vitality sensor
2686000	2688000	That even came out on the E3 stage
2688000	2690000	And suddenly disappeared
2690000	2692000	It does not mean the glasses thing will happen
2692000	2694000	This seems to me to be more of an R&D
2694000	2696000	Type of document
2696000	2698000	Well, I personally
2698000	2700000	I am sorry, I will let you finish
2700000	2702000	But personally I think it is a real document
2702000	2704000	I do and I think the fact that the lawyers
2704000	2706000	Took it down, it is what they call
2706000	2708000	What is it, Streisand syndrome
2708000	2710000	I think it is called that
2710000	2712000	The Streisand effect or something
2712000	2714000	And yes that is as in Barbara Streisand
2714000	2716000	Because one time
2716000	2718000	She tried to sue a company
2718000	2720000	Or her lawyers sued a company that published
2720000	2722000	A picture of her house
2722000	2724000	Like four people in the world saw
2724000	2726000	The picture of that house
2726000	2728000	Two of them being the lawyers until she sued the company
2728000	2730000	Then millions of people saw the picture
2730000	2732000	Of her house
2732000	2734000	So I think there is a little bit of that going on here
2734000	2736000	Because the Microsoft lawyers by taking down the document
2736000	2738000	Have somewhat proven
2738000	2740000	That there is legitimacy to it
2740000	2742000	Because Microsoft could have come out and said
2742000	2744000	Oh that thing is a bunch of crap
2744000	2746000	And maybe it was not crap
2746000	2748000	But nobody would have been any wiser
2748000	2750000	No, if they just said
2750000	2752000	Oh it is crap and then
2752000	2754000	However
2754000	2756000	I do not think it is a deep within
2756000	2758000	Microsoft document
2758000	2760000	It did not look professional enough
2760000	2762000	To be something that was done deep within Microsoft
2762000	2764000	I think this thing leaked out of some type
2764000	2766000	Of affiliate arrangement
2766000	2768000	I think a third party company put this thing together
2768000	2770000	I do not think it is
2770000	2772000	Directly Microsoft
2772000	2774000	Necessarily
2774000	2776000	Where there is smoke there is fire
2776000	2778000	And I think there is definitely some hot stuff in this document
2778000	2780000	Or perhaps
2780000	2782000	It was
2782000	2784000	A quote leak
2784000	2786000	If you know what I mean
2786000	2788000	Basically get it out there long enough for the
2788000	2790000	News centers to catch up on it
2790000	2792000	Yank it
2792000	2794000	Make it look official
2794000	2796000	I also think that
2796000	2798000	If it was like a hype generating
2798000	2800000	Stunt or something
2800000	2802000	I just do not really think it would generate
2802000	2804000	It is not really generating hype
2804000	2806000	Because it is just all very speculative
2806000	2808000	Especially if Microsoft is supposed to be announcing a new
2808000	2810000	Tablet on Monday as all the rumors say
2810000	2812000	Doing something like that between
2812000	2814000	E3 and a new tablet is kind of
2814000	2816000	Dumb
2816000	2818000	I do not know
2818000	2820000	There is too much coincidence in here
2820000	2822000	For this to not be real
2822000	2824000	I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing
2824000	2826000	I think the depth of that document
2826000	2828000	Would have been a lot to whip up
2828000	2830000	Somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one
2830000	2832000	On the internet if that is the case
2832000	2834000	Again
2834000	2836000	I think there is some legitimacy to this
2836000	2838000	But I do not think everything in here should be accepted
2838000	2840000	As fact because
2840000	2842000	A. The age
2842000	2844000	B. Ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light
2844000	2846000	That is
2846000	2848000	Basically what it boils down to
2848000	2850000	That is what good brainstorming is regardless
2850000	2852000	True
2852000	2854000	You throw out the idea you see if it is possible
2854000	2856000	If the whole thing is
2856000	2858000	Some dumb underground
2858000	2860000	Marketing ploy
2860000	2862000	Viral thing
2862000	2864000	Microsoft is trying to get feedback on the glasses thing
2864000	2866000	But I just think this is a dumb way to do it
2866000	2868000	If that is the case
2868000	2870000	If you put out anything the internet will respond to it
2870000	2872000	It is a guarantee
2872000	2874000	And if it is something big like Microsoft
2874000	2876000	Anything attached to Microsoft
2876000	2878000	The internet is definitely going to give some feedback
2878000	2880000	But let me just put it this way
2880000	2882000	If they are going to come to the table with something like that
2882000	2884000	You know in like two years time
2884000	2886000	That is not good for Nintendo
2886000	2888000	Because Nintendo does not
2888000	2890000	They are not bringing a whole lot to the table right now
2890000	2892000	They are bringing like
2892000	2894000	Hey look we can use the tablet with our system
2894000	2896000	And it is basically a Wii that does HD
2896000	2898000	That is not
2898000	2900000	This opens up a lot of possibilities
2900000	2902000	Of how you can make games and other applications
2902000	2904000	And stuff but
2904000	2906000	I do not know we will see
2906000	2908000	Especially since they are talking about these glasses
2908000	2910000	Or whatever not launching with the system
2910000	2912000	I do not know
2912000	2914000	All we need to see either way
2914000	2916000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
2916000	2918000	Not a whole lot of comments on this story
2918000	2920000	A lot of people still commenting about DS
2920000	2922000	And tech specifications and all this stuff
2922000	2924000	But Tiger Claw says
2924000	2926000	Smart glass how about dumb glass
2926000	2928000	I do not know
2928000	2930000	There are things I like and things I do not like
2930000	2932000	About this whole smart glass idea
2932000	2934000	I do not think it is as revolutionary as they make it sound
2934000	2936000	I mean whoopty shit
2936000	2938000	You can have some information
2938000	2940000	Some of the movies do this
2940000	2942000	Like the Tron Blu-ray
2942000	2944000	And there are other Blu-rays where you can do a very similar thing
2944000	2946000	It is cool
2946000	2948000	It is like the director's commentary track
2948000	2950000	Very few people go that extra mile to use it
2950000	2952000	Let's be real
2952000	2954000	Some of you do
2954000	2956000	Especially for movies that you love
2956000	2958000	That is a given but very few people do it
2958000	2960000	And it is not necessarily that this is something
2960000	2962000	That is not possible right now
2962000	2964000	Before this update
2964000	2966000	Because EA games have been doing this
2966000	2968000	With Mass Effect and stuff
2968000	2970000	They will have stuff that ties in with that
2970000	2972000	Hell you can even do with Call of Duty Elite
2972000	2974000	You can get the app for that on your Android
2974000	2976000	IOS devices
2976000	2978000	And you can tweak shit on there
2978000	2980000	Before you play the game
2980000	2982000	So they have this kind of stuff available already
2982000	2984000	And it is not that like
2984000	2986000	That does not sell a game tip for me
2986000	2988000	I mean if you know
2988000	2990000	Oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet
2990000	2992000	I am not going to go oh I have to get Madden now
2992000	2994000	I mean it does not seem like it is something
2994000	2996000	That is really going to sell me on games
2996000	2998000	I love this DC Nate in our chat room says
2998000	3000000	An alternate screen for your console
3000000	3002000	Dreamcast sheds another tear
3002000	3004000	It was just
3004000	3006000	It further proves that thing was just ahead of its time
3006000	3008000	Well and
3008000	3012000	Nintendo kind of already
3012000	3014000	Had that going on with that
3014000	3016000	Connection to the
3016000	3018000	Crystal Chronicles
3018000	3020000	We will just call it the Crystal Chronicles
3020000	3022000	That and Four Swords were the only games that really used it
3022000	3024000	Pac-Man
3024000	3026000	And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific
3026000	3028000	But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals
3028000	3030000	Five games used it and then it disappeared
3030000	3032000	Yeah
3032000	3034000	So
3034000	3036000	Like their LAN adapter
3036000	3038000	One game used it and then it disappeared
3038000	3040000	And then a bunch of people hacked it
3040000	3042000	So Mario Kart could use the warp pipe
3042000	3044000	Or whatever it was
3044000	3046000	Well that was over the internet stuff
3046000	3048000	I am talking about using the actual
3048000	3050000	LAN adapter
3050000	3052000	I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter
3052000	3054000	Maybe online but as far as LANs
3054000	3056000	Oh yeah you are right
3056000	3058000	Alright let's move on
3058000	3060000	So we can get to the classic game of the week
3060000	3062000	And release dates and all that good stuff
3062000	3064000	But first some more news stories Loki
3064000	3066000	Alright so
3066000	3068000	There is some hoo-ha
3068000	3070000	I guess about UDraw
3070000	3072000	And basically
3072000	3074000	A Georgia law firm is investigating
3074000	3076000	THQ to see
3076000	3078000	If they misled their investors
3078000	3080000	About the demand
3080000	3082000	For the UDraw tablet
3082000	3084000	Honestly I thought it was a really cool idea
3084000	3086000	So I could see where they
3086000	3088000	Think that the demand would be really high
3088000	3090000	And then it wasn't
3090000	3092000	And also I wonder if a lot of that
3092000	3094000	Kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying
3094000	3096000	That I think at one time
3096000	3098000	Nintendo was going to make a few
3098000	3100000	Games or whatever that would support it
3100000	3102000	And hell
3102000	3104000	Let's just get on the topic of the Wii U here
3104000	3106000	Why wasn't Mario Paint one of the
3106000	3108000	Launch titles for this system
3108000	3110000	I mean
3110000	3112000	That seems like a perfect title for the Wii U
3112000	3114000	Just saying
3114000	3116000	But yeah
3116000	3118000	They're still checking them out
3118000	3120000	And making sure that there wasn't
3120000	3122000	Any false and misleading statements
3122000	3124000	About its progress
3124000	3126000	I want to say that this is
3126000	3128000	Not the first franchise
3128000	3130000	That they were kind of
3130000	3132000	Supposedly misleading
3132000	3134000	People on
3134000	3136000	I want to see maybe UFC or something
3136000	3138000	I don't know
3138000	3140000	Interesting
3140000	3142000	I know those UDraw tablets
3142000	3144000	Are one of them sitting around
3144000	3146000	And they're going for dirt cheap
3146000	3148000	Mmm
3148000	3150000	THQ's been in a company that's had some
3150000	3152000	Rough times lately too
3152000	3154000	This is a fascinating story to me
3154000	3156000	What is like
3156000	3158000	I mean could it be that they just said
3158000	3160000	Okay
3160000	3162000	I understand that they are saying the demand is high
3162000	3164000	What if they believe the demand
3164000	3166000	They literally believe that the demand
3166000	3168000	Is going to be high for it and it just flops
3168000	3170000	Is that misleading your investors
3170000	3172000	I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate
3172000	3174000	With how much the demand is but what if
3174000	3176000	It's just like no one gave a shit
3176000	3178000	No shits were given that day
3178000	3180000	Would it be fair to say that
3180000	3182000	38 studios misled
3182000	3184000	The state of Rhode Island
3184000	3186000	Well that's a whole different story
3186000	3188000	It isn't it isn't
3188000	3190000	Well I don't believe
3190000	3192000	Kingdoms of Amalur had a
3192000	3194000	You know a peripheral that was tied to
3194000	3196000	Only you know certain games
3196000	3198000	Well it was that MMO never coming
3198000	3200000	Out too that really didn't do well
3200000	3202000	I mean I always have a problem
3202000	3204000	When you have a device that requires
3204000	3206000	A special peripheral
3206000	3208000	Because now you're locked in the buying games
3208000	3210000	That require that peripheral and if it's not something
3210000	3212000	That's widely used by a bunch of different companies
3212000	3214000	Because it was only THQ that was putting out
3214000	3216000	Stuff for it I mean they had licenses for
3216000	3218000	Spongebob and Disney princess stuff
3218000	3220000	And all that but no one
3220000	3222000	Really cares about that and they tried
3222000	3224000	Some funky stuff like with
3224000	3226000	Actually the Spongebob game they tried making
3226000	3228000	A kind of wire-wire type game
3228000	3230000	And it was dumb
3230000	3232000	So I could see why it just
3232000	3234000	Didn't sell very well and then they tried putting it
3234000	3236000	On other platforms and just
3236000	3238000	It bombed kind of like the Tony Hawk
3238000	3240000	Skateboard idea
3240000	3242000	I mean it was terrible
3242000	3244000	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room theorizes perhaps Mario Paint is coming later
3244000	3246000	It might just be one of their apps
3246000	3248000	I don't know I kind of think Nintendo
3248000	3250000	Is over Mario Paint
3250000	3252000	Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago
3252000	3254000	It still should
3254000	3256000	Pictochat
3256000	3258000	Was Mario Paint
3258000	3260000	Ooh do you think there's going to be something like Pictochat on the Wii U
3260000	3262000	Or like over the internet?
3262000	3264000	Oh is there oh
3264000	3266000	I guess I haven't been paying attention
3266000	3268000	You can leave messages and forms and stuff and you can also draw pictures
3268000	3270000	And stuff
3270000	3272000	That's kind of cool so if I want to just send Dark Sakura a big penis
3272000	3274000	I can do that
3274000	3276000	Well no there's moderation remember
3276000	3278000	Oh my gosh what if I don't want to post it publicly
3278000	3280000	What if I just want to send her a private penis
3280000	3282000	Oh well
3282000	3284000	I don't know how
3284000	3286000	Private peni are the best
3286000	3288000	I don't know how deep the moderation goes
3288000	3290000	Are they that deep
3290000	3292000	I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too
3292000	3294000	So I mean
3294000	3296000	How long before penises are being sent
3296000	3298000	All over the Wii U network privately
3298000	3300000	Instantly
3300000	3302000	There's no doubt about it I'm just saying that
3302000	3304000	The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination
3304000	3306000	Check out what I do with my Wii U
3306000	3308000	You're listening to Orange Penis Radio
3308000	3310000	Someone will see that penis
3310000	3312000	And it will be the moderator
3312000	3314000	The moderator will come home after the first day
3314000	3316000	Like I've seen so much penis today
3316000	3318000	I feel like I'm working in the porn industry
3318000	3320000	Oh Lord dry up
3320000	3322000	This river of penis
3322000	3324000	I knew you would get that one
3324000	3326000	Well you know what's funny
3326000	3328000	Is that
3328000	3330000	I don't remember if we talked about this on the show
3330000	3332000	Or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody
3332000	3334000	After the fact so I apologize if I'm not
3334000	3336000	Crediting the right person with this
3336000	3338000	But somebody was theorizing I think maybe it was on Facebook
3338000	3340000	That Nintendo's probably
3340000	3342000	Gonna hire an outsource company to do
3342000	3344000	All this moderation
3344000	3346000	So you're gonna have
3346000	3348000	This huge
3348000	3350000	Call center-esque thing filled with people
3350000	3352000	In either the Philippines or India
3352000	3354000	These poor people are gonna see
3354000	3356000	Penises all day long
3362000	3364000	It won't be done in Redmond
3364000	3366000	I think that's a damn
3366000	3368000	Fine theory that it's probably gonna be outsourced
3368000	3370000	I think I see that's my
3370000	3372000	Problem with this system is I think if
3372000	3374000	You know I'm an adult
3374000	3376000	I believe that I should be allowed
3376000	3378000	To you know post like
3378000	3380000	You know if I have my friends that I'm playing
3380000	3382000	Super Mario Brothers U with or whatever
3382000	3384000	And
3384000	3386000	Like Rob keeps dying at this one spot
3386000	3388000	And goes oh this is so hard
3388000	3390000	And I can tell him quit whining you
3390000	3392000	Fucking pansy you know and
3392000	3394000	Should be able to have that little thing pop up
3394000	3396000	Over world 3-1 or something like that
3398000	3400000	Why should that all be censored?
3400000	3402000	You're censoring my fun
3402000	3404000	No one wants to censor my fun
3404000	3406000	I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers
3406000	3408000	And all of a sudden
3408000	3410000	You have a message
3410000	3412000	Oh open up the message penis
3412000	3414000	Oh my god
3414000	3416000	Or tits I mean come on
3416000	3418000	Alright
3418000	3420000	I'm going to lie
3420000	3422000	They should totally have it in New Super Mario Brothers U
3422000	3424000	Where you can draw on the background
3424000	3426000	Of the levels you should be able to just stop
3426000	3428000	And sketch something on the levels
3428000	3430000	Uh alpha
3430000	3432000	Kananagram in chat says sky mario paint on the
3432000	3434000	DS was Wario do it yourself
3434000	3436000	I forgot about that
3436000	3438000	That was Nintendo we don't want to fucking
3438000	3440000	Make a game you make it yourself
3440000	3442000	Or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me
3442000	3444000	Uh let's see
3444000	3446000	The chat room is wondering
3446000	3448000	Where pen15 is tonight
3448000	3450000	This would be a perfect conversation for him
3450000	3452000	But sadly not here alright
3452000	3454000	Anyhow anything else you want to say about
3454000	3456000	Penis or I'm sorry this news story
3456000	3458000	That's it
3458000	3460000	Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U
3460000	3462000	Uh apparently
3462000	3464000	Some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo
3464000	3466000	Didn't show their big game at E3
3466000	3468000	After all destiny wasn't shown
3468000	3470000	On the Xbox so maybe
3470000	3472000	Something was held back a little bit
3472000	3474000	And this is because of a tweet
3474000	3476000	That game trailers editor in chief
3476000	3478000	Shane Satterfield said
3478000	3480000	Uh apparently
3480000	3482000	He said before E3
3482000	3484000	That the Wii U launch lineup
3484000	3486000	Was looking pretty damn good
3486000	3488000	Well if that's the case then he's probably the only one
3488000	3490000	That was thinking that
3490000	3492000	But it came out later he went on Twitter
3492000	3494000	And said quote
3494000	3496000	Just realized that a Wii U game
3496000	3498000	I knew about well before E3
3498000	3500000	Was never announced at the show
3500000	3502000	I'm guessing there's others
3502000	3504000	To come as well
3504000	3506000	Oh really? Yeah
3506000	3508000	Well sure why not
3508000	3510000	Because this
3510000	3512000	Got me into a topic on Twitter
3512000	3514000	Earlier this week that revealed
3514000	3516000	To me what I believe is the actual
3516000	3518000	Launch day for the Wii U
3518000	3520000	Which would be November 18th
3520000	3522000	I have to check my date
3522000	3524000	It's a Sunday of course
3524000	3526000	Of course that way you can camp out Saturday right
3526000	3528000	Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sundays
3528000	3530000	Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays
3530000	3532000	And I don't know why they're just obsessed with fucking Sundays
3532000	3534000	So yes November 18th
3534000	3536000	Now remember before I said
3536000	3538000	Well the 13th
3538000	3540000	Is gonna be out the 13th or before
3540000	3542000	Because there was a game that was dated for the 13th
3542000	3544000	Well there's other games dated for the 20th
3544000	3546000	Makes sense
3546000	3548000	You know just like the Vita launch
3548000	3550000	There was stuff that was out the week before
3550000	3552000	Could it just be a really good guest placeholder
3552000	3554000	Because honestly if I were to make an educated guess
3554000	3556000	Hmm the weekend before Thanksgiving
3556000	3558000	Yeah it's kind of in line with the way
3558000	3560000	They usually do it
3560000	3562000	But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays
3562000	3564000	Oh okay
3564000	3566000	And the game in question would be from Disney
3566000	3568000	And it's
3568000	3570000	Der their big game
3570000	3572000	Which would be
3572000	3574000	Epic Mickey 2
3574000	3576000	Which has not been announced yet
3576000	3578000	For the Wii U and I don't know when it will be announced
3578000	3580000	But it's coming
3580000	3582000	So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup
3582000	3584000	That they didn't talk about
3584000	3586000	At all
3586000	3588000	What up G in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3588000	3590000	Says rumor has it Nintendo is gonna show
3590000	3592000	Metro's game which of course
3592000	3594000	You know still is nowhere to be seen
3594000	3596000	Maybe it's the F-Zero game
3596000	3598000	Dream dream dream fanboy wank wank wank
3600000	3602000	It would be cool
3602000	3604000	I mean
3604000	3606000	I don't know but yeah I mean so
3606000	3608000	There that's you know
3608000	3610000	One and I know that
3610000	3612000	There was one I saw for
3612000	3614000	Transformers the new Transformers Prime
3614000	3616000	You know people don't really care about that
3616000	3618000	But I mean Epic Mickey 2 that's a pretty big fucking
3618000	3620000	Title not to mention
3620000	3622000	At all I mean unless
3622000	3624000	They're worried that it's not gonna be at launch but
3626000	3628000	I have things
3628000	3630000	That say otherwise
3630000	3632000	Alright well right alongside
3632000	3634000	That a story came out that
3634000	3636000	Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U
3636000	3638000	Third party games are yet to be
3638000	3640000	Announced and that's a quote from
3640000	3642000	David Yarnton who's the head of Nintendo's
3642000	3644000	UK division
3644000	3646000	Apparently this was in Nintendo gamer
3646000	3648000	Magazine it said quote
3648000	3650000	I think a lot of third party companies are
3650000	3652000	Developing for Wii U and a lot of it hasn't
3652000	3654000	Been announced but we can't comment on
3654000	3656000	Speculation there are lots of things
3656000	3658000	Everybody wishes for
3658000	3660000	Call of Duty is another one that's
3660000	3662000	Confirmed but
3662000	3664000	They haven't announced it yet
3664000	3666000	But then again they also haven't
3666000	3668000	Announced it for the Wii yet either so
3668000	3670000	So that comes usually later
3670000	3672000	What does this mean Nintendo's waiting for their
3672000	3674000	Tokyo game show concurrent event because they
3674000	3676000	Don't do Tokyo game show but they usually do a big
3676000	3678000	Event they may be announcing more
3678000	3680000	Stuff there I think it's just a way that
3680000	3682000	These companies are they announce
3682000	3684000	That far out ahead
3684000	3686000	You know ahead sometimes like Call of Duty
3686000	3688000	Every year it seems to be it's always
3688000	3690000	Gonna be Playstation 3
3690000	3692000	Xbox 360 PC announced
3692000	3694000	And then later on like last year it was
3694000	3696000	At their live
3696000	3698000	Call of Duty event in LA that they
3698000	3700000	Announced the Wii version
3700000	3702000	And then also DS and there was
3702000	3704000	The you know the elite
3704000	3706000	Stuff and the
3706000	3708000	You know special editions
3708000	3710000	And something none of that stuff's been announced yet
3710000	3712000	Oh but that's I mean
3712000	3714000	Just reality check the system's out in
3714000	3716000	Five months you know assuming it's out in November
3716000	3718000	Which is obviously a safe bet that's five
3718000	3720000	Months from now it's not
3720000	3722000	A whole lot of time to finish up the games
3722000	3724000	If you don't already know you're doing it
3724000	3726000	It's interesting I mean
3726000	3728000	Maybe there'll be something closer
3728000	3730000	To the end of summer when is Tokyo game show though
3730000	3732000	October? Seattle?
3732000	3734000	Oh it's September? Usually
3734000	3736000	Maybe two months is enough lead time but one month
3736000	3738000	Definitely isn't
3738000	3740000	But a lot of these games like I mean I don't see them
3740000	3742000	Talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo
3742000	3744000	Game show because that's not really a title
3744000	3746000	Skew towards the Japanese market
3746000	3748000	WhatupG in our chat room says
3748000	3750000	EA says they will announce a couple of games
3750000	3752000	At Gamescom for Wii U
3752000	3754000	FIFA probably
3754000	3756000	I don't know about NBA Live
3756000	3758000	But FIFA I think is for sure
3758000	3760000	Which Gamescom would be the place to announce
3760000	3762000	That too
3762000	3764000	Yeah I think they've already said FIFA was gonna be on the Wii U
3764000	3766000	Madden is on the Wii U
3766000	3768000	I believe I think that's already been announced
3768000	3770000	AkumaJP is in our chat he lives in Japan
3770000	3772000	And has gone to Tokyo game show and confirms
3772000	3774000	It's September my bad I thought it was October
3774000	3776000	For some reason
3776000	3778000	Still
3778000	3780000	I mean I don't know I could
3780000	3782000	Yeah I definitely agree this stuff
3782000	3784000	Lots of it hasn't been announced yet
3784000	3786000	I mean
3786000	3788000	For sure there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet
3788000	3790000	But I don't know
3790000	3792000	Everything
3792000	3794000	That's not been announced
3794000	3796000	I just know I know that one
3796000	3798000	And I know that it has a firm date on it
3798000	3800000	Because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff
3800000	3802000	And there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before
3802000	3804000	And the week after so
3804000	3806000	It seems to fit
3806000	3808000	And like I said
3808000	3810000	They're delaying the game
3810000	3812000	I don't know if that's even made it out yet
3812000	3814000	The game is not coming out in September anymore
3814000	3816000	All the other platforms
3816000	3818000	It's been confirmed I know for Europe
3818000	3820000	But they have not announced North America yet
3820000	3822000	But that is also going to be delayed
3822000	3824000	Europe is coming out on the 20th
3824000	3826000	So if you think about it
3826000	3828000	The console is probably not going to launch
3828000	3830000	I mean it's going to launch at the same time roughly
3830000	3832000	In all regions but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday
3832000	3834000	Like they did with the Wii
3834000	3836000	Wii launched on that Sunday
3836000	3838000	I believe if I remember correctly
3838000	3840000	Yeah it did
3840000	3842000	I remember we went out really late at night
3842000	3844000	And you know remember we were going out and Breslow was here
3844000	3846000	And everything and the lesbians
3846000	3848000	We all went out
3848000	3850000	Well I think it was just me and Kristin
3850000	3852000	We were at the
3852000	3854000	Yeah Extifer was at Target with you guys wasn't he?
3854000	3856000	Yeah Extifer
3856000	3858000	For a little bit
3858000	3860000	No Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me
3860000	3862000	Not at that Target we were at the
3862000	3864000	Oh you guys went somewhere else
3864000	3866000	Yeah so was Extifer
3866000	3868000	I don't remember him being there with us
3868000	3870000	Because we were just sitting there exchanging fan fiction
3870000	3872000	I had a Wii the day it came out because Extifer camped out for it
3872000	3874000	He was at that Target
3874000	3876000	It was a long time ago
3876000	3878000	I really don't remember seeing him then
3878000	3880000	It was a long time ago
3880000	3882000	Because we would have been hanging out with him
3882000	3884000	Yeah because remember we went to WinCo I believe
3884000	3886000	And got orange soda
3886000	3888000	No all we did was go to Krispy Kreme
3888000	3890000	And get donuts and coffee
3890000	3892000	Yeah I remember hearing about that
3892000	3894000	I only stayed out until about 2 am and then I was like fuck it I'm going home
3894000	3896000	I'm not staying up for that
3896000	3898000	Alright one more story for you guys then we're going to travel around the world
3898000	3900000	And look at release dates but first Dark Sakura has a story for us
3900000	3902000	I do don't I
3902000	3904000	Well how about
3904000	3906000	Well a game that we've brought up on the show before
3906000	3908000	Draw something
3908000	3910000	Over it
3910000	3912000	I like it
3912000	3914000	At any rate it's kind of funny that
3914000	3916000	Just as soon as Zynga purchased
3916000	3918000	OMG Pop
3918000	3920000	People stopped playing it
3920000	3922000	They dropped something like
3922000	3924000	Ten
3924000	3926000	They did
3926000	3928000	They lost ten million
3928000	3930000	Monthly active users
3930000	3932000	In thirty days
3932000	3934000	But anyway they might be
3934000	3936000	Doing a TV show with CBS
3936000	3938000	That's kind of along the lines
3938000	3940000	Of what Win Loser Draw was
3940000	3942000	Well they have that host with the awesome
3942000	3944000	Hair what was his name Burt something
3944000	3946000	Not Burt Reynolds but Burt something else
3946000	3948000	I don't remember
3948000	3950000	Oh man
3950000	3952000	But
3952000	3954000	But the
3954000	3956000	In the mean time
3956000	3958000	While that's still in the talks
3958000	3960000	They're thinking about bringing it out in more
3960000	3962000	Languages including Chinese
3964000	3966000	Well I mean if they have a successful
3966000	3968000	TV show based off of it it would certainly
3968000	3970000	Justify some of that extremely
3970000	3972000	High price
3972000	3974000	I've decided that Draw something
3974000	3976000	Would be much easier if I had an iPad
3976000	3978000	Oh hey this says
3978000	3980000	A complete episode of Win, Lose
3980000	3982000	Or Draw available here
3982000	3984000	Complete with commercials
3988000	3990000	I love stuff like this on YouTube
3990000	3992000	That's amazing
3992000	3994000	It's a coke commercial
3994000	3996000	Let me fast forward
3996000	3998000	There we go there's one Loser Draw
4000000	4002000	Burt Convy
4002000	4004000	Yeah and they all sit on the floor
4004000	4006000	To play
4006000	4008000	This show is awesome
4008000	4012000	Dude that's Alan Thicke
4020000	4022000	What ever happened to Lani Anderson?
4022000	4024000	Let's find out
4030000	4032000	Look I could do this all night but we better not
4032000	4034000	Oh it says right here in the description
4034000	4036000	Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds and Alan Thicke
4036000	4038000	I hope they have awesome
4038000	4040000	B list celebrities on
4040000	4042000	Draw something TV
4042000	4044000	That would be the only reason to watch
4044000	4046000	Oh my god
4046000	4048000	She just is still kinda
4048000	4050000	Plasticy looking
4050000	4052000	Well Lani Anderson's gotta be like 65 at least
4052000	4054000	She was born in 45 so yeah
4054000	4056000	I wonder if they'll have people
4056000	4058000	Drawing really elaborate pictures
4058000	4060000	Something simple
4060000	4062000	Like Darth Vader holding a cup
4062000	4064000	And it's a cup
4064000	4066000	Acidic Vampire
4066000	4068000	She's on her fourth marriage
4068000	4070000	Acidic Vampire in our chat room says bring back old game shows
4070000	4072000	Supermarket Suite please
4072000	4074000	Hell yes
4074000	4076000	The last movie she was in was
4076000	4078000	A Night at the Roxbury
4078000	4080000	Well you know what they need to do
4080000	4082000	So here's the trick
4082000	4084000	If you want to bring Supermarket Suite back
4084000	4086000	You've gotta write a new app
4086000	4088000	For iOS that mimics the old game show
4088000	4090000	And throwing hams into a cart
4090000	4092000	And brewing the coffee
4092000	4094000	For a bonus $200
4094000	4096000	And those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup
4096000	4098000	That were the bonus prizes
4098000	4100000	And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show
4100000	4102000	Out of your iOS game
4102000	4104000	The last two shows she was on was one called
4104000	4106000	The Mullets
4106000	4108000	And then So Notorious
4108000	4110000	Oh god that was the Tory
4110000	4112000	Spelling show
4112000	4114000	Actually that show was really good
4114000	4116000	Don't judge me
4116000	4118000	Do not judge me you're judging me
4118000	4120000	I am judging you
4120000	4122000	You just said
4122000	4124000	I of judgment almost
4124000	4126000	I said I am judging you
4126000	4128000	Release dates let's travel around the world
4128000	4130000	And check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U
4130000	4132000	That statement doesn't require
4132000	4134000	Extra garbage
4134000	4136000	To play a card game
4136000	4138000	So coming out
4138000	4140000	Actually tomorrow
4140000	4142000	Pokemon Conquest
4142000	4144000	On the DS it crosses
4144000	4146000	Nobunaga's Ambition
4146000	4148000	And Pokemon
4148000	4150000	Because that really needed to be crossed
4150000	4152000	Some people
4152000	4154000	Are looking forward to it
4154000	4156000	Disney Pixar's Brave
4156000	4158000	The video game on Playstation 3, Xbox
4158000	4160000	360, Wii and DS
4160000	4162000	Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes
4162000	4164000	On Playstation 3, Xbox
4164000	4166000	360, Wii, 3DS
4166000	4168000	DS, Vita and PC
4170000	4172000	And
4172000	4174000	Steel Battalion Heavy Armor
4174000	4176000	Game that's gonna really suck
4176000	4178000	Using the Kinect
4178000	4180000	So that is also coming out
4180000	4182000	Oh and I re-released the Quake 4
4182000	4184000	Because now Bethesda is releasing it
4184000	4186000	So
4186000	4188000	Of course, of course
4188000	4190000	I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering
4190000	4192000	We better not have another power outage before
4192000	4194000	Part A finishes here
4194000	4196000	I'd rather have the power outage today than next week
4196000	4198000	Yeah right? Don't jinx it
4198000	4200000	I'm not jinxing it
4200000	4202000	I don't know what we're- next week we're gonna need to have like a
4202000	4204000	Moratorium on power in this place
4204000	4206000	Because I don't want to blow a fuse
4206000	4208000	Anyhow, going to Japan
4208000	4210000	And looking at release dates over
4210000	4212000	There, we have on the Nintendo 3DS
4212000	4214000	Hello Kitty
4214000	4216000	Tohsekai Ryoku
4216000	4218000	Irona Kunii Dorekake
4218000	4220000	Shimasho
4220000	4222000	From Compile, who I am pissed
4222000	4224000	Compile is around and instead of
4224000	4226000	Doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making
4226000	4228000	Hello Kitty games
4228000	4230000	Yeah, get with it Compile
4230000	4232000	You know what your people want
4232000	4234000	Wouldn't it be hilarious? Rare
4234000	4236000	Announces, or was it, not rare
4236000	4238000	Retro Studios, Retro Studios announces
4238000	4240000	Guardian Legend Cross
4240000	4242000	F-Zero, the racing action
4242000	4244000	Shooter game I would jizz
4244000	4246000	I'm not even gonna hold back
4246000	4248000	It's what would happen
4248000	4250000	Let's see
4250000	4252000	Nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear
4252000	4254000	Solid collection coming out next week in Japan
4254000	4256000	That's not this week, sorry to say
4256000	4258000	How about the Playstation 3?
4258000	4260000	There's some stuff from Sega this week
4260000	4262000	K-ON! Hokkago Live
4262000	4264000	HD version
4264000	4266000	Mass Effect 2 gets a best hits
4266000	4268000	Version, and I think that's the version that comes with
4268000	4270000	All the DLC, I wonder if that's localized
4270000	4272000	With voice acting for Japan, that's pretty cool
4272000	4274000	I'd like to play a copy
4274000	4276000	Of that, just, you know, cause it's fun and different
4276000	4278000	Sniper Ghost Warrior
4278000	4280000	Comes out as well, and
4280000	4282000	Shutsugeki
4282000	4284000	Otometachi
4284000	4286000	No Senju 2 comes out
4286000	4288000	From SystemSoft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game
4288000	4290000	We have over here, I don't think it is
4290000	4292000	That's not something I recognize
4292000	4294000	Lol, no
4294000	4296000	I was looking to see if
4296000	4298000	Yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts
4298000	4300000	Japanese, I wonder if it's
4300000	4302000	I wanna see some dialogue
4302000	4304000	Oh, maybe not
4304000	4306000	Hey, this is kinda cool, actually
4306000	4308000	Something SSJ100Matt said in chat
4308000	4310000	What's that?
4310000	4312000	I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release
4312000	4314000	Days on Sundays, apparently back
4314000	4316000	In the Super Nest days, they would release games
4316000	4318000	During the week in Japan, when games
4318000	4320000	Were released during the week, people would skip work
4320000	4322000	In school to buy and play games
4322000	4324000	Apparently the Japanese government requested Nintendo
4324000	4326000	Change their release dates to the weekend
4326000	4328000	So there's no lost productivity
4328000	4330000	Interesting
4330000	4332000	I learned something
4332000	4334000	From the VOG Network chat room tonight, good job
4334000	4336000	Alright
4336000	4338000	And knowing is half the battle
4338000	4340000	Exactly, alright, that's it for Japanese
4340000	4342000	Release dates, let's move on to the UK
4342000	4344000	Well, for the UK
4344000	4346000	Not a whole bunch, it's a really short
4346000	4348000	List
4348000	4350000	On the 20th, Magic the Gathering
4350000	4352000	Duel of the Planewalkers
4352000	4354000	2013
4354000	4356000	On the 21st, Mutant Mudds on 3DS
4356000	4358000	And, let's see
4358000	4360000	On the 22nd, Civ V
4360000	4362000	Gods and Kings
4362000	4364000	And Steel Battalion, Heavy
4364000	4366000	Armor, and that's it until the 25th
4366000	4368000	So, nope
4368000	4370000	Nothing
4370000	4372000	Well, I mean, nothing
4372000	4374000	I guess, really good unless you're a big Civ fan
4374000	4376000	I guess that would apply to you, Rob
4376000	4378000	But you're not in the UK
4378000	4380000	So
4380000	4382000	How about... Well, the good news is
4382000	4384000	It's out here, and
4384000	4386000	It's out next week, or I think came out this week
4386000	4388000	I need to check
4388000	4390000	I gotta plan an epic Civ V night
4390000	4392000	With some friends, but, like, literally
4392000	4394000	That's an all-day, all-night event, so
4394000	4396000	It'll be sometime in July
4396000	4398000	So how about moving on to another story?
4398000	4400000	Alright, we can do that
4400000	4402000	I'm out of stuff for the UK
4402000	4404000	That's really it
4404000	4406000	Let's talk about Star Wars, and how
4406000	4408000	Something that they announced during E3
4408000	4410000	That Star Wars, the older public
4410000	4412000	Is gonna be free to
4412000	4414000	Well, not really free to play, but you can play for free
4414000	4416000	Up to level 15
4416000	4418000	And, you know
4418000	4420000	People are wondering, are they actually just
4420000	4422000	Testing the market with this?
4422000	4424000	And, apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case
4424000	4426000	They're saying that, you know, because
4426000	4428000	Before they lost
4428000	4430000	You know, 400,000 subscribers
4430000	4432000	And it's probably gonna get worse
4432000	4434000	Once the new World of Warcraft
4434000	4436000	Expansion comes out
4436000	4438000	But, you know, they're saying, you know
4438000	4440000	If it was just free to play games
4440000	4442000	And they weren't very good
4442000	4444000	It wouldn't even be a question, but
4444000	4446000	There are definitely good games out there
4446000	4448000	And good games coming out, so, of course
4448000	4450000	All of this competition impacts your plan
4450000	4452000	And with what you wanna do
4452000	4454000	So
4454000	4456000	It's interesting
4456000	4458000	The other interesting thing is this article got pulled
4458000	4460000	As well
4460000	4462000	But
4462000	4464000	Maybe they are gonna go all the way
4464000	4466000	And make it free to play, especially if it's just not
4466000	4468000	Panning out like they were hoping
4468000	4470000	If that's the case, it's kinda sad and unfortunate
4470000	4472000	Because the game hasn't exactly
4472000	4474000	Been out that long, and that's a really quick turnaround
4474000	4476000	But, I mean, we've heard the fact
4476000	4478000	That servers are
4478000	4480000	Losing people bad
4480000	4482000	And they're already talking about server merges
4482000	4484000	But when that game
4484000	4486000	Excuse me
4486000	4488000	When that game came out, obviously it was huge
4488000	4490000	And everybody wanted to check it out
4490000	4492000	But it had a real problem with retaining people
4492000	4494000	And I think a lot of that
4494000	4496000	It hasn't been that long either, I mean, like, five months
4496000	4498000	Five and a half months
4498000	4500000	I'm assuming part of that is the weekend game
4500000	4502000	But I do know some people that are into the end game and enjoying it
4502000	4504000	It seems like the launch of Star Wars
4504000	4506000	Was better than the original
4506000	4508000	World of Warcraft launch, but then again
4508000	4510000	What you could get away with seven years ago
4510000	4512000	In this day and age when there's tons of MMOs to choose from
4512000	4514000	Well, and also I think from what I've been hearing
4514000	4516000	A lot of the complaints with the Old Republic
4516000	4518000	Was that it did a lot of the
4518000	4520000	Same things that World of Warcraft does
4520000	4522000	You kinda have to make your game
4522000	4524000	A little different. Yes, I understand it works
4524000	4526000	For World of Warcraft, but if you just fucking copy them
4526000	4528000	It's... put it this way
4528000	4530000	Chinese knockoffs
4530000	4532000	Have never as good as the real thing
4532000	4534000	If copying something made it just as good
4534000	4536000	As the original, then
4536000	4538000	Why would be
4538000	4540000	Having a whole bunch of, you know, counterfeit stuff
4540000	4542000	Star Wars wasn't
4542000	4544000	Didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff
4544000	4546000	To me, I mean certainly there were some things inspired
4546000	4548000	By WoW, but there was a lot
4548000	4550000	That kinda tied into the other Star Wars
4550000	4552000	Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth
4552000	4554000	There was a lot
4554000	4556000	It was a good single player game
4556000	4558000	That's for sure, and I think that's what happened
4558000	4560000	A lot of people played to 50 and then that was kinda it
4560000	4562000	You know, I think
4562000	4564000	That ended up being part of the problem
4564000	4566000	They invested so much in the single player
4566000	4568000	In all the voice acting and everything
4568000	4570000	I kinda think that might have been one of the big mistakes
4570000	4572000	Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much
4572000	4574000	In the voice acting, I mean yes
4574000	4576000	It really adds a great deep element
4576000	4578000	And immersion into the game, but I think that was
4578000	4580000	A resource that could have been better spent somewhere else
4582000	4584000	More servers
4584000	4586000	Well, not even that, they didn't need more servers
4586000	4588000	They had a problem at launch, I thought
4588000	4590000	They fixed it really quick
4590000	4592000	It was no worse than what happened in WoW when it started
4592000	4594000	I think Star Trek Online handled that type of thing better
4594000	4596000	Because they really only had
4596000	4598000	Two celebrities for voice acting
4598000	4600000	They had Leonard Nimoy doing narration
4600000	4602000	For each of the new areas
4602000	4604000	And they had
4604000	4606000	What's-his-face
4606000	4608000	Zachary Quinto
4608000	4610000	Yes, as the
4610000	4612000	EMH, the Emergency Medical Hologram
4612000	4614000	For the first mission
4614000	4616000	And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything
4616000	4618000	You don't have people
4618000	4620000	Saying, hey, give me money
4620000	4622000	Or anything
4622000	4624000	It has very limited voice acting
4624000	4626000	Yeah, but
4626000	4628000	They've managed to get dedicated voice actors
4628000	4630000	For their main people
4630000	4632000	True
4632000	4634000	I have to say, even What's-his-face
4634000	4636000	Metzen does half of everybody
4636000	4638000	Including Thrall
4638000	4640000	But
4640000	4642000	I think their best voice actor
4642000	4644000	Is the lady that does Sylvanas
4644000	4646000	Because, oh my god, that just chills
4646000	4648000	But anyway
4648000	4650000	They put the money into
4650000	4652000	Making sure, there's one dedicated
4652000	4654000	Server that can handle everybody
4654000	4656000	That's on it, you've got your beta test server
4656000	4658000	And as far as the voices go
4658000	4660000	They didn't license any music
4660000	4662000	It's really kind of limited
4662000	4664000	But you don't care once you're playing it
4664000	4666000	Because the game itself is in depth
4666000	4668000	And I think that's where you're getting
4668000	4670000	Into the difference
4670000	4672000	Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week
4672000	4674000	And it has to do with Ubisoft
4674000	4676000	Or as a lot of people have been calling him since last week
4676000	4678000	Boobysoft
4678000	4680000	Is apparently talking to Warner Brothers and Paramount
4680000	4682000	For a movie dealing with
4682000	4684000	Splinter Cell
4684000	4686000	This is according to a report from
4686000	4688000	Deadline, Ubisoft is in talks with
4688000	4690000	Warner Brothers and Paramount over a
4690000	4692000	Film tie-in
4692000	4694000	It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow
4694000	4696000	It could also follow a new
4696000	4698000	Kind of story set in the same universe
4698000	4700000	However, it is worth pointing out
4700000	4702000	There have also been, in the past, deals on
4702000	4704000	Uncharted and Bioshock
4704000	4706000	Nothing's happened yet
4706000	4708000	So, just because they're talking
4708000	4710000	About it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it
4710000	4712000	Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft
4712000	4714000	Has also registered some
4714000	4716000	Domains in regards
4716000	4718000	To their new IP Watch Dogs
4718000	4720000	Remember that was the big game they showed
4720000	4722000	At the end of their press conference that
4722000	4724000	Made a lot of people pay attention and some said
4724000	4726000	Kind of stole the show away from the
4726000	4728000	Big companies
4728000	4730000	They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie
4730000	4732000	Watch Dogs The Movie
4732000	4734000	Watch Dash Dogs The Movie and so forth
4734000	4736000	This could mean that there's plans
4736000	4738000	Or talks about a movie
4738000	4740000	I also kind of think this could just be
4740000	4742000	Protection of the intellectual property
4742000	4744000	Just to make sure
4744000	4746000	Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or
4746000	4748000	Whatever or something, you know, and maybe because
4748000	4750000	The game looks so good it could be a movie
4750000	4752000	Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it
4752000	4754000	For one when they start seeing the commercials on TV
4754000	4756000	I don't think you necessarily
4756000	4758000	Want to read into this that they're absolutely
4758000	4760000	Making a movie because of this, this could just be
4760000	4762000	You know, trying to protect someone
4762000	4764000	It's the same reason why we registered
4764000	4766000	TheVogNetwork.com
4766000	4768000	Because so many hosts
4768000	4770000	Were calling it TheVogNetwork
4770000	4772000	Kind of a similar thing
4772000	4774000	Alright, let's
4774000	4776000	Let's go back to a time when games
4776000	4778000	Were simpler and they weren't making movies
4778000	4780000	Out of every single stinking game
4780000	4782000	In fact, the only movie that got a game was
4782000	4784000	Super Mario Bros. or excuse me, the only game
4784000	4786000	That got a movie was Super Mario Bros. and it
4786000	4788000	Sucked
4788000	4790000	It's the classic game of the week
4790000	4792000	And since it's not the classic
4792000	4794000	Video game of the week
4794000	4796000	Screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game
4796000	4798000	It doesn't say classic
4798000	4800000	Video game of the week, she's got a point
4800000	4802000	This is in my house too
4802000	4804000	It is
4804000	4806000	Twilight Zone that was
4806000	4808000	Done by Bally Midway
4808000	4810000	Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
4810000	4812000	Uh, that's Mortal Kombat
4812000	4814000	You unlock this door with the
4814000	4816000	Key of imagination
4816000	4818000	Anyway
4818000	4820000	It was designed by Pat Lawler
4820000	4822000	Who is like one of the all
4822000	4824000	Time best pinball
4824000	4826000	Table designers, like let me go over his
4826000	4828000	List just real quick
4828000	4830000	He did Earth Shaker and Whirlwind
4830000	4832000	He did Fun House where you got to hit
4832000	4834000	That ugly guy in the head a bunch of times
4834000	4836000	He did Adam's Family
4836000	4838000	He did Safe Cracker
4838000	4840000	With Stern, he did
4840000	4842000	Roller Coaster Tycoon, Ripley's
4842000	4844000	Believe it or not, NASCAR, Family Guy
4844000	4846000	CSI, and Shrek
4846000	4848000	I mean this guy is
4848000	4850000	He's done some of the best tables
4850000	4852000	Out there
4852000	4854000	But anyway, Twilight Zone
4854000	4856000	Is based off of the
4856000	4858000	Twilight Zone TV show
4858000	4860000	It's one of the super pin series
4860000	4862000	Of wide body pinball tables
4862000	4864000	Other ones include
4864000	4866000	Star Trek The Next Generation and
4866000	4868000	Indiana Jones The Pinball Adventure
4868000	4870000	Which is at Disneyland again
4870000	4872000	It's at the
4872000	4874000	Was it the Jungle Trader? Anyway
4874000	4876000	But because
4876000	4878000	He was so successful with Adam's Family
4878000	4880000	Midway's like, here you
4880000	4882000	Can do the whole thing, you don't need to ask us
4882000	4884000	Anything, and this is considered to be
4884000	4886000	One of the most complex pinball
4886000	4888000	Tables ever designed
4888000	4890000	It has a working gumball
4890000	4892000	Machine that deposits balls
4892000	4894000	An analog clock deposits balls
4894000	4896000	Shut up
4896000	4898000	I knew you were going to do that
4898000	4900000	It has a working analog clock
4900000	4902000	It's a timer for different modes
4902000	4904000	A power field
4904000	4906000	Which is basically like
4906000	4908000	Right on top
4908000	4910000	Of the left hand side
4910000	4912000	Of the thing
4912000	4914000	Basically instead of using flippers
4914000	4916000	You're using magnets
4916000	4918000	To play the ball through this little mini field
4918000	4920000	And the power ball where you use a white ceramic
4920000	4922000	Ball that's lighter
4922000	4924000	And it's given that it's
4924000	4926000	Not magnetic, it's not affected by the
4926000	4928000	Magnets in the table
4928000	4930000	It also uses
4930000	4932000	The original theme
4932000	4934000	From the Twilight Zone
4934000	4936000	And it also uses
4936000	4938000	I don't know who likes
4938000	4940000	Their early 80's rock
4940000	4942000	But it uses the song Twilight Zone by
4942000	4944000	Golden Earring
4944000	4946000	And it actually
4946000	4948000	Has a
4948000	4950000	Really good vocal
4950000	4952000	Lightness, Tim Kittrow did
4952000	4954000	The voice of Rod Serling
4954000	4956000	It was
4956000	4958000	Supposed to be the first game
4958000	4960000	To use the Williams Midway
4960000	4962000	DCS sound system
4962000	4964000	But it was still being developed
4964000	4966000	So it used the Yamaha YM-2151
4966000	4968000	Harris CVSD soundboard
4968000	4970000	And it is
4970000	4972000	Considered right now
4972000	4974000	The top rated electronic pinball
4974000	4976000	Table of Instagram
4976000	4978000	As far as
4978000	4980000	Little fun stuff that's in there
4980000	4982000	And I'm just going to read through the list on here
4982000	4984000	It has the door from the
4984000	4986000	Opening credits right in the
4986000	4988000	Center of the play field
4988000	4990000	You have the mannequin, the zodiac
4990000	4992000	Clop from the very beginning
4992000	4994000	It has an image of
4994000	4996000	Henry Burness from the episode
4996000	4998000	Time Enough At Last
4998000	5000000	It's next to the slot machine
5000000	5002000	The hitchhiker
5002000	5004000	The slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover
5004000	5006000	You have the most
5006000	5008000	Unusual camera
5008000	5010000	Which is actually a pretty good episode
5010000	5012000	The invader, static, the piano of the house
5012000	5014000	Has the player piano
5014000	5016000	From that. You have
5016000	5018000	Talky Tina from the living doll
5018000	5020000	Here's your extra ball
5020000	5022000	I know, it's pretty cool
5022000	5024000	They need the tower of terror
5024000	5026000	Where your balls just drop
5026000	5028000	Robbie the Robot
5028000	5030000	Is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center
5030000	5032000	Whipple is on the play field
5032000	5034000	And in an animation
5034000	5036000	And different sound effects
5036000	5038000	Like the Serling voiceovers
5038000	5040000	My favorite one which we heard right at the beginning
5040000	5042000	You unlock this door with a key of imagination
5042000	5044000	May I present
5044000	5046000	A most unusual camera
5046000	5048000	You know, that type of stuff
5048000	5050000	But the
5050000	5052000	You have different door panel modes
5052000	5054000	Where one is like
5054000	5056000	Ten million points, the light the gumball
5056000	5058000	The town square madness, fast lock
5058000	5060000	Super skill shot, the super slot
5060000	5062000	The extra ball
5062000	5064000	The camera
5064000	5066000	The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game
5066000	5068000	There's also the spiral
5068000	5070000	Clock millions, battle the power
5070000	5072000	Greed, which actually
5072000	5074000	Is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family
5074000	5076000	Exactly
5076000	5078000	The hitchhiker
5078000	5080000	And the clock chaos
5080000	5082000	There's actually one of my favorite things to do
5082000	5084000	And this is one of the skill shots in the game
5084000	5086000	Is when you use
5086000	5088000	One of the top right flippers
5088000	5090000	And you have to hold the left flipper open
5090000	5092000	So that you're shooting it up a ramp
5092000	5094000	Under the mini field
5094000	5096000	So I mean, it's really
5096000	5098000	Complex, really hard
5098000	5100000	And then on top of that you have four different
5100000	5102000	Multiball modes
5102000	5104000	You have the standard multiball
5104000	5106000	Powerball mania
5106000	5108000	Where it happens
5108000	5110000	When you load the powerball into the gumball machine
5110000	5112000	And then
5112000	5114000	You have to keep making shots over the main playfield
5114000	5116000	And you get a 50 million point jackpot
5116000	5118000	You have the
5118000	5120000	Fast lock multiball
5120000	5122000	And then lost in the zone
5122000	5124000	Which is the wizard mode
5124000	5126000	Where if you light all of the door panels
5126000	5128000	You get a door knob with a question mark
5128000	5130000	And it pops open
5130000	5132000	And you have 45 seconds
5132000	5134000	To make an unlimited number of shots
5134000	5136000	To all the targets
5136000	5138000	Basically every playable
5138000	5140000	Single ball mode is active during this time period
5140000	5142000	So it's basically
5142000	5144000	45 seconds of three for all
5144000	5146000	And then
5146000	5148000	In most of the machines though
5148000	5150000	You have your standard multiball
5150000	5152000	With three being released
5152000	5154000	There's all kinds of custom mods
5154000	5156000	That people have done
5156000	5158000	Like one person added in
5158000	5160000	The Robbie the Robot toy
5160000	5162000	Into their machine
5162000	5164000	There's other design mods like the
5164000	5166000	Third play field magnet
5166000	5168000	The gumball flashers, the gumballs
5168000	5170000	We actually I think added an LED into ours
5170000	5172000	I want to say
5172000	5174000	But yeah we have a gumball flasher
5174000	5176000	That's an independent mod
5176000	5178000	Different you know
5178000	5180000	Colors, different things you can add in
5180000	5182000	Just all kinds, people mod their stuff
5182000	5184000	All the way, now here's the cool stuff
5184000	5186000	You can play Twilight Zone
5186000	5188000	Anytime you want to
5188000	5190000	It's a license table for the pinball arcade
5190000	5192000	It's out on
5192000	5194000	Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3
5194000	5196000	PS Vita
5196000	5198000	And it's supposed to be out for the 3DS
5198000	5200000	Windows and Mac OS
5200000	5202000	So it kind of is a game
5202000	5204000	Like a console game
5204000	5206000	Well and for anyone who still
5206000	5208000	Uses VPN which is basically
5208000	5210000	How we played it for the longest time in my house
5210000	5212000	You can play it on Windows
5212000	5214000	I think there's also a version of PinMame
5214000	5216000	And PinMame
5216000	5218000	For Linux
5218000	5220000	I want to say
5220000	5222000	So there you go, that's the game
5222000	5224000	It's Twilight Zone
5224000	5226000	Are you lost in the zone?
5226000	5228000	Do you unlock this door with the key of imagination?
5228000	5230000	There it is, Twilight Zone
5230000	5232000	The pinball game but now accessible
5232000	5234000	Thanks to the wonders of emulation
5234000	5236000	On the 360 and Playstation Network
5236000	5238000	And iPhone and all that good stuff
5238000	5240000	There it is
5240000	5242000	Neat choice, something a little bit outside the box
5242000	5244000	I like it
5244000	5246000	So we are going to take a quick break
5246000	5248000	There's plenty more OLR to come, don't miss it
5248000	5250000	We have the FUGL Question of the Week

5266000	5268000	With the 461st episode of our show
5268000	5270000	Hey, happy Father's Day

5272000	5274000	Happen to be listening to the show
5274000	5276000	Including Loki, of course
5276000	5278000	Has his kid Josh
5278000	5280000	I see a lot of pictures
5280000	5282000	That the Mrs. and Mrs.
5282000	5284000	And the Mrs.
5284000	5286000	And the Mrs.
5286000	5288000	And the Mrs.
5288000	5290000	I see a lot of pictures that the Mrs.
5290000	5292000	Has been putting up on Facebook, very cute
5292000	5294000	He was playing with another kid today it looks like
5294000	5296000	Or the other day, I don't know
5296000	5298000	I saw the picture today
5298000	5300000	He has the cutest hair
5300000	5302000	And of course
5302000	5304000	As of course as I say
5304000	5306000	If you're a father figure or a father to pets
5306000	5308000	I think you count too
5308000	5310000	So I'm a wicked stepfather to two cats
5310000	5312000	One of which is being brave and coming out in the studio tonight
5312000	5314000	Usually they hide
5314000	5316000	But Maruko is out here
5316000	5318000	He wanted food
5318000	5320000	I said tonight I'm not moving their dish tonight
5320000	5322000	There you go
5322000	5324000	Clover Nikon in our chat room
5324000	5326000	At live.vognetwork.com
5326000	5328000	Says I'm a gamer uncle
5328000	5330000	You know what, close enough
5330000	5332000	I would still say that's a fatherly figure
5332000	5334000	In somebody's life
5334000	5336000	I have a picture of Maruko, I'm gonna post it
5336000	5338000	Awesome, over to orangelaunchradio.com
5338000	5340000	Kind of a squinty picture
5340000	5342000	While you're checking out the pictures of the kitties
5342000	5344000	At orangelaunchradio.com
5344000	5346000	Coming by vognetwork.com
5346000	5348000	Because if you are participating live with the show
5348000	5350000	You can check in and get your points
5350000	5352000	And maybe, just maybe, get some loot
5352000	5354000	Again that's vognetwork.com
5354000	5356000	If you're a podcast listener, sorry
5356000	5358000	Can't check into the show yet
5358000	5360000	That's all I'll say about that
5360000	5362000	Oh, by the way
5362000	5364000	I think I should post the picture of the kitty cats kissing
5364000	5366000	Outside of your
5366000	5368000	Oh, the strays out in the neighborhood
5368000	5370000	Yeah, that was cute
5370000	5372000	So, alright
5372000	5374000	We have some gaming news here
5374000	5376000	With rapid fire news
5376000	5378000	I do want to put out a last call for any tweets
5378000	5380000	You guys want us to talk about tonight
5380000	5382000	I'm gonna get to the foogle question of the week in a minute here too
5382000	5384000	And I think DarkSakura is in her way to opening up the mail bags
5384000	5386000	You don't have a lot of time left there
5386000	5388000	But let's do some rapid fire news, Loki
5388000	5390000	Sorry, I was looking up US Open
5390000	5392000	Results
5392000	5394000	Since when were you a tennis fan?
5394000	5396000	It's not golf
5396000	5398000	I'm stupid
5398000	5400000	Well, no, fair enough
5400000	5402000	This is also tennis
5402000	5404000	No, but
5404000	5406000	My grandpa watches it a lot
5406000	5408000	We went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue
5408000	5410000	And he was watching it
5410000	5412000	There was this amateur
5412000	5414000	17 year old guy
5414000	5416000	Who was just out shooting Tiger Woods
5416000	5418000	Which I thought was hilarious
5418000	5420000	And I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods
5420000	5422000	Tiger Woods ended up 3 over par
5422000	5424000	For the 3 day course
5424000	5426000	I don't remember the guys name
5426000	5428000	Anyways, sorry
5428000	5430000	So let's talk Journey
5430000	5432000	Journey
5432000	5434000	Don't stop
5434000	5436000	The journey was pretty awesome
5436000	5438000	And of course
5438000	5440000	The developer, that game company
5440000	5442000	Is now gonna go and self publish
5442000	5444000	Their next game
5444000	5446000	And they've got
5446000	5448000	5.5 million dollars
5448000	5450000	Of capital from Benchmark Capital
5450000	5452000	Mitch Lasky
5452000	5454000	And
5454000	5456000	They're gonna try to publish
5456000	5458000	Their game on multiple platforms
5458000	5460000	Possibly PC
5460000	5462000	And I guess
5462000	5464000	They haven't announced
5464000	5466000	Which platform the game's gonna be on
5466000	5468000	But I'm sure it'll be awesome
5468000	5470000	Also should note that
5470000	5472000	One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet
5472000	5474000	But I kinda hinted at it
5474000	5476000	On Twitter as well
5476000	5478000	That Sony will be releasing
5478000	5480000	On Playstation 3 a Journey compilation
5480000	5482000	Now
5482000	5484000	There's only one Journey game
5484000	5486000	To believe that it's Journey, Flower, and
5486000	5488000	Flow on disc
5488000	5490000	Sadly not the 80's
5490000	5492000	Game starring the super band
5492000	5494000	Although that would be awesome
5494000	5496000	But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey
5496000	5498000	On top of that, you can throw in the music
5498000	5500000	In there as well
5500000	5502000	Well it's funny to me though
5502000	5504000	Flower and all that is good
5504000	5506000	But the Journey
5506000	5508000	Why would you release this disc?
5508000	5510000	Because people can't go online to download it
5510000	5512000	Or they're not connected
5512000	5514000	Without being connected
5514000	5516000	You're not really playing Journey
5516000	5518000	That's the problem
5518000	5520000	You're not taking the true Journey
5520000	5522000	You're like backseat driver
5524000	5526000	I don't know
5526000	5528000	Yeah I know
5528000	5530000	It's a cash grab
5530000	5532000	Journey still is a fantastic game
5532000	5534000	But if you're playing it and not being online
5534000	5536000	Then I think you kinda miss the point
5536000	5538000	And that's where the other games
5538000	5540000	Like Flower and stuff become
5540000	5542000	Journey really needs to be on the Vita
5542000	5544000	Because that would be amazing
5544000	5546000	I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best
5546000	5548000	Racing games I've ever played
5548000	5550000	Think about it
5550000	5552000	PlayStation Home would be interesting
5552000	5554000	On the Vita as well
5554000	5556000	I don't know if I'd play it though
5556000	5558000	But I would probably play it more on the Vita
5558000	5560000	Than I would on the PS3
5560000	5562000	Anyways, so let's talk Minecraft
5562000	5564000	Because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet
5564000	5566000	And there was a patch that was released
5566000	5568000	Earlier, well Friday
5568000	5570000	The Secret Patch Friday
5570000	5573000	There's actually a bug fix patch right now
5573000	5575000	They didn't really do a whole lot
5575000	5577000	As far as any of the updates to the game
5577000	5579000	Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes
5579000	5581000	They added an auto save feature
5581000	5583000	So you can set it up to automatically save
5583000	5585000	Every 15 minutes or 2 hours
5585000	5587000	Or
5587000	5589000	I guess up to 2 hours
5589000	5591000	They've also added a coordinate system
5591000	5593000	To the map, which is kinda good
5593000	5595000	That's good
5595000	5597000	You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is
5597000	5599000	Exactly
5599000	5601000	Also, they took away the dupe glitch
5601000	5603000	So you can't dupe items anymore
5603000	5606000	Some issues with clay not generating in your maps
5606000	5608000	Which is a big no-no
5608000	5610000	So they finally fixed that
5610000	5612000	It can actually craft stuff with clay
5612000	5614000	Also some framerate drops
5614000	5616000	Stuff not spawning
5616000	5619000	I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix
5619000	5621000	So I sent them a message
5621000	5623000	Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire
5623000	5625000	And switch to the third person camera
5625000	5627000	That faces the front of you
5627000	5629000	You don't see the fire
5629000	5631000	But you'll see it from the back
5631000	5633000	If you do that
5633000	5635000	It's a one way fire
5635000	5637000	And then I guess
5637000	5641000	Here's the other thing I didn't realize too
5641000	5644000	They set a fix for awaiting approval
5644000	5646000	Showing all the time on some signs
5646000	5648000	I've seen that happen
5648000	5650000	I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved
5650000	5652000	They don't
5652000	5654000	That's weird
5654000	5656000	Um
5656000	5658000	I want to point out some comments from chat
5658000	5660000	Clover Nikon is in chat saying
5660000	5662000	All the children at the school I work at
5662000	5664000	Play the Minecraft demo
5664000	5666000	And I'm like, well what age?
5666000	5668000	8-10
5668000	5670000	Which seems kind of young, but it's cool
5670000	5672000	It's a great game for kids
5672000	5674000	It's pretty awesome
5674000	5676000	I do like this
5676000	5678000	The ability they turn
5678000	5680000	Or you can enable or disable the tool tips
5680000	5682000	I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time
5682000	5684000	And he's seen all this stuff already
5684000	5686000	And it'll be just like, hey
5686000	5688000	Did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah blah blah
5688000	5690000	I'm like, yes I know, I built a giant
5690000	5692000	Volcano out of Obsidian
5692000	5694000	I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian
5694000	5696000	It's just, I don't know, a little
5696000	5698000	Annoying sometimes
5698000	5700000	I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games
5700000	5702000	When I was 12, or maybe 11
5702000	5704000	We used to go to the lab at the junior high
5704000	5706000	No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school
5706000	5708000	We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers
5708000	5710000	We would play Scorched Earth
5710000	5712000	It's epic
5712000	5714000	Scorched Earth is still epic
5714000	5716000	And what was it, Tank 256? There was another one
5716000	5718000	Just like a Tank 256 or something like that
5718000	5720000	VGA Tank, I don't know, there was another one
5720000	5722000	That is a game right there that needs it
5722000	5724000	That would be the perfect Facebook game
5724000	5726000	If you think about it
5726000	5728000	Because it's not something that you take turns
5728000	5730000	It's a game that you take turns in
5730000	5732000	And so, why not have it where
5732000	5734000	You would play Scorched Earth on Facebook
5734000	5736000	And I am not talking about
5736000	5738000	Fucking Worms
5738000	5740000	Inspired by Scorched Earth
5740000	5742000	I am talking about Scorched Motherfucking Earth
5742000	5744000	Right? Exactly
5744000	5746000	So that would be pretty awesome
5746000	5748000	There will be an update
5748000	5750000	Though for Minecraft, the next update
5750000	5752000	That's supposed to add pistons
5752000	5754000	And that fun stuff
5754000	5756000	That's sometime in July
5756000	5758000	I can't wait
5758000	5760000	Do you realize, literally in one week
5760000	5762000	We're getting a Skyrim expansion
5762000	5764000	You may not be in Minecraft
5764000	5766000	For very long
5766000	5768000	Do you realize in one week
5768000	5770000	It's the 10th anniversary of our show
5770000	5772000	That's Bethesda's present to us
5772000	5774000	Naturally, that expansion is coming out on my birthday
5774000	5776000	So it's Bethesda's present to me
5776000	5778000	The guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim
5778000	5780000	You really can't
5780000	5782000	You can never play enough Skyrim
5782000	5784000	And then finally
5784000	5786000	Tank Wars
5786000	5788000	Thank you Jim Sally
5788000	5790000	I think that was the one I was talking about
5790000	5792000	Finally, Penny Arcade
5792000	5794000	Their brand new game is going to be coming out
5794000	5796000	Not on Xbox Live Arcade
5796000	5798000	But actually on PC, Mac
5798000	5800000	On Steam
5800000	5802000	And Xbox Live Indie Games
5802000	5804000	It's coming out on June 25th
5804000	5806000	It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th
5806000	5808000	But they wait until July seems dumb
5808000	5810000	Which sounds great to me
5810000	5812000	And the game itself looks awesome
5812000	5814000	I wasn't a huge fan of the
5814000	5816000	Adventure game style that the first one had
5816000	5818000	But this one looks
5818000	5820000	Straight up
5820000	5822000	2D Final Fantasy game
5822000	5824000	So I may have to pick this up
5824000	5826000	I just hope it doesn't
5826000	5828000	Require too much knowledge of the other games
5832000	5834000	Sorry, I was queuing something up here
5834000	5836000	I don't know, I zoned out when you
5836000	5838000	Mentioned Minecraft
5838000	5840000	Kirby
5840000	5842000	Thank you for ruining it Dark Soccer
5842000	5844000	I appreciate that
5844000	5846000	I was going to play the music here
5846000	5848000	And talk about
5848000	5852000	That's right, there's a Kirby 20th Anniversary Collection coming out
5852000	5854000	You may have already known that
5854000	5856000	But Kirby
5856000	5858000	20th Anniversary is going to include
5858000	5860000	Now this is the Wii game
5860000	5862000	That's kind of like the Mario game
5862000	5864000	It was announced back in April
5864000	5866000	But now we know what's actually going to be in it
5866000	5868000	Kirby's Dream Land
5868000	5870000	Kirby's Dream Land 2
5870000	5872000	Kirby's Adventure
5872000	5874000	Kirby Super Star
5874000	5876000	Kirby's Dream Land 3
5876000	5878000	There's also going to be a timeline
5878000	5880000	Whatever that is
5880000	5882000	I guess a poster or something
5882000	5884000	And a soundtrack
5884000	5886000	It launches in Japan on July 19th
5886000	5888000	No North American information
5888000	5890000	As of yet, but I'm sure it will be
5890000	5892000	Just in time for the holidays
5892000	5894000	I think they've said September
5894000	5896000	I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game
5896000	5898000	On SNES
5898000	5900000	Which was the best one
5900000	5902000	I'm giving this props because
5902000	5904000	It's not a port of a Virtual Console game
5904000	5906000	Because that's all the 20th Anniversary edition was
5906000	5908000	Was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars
5908000	5910000	Ported onto the Wii
5910000	5912000	Literally game rips of it
5912000	5914000	The disc rips were like 30 megs
5914000	5916000	It was literally the ROM
5916000	5918000	From Super Nintendo
5918000	5920000	This is at least more than one ROM
5920000	5922000	And they actually have to mink something
5922000	5924000	Well, Majesco
5924000	5926000	The makers of Zumba Fitness
5926000	5928000	Which sells really well
5928000	5930000	And NBA Baller Beats
5930000	5932000	Oh, Snapples
5932000	5934000	All right, NBA Baller Beats
5934000	5936000	Well, they've got another baller franchise
5936000	5938000	That they've just acquired
5938000	5940000	American Idol is a license they just got
5940000	5942000	I want to say, when American Idol first came out
5942000	5944000	Codemasters had it, then Konami had it
5944000	5946000	I remember the American Idol karaoke revolution games
5946000	5948000	Well now, I guess Konami lost it
5948000	5950000	Or gave it up
5950000	5952000	Because Majesco now has the license
5952000	5954000	For American Idol
5954000	5956000	No idea what they're going to do with that
5956000	5958000	I imagine a type of karaoke game
5958000	5960000	Would make some sense
5960000	5962000	Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you
5962000	5964000	A bunch of compliments
5964000	5966000	You know what's kind of funny?
5966000	5968000	Konami is actually getting out of the music game
5968000	5970000	Genre completely
5970000	5972000	Aside from Joy Sound
5972000	5974000	That they have coming out
5974000	5976000	Which is a game that's pretty fucking old
5976000	5978000	You know, I said for the 10th anniversary
5978000	5980000	We should have a funeral for Bomani
5980000	5982000	And never talk about it again
5982000	5984000	But I don't know
5984000	5986000	I don't want to do that
5986000	5988000	But it's true
5988000	5990000	In the first year, there was nothing on the floor
5990000	5992000	At E3 about Bomani
5992000	5994000	The very least they should have done
5994000	5996000	Was put one of those DDRX3
5996000	5998000	Versus second mix
5998000	6000000	Machines in the Konami booth
6000000	6002000	It would have been at least cool
6002000	6004000	No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game
6004000	6006000	Which looks pretty awesome
6006000	6008000	Anyhow, lastly here for me
6008000	6010000	Mistwalker wants to make
6010000	6012000	RPGs for the Wii U
6012000	6014000	But nothing planned yet
6014000	6016000	Mistwalker, of course, made
6016000	6018000	The Last Story
6018000	6020000	Which is finally coming out here in America
6020000	6022000	Some of the games before that they did
6022000	6024000	Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey
6024000	6026000	A criminally underrated 360 game
6026000	6028000	I need to play that game
6028000	6030000	You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey
6030000	6032000	Is that the 360 flopsied in Japan
6032000	6034000	I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3
6034000	6036000	We would have had a sequel
6036000	6038000	I hate to say it, but it's so true
6038000	6040000	It's just really unfortunate
6040000	6042000	Because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG
6042000	6044000	I love that game
6044000	6046000	A quote from designer
6046000	6048000	Takuya Matsumoto
6048000	6050000	The development team and Sakaguchi-san
6050000	6052000	Are looking forward to making more
6052000	6054000	Especially for the Wii U because it has another screen
6054000	6056000	Right in front of you that will add another level
6056000	6058000	Of strategic elements into the action RPG
6058000	6060000	So we really are looking forward to it
6060000	6062000	But we really haven't planned anything
6062000	6064000	It seems like it's something you could
6064000	6066000	Easily do, your little menus
6066000	6068000	You could even draw attack patterns
6068000	6070000	I could see role playing action games
6070000	6072000	Working very well with the Wii U
6072000	6074000	As long as it's in capable hands
6074000	6076000	I think Mist Walker
6076000	6078000	Has done a lot of underrated stuff
6078000	6080000	Could be good if they decide to do it
6080000	6082000	Since apparently they are
6082000	6084000	Kind of married to Nintendo now
6084000	6086000	I didn't realize this, but
6086000	6088000	They probably sold more of the last story
6088000	6090000	Than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly
6092000	6094000	Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?
6094000	6096000	Well, I have a few things
6096000	6098000	We have, first of all
6098000	6100000	The amount of money the
6100000	6102000	Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at
6102000	6104000	$5.1 million
6104000	6106000	So all of that
6106000	6108000	The final amount is
6108000	6114000	$5,105,169.91
6114000	6116000	In two weeks
6116000	6118000	They basically blew
6118000	6120000	Their previous records from 2 and 3
6120000	6122000	Just out of the water
6124000	6126000	So basically
6126000	6128000	We had
6128000	6132000	598,794 people buy
6132000	6134000	Make purchases
6134000	6136000	With the average price being
6136000	6138000	$8.53
6138000	6140000	And it said that Linux users paid
6140000	6142000	More than anyone else at $12.51
6142000	6144000	Per transaction
6144000	6146000	And Windows users were paying the least
6146000	6148000	At $7.97
6148000	6150000	They always pay the least
6150000	6152000	Yeah
6152000	6154000	But basically most of the purchases
6154000	6156000	Were made on PC
6156000	6158000	And then The Last of Us
6158000	6160000	Is going to
6160000	6162000	Not be out until 2013
6162000	6164000	Well, of course
6164000	6166000	That's when all the games are coming out now
6166000	6168000	Well, it was
6168000	6170000	Technically it's late 2012
6170000	6172000	Early 2013
6172000	6174000	But that's
6174000	6176000	What the Naughty Dog
6176000	6178000	Director
6178000	6180000	Directors, I should say
6180000	6182000	Said on Jimmy Fallon
6182000	6184000	And then Dance Central 2
6184000	6186000	It has a June DLC
6186000	6188000	It is
6188000	6190000	Um
6190000	6192000	I don't know who this person is
6192000	6194000	Eaz
6194000	6196000	Replay
6196000	6198000	And Nelly's Hot in Here
6198000	6200000	And Kat De Luna's Wine Up
6200000	6202000	Yeah, these are all songs
6202000	6204000	Well, I've heard the Hot in Here song, but I think it's awful
6204000	6206000	The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are
6206000	6208000	So, uh
6208000	6210000	I don't care
6210000	6212000	Alrighty then
6212000	6214000	What do we have for the week?
6220000	6222000	Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook
6222000	6224000	And Google Plus
6224000	6226000	Put it together and you get FOOGLE
6226000	6228000	Uh, this week's question
6228000	6230000	Has to do with the story we talked about earlier
6230000	6232000	One of the stories we were talking about tonight was
6232000	6234000	THQ being suspected of misleading investors
6234000	6236000	On uDraw, which got us thinking
6236000	6238000	Although all of us may not be financial investors
6238000	6240000	Per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money
6240000	6242000	Into our gaming habit
6242000	6244000	When was a time that you felt
6244000	6246000	Misled by a gaming company
6246000	6248000	And, you know, we kept it a little bit vague on purpose
6248000	6250000	We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with
6250000	6252000	There's a lot of interesting responses tonight
6252000	6254000	Let's start with Facebook tonight
6254000	6256000	Um, I'm gonna start with Rob D
6256000	6258000	It's hard not to feel
6258000	6260000	Constantly misled by Capcom
6260000	6262000	Their works, and especially their long-running
6262000	6264000	Franchises, show that their developers
6264000	6266000	Care about their games and have passion
6266000	6268000	However, we're promised so much
6268000	6270000	And all we ever get is nickeled and dimed
6270000	6272000	Zombie Princess says
6272000	6274000	The ending of Mass Effect 3
6274000	6276000	The whole series makes you think your choices
6276000	6278000	Will make a big difference
6278000	6280000	In actuality, it doesn't matter at all
6280000	6282000	Locopoco says
6282000	6284000	By Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3
6284000	6286000	Not Ultimate
6286000	6288000	Was gonna have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3
6288000	6290000	Then when I bought it
6290000	6292000	All I got was a barebones fighter
6292000	6294000	Sold it back to GameStop two hours later
6294000	6296000	That's two strikes against Capcom
6296000	6298000	Um, let's go to
6298000	6300000	Kareem J who says
6300000	6302000	Have to agree with the above poster and Capcom
6302000	6304000	They hype up their franchises
6304000	6306000	Then release a boatload of DLC
6306000	6308000	Which should have been on the disc
6308000	6310000	Then to add a further kick in the balls
6310000	6312000	They release a Game of the Year edition
6312000	6314000	I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one
6314000	6316000	But if you're really into one of their franchises
6316000	6318000	You want the game on day one
6318000	6320000	You can't help but feel like a sucker
6320000	6322000	Ouch
6322000	6324000	That's three punches for Capcom
6324000	6326000	Joe G says
6326000	6328000	GoldenEye Reloaded
6328000	6330000	Frankly, I thought Activision was gonna make the original GoldenEye 64
6330000	6332000	Pretty with some story
6332000	6334000	A few new missions and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan
6334000	6336000	This isn't the case
6336000	6338000	They gutted the game, changed around the story
6338000	6340000	To make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay
6340000	6342000	And they fucking took out the jumping mechanics
6342000	6344000	You can vault over objects
6344000	6346000	But it's clunky to say the least
6346000	6348000	Tyler M says
6348000	6350000	There's been many times
6350000	6352000	But nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore
6352000	6354000	I do remember being
6354000	6356000	Kind of let down by Spore
6356000	6358000	Spore wasn't
6358000	6360000	I think even Will Wright
6360000	6362000	Kind of said it best
6362000	6364000	He just tried to accomplish too damn much
6364000	6366000	I don't think he said it that way, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there
6366000	6368000	Let's see
6368000	6370000	Let me try to wrap some of this up here
6370000	6372000	Clover N says
6372000	6374000	Driver was just awfully misleading
6374000	6376000	Thank heavens EB Games has a seven day return policy
6376000	6378000	No questions asked
6378000	6380000	That's Driver 3
6380000	6382000	It's Driver with a three in it
6382000	6384000	It is very entertaining though on its own merits
6384000	6386000	It's Lulzy for about those first seven days
6386000	6388000	And then it's over
6388000	6390000	I remember when you bought that
6390000	6392000	It's still Lulzy way after that
6392000	6394000	It's one of those you have to keep going back to after a while
6394000	6396000	I need to go back to that
6396000	6398000	Shattered Hawk said
6398000	6400000	Mass Effect 3
6400000	6402000	All the hours being drawn in by the story and characters
6402000	6404000	Only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end
6404000	6406000	Fuck you BioWare
6406000	6408000	That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom
6408000	6410000	For Mass Effect 3
6410000	6412000	Let's go over to the Google Plus
6412000	6414000	Uh oh
6414000	6416000	Only one response on Google Plus
6416000	6418000	You know what that means about Google Plus
6418000	6420000	No one's on it
6420000	6422000	That's what it's starting to look like
6422000	6424000	We have another little kick for Google Plus
6424000	6426000	Are you saying that Google Plus isn't the amazing thing
6426000	6428000	That they had us
6428000	6430000	Let's believe that it was
6430000	6432000	I have more I want to say about this
6432000	6434000	But I'm going to wait because there's another Google Plus story
6434000	6436000	Coming up in a minute
6436000	6438000	I want to say this about ActDeft
6438000	6440000	Who has Google Plus all to himself
6440000	6442000	And says I think there hasn't been a game yet
6442000	6444000	That has led to think or believe I've been misled
6444000	6446000	Into buying by a game company
6446000	6448000	I usually follow the word of other gamers
6448000	6450000	And consumers before plunging into
6450000	6452000	Buy a game
6452000	6454000	Though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans
6454000	6456000	Believing that EA and BioWare have totally
6456000	6458000	Scammed them even if they didn't
6458000	6460000	In parentheses
6460000	6462000	So there you have it
6462000	6464000	That's not really a third strike against BioWare
6464000	6466000	Pointing and laughing at the other people maybe
6466000	6468000	Looks like Capcom
6468000	6470000	Took the cake on that one
6470000	6472000	I can't say I blame the listeners there
6472000	6474000	There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom
6474000	6476000	Over the past couple of years
6476000	6478000	Maybe they'll redeem themselves if
6478000	6480000	Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3
6480000	6482000	End up being really really good
6482000	6484000	I would still like to have that
6484000	6486000	Mega Man universe someday
6486000	6488000	Or the Mega Man Legends
6488000	6490000	They're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing
6490000	6492000	On top of that
6492000	6494000	I mean yes that was terrible
6494000	6496000	However I didn't buy the game so that
6496000	6498000	Wouldn't have been my choice
6498000	6500000	My choice would have to be Saints for the Third
6500000	6502000	And not as
6502000	6504000	I mean the game itself is a little misleading
6504000	6506000	Kind of eh
6506000	6508000	The game itself is pretty fucking funny
6508000	6510000	I mean that's just a funny
6510000	6512000	Ass game
6512000	6514000	It is a fun game
6514000	6516000	The DLC though on the other hand
6516000	6518000	Is fucking terrible
6518000	6520000	It's just the expansion packs
6520000	6522000	That they had I mean don't get me wrong
6522000	6524000	I understand the costumes that's a waste of money
6524000	6526000	But the expansion packs
6526000	6528000	I was smart enough not to buy the season pass
6528000	6530000	Because I know well enough
6530000	6532000	That you know what I'd rather
6532000	6534000	Pay extra money
6534000	6536000	And have each one of those expansion packs
6536000	6538000	Be for you know
6538000	6540000	Definitely good
6540000	6542000	Than to just pay twenty bucks
6542000	6544000	And have them all be terrible
6544000	6546000	And thankfully I paid seven dollars
6546000	6548000	Bought the first expansion and it was fucking terrible
6548000	6550000	Rather reason the second expansion
6550000	6552000	Even more terrible than the first expansion
6552000	6554000	Third one
6554000	6556000	Hey we get Johnny Gapat
6556000	6558000	Except he's a giant mutant
6558000	6560000	And it's fucking terrible
6560000	6562000	So
6562000	6564000	Yeah I'm not
6564000	6566000	I feel a little ripped off by them
6566000	6568000	And also all the on disc
6568000	6570000	DLC they have more on disc
6570000	6572000	DLC than fucking Capcom does
6572000	6574000	It's ridiculous they're still releasing
6574000	6576000	Stuff today that's on disc
6576000	6578000	And then they have a whole
6578000	6580000	Expansion that really could have been
6580000	6582000	An expansion of the game but now they're
6582000	6584000	Gonna make it's own retail releases thirty bucks
6584000	6586000	I'm waiting on that one
6586000	6588000	I do want to play it because I like
6588000	6590000	The Matrix and I like Saints Row the Third
6590000	6592000	But I'm
6592000	6594000	Very cautious going into it
6594000	6596000	Lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight
6596000	6598000	Blender agrees with Loki
6598000	6600000	Yes Loki Saints Row the Third
6600000	6602000	DLC pissed me off
6602000	6604000	Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says
6604000	6606000	Bethesda got away with making the
6606000	6608000	True ending a DLC with Fallout 3
6608000	6610000	I don't see a problem with Bioware
6610000	6612000	Doing it as well
6612000	6614000	He makes a good point there about sometimes our
6614000	6616000	Attention spans we let
6616000	6618000	One company get away with something but then
6618000	6620000	Don't let the other
6620000	6622000	Lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com
6622000	6624000	Let's go back to some news
6624000	6626000	I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later
6626000	6628000	Maybe some emails
6628000	6630000	Let's go to Loki with news
6630000	6632000	Let's talk a little bit about
6632000	6634000	Retro and what their plans are
6634000	6636000	Apparently
6636000	6638000	Retro Games
6638000	6640000	It's been rumored for a while
6640000	6642000	Well they've come out and said
6642000	6644000	Hey we'd love to do a Zelda game
6644000	6646000	And people started asking them
6646000	6648000	Hey what's Retro working on?
6648000	6650000	Because you know
6650000	6652000	You're not really saying anything about them
6652000	6654000	And
6654000	6656000	Of course Miyamoto
6656000	6658000	Basically saying
6658000	6660000	In terms of them working on a Zelda game
6660000	6662000	It's not out of the question
6662000	6664000	But
6664000	6666000	You know
6666000	6668000	Right now they're
6668000	6670000	Incredibly busy with other things
6670000	6672000	Then of course they said traditionally I think the Zelda team
6672000	6674000	Has always had close contact with anyone
6674000	6676000	Who's working on a Zelda game
6676000	6678000	Traditionally
6678000	6680000	Except for maybe in the CDI days
6680000	6682000	Where they did not have close contact
6682000	6684000	With people that were working on that game
6684000	6686000	At least they probably
6686000	6688000	Distanced themselves
6688000	6690000	Ever since then
6690000	6692000	That's why Nintendo has had a close relationship
6692000	6694000	Yeah
6694000	6696000	Of course they're saying you know
6696000	6698000	Retro is too busy
6698000	6700000	For that sort of thing right now
6700000	6702000	You know saying that they're
6702000	6704000	Working on something else
6704000	6706000	And you know very busy right now
6706000	6708000	But I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is
6708000	6710000	That they're working on
6710000	6712000	Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game
6712000	6714000	Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright
6714000	6716000	But
6716000	6718000	I'm kind of curious to see if they are
6718000	6720000	Making a Zelda game
6720000	6722000	Could they be doing the next gen Zelda game
6722000	6724000	Because if you think about you know the next gen type
6724000	6726000	Zelda game for the Wii U
6726000	6728000	Because Nintendo hasn't really worked in
6728000	6730000	Next gen stuff I don't know if Retro's really
6730000	6732000	Gotten their feet with it
6732000	6734000	I don't know
6734000	6736000	We'll see
6736000	6738000	Alright well I mentioned a minute ago we could come back
6738000	6740000	And talk about Google Plus
6740000	6742000	This is not a good thing for the service
6742000	6744000	PopCap and
6744000	6746000	Wuga Games
6746000	6748000	They're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform
6748000	6750000	Wuga already shut down
6750000	6752000	Monster World
6752000	6754000	Around May 1st
6754000	6756000	EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz
6756000	6758000	From the service this week
6758000	6760000	I think it's already happened
6760000	6762000	They're going to quote redeploy our resources
6762000	6764000	To other adaptations of Bejeweled
6764000	6766000	I think that's their nice way of saying
6766000	6768000	Fucking no one's playing it on Google Plus
6768000	6770000	So we'd rather do the phones and
6770000	6772000	You know the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at
6772000	6774000	Wuga said
6774000	6776000	They decided to
6776000	6778000	Decided to remove certain games from Google Plus
6778000	6780000	Because we have had a much
6780000	6782000	Larger following on Facebook
6782000	6784000	And they are active users
6784000	6786000	So goodbye Bubble Island and Diamond Dash
6786000	6788000	Those are leaving on July 1st
6788000	6790000	PopCap does say Google is
6790000	6792000	A valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA
6792000	6794000	And will continue to develop for Google
6794000	6796000	Platforms, that probably means Android
6796000	6798000	I think also maybe Chrome
6798000	6800000	Because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration
6800000	6802000	With games and stuff like that
6802000	6804000	Chrome has a bunch of the
6804000	6806000	Sort of add-ons with it too with games
6806000	6808000	Which is strange that
6808000	6810000	You know it doesn't
6810000	6812000	That that won't therefore
6812000	6814000	Integrate into Google Plus automatically
6814000	6816000	But maybe it does
6816000	6818000	I don't know
6818000	6820000	I remember seeing ads for Google Plus
6820000	6822000	Like at the movies and stuff
6822000	6824000	They really tried to push this and
6824000	6826000	People just aren't taking the bait
6826000	6828000	And I'm not sure I totally
6828000	6830000	Understand why I mean is it the
6830000	6832000	Interface is because maybe it's
6832000	6834000	Maybe people don't like the oversimplification
6834000	6836000	Next to Facebook I do see
6836000	6838000	Some dedicated Google Plus people
6838000	6840000	There are definitely some people I see that use
6840000	6842000	Google Plus more than they use Facebook
6842000	6844000	And I have to admit I get so
6844000	6846000	Sick of Facebook shit
6846000	6848000	There is so much shit on Facebook
6848000	6850000	I don't need in my life I really don't
6850000	6852000	You know there's a lot of toxicness there
6852000	6854000	There's a lot of just
6854000	6856000	There's a lot of stuff
6856000	6858000	On there and I'm not saying Google Plus is
6858000	6860000	Any better in that regard because I think
6860000	6862000	If everybody was on Google Plus instead of
6862000	6864000	Facebook it would just be the same thing in
6864000	6866000	Reverse but
6866000	6868000	I don't know
6868000	6870000	I'm just surprised more
6870000	6872000	People didn't run away
6872000	6874000	To Google Plus in a way
6874000	6876000	Well for a while people did
6876000	6878000	And I was like oh everyone else is still on
6878000	6880000	Facebook because people needed attention
6882000	6884000	It's true it is absolutely
6884000	6886000	True people needed attention
6886000	6888000	They went back to Facebook I will totally
6888000	6890000	Admit in some ways that's why I've still
6890000	6892000	Posted on Facebook it is it's
6892000	6894000	Been a great promotional tool for the show
6894000	6896000	Now I will say this
6896000	6898000	I think there's a huge
6898000	6900000	And I hope to hell
6900000	6902000	This doesn't go away because I think there's
6902000	6904000	A huge potential to do something great
6904000	6906000	With Google Hangout
6906000	6908000	And some of the interviews and some of that and I think
6908000	6910000	There's some cool untapped stuff there
6910000	6912000	So I hope they don't just close Google Plus
6912000	6914000	All together and you know what I don't
6914000	6916000	Care if we only have like five fans on
6916000	6918000	Google Plus that's five fans
6918000	6920000	That we have
6920000	6922000	So you know I don't want to like stop supporting
6922000	6924000	Google Plus or whatever but you know it is
6924000	6926000	The fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook
6926000	6928000	But MySpace
6928000	6930000	Fuck them
6930000	6932000	Fuck MySpace we don't care about that
6932000	6934000	Fuck MySpace
6934000	6936000	I still get messages on MySpace I'm like
6936000	6938000	I don't even know where my page is anymore
6938000	6940000	Let alone
6940000	6942000	All these artists hey listen to my shit
6942000	6944000	I'm like no
6944000	6946000	Zethur in our chatroom says r.i.p. Google Plus
6946000	6948000	Well yeah
6948000	6950000	I mean the game's leaving, Bejeweled leaving
6950000	6952000	That's when your PopCap
6952000	6954000	Games are leaving
6954000	6956000	It's really not a good sign
6956000	6958000	Yikes
6958000	6960000	Alright anyhow
6960000	6962000	Let's move on with some more news
6962000	6964000	DarkSaga
6964000	6966000	Who pays attention to news?
6966000	6968000	How about some stuff about Starcraft
6968000	6970000	That'll make people perk up
6970000	6972000	Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm
6972000	6974000	Is 99% done
6974000	6976000	The lead designer Dustin
6976000	6978000	Browder basically said
6978000	6980000	And this is a quote
6980000	6982000	99% done but that last 1% is a bitch
6982000	6984000	So
6984000	6986000	They're saying basically he says
6986000	6988000	He could do a playthrough
6988000	6990000	I'm sorry then it's not really 99% done
6990000	6992000	That was something he said to get quoted
6992000	6994000	May I finish?
6994000	6996000	He said they can do a playthrough
6996000	6998000	And are like wow this is great
6998000	7000000	Or you can do a playthrough
7000000	7002000	And then find more items to fix
7002000	7004000	So basically it's like they're in that last
7004000	7006000	Beta stage
7006000	7008000	Or I should say alpha stage
7008000	7010000	Where they're finding those little last minute things
7010000	7012000	It sounds like it's all about your tweaking
7012000	7014000	Which really is like the last little bit
7014000	7016000	So you're like 90% done
7016000	7018000	Yeah
7018000	7020000	But um
7020000	7022000	So that's the only thing holding it back
7022000	7024000	At least they're waiting until it's done
7024000	7026000	What exactly do they have to do?
7026000	7028000	They have the game done
7028000	7030000	They're adding an expansion pack
7030000	7032000	Starcraft 2
7032000	7034000	I don't know if I want my unit right here
7034000	7036000	Do you play Starcraft 2?
7036000	7038000	They are doing some more units and campaign analysis
7038000	7040000	Here's the thing
7040000	7042000	Starcraft 2 has to be balanced right
7042000	7044000	There is so much
7044000	7046000	Esports and competitive gaming
7046000	7048000	And things that go into something like Starcraft 2
7048000	7050000	It has to be right
7050000	7052000	So I understand there's gonna be some
7052000	7054000	Extensive testing that goes on with this
7054000	7056000	Because they cannot afford to have a fucked up
7056000	7058000	Balance in Starcraft 2
7058000	7060000	Literally
7060000	7062000	Hundreds of thousands of dollars go up for contests
7062000	7064000	Over Starcraft 2
7064000	7066000	This game is huge in the competitive industry
7066000	7068000	Especially though with all the shit over Diablo 3
7068000	7070000	You better bet your ass they're gonna
7070000	7072000	Really put effort into this
7072000	7074000	I mean really
7074000	7076000	If you look at the competitive gaming universe
7076000	7078000	It's Starcraft 2, League of Legends
7078000	7080000	That's where it's at right now
7080000	7082000	You know it's these type of games
7082000	7084000	It's not so much the shooters these days
7084000	7086000	I mean yeah there's some of that still don't get me wrong
7086000	7088000	But it's a huge part
7088000	7090000	It's Starcraft, Warcraft Arena
7090000	7092000	To some extent, League of Legends is huge
7092000	7094000	It keeps getting bigger too
7094000	7096000	Anyhow
7096000	7098000	Few more stories for you guys
7098000	7100000	In the mailbag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com
7100000	7102000	And Skype line in a little bit
7102000	7104000	But for first, Loki
7104000	7106000	Well something I was talking a little bit about earlier
7106000	7108000	Things that Nintendo says that they're doing
7108000	7110000	And then
7110000	7112000	Doesn't
7112000	7114000	We just talked about Starcraft 2
7114000	7116000	And you know similar type of gameplay style
7116000	7118000	RTS, Pikmin 3
7118000	7120000	They're not doing online multiplayer
7120000	7122000	A brand new system that's coming out
7122000	7124000	HD
7124000	7126000	And they're not fucking doing online multiplayer
7126000	7128000	Because they said
7128000	7130000	Well we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around
7130000	7132000	So it would be hard for us to track all those
7132000	7134000	Accurately on other systems
7134000	7136000	Uh
7136000	7138000	No
7138000	7140000	That doesn't make any sense to me
7140000	7142000	I'm sorry
7142000	7144000	Because if you think about it
7144000	7146000	There are multiplayer RTS games
7146000	7148000	Out there
7148000	7150000	There are multiplayer console RTS games out there
7150000	7152000	I just fucking named some in the competitive space
7152000	7154000	Hello, Starcraft, League of Legends
7154000	7156000	And you can't fucking
7156000	7158000	I mean
7158000	7160000	Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around
7160000	7162000	At one time, but
7162000	7164000	Not like billions of
7164000	7166000	Pikmin running around at the same time
7166000	7168000	Ever heard of the Zerg?
7168000	7170000	It's a big
7170000	7172000	Yeah, so it just seems like a
7172000	7174000	Piss poor excuse for that
7174000	7176000	I mean, you have a launch title
7176000	7178000	You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system
7178000	7180000	Your system finally gets online
7180000	7182000	It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U
7182000	7184000	Nintendo fucking gets online
7184000	7186000	But no, they don't fucking get online
7186000	7188000	They don't at all
7188000	7190000	It's no online multiplayer
7190000	7192000	You need to be online
7192000	7194000	And send pictures of your penis to your friends
7194000	7196000	Yay
7196000	7198000	But there's co-op local multiplayer
7198000	7200000	Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again
7200000	7202000	It's just all the online
7202000	7204000	Functionality that they've shown right now
7204000	7206000	It's the same functionality we have
7206000	7208000	The 3DS and the Wii
7208000	7210000	Send messages back and forth
7210000	7212000	And see what your friends are playing
7216000	7218000	That's not very functional
7218000	7220000	Can fucking do on the 3DS with SwapNote
7220000	7222000	Or on the Wii
7222000	7224000	Wii has online gameplay
7224000	7226000	We had online gameplay with Mario Kart
7226000	7228000	You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart
7228000	7230000	Why can't you do online gameplay for
7230000	7232000	Pikmin
7232000	7234000	Oh, I don't know
7234000	7236000	We've never coded online games before
7236000	7238000	What's the deal?
7238000	7240000	Oh, but we have local multiplayer
7240000	7242000	Could it have anything to do with the fact
7242000	7244000	That the bandwidth that they have to send
7244000	7246000	Data to tablet or something
7246000	7248000	Is fucking things up
7248000	7250000	Because they have to keep things synced between the tablet
7250000	7252000	And the system
7252000	7254000	And then also
7254000	7256000	Other people's systems
7256000	7258000	I don't know really how it works
7258000	7260000	Because I'm not a developer
7260000	7262000	But it just seems like a piss-poor excuse
7262000	7264000	Just saying
7264000	7266000	And they even said
7266000	7268000	One of the other things was that the Wii U
7268000	7270000	The whole idea was almost scrapped
7270000	7272000	Because of the price concerns
7272000	7274000	They were saying sometimes
7274000	7276000	They almost gave up on the idea of additional screen
7276000	7278000	This was due over the concern
7278000	7280000	Of expected high cost
7280000	7282000	It may not have been feasible
7282000	7284000	To create this and sell it
7284000	7286000	At a reasonable price point for the consumers
7286000	7288000	Um
7288000	7290000	And of course they haven't said
7290000	7292000	What the reasonable price point is yet
7292000	7294000	Maybe now it's more reasonable
7294000	7296000	To pay $400 for a system
7296000	7298000	Because there's tablets out there that cost that much
7298000	7300000	But
7300000	7302000	I guess it's just
7302000	7304000	We're gonna have to wait and see
7304000	7306000	You know, how much the system's gonna cost
7306000	7308000	And if it's too much
7308000	7310000	It's gonna flop
7310000	7312000	If it's the right price point, it'll do okay
7312000	7314000	But
7314000	7316000	I don't know
7318000	7320000	Alright, moving on to a story
7320000	7322000	About a game a lot of people are looking forward to
7322000	7324000	We talked a lot about the Wii U tonight
7324000	7326000	And not enough about this game
7326000	7328000	Because this game looks so awesome, I can't wait to play it
7328000	7330000	It's Ni no Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch
7330000	7332000	What's amazing is that Namco Bandai
7332000	7334000	Is actually keeping that name in America
7334000	7336000	It's going to be called Ni no Kuni here
7336000	7338000	Now they did change the subtitle
7338000	7340000	Wrath of the White Witch has obviously
7340000	7342000	Been translated into English
7342000	7344000	But yeah, the game is still planned
7344000	7346000	It is, if you're not sure what this game is
7346000	7348000	It's the whole level 5
7348000	7350000	And Studio Ghibli
7350000	7352000	Collaboration, which has been out in Japan already
7352000	7354000	For a little bit
7354000	7356000	I don't remember when it's finally coming out here
7356000	7358000	I think it's towards the end of the year?
7358000	7360000	2013, yet again
7360000	7362000	The reasons why they kept the name the same
7362000	7364000	I love this, this is
7364000	7366000	Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee
7366000	7368000	Quote, we really wanted to make sure
7368000	7370000	That all the fans who had come to know the game
7370000	7372000	As Ni no Kuni would still be able
7372000	7374000	To recognize it and find it
7374000	7376000	Having a localized name of a game, you know
7376000	7378000	Like Fight Quest 6, even though
7378000	7380000	It could be more westernized, that doesn't quite mean
7380000	7382000	That it has the same feel as the original game
7382000	7384000	That's why the name of the game
7384000	7386000	Stayed with Ni no Kuni
7386000	7388000	There's a sound to it that feels right
7388000	7390000	And the subtitle was of course localized
7390000	7392000	To Wrath of the White Witch
7392000	7394000	Versus the original Japanese title
7394000	7396000	You know what that means though, right?
7396000	7398000	Second Country
7398000	7400000	Ni no Kuni, Second Country
7400000	7402000	But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country
7402000	7404000	You know?
7404000	7406000	I'm glad they did keep that name
7406000	7408000	You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell
7408000	7410000	With a title that isn't English
7410000	7412000	Then why not?
7412000	7414000	Yeah
7414000	7416000	I think that Dew Prism had a different name
7416000	7418000	Because I had been freaking looking forward
7418000	7420000	To hoping that Dew Prism would be out
7420000	7422000	And then I hear about Threads of Fate
7422000	7424000	And I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?
7424000	7426000	Speaking of Fight Quest 6
7426000	7428000	I really do think that they should bring over
7428000	7430000	Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3
7430000	7432000	Which is what I would call
7432000	7434000	Toeball 3
7434000	7436000	Because they really need a Toeball 3
7436000	7438000	Because Toeball 2 is awesome
7438000	7440000	Just saying
7440000	7442000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag
7442000	7444000	Every week you guys email us
7444000	7446000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7446000	7448000	And DarkSakura
7448000	7450000	Dives in the mailbag head first
7450000	7452000	Surrounds herself
7452000	7454000	In the hundreds of thousands of emails
7454000	7456000	We get every week
7456000	7458000	And pulls out a lucky few to read here on air
7458000	7460000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7460000	7462000	That's exactly what happens
7462000	7464000	Well, we've got a few
7464000	7466000	And there's one actually that we got
7466000	7468000	From Redertainment
7468000	7470000	And just to say right now
7470000	7472000	I've read it and I'm reading your thing
7472000	7474000	And I'll give you feedback
7474000	7476000	Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback
7476000	7478000	Oh, it was an off-air question
7478000	7480000	Okay, sure, I'll peek later
7480000	7482000	So
7482000	7484000	Anyway, this one
7484000	7486000	Dear O.L.R.
7486000	7488000	I first have to say that I love this show
7488000	7490000	Even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to
7490000	7492000	Anyway
7492000	7494000	Cancel your plans
7494000	7496000	Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about
7496000	7498000	O.L.R. memory I have
7498000	7500000	Aside from getting pretty close to
7500000	7502000	Dark Tetsuya
7502000	7504000	Is that the day my father passed away
7504000	7506000	June 25th, 2003 from cancer
7506000	7508000	You guys were there for me
7508000	7510000	I remember we were holding a show that day
7510000	7512000	And I had delivered the news that he passed on
7512000	7514000	And to help me get through it
7514000	7516000	You guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirit
7516000	7518000	Ever since then
7518000	7520000	You guys have been a huge part of my life
7520000	7522000	Thanks O.L.R. for the memories and keep up the good work
7522000	7524000	Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl
7524000	7526000	Wow, that's heavy
7526000	7528000	Like, you know
7528000	7530000	I think we sometimes forget
7530000	7532000	That like people have their lives
7532000	7534000	And their drama and the things that they're going through
7534000	7536000	And yet O.L.R. is kind of something
7536000	7538000	That stayed constant through 10 years
7538000	7540000	And I think some people have kind of, you know
7540000	7542000	It's really weird to say
7542000	7544000	I mean, not in a bad way
7544000	7546000	But to hear something like that is very powerful
7546000	7548000	I mean, when somebody's
7548000	7550000	Looking for normalcy
7550000	7552000	So they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights
7552000	7554000	To help them get through it
7554000	7556000	Like I said
7556000	7558000	We don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners
7558000	7560000	To feel that kind of power
7560000	7562000	That took one person in this case
7562000	7564000	Very
7564000	7566000	I'm glad we could help
7566000	7568000	That's all I can really say
7568000	7570000	Same here
7570000	7572000	Alright, the next
7572000	7574000	This is the one from Reddertainment I can read
7574000	7576000	Greetings Omni Beings
7576000	7578000	Attached to this email is a picture
7578000	7580000	I took at a Best Buy on Saturday
7580000	7582000	It's of the PC version
7582000	7584000	Of Final Fantasy XIV
7584000	7586000	The game is drastically reduced
7586000	7588000	Not only does the price sticker read 20
7588000	7590000	The red sticker on the game
7590000	7592000	Means the game is reduced to $10
7592000	7594000	Still, even at $10, I question whether
7594000	7596000	This game was worth my money
7596000	7598000	I posted this picture on Twitter
7598000	7600000	Asking if the game was worth my money
7600000	7602000	The only reply I received told me
7602000	7604000	That the Wolverine movie game next to
7604000	7606000	Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing
7606000	7608000	What does it say
7608000	7610000	About Final Fantasy XIV that I
7610000	7612000	The gamer who cuts his teeth on
7612000	7614000	Who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII
7614000	7616000	Would question buying this game
7616000	7618000	And when asked, people replied
7618000	7620000	That I should buy a movie tie-in instead
7620000	7622000	Stay black Reddertainment
7622000	7624000	This message has been brought to you by
7624000	7626000	Locally produced microbrew beer
7626000	7628000	Which is what I bought instead of a game
7628000	7630000	You could take a risk
7630000	7632000	That the 2.0 version
7632000	7634000	Is going to kick a lot of ass
7634000	7636000	One thing we didn't talk about this week
7636000	7638000	There was a blog post on Sony's blog
7638000	7640000	That was still happening on the PlayStation 3
7640000	7642000	Whenever the 2.0 version happens
7642000	7644000	There's going to be a beta test later in the year
7644000	7646000	I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet
7646000	7648000	I just, I mean, rebooting an MMO
7648000	7650000	And expecting people to care
7650000	7652000	I mean, it's a big
7652000	7654000	Risk
7654000	7656000	But if you think about it, if you buy the game now
7656000	7658000	For $10, you're not going to have to buy it again
7658000	7660000	When the 2.0 upgrade comes out
7660000	7662000	At least on PC
7662000	7664000	I just hope that means free to play
7664000	7666000	Final Fantasy XI
7666000	7668000	I wish those rumors about the Vita
7668000	7670000	Final Fantasy XI were true
7670000	7672000	Oh god, dream on internet
7672000	7674000	Okay
7674000	7676000	We have two more actually
7676000	7678000	But I never remember saying this
7678000	7680000	So, okay
7680000	7682000	I agree with Dark Soccer 100%
7682000	7684000	When she implied that Nintendo
7684000	7686000	Redeveloped Super Mario Bros. U
7686000	7688000	With a Crysis or Unreal type
7688000	7690000	Graphics engine and put Mario in
7690000	7692000	Real world 2D side scrolling
7692000	7694000	environment, oh, with real skies, trees
7694000	7696000	And weather effects, real gold coins
7696000	7698000	Abuse the power of the Wii U
7698000	7700000	I think I had said that it should
7700000	7702000	Be like, remember how Fantasy Zone
7702000	7704000	The Sega Ages
7704000	7706000	2500
7706000	7708000	Is, where it's all 3D
7708000	7710000	But it's side scrolling
7710000	7712000	I think that's what I had
7712000	7714000	Said
7714000	7716000	But
7716000	7718000	I don't know that I would want it to be
7718000	7720000	Like Crysis or Unreal
7720000	7722000	I just want it to be
7722000	7724000	2D side scrolling
7724000	7726000	But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D
7726000	7728000	I think more like a game like
7728000	7730000	Castlevania Symphony of the Night
7730000	7732000	Kinda had 2D, but a little bit of 3D thrown in
7732000	7734000	I don't know
7734000	7736000	And we had one last meal that came in
7736000	7738000	How about Paper Mario? That's a good example too
7738000	7740000	Came in last minute
7740000	7742000	And dear lord, sir
7742000	7744000	Please spell out your words
7744000	7746000	Well, sent from my iPod
7746000	7748000	That's what's happening
7748000	7750000	I type out all of my words fully
7750000	7752000	On my iPhone
7752000	7754000	So if I can do it, you can do it
7754000	7756000	And I'm lazier
7756000	7758000	Hey lord of the Orange Lounge
7758000	7760000	What's your most shameful moment
7760000	7762000	In video games?
7762000	7764000	Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about
7764000	7766000	Mine is Star Wars Galaxies
7766000	7768000	The hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard
7768000	7770000	Just so I could make
7770000	7772000	Hundreds of stem packs
7772000	7774000	Because I want to be a medic
7774000	7776000	Just that bad
7776000	7778000	That stupid game was such a let down
7778000	7780000	Tons of money and time
7780000	7782000	Never swinging a fucking light saber once
7782000	7784000	Kisses, Jim Sally
7784000	7786000	I may not want my co-workers to know about my
7786000	7788000	World of Warcraft podcast
7788000	7790000	Actually, a lot of them already
7790000	7792000	Do know about that
7792000	7794000	They don't get it, but they think it's
7794000	7796000	Interesting
7796000	7798000	I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work
7798000	7800000	I mean
7800000	7802000	You have to remember
7802000	7804000	I work primarily
7804000	7806000	Not exclusively, but primarily
7806000	7808000	Middle-aged women
7808000	7810000	So when I say
7810000	7812000	When I say that I'm into video games
7812000	7814000	I usually get a, oh
7814000	7816000	My son's really into that
7816000	7818000	Type of reaction
7818000	7820000	We've got a few fellow geeks at my work
7820000	7822000	But one of them is into Supernatural
7822000	7824000	Like I am
7824000	7826000	And you know, Becky works where I do
7826000	7828000	And she doesn't play games
7828000	7830000	Well, she plays R.I.P.M. but she sings
7830000	7832000	I have another friend that plays Xbox
7832000	7834000	Some of the people I talk to on the phone play games
7834000	7836000	The person I work
7836000	7838000	Closest with at my work
7838000	7840000	Who's another trainer and her and I are the same
7840000	7842000	Subject matter experts
7842000	7844000	I will say this
7844000	7846000	I adore her very much
7846000	7848000	We work great together, we're a great team
7848000	7850000	But I do love the fact that even though
7850000	7852000	She may not totally get all my game talk
7852000	7854000	She kind of is a closet nerd
7854000	7856000	And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show
7856000	7858000	But it's not like you guys know her anyway
7858000	7860000	She's totally into comic books
7860000	7862000	Oh, I totally know who that is
7862000	7864000	But no, she was telling me about
7864000	7866000	Oh no, before you go see the Avengers
7866000	7868000	You need to go see Captain America
7868000	7870000	Because there's parts of the story
7870000	7872000	That are in there that you're not going to see
7872000	7874000	In the Avengers
7874000	7876000	She likes to tell me about
7876000	7878000	How her and her son read comic books
7878000	7880000	Together, that used to be a bonding thing for them
7880000	7882000	She's talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons
7882000	7884000	Together with them, and I thought that was just neat
7884000	7886000	It was neat
7886000	7888000	There's nothing to be ashamed of
7888000	7890000	Unless you're a DC fan
7890000	7892000	That's why
7892000	7894000	Just to bring this back to an empowering moment
7894000	7896000	That's why I love VoG
7896000	7898000	The Voice of Geeks Network
7898000	7900000	There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek
7900000	7902000	Let your voice be heard
7902000	7904000	Nope
7904000	7906000	Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway
7906000	7908000	About what, VoG?
7908000	7910000	Shame on you
7910000	7912000	No, about people knowing what my fandoms are
7912000	7914000	You've made a career out of it, woman
7914000	7916000	At least a nighttime career
7916000	7918000	Well, I mean, but I really am
7918000	7920000	Completely happy
7920000	7922000	You know, I like
7922000	7924000	My nerdy stuff makes me happy
7924000	7926000	And, you know
7926000	7928000	If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like
7928000	7930000	Yeah, I play games
7930000	7932000	Play Mass Effect right now, yo
7932000	7934000	I got, you know, I actually
7934000	7936000	One of our reps was like, so what you're playing for this weekend?
7936000	7938000	Oh, sleeping video games
7938000	7940000	And like, oh, what are you playing?
7940000	7942000	I'm playing Mass Effect, really? I just finished that
7942000	7944000	You know, I have to do the conversation
7944000	7946000	Back to work
7946000	7948000	But, you know, I get that
7948000	7950000	I was like, oh, I play my Wii
7950000	7952000	I took one of my co-workers
7952000	7954000	To the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco
7954000	7956000	We drove over there
7956000	7958000	It was awesome
7958000	7960000	She had a blast
7960000	7962000	Anyway
7962000	7964000	She's also a fan of this page on Facebook
7964000	7966000	One of my co-workers, yeah
7966000	7968000	Do you be a fan of my page?
7968000	7970000	Well, you can go like Jamie, too
7970000	7972000	But I do want to say this
7972000	7974000	The Orange Lounge radio page is
7974000	7976000	A part of 500
7976000	7978000	Do you think for our 10th anniversary
7978000	7980000	You could get us 500 likes on Facebook?
7980000	7982000	Like, I could go, oh, we want
7982000	7984000	1000 likes on Facebook and 5000
7984000	7986000	Of course we fucking want 5000 likes on
7986000	7988000	Facebook, but I'm gonna keep the goal reasonable
7988000	7990000	Let's go
7990000	7992000	For 500 fans on Facebook
7992000	7994000	Two more fans before the next episode
7994000	7996000	That would be great
7998000	8000000	Alright, is that it for emails?
8000000	8002000	Yeah, that's all I'm gonna read anyway
8002000	8004000	Send us your emails
8004000	8006000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8006000	8008000	DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast
8008000	8010000	Next week
8010000	8012000	Meanwhile, let's get angsty
8026000	8028000	My FU, I have a few FUs
8028000	8030000	But I also have a thank you
8030000	8032000	My first FU goes
8032000	8034000	Towards
8034000	8036000	This trend lately
8036000	8038000	Of people having, like, you know
8038000	8040000	A Camry or some shit
8040000	8042000	Up on these huge ass wheels
8042000	8044000	With, like, bicycle spokes in them
8044000	8046000	You know what I'm talking about, Rob?
8046000	8048000	They're like wheels
8048000	8050000	That are, like, way too big
8050000	8052000	For the car
8052000	8054000	And the spokes
8054000	8056000	Are kinda like wagon wheels
8056000	8058000	Except, they have spokes
8058000	8060000	You don't get it
8060000	8062000	It's like, what the fuck are you doing to your car?
8062000	8064000	And it's like, it doesn't add any
8064000	8066000	It, first of all
8066000	8068000	It reduces
8068000	8070000	It, um
8070000	8072000	Decreases their gas mileage
8072000	8074000	Because they have higher wind resistance
8074000	8076000	It adds no grip to the ground
8076000	8078000	And it's just not at all good
8078000	8080000	For their suspension
8080000	8082000	It's stupid, I mean
8082000	8084000	You know what broke my heart, Rob?
8084000	8086000	You know what really broke my heart?
8086000	8088000	The 1970 Dodge Challenger
8088000	8090000	Which is one of my favorite muscle cars
8090000	8092000	With the fucking wheels like that
8092000	8094000	I wanted to kill a bitch
8094000	8096000	I would have cut them so hard
8096000	8098000	Now, I think that I would just fall over dead
8098000	8100000	If I happened to see one in the 72 Chevelle SS
8100000	8102000	I mean, that would murder me
8102000	8104000	And then, there were
8104000	8106000	There was just the
8106000	8108000	The people, this is the other thing
8108000	8110000	People try to sneak around you
8110000	8112000	Without saying, excuse me
8112000	8114000	When you don't see them, all you have to do is go
8114000	8116000	Excuse me, may I get by, please
8116000	8118000	And I'm like
8118000	8120000	I'll step aside and be like, okay
8120000	8122000	It's California in particular
8122000	8124000	Where people don't do that
8124000	8126000	And like, anywhere else that I've been
8126000	8128000	People will tap me on the shoulder and say
8128000	8130000	Excuse me, may I move around
8130000	8132000	But they don't do it here
8132000	8134000	I don't get why
8134000	8136000	All you have to do is just speak to somebody
8136000	8138000	And not treat them like they're an inconvenience
8138000	8140000	But I also
8140000	8142000	I love my mom
8142000	8144000	Because I have to direct an FU in her direction
8144000	8146000	And you know, actually
8146000	8148000	I've got it in front of me on Facebook
8148000	8150000	I am going
8150000	8152000	Making adjustments in my diet
8152000	8154000	Because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick
8154000	8156000	And my mom says
8156000	8158000	I've lost 8 pounds in two weeks
8158000	8160000	And I ain't no vegan, I eat meat
8160000	8162000	Water weight
8162000	8164000	So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol
8164000	8166000	And then
8166000	8168000	You're a bitch
8168000	8170000	But that's why we love you
8170000	8172000	And I appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy
8172000	8174000	And eat food that's good for me
8174000	8176000	And lose a little bit of my extra bulk
8176000	8178000	Thanks mom slash sarcasm
8178000	8180000	And so
8180000	8182000	It's just this thing with my mom
8182000	8184000	Basically
8184000	8186000	Anything that is not in her scope of reality
8186000	8188000	She sort of just rejects it
8188000	8190000	And substitutes it with her own version of reality
8190000	8192000	And in some places
8192000	8194000	They call that insanity
8194000	8196000	So I don't know if it's just a mom thing
8196000	8198000	She just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view
8198000	8200000	So I guess this isn't
8200000	8202000	Oh I just noticed
8202000	8204000	I know look at that
8204000	8206000	500 likes
8206000	8208000	Thank you whoever just liked us
8208000	8210000	I can't see who it is
8210000	8212000	50 for every year of the podcast
8212000	8214000	Alright now let's do 600
8214000	8216000	Or no I want 666 now
8216000	8218000	Well to continue
8218000	8220000	Yes
8220000	8222000	It's just that
8222000	8224000	Again I love my mom
8224000	8226000	It's not exactly an FU
8226000	8228000	Really you know what I mean
8228000	8230000	Where you just go really really
8230000	8232000	It's like that meme where the
8232000	8234000	Girl is like looking sideways and making the
8234000	8236000	Face which you can't see
8236000	8238000	So this is really good radio
8238000	8240000	You have a lot of FUs to give tonight
8240000	8242000	Oh my thank you
8242000	8244000	Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods
8244000	8246000	Who let me
8246000	8248000	And my small little purchase
8248000	8250000	Go through and said oh no you've only
8250000	8252000	Got a couple you go ahead of me
8252000	8254000	I have a bunch more than you
8254000	8256000	And I was like well thank you

8258000	8260000	I hope you have a great evening
8260000	8262000	Bless her heart I hope she gets some tonight
8262000	8264000	Yeah
8264000	8266000	But it just I'm glad that there's nice
8266000	8268000	Considerate people in the world
8268000	8270000	And there need to be it just takes one
8270000	8272000	Act of kindness to make sort of
8272000	8274000	A ripple effect cause you know if you
8274000	8276000	If you take that moment and make a difference
8276000	8278000	In somebody else's day
8278000	8280000	Then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference
8280000	8282000	In somebody else's day that's all I'm saying
8282000	8284000	I'm done
8284000	8286000	Spent
8286000	8288000	Loki
8288000	8290000	Uh
8290000	8292000	I don't know I don't have anything
8292000	8294000	FU to my throat being sore
8294000	8296000	For a third week in a row
8296000	8298000	She's not going away
8298000	8300000	So I guess I gotta go see the doctor now
8300000	8302000	Cause it could
8302000	8304000	No I don't know what it could be
8304000	8306000	Maybe allergies
8306000	8308000	This is annoying
8308000	8310000	I have to make mine
8310000	8312000	Intentionally extremely vague
8312000	8314000	Tonight but FU
8314000	8316000	To my fear of the
8316000	8318000	Uncertain and the
8318000	8320000	Uncomfortable probably causing
8320000	8322000	Me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity
8322000	8324000	That's all I'm gonna say
8324000	8326000	Alright
8326000	8328000	Really there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear
8328000	8330000	Nothing wrong with changing brands
8330000	8332000	No that part's fun
8332000	8334000	Are you kidding?
8334000	8336000	That's like
8336000	8338000	I know they might fit a little differently
8338000	8340000	Than your current brand
8340000	8342000	That's the incentive to lose weight
8342000	8344000	It's like Rob if you lose weight
8344000	8346000	You can go buy new underwear
8346000	8348000	Yes
8348000	8350000	I meant like changing your brand
8350000	8352000	Oh
8352000	8354000	They may fit a little weird in some places
8354000	8356000	Maybe a little too snug
8356000	8358000	But it's a new opportunity
8358000	8360000	They might be cheaper and better made
8360000	8362000	I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear
8362000	8364000	On Orange Lawn's radio so I think we need to move on
8364000	8366000	I think it'll be a good idea
8366000	8368000	Please let's move on with something else
8368000	8370000	Let's talk about Harmonix and
8370000	8372000	What they're planning on working on
8372000	8374000	They actually have three more projects
8374000	8376000	Or three or more projects
8376000	8378000	They're in the work right now
8378000	8380000	And none of them are Rock Band
8380000	8382000	Or Dance Central
8382000	8384000	So that's pretty awesome
8384000	8386000	And
8386000	8388000	Of course they can't
8388000	8390000	Talk about it but
8390000	8392000	At least they're coming out with something new
8392000	8394000	Eventually
8394000	8396000	Eventually
8396000	8398000	But they said yeah
8398000	8400000	They'll have some crazy stuff to talk about
8400000	8402000	Hopefully next year
8404000	8406000	Hopefully soon
8406000	8408000	Coming soon
8408000	8410000	Or not
8410000	8412000	Yes
8412000	8414000	Someday
8414000	8416000	Eventually
8416000	8418000	Alright let's move on
8418000	8420000	Moving on to
8420000	8422000	One more story
8422000	8424000	It's about Capcom
8424000	8426000	And you gotta love this guy
8426000	8428000	He's so animated
8428000	8430000	Yoshinori Ono
8430000	8432000	He's the guy behind
8432000	8434000	One of the producers of Street Fighter 4
8434000	8436000	He's awesome
8436000	8438000	He is awesome
8438000	8440000	There's this interview going around
8440000	8442000	That's on Eurogamer
8442000	8444000	About how he did Street Fighter 4
8444000	8446000	Because he was working on Onimusha 4
8446000	8448000	And he kept submitting a proposal
8448000	8450000	For a new Street Fighter
8450000	8452000	After Street Fighter 3 did not do so well
8452000	8454000	But apparently enough fans
8454000	8456000	Pestered Capcom
8456000	8458000	They kind of let him do it
8458000	8460000	I don't know if you forgot
8460000	8462000	But he had this whole thing where
8462000	8464000	He suffered from exhaustion
8464000	8466000	Legit
8466000	8468000	I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion
8468000	8470000	He was just exhausted
8470000	8472000	I don't want to say retire
8472000	8474000	But he had to really take a step back
8474000	8476000	For a little bit
8476000	8478000	What's interesting
8478000	8480000	About having come back to work
8480000	8482000	At Capcom
8482000	8484000	Nobody told me to take a rest
8484000	8486000	When I returned to work
8486000	8488000	Capcom didn't even acknowledge
8488000	8490000	That I'd been in the hospital
8490000	8492000	There was no change in my schedule
8492000	8494000	I was at home for an entire week
8494000	8496000	Before the doctors allowed me to return to work
8496000	8498000	When I returned to my desk
8498000	8500000	There was a ticket to Rome waiting for me
8500000	8502000	There's no mercy
8502000	8504000	Everyone in the company says
8504000	8506000	Ono-san we've been so worried about you
8506000	8508000	We've been overwhelmed with things to do
8508000	8510000	That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer
8510000	8512000	But then again when you made Street Fighter 4
8512000	8514000	Which is kind of making Capcom
8514000	8516000	A lot of money right now I guess you can do that
8516000	8518000	And that is kind of messed up
8518000	8520000	I mean I don't know
8520000	8522000	Is it just here in America
8522000	8524000	That you can kind of get that
8524000	8526000	Like if you have an incident like that
8526000	8528000	I know if somebody at my work
8528000	8530000	Had a bad incident like that
8530000	8532000	You would get what's called the work accommodation
8532000	8534000	Where you work a limited schedule
8534000	8536000	Whatever your doctor orders
8536000	8538000	Which I still have
8538000	8540000	For several months
8540000	8542000	I took two weeks off
8542000	8544000	And basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to
8544000	8546000	Which
8546000	8548000	Some people might sound like
8548000	8550000	Oh what a lazy
8550000	8552000	But no this is like a legit diagnosed thing
8552000	8554000	Your doctor said she's got to do it
8554000	8556000	It's related to an immunodeficiency issue
8556000	8558000	And I was also lacking in B12
8558000	8560000	And vitamin D
8560000	8562000	And it's almost
8562000	8564000	In some cases I've seen people
8564000	8566000	Compare it to narcolepsy
8566000	8568000	Where you start finding you'll be aware
8568000	8570000	Of yourself nodding off
8570000	8572000	It's just overwhelming
8572000	8574000	Exhaustion where you hurt
8574000	8576000	All the time
8576000	8578000	It's horrible
8578000	8580000	And anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass
8580000	8582000	I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls
8582000	8584000	Alright anyhow
8584000	8586000	What is this
8586000	8588000	I guess Ono
8588000	8590000	Was continuing to talk
8590000	8592000	I thought this was a crazy quote
8592000	8594000	Was this a quote from Ono? I guess it was
8594000	8596000	Capcom was very good at squeezing
8596000	8598000	People to the last drop of their
8598000	8600000	Blood to get work done
8600000	8602000	Ouch
8602000	8604000	You know something else though
8604000	8606000	I think it's
8606000	8608000	So they basically bought him a ticket to Rome
8608000	8610000	To relax
8610000	8612000	See now that is though
8612000	8614000	I would say understanding
8614000	8616000	What they did and saying sorry here you go
8616000	8618000	Thanks for getting the product out
8618000	8620000	I know in Denmark they get a month off
8620000	8622000	Mandatory paid vacation
8622000	8624000	Finland too
8624000	8626000	Because they're you know
8626000	8628000	A socialist democracy and they have the highest
8628000	8630000	Highest level of
8630000	8632000	Reported public happiness in the world
8632000	8634000	Just saying
8634000	8636000	Learn from this America
8638000	8640000	Alrighty
8640000	8642000	Ah
8642000	8644000	That's it for my story there
8644000	8646000	I guess we're about ready to open up the skype line
8646000	8648000	How's it sound when we open up the skype line?
8648000	8650000	1877 Game OLR
8650000	8652000	Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8652000	8654000	And we'll get to the twitter topics
8654000	8656000	In just a minute as well but I want to ask Loki
8656000	8658000	Surprise him here with any last minute stories
8658000	8660000	He might possibly have for us
8660000	8662000	Just real quick there's going to be
8662000	8664000	A different circle pad attachment
8664000	8666000	That's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet
8666000	8668000	It actually kind of conforms
8668000	8670000	To the 3DS shell
8670000	8672000	So it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS
8672000	8674000	So cool
8674000	8676000	And that'll be coming out I guess
8676000	8678000	For 30 bucks
8678000	8680000	Soon
8680000	8682000	So a little bit more expensive but
8682000	8684000	Pay for quality I guess
8684000	8686000	And then there's a retro game
8686000	8688000	That's being put out
8688000	8690000	On PC
8690000	8692000	By developer JoyMashers
8692000	8694000	And it's a game called Oniken
8694000	8696000	Looks pretty awesome
8696000	8698000	Supposed to be coming out on
8698000	8700000	I guess Desura
8700000	8702000	For $4.99
8702000	8704000	And that's out uh
8704000	8706000	It was actually out this coming Friday
8706000	8708000	On the 22nd
8708000	8710000	And I guess um
8710000	8712000	Mac and Linux versions are coming out
8712000	8714000	Later on
8714000	8716000	But the game looks a lot like Strider
8716000	8718000	So
8718000	8720000	It could be cool
8720000	8722000	Which Strider? NES Strider?
8722000	8724000	NES Strider? Well I mean it's an
8724000	8726000	NES styled game
8726000	8728000	So it's like NES Strider but
8728000	8730000	I mean it sort of resembles Strider
8730000	8732000	But not Commando you know generic
8732000	8734000	Futuristic action game
8734000	8736000	Alright the calls are coming in
8736000	8738000	So let's go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Taunt Radio who's this?
8738000	8740000	It's Shane
8740000	8742000	Hi Shane how are you?
8742000	8744000	Hello
8744000	8746000	How are you?
8746000	8748000	I'm burning up and achy
8748000	8750000	And tired
8750000	8752000	For those that listen to Horde House
8752000	8754000	How are you doing after the surgery?
8754000	8756000	Well
8756000	8758000	I'm not falling asleep
8758000	8760000	In the middle of things as much
8760000	8762000	Yeah that was a hilarious moment by the way on the show
8762000	8764000	If you didn't hear this week's Horde House
8764000	8766000	Shane fell asleep part way through the show
8766000	8768000	It was amazing, amazing radio
8768000	8770000	Go check it out
8770000	8772000	It's because I was on uh
8772000	8774000	What's that thing? Percocet
8774000	8776000	I'm still on it, only to get to sleep now
8776000	8778000	Not for pain stuff
8778000	8780000	You even have comments in the chat room
8780000	8782000	BlackWolf says is Shane awake?
8782000	8784000	I am
8784000	8786000	Um crap
8786000	8788000	I totally had what I was gonna say
8788000	8790000	And then I forgot because you interrupted me
8790000	8792000	I'm sorry well surely it was about Mass Effect
8792000	8794000	Percocet
8794000	8796000	Surely it was about Mass Effect
8796000	8798000	I honestly don't think it was
8798000	8800000	Which might
8800000	8802000	Shock everybody
8802000	8804000	They replaced him after the surgery
8804000	8806000	What? Nothing
8806000	8808000	Nothing? You're not a pod person
8808000	8810000	Was it E3? Was it something we talked about?
8810000	8812000	No I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop
8812000	8814000	So I got that
8814000	8816000	Indie bundle that had all those really good games
8816000	8818000	For super cheap
8818000	8820000	The most recent one
8820000	8822000	Sorry BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep
8822000	8824000	That was good
8824000	8826000	That was good
8826000	8828000	Yes the Humble Bundle
8828000	8830000	And I started playing Bastion which you know
8830000	8832000	I heard so much about
8832000	8834000	I saw all the banners at E3 last year
8834000	8836000	I was like oh that looks stupid
8836000	8838000	And now I'm playing it and the game
8838000	8840000	It's okay but I want every game to be narrated
8840000	8842000	Now because that is the
8842000	8844000	Best part of the game
8844000	8846000	It's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers
8846000	8848000	It's the part of the game that makes
8848000	8850000	People feel so like hipster
8850000	8852000	And that they're playing something artistic
8852000	8854000	Is like my game has a deep
8854000	8856000	Voiced bassy narrator
8856000	8858000	I don't feel hipster but I like to
8858000	8860000	Jump off you know
8860000	8862000	Well I fell off the world once and he narrated
8862000	8864000	That and that's where I was sold
8864000	8866000	I thought it was so awesome
8866000	8868000	I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice
8868000	8870000	Commercial in the style of the Old Spice Commercial
8870000	8872000	That Mustafa guy
8872000	8874000	That would be awesome
8874000	8876000	I want a game narrated by Gilbert
8876000	8878000	Godfried
8878000	8880000	I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees
8880000	8882000	What is up with that?
8882000	8884000	That would be terrible
8884000	8886000	Nobody wants that
8886000	8888000	I would play that
8888000	8890000	Oh my god I think you just
8890000	8892000	Died
8892000	8894000	You're the worst video game player ever
8894000	8896000	Have you seen the
8896000	8898000	Funny video of Gilbert Godfried doing
8898000	8900000	The audio book for Fifty Shades of Grey
8900000	8902000	Yes
8902000	8904000	Yes I have
8904000	8906000	Oh my god it's fucking amazing
8906000	8908000	Yes I have
8908000	8910000	Fifty Shades of Grey
8910000	8912000	Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate
8912000	8914000	Oh my god
8914000	8916000	So Shane
8916000	8918000	I am addicted and I blame you
8918000	8920000	And Rob
8920000	8922000	That's fine I'll take all the blame
8922000	8924000	For that because
8924000	8926000	Well here's the thing it's kind of like a pyramid scheme
8926000	8928000	So now you have to go and find
8928000	8930000	Somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them
8930000	8932000	I'm working on it I'm trying to get Dan to play it
8932000	8934000	So that our entire house is infected
8934000	8936000	Can Shirmi play it?
8936000	8938000	No she'll just shit
8938000	8940000	Oh that's disgusting
8940000	8942000	Well everyone poops
8942000	8944000	That's true I know
8944000	8946000	From my little puppy Especially your new puppy
8946000	8948000	What did you end up naming your puppy?
8948000	8950000	Helo from Battlestar Galactica
8950000	8952000	Cool okay
8952000	8954000	Well um
8954000	8956000	Now I am completely addicted to
8956000	8958000	Including Garris and everything
8958000	8960000	Because I kind of dig my
8960000	8962000	Birdman
8962000	8964000	He is awesome He totally is
8964000	8966000	But I am looking forward to the
8966000	8968000	Hotness of Miranda
8968000	8970000	But I don't know I'm not too impressed with Kaiden yet
8970000	8972000	Really cause he's just
8972000	8974000	Not doing anything he's just sort of like
8974000	8976000	It's cause you're not taking him places
8976000	8978000	I heard earlier you're like
8978000	8980000	I don't bring him along
8980000	8982000	I'm like hi Shepard
8982000	8984000	Wink
8984000	8986000	No the same thing I felt for Liara
8986000	8988000	I hated Liara and then I beat three and I kind of
8988000	8990000	Liked her and then I started taking her
8990000	8992000	Through my playthroughs
8992000	8994000	Well I can't say stuff
8994000	8996000	And she became my hag
8996000	8998000	And I like Liara now
8998000	9000000	So I have her and Kaiden all the time
9000000	9002000	Well then maybe
9002000	9004000	Maybe I'll leave Rex at home
9004000	9006000	For a while and take Kaiden out
9006000	9008000	Yes
9008000	9010000	That's a much better idea
9010000	9012000	Although people have been spoiling crap for me
9012000	9014000	Well you should
9014000	9016000	Unfriend them and then drive to their house
9016000	9018000	And punch them in the throat
9018000	9020000	It's because I was looking up the stuff
9020000	9022000	That I'm not doing in Mass Effect
9022000	9024000	Like I was reading the wiki
9024000	9026000	And I don't want to
9026000	9028000	Shoot somebody
9028000	9030000	Oh yeah
9030000	9032000	So
9032000	9034000	That made me mad
9034000	9036000	That and the triple palette swap
9036000	9038000	That I won't go into further detail about
9038000	9040000	We can talk
9040000	9042000	Later about that because I don't understand what that is
9042000	9044000	I'm telling her she doesn't
9044000	9046000	That doesn't tell her the full picture
9046000	9048000	That doesn't tell her the full
9048000	9050000	Picture I'm still going to play the whole thing
9050000	9052000	I'll find out Rob
9052000	9054000	I'm just saying
9054000	9056000	Before I hang up here
9056000	9058000	So you don't hang up on me
9058000	9060000	Something we'll probably talk about on Horde House
9060000	9062000	This week that I saw today
9062000	9064000	I guess it was Dad of Mine for Diablo 3
9064000	9066000	That you'll get
9066000	9068000	Some stuff for having the collectors
9068000	9070000	Miss the Pandaria
9070000	9072000	You'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some
9072000	9074000	Banners and stuff but there's also
9074000	9076000	Possibly these
9076000	9078000	Wings that say in the
9078000	9080000	Like the code string
9080000	9082000	That they give you quad damage
9082000	9084000	Now how fair is that
9084000	9086000	To get something that's actually worth
9086000	9088000	Something that's really good
9088000	9090000	For another game but you have to buy
9090000	9092000	A collector's edition of something you may not
9092000	9094000	Care about
9094000	9096000	That fucking sucks actually that's pretty shitty
9096000	9098000	I gotta say
9098000	9100000	But I'll get the collector's edition anyway cause
9100000	9102000	I want that soundtrack cause it's really good
9102000	9104000	And actually before I let you go
9104000	9106000	I have something I have to play
9106000	9108000	Oops not that
9108000	9110000	Was it my commercial I sent you cause that's awesome
9110000	9112000	No
9112000	9116000	Holy fuck is this wrong
9116000	9118000	But holy hell
9118000	9120000	Is it erotic
9120000	9124000	He totally missed the part where he's actually
9124000	9126000	I can't find the actual YouTube on there
9126000	9128000	It was apparently on College Humor
9128000	9130000	But I searched their site and I couldn't find it
9130000	9132000	I'm sure Tiger Claw will have it in 30 seconds now
9132000	9134000	But it's missed the boat
9134000	9136000	It's on my Facebook page
9136000	9138000	Hurry up and end the show so we can go play Mass Effect multiplayer
9138000	9140000	Bye
9140000	9142000	1877 game
9142000	9144000	O-L-R username on Skype
9144000	9146000	Is Orange Lounge Radio
9146000	9148000	If you want to give us a call
9148000	9150000	Do we have any other last minute stories
9150000	9152000	Or should I go over to Twitter
9152000	9154000	I had Twitter up on the iPad
9154000	9156000	Well there was something I was just going to mention real quick
9156000	9158000	That was kind of interesting
9158000	9160000	Remember how well we were just talking about
9160000	9162000	Pinball game during part A
9162000	9164000	Where Twilight Zone was
9164000	9166000	The game of the week here
9166000	9168000	There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently
9168000	9170000	Pinball Arcade the Twilight Zone
9170000	9174000	It's to get the Twilight Zone I guess on consoles
9174000	9176000	Well it must have worked
9176000	9178000	Hold on let's go to the phone
9178000	9180000	So we have another call coming in
9180000	9182000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9182000	9184000	Oh my god is this Rob
9184000	9186000	Oh my god it is
9186000	9188000	Oh my god penis
9188000	9190000	Oh hi
9190000	9192000	Well yes I have one
9192000	9194000	Would you like to see it
9194000	9196000	And unfortunately I've already seen it
9196000	9198000	Ah to be 20
9198000	9200000	Ah unicorns
9200000	9202000	What is up Miss Jessica Harper
9202000	9204000	From Understation Live Saturday nights at VOG
9204000	9206000	Not much I thought that you know
9206000	9208000	Since you've actually been
9208000	9210000	Showing support for us these past two Saturdays
9210000	9212000	And stuff
9212000	9214000	I would actually call in
9214000	9216000	And say hi guys
9216000	9218000	Thank you so much you know being able to check in
9218000	9220000	And get points really helps motivate me
9220000	9222000	To show no I've
9222000	9224000	I mean obviously I do love the points
9224000	9226000	There's no other reason aside from
9226000	9228000	Going and getting points
9228000	9230000	No the whole reason there's two reasons
9230000	9232000	I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night
9232000	9234000	And I can't honestly I won't be there next
9234000	9236000	Saturday but neither will you
9236000	9238000	Neither will I
9238000	9240000	There's two reasons one of them is disco disco
9240000	9242000	Disco disco
9242000	9244000	And somebody was asking me when we were going to do
9244000	9246000	Disco disco on Orange Lounge Radio I said you don't understand
9246000	9248000	Travis already thinks I steal
9248000	9250000	All the bits from Understation Live
9250000	9252000	I'm not gonna
9252000	9254000	Like further give him evidence
9254000	9256000	So no disco there's a ban on disco
9256000	9258000	Disco the closest thing
9258000	9260000	You can go disco disco in PlayStation Home
9260000	9262000	That's as close as we're gonna get
9262000	9264000	But I will say
9264000	9266000	The second reason is recursive
9266000	9268000	Travis
9268000	9270000	Yes recursive Travis
9270000	9272000	Always makes me giggle it doesn't matter
9272000	9274000	How pissed off I am how upset
9274000	9276000	I am recursive Travis just every
9276000	9278000	Single time I do love though
9278000	9280000	That you guys it looks like
9280000	9282000	I gotta say props to Travis and I don't know
9282000	9284000	If you're part of this effort as well you've gotta be cracking
9284000	9286000	The whip or something behind the scenes because
9286000	9288000	Travis is now getting his podcast up
9288000	9290000	Same day which is amazing
9290000	9292000	You know it's all
9292000	9294000	Because of
9294000	9296000	The vog
9296000	9298000	Aura it's like it got into his
9298000	9300000	Veins or something and now he
9300000	9302000	He just he's part
9302000	9304000	Of it you know he is in the
9304000	9306000	Groove and I'm waiting for it
9306000	9308000	To start you know
9308000	9310000	Calming down like after a month or two
9310000	9312000	But you know it's been well over a month
9312000	9314000	Now it's like been what seven shows
9314000	9316000	Now that he's been getting up there
9316000	9318000	Every single week yeah yeah for real
9318000	9320000	Yeah and um
9320000	9322000	Not only that but it looks like
9322000	9324000	Starting with this past week he now has
9324000	9326000	Saved the archives on Ustream because
9326000	9328000	If you haven't tuned in to understation live on vog
9328000	9330000	It actually flips
9330000	9332000	The radio station disappears
9332000	9334000	I mean it's still there so if you want just the
9334000	9336000	Audio like if you're driving in your car or something
9336000	9338000	You obviously can't watch understation live you can still listen
9338000	9340000	But if you're watching on your computer it
9340000	9342000	Flips and you see the Ustream
9342000	9344000	Well Travis is now saving the Ustreams
9344000	9346000	So if you're jvmon in our chat
9346000	9348000	Room asking what is disco disco
9348000	9350000	You could go to Ustream
9350000	9352000	And watch now you can
9352000	9354000	Watch and watch you can actually
9354000	9356000	Feel like you're there
9356000	9358000	Watch me disco disco last week
9358000	9360000	With no pants yes
9360000	9362000	And watch his you know beard
9362000	9364000	Get the dirty thoughts out of your head you didn't see anything
9364000	9366000	Below the belt except my leg
9366000	9368000	But I have
9368000	9370000	I've just
9370000	9372000	Seen Robin very tight
9372000	9374000	Lacy panties
9374000	9376000	Lacy silky
9376000	9378000	Is what I did you make it okay
9378000	9380000	You need to give some background to this
9380000	9382000	Because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy
9382000	9384000	Walking around in women's panties
9384000	9386000	Or something like that yes it was rocky
9386000	9388000	Horror there's a big difference
9388000	9390000	There's a difference still funny to say
9390000	9392000	There's a difference
9394000	9396000	Is there any video games you've been playing lately
9396000	9398000	Aquaticirl
9398000	9400000	Well pretty much what I play
9400000	9402000	Is over and over and over again
9402000	9404000	Is lotro I am addicted to lotro
9404000	9406000	Yeah you suck dark soccer into that whole thing
9406000	9408000	I'm trying to
9408000	9410000	I see her over there once in a while
9410000	9412000	And she's like oh it's so pretty I'm like
9412000	9414000	Yeah that's why I keep trying to tell you people
9414000	9416000	It seems like it's working a little bit
9416000	9418000	I'm trying to play it at least once a week
9418000	9420000	At least once a week
9420000	9422000	Because I don't know if you know about
9422000	9424000	My guild druidia
9424000	9426000	I was seeing something about that yeah
9426000	9428000	We now have an all druid guild
9428000	9430000	Called druidia
9430000	9432000	It was either going to be that or the order of vespa
9432000	9434000	She has to fit in her time
9434000	9436000	Between tumblr and facebook
9436000	9438000	Too I'm just
9438000	9440000	I've had design work to do
9440000	9442000	For reals that I've been getting paid for
9442000	9444000	I'm kidding lady lighten up
9444000	9446000	She just has such a busy gaming schedule
9446000	9448000	She has to fit everything in
9448000	9450000	Yeah my mass effect and my fractal
9450000	9452000	And my wows and my lotors
9452000	9454000	And my stows
9454000	9456000	So yeah I only have time
9456000	9458000	In my life for one game
9458000	9460000	That's my MMO addiction right there
9460000	9462000	Hey you know what getting addicted to an MMO
9462000	9464000	Still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes
9464000	9466000	Well I just
9466000	9468000	See here's how bad I am though
9468000	9470000	When it comes to console gaming
9470000	9472000	I used to be right on top of it
9472000	9474000	You remember how I used to be
9474000	9476000	I don't own any modern system
9476000	9478000	The only thing I have is a PS2
9478000	9480000	You know what though
9480000	9482000	Gaming can be an expensive hobby
9482000	9484000	And there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer
9484000	9486000	We have a lot of people listen to this show
9486000	9488000	That's kind of in your boat
9488000	9490000	Where it's like you know
9490000	9492000	I'd love to have a 360 or a Playstation 3
9492000	9494000	Or whatever but I just
9494000	9496000	I have to buy stuff at you know
9496000	9498000	Flee markets
9498000	9500000	I like paying my rent
9500000	9502000	Exactly
9502000	9504000	I've gone through a lot of life changes
9504000	9506000	Since my gaming days
9506000	9508000	I now live in a place all by myself
9508000	9510000	And it's in downtown Sacramento
9510000	9512000	So it's a little bit more expensive
9512000	9514000	But you know
9514000	9516000	You do what you have to do
9516000	9518000	And so yeah I'm not sharing rent
9518000	9520000	So I can't go out and buy the pretty toys
9520000	9522000	And what have you but
9522000	9524000	You know what we could do?
9524000	9526000	Typing of the dead
9526000	9528000	Yeah well unfortunately
9528000	9530000	When I was going through all of my
9530000	9532000	Very very difficult times
9532000	9534000	My Dreamcast was one of the things that went away
9534000	9536000	You girls can borrow mine anytime
9536000	9538000	If I can find it
9538000	9540000	If I can find it
9540000	9542000	Yes I could
9542000	9544000	We can type zombies to death at my house
9544000	9546000	Yeah
9546000	9548000	And as mentioned in chat I do have Chewy
9548000	9550000	You do have a Chewy and that's very important
9550000	9552000	And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well
9552000	9554000	And space

9666000	9668000	I am like I was
9668000	9670000	Terribly afraid of roller coasters then one time
9670000	9672000	Disneyland it was awesome and then
9672000	9674000	Alright I'm afraid again
9674000	9676000	The only roller coaster I will real roller coaster I'll ever do
9676000	9678000	Is screaming okay Rob
9678000	9680000	I just want to read in chat real quick though
9680000	9682000	Black Wolf is complaining
9682000	9684000	You guys just went I haven't been in
9684000	9686000	Over a year yeah well
9686000	9688000	Still two weeks is two weeks too long
9688000	9690000	Alright caller hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
9690000	9692000	Who's this? Hey what's up this is X-Link
9692000	9694000	Hey X-Link I haven't heard from you in a while buddy
9694000	9696000	How you doing? Good good Black Wolf don't feel too bad
9696000	9698000	I live right around the corner from
9698000	9700000	Disney around here and I've been in here so
9700000	9702000	Don't even remotely feel bad
9702000	9704000	I haven't been able to get up there and be able to do
9704000	9706000	Stuff in quite a while so
9706000	9708000	I've been quite disappointed that they took
9708000	9710000	Tron away from it but
9710000	9712000	You know something about that
9712000	9714000	Rob I have a question for you
9714000	9716000	How do you feel now
9716000	9718000	That the Steam Workshop has now
9718000	9720000	Has been available for Civ 5
9720000	9722000	I haven't really
9722000	9724000	Got to play around with it yet
9724000	9726000	But I'm excited about the potential
9726000	9728000	That's in there I mean there's always been some
9728000	9730000	Great mods for Civ so
9730000	9732000	It just seems like a logical step and I'm kind of
9732000	9734000	Glad that they're kind of embracing each other
9734000	9736000	Steam and Civ I haven't
9736000	9738000	Admittedly played a lot of Sim 5
9738000	9740000	Ever since I got into the Mass Effect series
9740000	9742000	But I definitely want to go back and revisit it
9742000	9744000	I heard the game fell out of balance
9744000	9746000	Bad with the last patch
9746000	9748000	That they did so my friends were like I don't really want to play
9748000	9750000	It kind of sucks right now but I'm imagining
9750000	9752000	They fixed it with God's I mean they had to
9752000	9754000	Have with this Gods and Kings expansion so
9754000	9756000	I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months
9756000	9758000	Yeah they did a lot of work on it
9758000	9760000	From what I understood from this last patch alone
9760000	9762000	When they were adding the Steam
9762000	9764000	The Steam Network workshop
9764000	9766000	Onto it and then I'm hearing on top of that
9766000	9768000	They're also going to be doing a little more odds
9768000	9770000	And ends to that when Gods and Kings does
9770000	9772000	Come out in the following week here so
9772000	9774000	Right right
9774000	9776000	Which will be very interesting because knowing
9776000	9778000	That you can make your own religion is going to be kind of
9778000	9780000	Interesting and intriguing to see what happens
9780000	9782000	That is a little bit scary but good
9782000	9784000	I was going to flip this question on you what do you think
9784000	9786000	About Steam Workshop and Civ integration
9786000	9788000	Civ 5? Hey I think it's going to be pretty interesting
9788000	9790000	What they're going to do Sharks with lasers
9790000	9792000	Or nuclear weapons or you know
9792000	9794000	Or robotic robots you know
9794000	9796000	I mean the sky is the limit so
9796000	9798000	I mean it's going to be intriguing to see
9798000	9800000	What kind of different mods and stuff
9800000	9802000	People are going to come up with for the game so
9802000	9804000	It really is it's like little big Civ
9804000	9806000	Pretty much yeah
9806000	9808000	Hey this actually kind of ties into this
9808000	9810000	I want to bring in this Twitter topic here real quick
9810000	9812000	Because it sort of is related here and I'm sure
9812000	9814000	You're going to know this story when I start reading it
9814000	9816000	From SSJ100Matt who tweeted us saying
9816000	9818000	I saw this earlier this week
9818000	9820000	Man plays same Civ 2 game
9820000	9822000	For 10 years
9822000	9824000	Civ 2 is my favorite Civ game
9824000	9826000	So this made me smile
9826000	9828000	And Sid Meier even did a reaction to it
9828000	9830000	If you haven't heard basically
9830000	9832000	And this was all over Reddit and all that stuff
9832000	9834000	So I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this
9834000	9836000	But this man has been playing his Civ game for 10 years
9836000	9838000	He's now in the
9838000	9840000	I mean not obviously like straight
9840000	9842000	He's been playing 10 years on and off
9842000	9844000	His world is in the world
9844000	9846000	Is in the year 3991 AD
9846000	9848000	That's a long ways into the game
9848000	9850000	Trust me
9850000	9852000	And basically his world has
9852000	9854000	The Celts, the Vikings and the Americans
9854000	9856000	Stuck in thermo
9856000	9858000	Sorry the Celts, the Vikings and the Americans
9858000	9860000	Stuck in thermonuclear war
9860000	9862000	For 1700 in game years
9862000	9864000	That's crazy
9864000	9866000	They're saying
9866000	9868000	Is it a strange reflection
9868000	9870000	On where society is headed
9870000	9872000	It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts
9872000	9874000	This week
9874000	9876000	No I did not actually
9876000	9878000	It's kind of intriguing hearing about that
9878000	9880000	I'll definitely go back and reread that
9880000	9882000	But yeah that's crazy
9882000	9884000	Though I thought they could have sworn
9884000	9886000	They stopped it like at some point they do
9886000	9888000	Stop the game like if you get to a certain area
9888000	9890000	It's like you can't play it after that
9890000	9892000	Unless it's Civ 3 or 4
9892000	9894000	It must be
9894000	9896000	It must be the later Civs
9896000	9898000	I thought the game always ended at a certain point
9898000	9900000	As well but maybe 2 had been left open ended
9900000	9902000	I can't remember
9902000	9904000	Maybe his game was modded somehow
9904000	9906000	To let it go on forever
9906000	9908000	I didn't read about the details on that
9908000	9910000	In 10 years that's a lot of time
9910000	9912000	I don't know
9912000	9914000	Maybe turn a day or something
9914000	9916000	Or turn a week
9916000	9918000	I don't know
9918000	9920000	That's very intriguing but that's very cool
9920000	9922000	To hear about that
9922000	9924000	Sid Meier's response was really interesting
9924000	9926000	He said
9926000	9928000	My first thought was wow
9928000	9930000	I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2
9930000	9932000	For so long
9932000	9934000	It's been more than 15 years since we released that game
9934000	9936000	And I don't think any of us expected
9936000	9938000	A decade long game would come out of it
9938000	9940000	It would be amazing if we could come back
9940000	9942000	In 2025 and find out if
9942000	9944000	Someone's had a 10 year game of Civ 5
9944000	9946000	Going
9946000	9948000	Well you know it's kind of like
9948000	9950000	The way he's played and ran is kind of similar to
9950000	9952000	Monopoly really
9952000	9954000	If you play it right
9954000	9956000	I could see it actually going on for that long period
9956000	9958000	Of time
9958000	9960000	It's going back and forth type of deal
9960000	9962000	And you're not really making
9962000	9964000	Ok I'm going to build up 50 units
9964000	9966000	And go in there and try to
9966000	9968000	Massive wipe these
9968000	9970000	Towns and cities in the short period
9970000	9972000	Of time
9972000	9974000	If he's taking his time and just doing it
9974000	9976000	Building day by day I could actually see
9976000	9978000	Something like that happening probably
9978000	9980000	Let me read this comment from JVmon in our chatroom
9980000	9982000	Saying I know Civ 3 stops scoring
9982000	9984000	Once you hit 2050 AD
9984000	9986000	But you can keep playing if you want
9986000	9988000	I think that's it
9988000	9990000	The game stops
9990000	9992000	Yeah I think that's exactly what it is
9992000	9994000	But I will say this and I know I'm going to get shit for this
9994000	9996000	Because he just said he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time
9996000	9998000	But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3
9998000	10000000	That one's the worst one in the whole series
10002000	10004000	I kind of agree
10004000	10006000	Especially the way that it's advanced
10006000	10008000	Over time
10008000	10010000	Yeah I can actually see that
10010000	10012000	But all the games
10012000	10014000	If you go back you're like wow
10014000	10016000	It's kind of cool though
10016000	10018000	It's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play
10018000	10020000	From the beginning and going through
10020000	10022000	And it's kind of cool like even you said yourself
10022000	10024000	When you're playing Mass Effect
10024000	10026000	Seeing the changes that have been done from part 1 to part 2
10026000	10028000	To part 3 to part 4
10028000	10030000	You know so on and so forth
10030000	10032000	It's kind of cool to see the
10032000	10034000	Transactions and seeing what happens
10034000	10036000	Throughout that time period
10036000	10038000	And to get their own
10038000	10040000	Their own thoughts and other people's thoughts
10040000	10042000	And theories behind it and putting it to work like that
10042000	10044000	If DarkSakura wanted to jump in here with a thought
10044000	10046000	And then we'll wrap things up
10046000	10048000	I was just going to use one of my grandmother's favorite quotes
10048000	10050000	To each their own said the blind woman
10050000	10052000	Said the blind woman as she kissed the cow
10054000	10056000	That is very true
10056000	10058000	Very very true
10058000	10060000	Alright XLink I got to let you go
10060000	10062000	Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners
10062000	10064000	Not really that I can think of at this time
10064000	10066000	I'm probably going to go back and play some Rift now
10066000	10068000	Alright good luck have fun with Rift
10068000	10070000	Yeah thanks appreciate it
10070000	10072000	I know him talking about MMOs and obviously I used to play
10072000	10074000	A lot of WoW with XLink
10074000	10076000	Until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding
10076000	10078000	But I was playing some of the beta
10078000	10080000	This week and I got to say the beta's
10080000	10082000	Come a long way and I was doing some panda
10082000	10084000	Tanking and it was actually quite fun
10084000	10086000	Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call
10086000	10088000	1877 game
10088000	10090000	1877
10090000	10092000	GameOLR or a username
10092000	10094000	On Skype Orange Lounge Radio
10094000	10096000	Meanwhile I got to get through some of these tweets
10096000	10098000	I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon
10098000	10100000	Who said shout out, I actually retweeted it
10100000	10102000	Shout out to OLR, long time
10102000	10104000	Fan from many moons ago
10104000	10106000	Rediscovered you recently
10106000	10108000	Now listening to you live with my fiance
10108000	10110000	Well thank you for tuning in
10110000	10112000	And I realize sometimes
10112000	10114000	People just don't have time
10114000	10116000	For OLR anymore or kind of fall out of
10116000	10118000	The habit of listening you know
10118000	10120000	It happens but it's really cool that you come back
10120000	10122000	At least you haven't fallen
10122000	10124000	Asleep during the damn show
10124000	10126000	I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft
10126000	10128000	Fair enough
10128000	10130000	Jim Sally sent a tweet that said
10130000	10132000	Hey guys can you tell me how to spend
10132000	10134000	You a tweet while you're live on air
10134000	10136000	I wish I could figure this out
10136000	10138000	You kids and your twittering
10138000	10140000	Well speaking of which, let's take this phone call
10140000	10142000	And see who might be there
10142000	10144000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10148000	10150000	Hey baby
10150000	10152000	How funny, I was just talking about you
10152000	10154000	Were your ears burning?
10154000	10156000	What did you say?
10156000	10158000	I was reading your tweet
10158000	10160000	I wrote a tweet to you? Oh yeah sorry about that
10160000	10162000	Or somebody hacked your account
10162000	10164000	No that was me, I was a little bit
10164000	10166000	Funny before and I thought I would tell that joke
10166000	10168000	Did you like it?
10168000	10170000	I did, I did
10170000	10172000	I was saying can you tell me how to spend a tweet
10172000	10174000	While you're live on the air
10174000	10176000	You kids and your twittering
10176000	10178000	You pretty much got
10178000	10180000	Twitter in a nutshell right there
10180000	10182000	Bad grammar and all
10182000	10184000	That's the Jim Salle way
10184000	10186000	That's the Jim Salle goy
10186000	10188000	I'm making my own English
10188000	10190000	I was just going to say to what do we owe
10190000	10192000	This great phone call tonight
10192000	10194000	I got you another little present like you asked
10194000	10196000	I'm the 500th person to like your
10196000	10198000	Facebook page
10198000	10200000	Get out, that's awesome
10200000	10202000	Thank you
10202000	10204000	I said how come I haven't done this yet
10204000	10206000	I felt a little ashamed
10206000	10208000	So I rectified my situation
10208000	10210000	Thank you for the support
10210000	10212000	What kind of prize should we give Jim Salle
10212000	10214000	For being the 500th fan
10214000	10216000	I think I should get 500
10216000	10218000	VOG points
10218000	10220000	Jamie has a prize?
10220000	10222000	Yeah
10224000	10226000	You got a round of applause
10226000	10228000	I was using my slow clap processor
10230000	10232000	So I'm not going to get the 500
10232000	10234000	VOG points
10234000	10236000	And hearts, you get hearts
10236000	10238000	And you have VOG points
10238000	10240000	Don't they go away at the end of the month
10240000	10242000	I think someone told me they go away at the end of the month
10242000	10244000	Sort of, the main leaderboard
10244000	10246000	Is monthly
10246000	10248000	But we are still going to keep track on a year
10248000	10250000	Basis, but that one is
10250000	10252000	Going to be a little more for fun
10252000	10254000	And let me tell you the reason behind that
10254000	10256000	We want, well just go back to the
10256000	10258000	Tweet earlier where somebody said
10258000	10260000	Hey I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while
10260000	10262000	But I recently rediscovered you guys
10262000	10264000	Well you know if somebody kind of comes into
10264000	10266000	VOG a little bit late
10266000	10268000	Then you know we are going to be adding more shows
10268000	10270000	To the network soon so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out
10270000	10272000	We don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up
10272000	10274000	Or they can't ever play the game
10274000	10276000	Because they are never going to be able to beat the score
10276000	10278000	So that's
10278000	10280000	We are going to reset the boards every month for that reason
10280000	10282000	So people have a chance to win
10282000	10284000	Every month
10284000	10286000	Listen Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG network
10286000	10288000	Knows they can't keep up with Jim Sally
10288000	10290000	So you might as well just give me the 500 points
10290000	10292000	First off, okay
10292000	10294000	Second off, it's father's day
10294000	10296000	You're a good dad, I'm a stay at home dad
10296000	10298000	I work hard every day, keep my baby girl
10298000	10300000	Clean and pretty and nice and put her in
10300000	10302000	Dresses and stuff
10302000	10304000	All I ask for at the end of the day is
10304000	10306000	Maybe some extra VOG points
10306000	10310000	And a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something
10310000	10312000	Alright, Jim Sally
10312000	10314000	Just because you call in to the shows
10314000	10316000	And you do show your support
10316000	10318000	I will see what we can do, no promises
10318000	10320000	You're the boss, you can do it
10320000	10322000	Here's the thing
10322000	10324000	Bobby did all the coding work
10324000	10326000	And he's very
10326000	10328000	Passionate about his game
10328000	10330000	I'll see what we can do
10330000	10332000	Come on, Bobby
10332000	10334000	Bobby, don't be a douche
10334000	10336000	Give me my 500 points
10336000	10338000	Listen, Bobby
10338000	10340000	Douche wolf
10340000	10342000	You're not going to win fans that way
10342000	10344000	Listen
10344000	10346000	This is not how you do it
10346000	10348000	You catch more flies with honey than vinegar
10348000	10350000	Listen Bobby
10350000	10352000	I don't care about honey or vinegar
10352000	10354000	I care about my VOG points
10354000	10356000	Act deaf, this Google plus loving mother fucker is ahead of me
10356000	10358000	And I won't have it
10358000	10360000	And I won't have it
10360000	10362000	I'll give him something to Google plus about
10362000	10364000	Jeez, I deserve those points
10364000	10366000	I work hard
10366000	10368000	I think without me, where would I be?
10368000	10370000	If anything
10370000	10372000	If anything
10372000	10374000	Listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points
10374000	10376000	Then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG network enough
10376000	10378000	Or too much
10378000	10380000	Or too much
10380000	10382000	Fine, I award you 500 points
10382000	10384000	For Gryffindor
10384000	10386000	For Gryffindor
10386000	10388000	What is it you were going to say, Rob?
10388000	10390000	It's a bummer the points aren't compatible
10390000	10392000	With each other
10392000	10394000	The conversion rates
10394000	10396000	You were looking at me funny
10396000	10398000	Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning
10398000	10400000	Very loudly
10400000	10402000	Oh, nothing
10402000	10404000	Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show
10404000	10406000	Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points
10406000	10408000	No
10408000	10410000	I'm just
10410000	10412000	I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now
10412000	10414000	Bobby, make it happen
10414000	10416000	Bobby, come on
10416000	10418000	A lot of people are
10418000	10420000	Alright, take care of Jim Sally
10420000	10422000	Have a good one
10422000	10424000	Thanks for the points, Bobby
10424000	10426000	Goodnight everybody
10426000	10428000	Bye
10428000	10430000	Alright, we got to close up the Skyline
10430000	10432000	I'm so sorry, I saw other people trying to get through
10432000	10434000	In fact, there was one caller I'd never seen before
10434000	10436000	That I really wanted to take
10436000	10438000	But it just didn't work out, I'm sorry
10438000	10440000	Email us, mailbagoutorangeloungeradio.com
10440000	10442000	I'm using Chigurh's suggestion
10442000	10444000	By the way, we've actually awarded you
10444000	10446000	The 500 points
10446000	10448000	But we're taking it away for ranting
10448000	10450000	No, we are doing no such thing
10450000	10452000	Bobby and I are already discussing
10452000	10454000	Something in secret
10454000	10456000	That's all we can say, it's in secret
10456000	10458000	A couple more tweets, I got to get some of Tigerclaw's tweets
10458000	10460000	I posted the best picture
10460000	10462000	In chat, by the way
10462000	10464000	Tigerclaw tweets
10464000	10466000	But I posted the best picture in chat
10466000	10468000	Of peekathulu
10468000	10470000	Tigerclaw sends us a tweet
10470000	10472000	Microsoft's first Android
10472000	10474000	Title, Connectimals
10474000	10476000	Remember Connectimals?
10476000	10478000	They're still around
10478000	10480000	Apparently it's the first Android game
10480000	10482000	That they've launched on Google Play's
10482000	10484000	Store, not to be confused with Google Plus
10484000	10486000	Which we were talking about earlier
10486000	10488000	It is out now, it's also on
10488000	10490000	iOS, just saying
10490000	10492000	$2.99 on Google Play for Android
10492000	10494000	A little tie-in there to the
10494000	10496000	Connect game that I know Loki's a big fan of
10496000	10498000	He gave me a big thumb
10498000	10500000	That was a gladiator moment
10500000	10502000	Right there with the big thumbs down
10502000	10504000	Alright, let me read
10504000	10506000	One more tweet here from Tigerclaw
10506000	10508000	PBS taking a look at
10508000	10510000	Modern 8-bit culture
10510000	10512000	That's really cool
10512000	10514000	The evolution of 8-bit art, I guess it's like a
10514000	10516000	PBS special that's going on there
10516000	10518000	That's talking about, I imagine it's got to be things like the
10518000	10520000	8-bit exhibit and all that stuff
10520000	10522000	Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff
10522000	10524000	That's pretty cool
10524000	10526000	Talking about some of the recent games like VVV
10526000	10528000	Mega Man 9 and some of that
10528000	10530000	Stuff that's really caught on, that's really cool
10530000	10532000	And murals and so forth, you know what?
10532000	10534000	It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods
10534000	10536000	And all that, so
10536000	10538000	I can totally see why it's in our
10538000	10540000	Popular culture and all that
10540000	10542000	Anyway, I gotta close up the tweeters
10542000	10544000	Close up the mailbag, close up
10544000	10546000	The phone because it is about closing
10546000	10548000	Time here at Orange Lounge
10548000	10550000	Radio, we gotta wrap up the show and say
10550000	10552000	Goodnight, I wanna check in with Loki
10552000	10554000	One more time to see if he has any other
10554000	10556000	Last minute stories
10556000	10558000	Alright, then we'll go around
10558000	10560000	And get everybody's final thought and wrap
10560000	10562000	Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk
10562000	10564000	About this, what is this that you brought?
10564000	10566000	The FP
10566000	10568000	It's basically
10568000	10570000	A movie where there's these two post
10570000	10572000	Apocalyptic gangs that compete
10572000	10574000	And fight each other
10574000	10576000	By playing DDR
10576000	10578000	Wasn't that in a Madonna video?
10578000	10580000	Hated it, no
10580000	10582000	It's really cheesy
10582000	10584000	I don't know
10584000	10586000	It's a screener ahead
10586000	10588000	I'll have to check that out at some point
10588000	10590000	Alright
10590000	10592000	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's
10592000	10594000	Final thought
10594000	10596000	My final thought tonight is
10596000	10598000	Dinner
10598000	10600000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
10600000	10602000	Picatulu
10602000	10604000	And Loki
10604000	10606000	Last but not least, your final thought tonight
10606000	10608000	My final thought is
10608000	10610000	This mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter
10610000	10612000	Zombie Playground looks too much
10612000	10614000	Like Pedobear
10614000	10616000	It's Pedo Raccoon
10616000	10618000	That is
10618000	10620000	Pedo Raccoon for sure
10620000	10622000	And Zombie Pedo Raccoon
10622000	10624000	But that is Pedo Raccoon
10624000	10626000	Fun!
10626000	10628000	Alright, hey before we
10628000	10630000	Close up shop here
10630000	10632000	I just want to say thank you guys very much
10632000	10634000	For tuning into Orange Lounge Radio
10634000	10636000	Thank you for your support over the past 9 years
10636000	10638000	And 51 weeks
10638000	10640000	All we ask, tell a friend or two about
10640000	10642000	Orange Lounge Radio, help spread the word
10642000	10644000	Hey, we got fans 499
10644000	10646000	And 500 tonight on Facebook
10646000	10648000	That's exactly what we're talking about
10648000	10650000	I know 500 was Jim Sally, I don't know where 499 came from
10650000	10652000	But thank you whoever that was
10652000	10654000	And whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio
10654000	10656000	Help us spread the word, word of mouth
10656000	10658000	And all that stuff especially
10658000	10660000	And as well
10660000	10662000	As you know from behind the scenes stuff
10662000	10664000	There will be easier and more ways
10664000	10666000	To spread that word soon enough
10666000	10668000	Uh huh, very true, very true
10668000	10670000	We've seen things
10670000	10672000	And also I want to say
10672000	10674000	Next week is
10674000	10676000	The 10 year anniversary
10676000	10678000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
10678000	10680000	Please help spread the word
10680000	10682000	Especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while
10682000	10684000	Such as the Twitter comment I read earlier
10684000	10686000	Just I would really love to hear
10686000	10688000	From the folks from OLR's past
10688000	10690000	The Skype line will be open
10690000	10692000	In about an hour after the show
10692000	10694000	To take your calls and messages
10694000	10696000	Uh if you have anything you want to leave
10696000	10698000	For us to play next week
10698000	10700000	I'm really looking forward to it
10700000	10702000	And um
10702000	10704000	I kind of can't believe it
10704000	10706000	That's why we haven't said much about it
10706000	10708000	We kind of can't believe it, it's been 10 years
10708000	10710000	Shit, we are old
10710000	10712000	It's our 10th anniversary
10712000	10714000	We'll be back next week to celebrate
10714000	10716000	10 years of Orange Lounge Radio
10716000	10718000	Until then, don't be a dick
10718000	10744000	Be safe, see you next time
10748000	10750000	See you next week
10778000	10780000	See you next time
