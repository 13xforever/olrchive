10026	12288	Sky, and Loki.
14049	15350	Tonight, June 17th, 2012.
16410	18732	Have new details leaked out on the next Xbox?
19132	22555	Rumors intensify that Star Wars The Old Republic may go free to play.
22955	25436	And did Nintendo withhold some big games from E3?
31553	38597	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38978	51866	Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network or the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com where we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
52026	53907	But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well.
54227	55588	and that's okay too.
56009	62835	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys.
63195	65838	First off, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66377	66897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
94574	96595	There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods.
96615	97416	What are you doing here?
98196	101018	And then there's the, oh, let me, go ahead of me.
101138	102658	Like the lady, I had like my salad.
102678	104539	She's like, why don't you check out ahead of me?
104820	105220	Go on.
105800	106541	Are you sure?
106921	107681	Yeah, go ahead.
107901	109322	I'm sure there's more people like that in the world.
109382	109682	Yeah.
110243	116606	So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods.
118300	121062	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
121223	121603	Hello.
121763	123084	Who is not at Whole Foods today.
124165	124305	No.
124746	125927	How are you doing, Loki?
126607	130330	I tend to like to buy my food in the whole form.
132232	133753	Is that like a Costco endorsement?
133773	134234	I'm not sure.
134574	137717	No, I'm just saying that I don't want half foods.
138077	138417	I see.
138498	139218	All right, I get it.
139238	139879	There's a joke there.
140319	144003	All right, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room.
144343	147586	If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com.
147606	151169	The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room.
151409	154332	And checking the comments in our chat room.
155513	156173	I'm not sure.
156213	156514	Let's see.
156594	159095	I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts.
159135	160435	I'm going to play Binding of Isaac.
160455	161776	You know, I checked out that game this week.
162696	165557	I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago.
165818	166778	That game's messed up.
166978	167278	It is.
167338	167939	It really is.
167979	169539	That's a disturbing little game.
169999	174701	And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy, but it's a very different kind of game.
175102	178703	It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it, but looks can be deceiving.
178743	182485	It's more like a twin stick shooter in Zelda's kind of box.
182505	184846	I wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks.
186080	186580	It may work.
186621	188361	You can do like a... It tells you.
188401	188741	It's weird.
188781	193344	When you go into the options, it tells you, use Joy2Pad to use whatever joystick.
194284	196385	And it even says, don't know what it is?
196805	197305	Google it.
197786	198486	Which I found funny.
198717	199778	I've just been using keyboard.
201459	202960	But I was just, I thought it was very strange.
202980	207904	Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo, which I might find treasure in.
207944	210306	And I was like, this is... The hell is this?
210366	213748	I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him, but I won't spoil it.
213909	214449	I won't spoil it.
214469	215910	This crazy mom.
216350	217531	Did you get any of the items?
217551	221334	Because one of the first items you get is mom's underpants.
221514	222115	And I was like...
222575	224196	I actually didn't get too far into it.
224216	225577	That's creeper right there.
225657	226678	Because I had Mass Effect.
228640	228960	All right.
229540	232683	Well, we are going to talk about our gaming weeks and all the games that we've been playing this week.
232743	237126	But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things at the top of the show here.
237186	244792	For one, if you were listening to Bobby, when he gave us a call there at the end of the show, he said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting.
244812	245532	And that's correct.
245552	248314	You know, next year, or next year, next week...
249255	251797	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
268982	279329	No, I know why we still do this, but it's interesting because a lot of shows, you know, I'm not, I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows because you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts and all that other stuff.
279649	281771	But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?
281911	286354	You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last, heck, two or three years even.
286914	288615	It's a milestone to get to one year.
289235	295099	What do you think has caused us to go for 10 whole years where other people don't make it?
296560	297801	We've set the bar really low.
300748	301508	That's true.
301849	304250	You know, we don't have a huge audience and that's okay.
304650	307271	You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show.
307311	309052	I mean, we were doing... That first show... You're doing better than 12.
309312	310013	I know.
310113	311533	The first show was for 12 people.
312014	313694	And for internet radio, that was huge.
314395	318517	You know, we were really excited to have 12 people who gave a shit enough to listen to us.
318537	319917	And that's the way it was for many years.
319957	320558	It wasn't really until...
321158	321718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
340906	354640	and now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts all over the iTunes market so it gets a little harder to stand out if you're not IGN or 1UP or one of the big deep-pocketed producers out there.
355080	361666	But I'm really happy with the following that we do have and it does seem like the folks that do show up and participate with our show every week...
362527	365671	are really the reason for me that kind of we keep doing this, you know?
366051	369975	There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week thanks to this show.
370475	373799	And it is a way for me to hang out with DarkSakura and Loki who are, you know, they're okay.
376702	377823	Jamie, what's... Were you talking?
378163	380185	Jamie, what's motivated you for the past 10 years?
383909	384530	She's thinking.
384887	387508	It was at my house for a while.
387628	389289	For a little bit, but not in the beginning.
389309	391069	Dan says he misses the show being at the house.
391129	391430	Does he?
391770	393090	That's actually kind of a nice compliment.
396011	396611	My ego.
397932	398392	Spite.
400253	402354	I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show.
402394	403634	You're not getting paid for it.
403654	404174	Bitch, please.
407068	407608	It's a hobby.
407688	408789	It's something you do for fun.
427638	436587	and even if they can't make it into the chat room live or catch the podcast later on, you know, I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason.
436688	438529	I'm doing it, I mean, I enjoy it.
438550	439030	Except your ego.
439370	440532	Well, except my ego, of course.
441292	442233	Make my ego grow.
443294	447439	But no, I just do it because I like attention.
447539	448860	I mean, because I like all of you.
449921	458972	That's why I kind of, I don't know, that's why, and I've talked a little bit about this, and I don't want to be very direct because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily, but I get a little...
460985	461586	We have integrity.
461606	462626	We really do.
486062	487163	You ask, we deliver.
487823	488823	Unless you're being bitches.
488983	490304	And then we'll tell you off.
490624	492745	Or Rob will have a hissy fit.
493965	495366	So, I don't know.
495966	497907	Yeah, it's certainly... Let me tell you this.
498147	500168	It's certainly not money that motivates us.
500208	500988	I'll tell you that much.
501048	501648	That's for sure.
502369	503849	We've had some generous people.
504990	507331	And we've had good things fall into our laps.
508531	513393	And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer, Ranma mostly, wasn't it?
514969	517392	It was a variety of people.
517432	524459	I don't want to give one person more credit than another, but that was a really great gesture.
524599	527703	I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep.
529385	530065	You know that too.
531267	532368	Oh, hi Shane!
533069	537411	By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network, I was a little slow in activating the check-in.
537471	539272	Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer.
539292	540853	I have to put a button to do it.
541113	545816	But you can now check into the show at live.vognetwork.com and get your points.
545836	546356	Sorry about that.
546796	547136	Slacker.
547156	548757	I just wanted you to wait for it.
548857	551959	He was busy playing that game on his iPad.
552059	552619	The pocket planes?
552659	553480	Pocket planes.
553860	555201	Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute.
555241	556641	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
556661	557782	Pokey plane, pokey plane.
558843	560644	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
560664	561244	We'll start with you.
562429	563730	I played Mass Effect.
564691	567773	And I played... I started a new guild.
568354	573517	So anyone who plays World of Warcraft, I made an all-Druid guild, so you have to be a Druid to be in it.
574538	576159	And it's called Druidia.
576560	581303	And if you don't get the joke, then I feel very, very sorry for you and probably a little old.
582424	598204	I was either going to name it that or Jewish Princesses or Order of Vespa so you should all get where that comes from and I played like a little Lotor but this week has really been kind of exhausting for me and next week is going to be exhausting as well
598744	603670	I've had some design work come onto my plate that I'm getting a little bit for.
603690	606934	I did a book cover.
607815	609758	I've been playing more games than usual, though.
610438	611900	I've played some Fractal.
612701	613923	I love freaking Fractal.
613963	615705	That game pisses me off and I love it for it.
616266	617387	It's like an abusive boyfriend.
618488	625037	So I was right that you are going to really like Mass Effect, even though you're on the first game, but it sounds like you'll play through the series.
625257	628581	Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me.
628621	630644	That was messed up, what you were telling me about that.
630684	635050	But like I was telling you in chat last night, I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in.
635770	640712	I'm still going to play it because I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head.
640732	643192	There's so many subplots about the various characters.
643533	647234	Not so much in one, I hate to say it, but when you get to two, there's a lot between two and three.
647254	648274	I'm looking forward to Miranda.
648734	649494	Miranda's great.
649514	650195	Miranda's hot.
650215	651135	Because that bitch is hot.
651255	652155	Miranda's hot.
652335	653296	Yeah.
653396	658017	If not for my overwhelming fandom of Garrus, I would totally romance that bitch.
658257	659417	You can't as a femme chef.
659437	659738	Sucks!
661258	663779	You can only les out with Liara, I think.
663980	664360	Ashley.
664880	667141	Ashley's a bitch and Liara's too skinny.
667321	670023	No, you can't be lesbianic with Ashley.
670803	671264	I don't think.
671424	672344	No, I'm pretty sure you can't.
672584	674105	You know what character I'm also looking forward to?
674725	674966	Jack.
675786	676666	Jack is awesome.
676947	677187	Yeah.
677947	678708	Yeah, it's a great story.
678728	680929	But she oddly made me think of my friend Gary's sister.
682029	682810	Just saying.
682930	684831	I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay.
685307	686428	But yeah, she was pretty cool.
686908	692993	Infanel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head.
693354	693874	That's true.
693894	694915	And you know what, DarkSakura?
695155	702461	By the time you get to 3, there's going to be that extra content that's the enriched ending, which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet.
702561	704623	It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles.
706444	707325	Like pop-up video?
707445	708086	Exactly.
708586	712029	See, this is what this meant, in case you didn't get it.
713568	716769	TigerClaw in chat says it's all about Miranda's assets.
717509	718889	Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass.
718989	721249	She is a nice war asset to have.
721430	722090	It's round.
722390	725830	It's round and plump and you just want to reach in the screen and get squished.
725890	727371	It's modeled after the voice actress.
727391	728871	Yeah.
728931	729711	You know who I love too?
729731	731771	Talk about genetic perfection.
731851	733032	Not that I'm into aliens.
733292	735312	I'm very secure in my homosexuality.
736092	740153	But if I were to get it on with a femme alien, Samara's kind of hot.
741331	741812	Just saying.
741912	744415	Even though her children are apparently fucked up.
744495	744795	Aha!
744935	746897	You haven't even played two yet and you know this.
746918	753405	No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki, the Mass Effect wiki, and it came up with whatever it is that they have.
753906	755367	And I know one of them's like addicted to...
757870	775546	and so I actually out of curiosity I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it with the crazy chick and of course dead so that was pretty funny and I also I've decided that if I play through it as a dude I'm totally going after Tali because she's just funny and cute
775866	778468	Oh, you've got... There's so much I want to say, but I can't.
778528	779129	Just keep playing.
779189	779529	Keep going.
779549	779849	Keep going.
780490	781771	Mass Effect Lounge Radio.
781811	785434	But it really... I can't believe I missed this series for so many years.
785534	787115	It's so flippin' good.
787775	787916	Ugh.
788196	788416	Anyway.
788676	794381	Well, at any rate, I've been averaging, like, a planet a play, if that makes sense, Rob.
795101	796822	So, like, I just...
797603	798324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
818546	840315	I should at least get to where I was probably by the end of the night one night when I'm playing so because I tend to you know play and chat with people at the same time so I multitask I multitask and Acidic Vampire asked me who my favorite character is so far in the first game and I mean Shepard's actually pretty pretty badass I dig her
840697	840877	Garry's
864330	864530	Yeah.
864670	868773	He's just so... He can be a dick and you love him.
868853	873435	He's like Thor, kind of, except, you know, not as thee and thou and wearing his mother's drapes.
873575	877357	I think all boys that play Mass Effect kind of want to bromance Garrus, too.
877557	880159	Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy.
881439	881820	That's it.
882080	886222	He can be kind of a jerk, but he's a good jerk and you like him.
886282	889624	He's just a nice jerky kind of... He's like your husband.
889664	890264	He's like Dan.
890304	891225	He's really like Dan.
892466	895968	And you just can't help but be charmed by his degrees of arrogance.
896508	912179	by the way I do I don't mean to veer off track too much but we are we are currently in the VOG Network clubhouse on Sony Home and if you want to log into PlayStation Home and search for VOG Network just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up VOG Network
912899	914579	I also really like Rex Rex is cuddly
937483	941066	He's just, I like the gruff sort of, you know, mercenary attitude.
941106	943228	I mean, I've always had a thing for that kind of character.
944609	948692	While I'm at it, okay, Liara is too talkative and she needs to shut up sometimes.
949513	953256	I mean, there's one thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they take things and run away with it.
953696	954377	Ashley's a bitch.
955177	957619	I thought I would like her, but she's really just kind of a bitch ho bag.
958560	967087	And I hate to say it, Caden is just too Mr. Generic Pretty Guy.
968359	968999	Get out of my house.
969579	970200	I'm sorry.
970260	971060	You know what I mean.
971540	973821	He's... I mean, maybe he'll get better.
974341	975521	I haven't used him that much.
976281	978522	And I really think that Tali is adorable.
978882	979843	She's just so cute.
980023	980243	All right.
980283	989466	I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat, but going to some of the comments from our chat room at vognetwork.com, TigerClaw says, Garrus is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad when he does bad things.
990106	991306	Not as much as Liara.
991366	993427	It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things.
993447	993767	All right.
994648	997650	Moving on, anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?
997690	1008176	I would not have Romance Rex, I'm sorry, but that's too much like doing it with, I can't even say with, like, Jabba the Hutt, sorry.
1009296	1010477	All right, Loki, how is your gaming?
1010537	1013959	I know you're not a Mass Effect addict, so you have something else going on, right?
1013979	1014639	Oh, thank God.
1014659	1021103	Let's turn in like a soap opera just talking about all the people that you would have sex with in Mass Effect.
1021457	1024480	So how many block people have you romanced in Minecraft?
1024700	1026462	There are no block people in Minecraft.
1026482	1029204	There's just blocks and farm animals.
1029364	1035050	How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?
1035310	1037592	None because I'm playing on peaceful.
1037712	1038413	Boring.
1038573	1039273	So there's none.
1039534	1042917	It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things sneak up on you.
1043537	1054385	So, I've been, uh, I tunneled from my original track, uh, that went from the one station to the next, to my volcanic lair now, and so I have that.
1054525	1056747	I love that you have an evil underground lair.
1057267	1061410	Oh, it's above ground, it's, you know, the tallest mountain in the... I thought it was in the volcano.
1061731	1062591	It is in the volcano.
1062631	1064072	Aren't a lot of evil lairs in volcanoes?
1064092	1066174	I swear that was in a James Bond movie, I swear.
1066633	1081253	It was also in Austin Powers That's true I was hollowing out the volcano to build more stuff Although I'm starting to wonder what the hell I'm supposed to fill this volcano with
1082874	1099385	I tried making a library, but apparently if the book shelves are too close to lava, even though the lava could be on the other side of a wall several layers away, it'll still catch those books on fire eventually.
1099845	1101466	So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap.
1101486	1104709	I need more materials to build my library.
1104749	1106330	Come back and the whole library burned down.
1106350	1108131	I'm like, ah, damn it.
1108740	1117424	Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories, but we are going to talk a little bit about some things that changed in Minecraft this week, and one of them is the removal of the duping bug.
1117785	1119225	How are you feeling about that, Loki?
1119385	1120446	I just haven't updated yet.
1121507	1121927	Never.
1122407	1123207	I'll never update.
1123227	1124028	No, I will update.
1124068	1125529	It's just, it's a little annoying.
1125549	1133353	This is how I built, like, a huge old storage facility now that I'm slowly filling stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring duping stuff.
1133413	1137855	Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version, they'll have creative mode in there, which I think...
1138155	1144099	Yeah, they're going to have create mode, but even technically that they patched out the duping, there's still ways for me to get stuff that I want.
1144139	1152786	They have a save file editor that you can edit what you have in your inventory, so I can still dupe that way if I want to, but it's just a pain to pull the save off and do this.
1153246	1177454	and I know they fixed the clay spawn rate and stuff so you can actually find clay now instead of it being like diamond searching for a diamond but even though diamond is a lot easier to find than this right now and you have to start a new world in order for all those update effects to take effect in your world so like if we respawn the VOG seed or whatever it would actually have different things in it
1177854	1179815	and they're going to do the same thing again with Pistons.
1179875	1187079	So right now I'm just going to stick with this world and I'm not going to bother starting a new one just to get more clay because I don't really want clay.
1187740	1188800	I think I'm going to start over.
1189040	1190902	I need to do some work in Peaceful.
1190942	1196645	That's what was slowing me down before was that I was too... I could not get to stuff because of the stupid...
1197045	1198466	and Creepers and all that stuff.
1198506	1202389	And I realize that's kind of part of the fun of the game, but I would like to just do peaceful.
1202849	1209374	And then once I have my underground lair built, I will turn on the monsters, make it the point to go out and destroy them all.
1209861	1210341	Thanks for watching!
1229659	1231980	So I played that stuff.
1233381	1234262	What else did I do?
1237043	1239505	I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 a little bit.
1239525	1241306	We played a little bit of the System Link stuff.
1241926	1245028	Still wish I had some more maps to play because a lot of them are really big.
1245128	1253532	Whereas the first game, Modern Warfare, just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small that we could actually play on and it wasn't such a big deal.
1253552	1255574	There was only a couple that were too big.
1256074	1257455	And now it's like the reverse problem.
1258355	1261700	Um, so hopefully there will be some more maps that we can check out.
1262241	1264443	Hopefully for free, because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody.
1265064	1273355	And then, um, I was going to play Gravity Rush, but I... What the fuck?
1274036	1274116	Uh...
1275524	1275904	I don't know.
1276264	1277965	Home is interesting.
1278005	1279026	That's all I can really say.
1279326	1283048	Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says, it gets hard.
1283848	1284808	Get your minds out of the gutter.
1286289	1287690	It's a big piece of wood.
1289030	1289791	I'm not helping, am I?
1289811	1290111	Really?
1290311	1291852	That says, it gets hard.
1291912	1292312	Is it smooth?
1292432	1295854	There's a lot of these double entendres in Sony Home.
1296074	1298535	Dirty ass people who play Home, like me.
1299917	1301298	I've been good this weekend.
1301338	1303220	I have not played any Minecraft this weekend.
1303280	1304941	I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that.
1305201	1307123	Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that.
1308224	1311367	I did not play any Minecraft today or yesterday.
1313168	1314830	Anything else for your gaming week?
1314870	1315150	That's it.
1316135	1317256	Not a lot for me to report.
1317296	1319037	I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects.
1319077	1322399	As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer still kind of consumes.
1322519	1326742	I finally got the Vortex Sentinel, who's awesome.
1327402	1333446	I considered buying Mass Effect 3 on PC just so I could play with Alan, who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC.
1333867	1335068	But now I'm not going to be able to.
1335188	1337189	Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real.
1337229	1338630	We think it's the power supply.
1339751	1343053	He was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours yesterday.
1343733	1347056	and finally there was just this loud... It was during Under Sedation Live when I was listening.
1347236	1350538	There's just loud... And then... Damn it, I forgot your game.
1350558	1350979	I'm sorry.
1351019	1351959	I know, I was gonna ask about that.
1351999	1352760	Just come to my house.
1353541	1354321	Come to my house next week.
1354441	1354781	We'll see.
1355442	1359025	Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway, so maybe... Anyway, off-air discussion.
1359785	1360266	Where was I?
1360346	1361206	Damn it, you threw me off.
1362067	1362648	Oh, Mass Effect.
1362668	1369674	So, Alan's computer broke, so the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC, I ended up having to buy a power supply for Alan's computer.
1369734	1373217	So, you know, maybe in the future.
1374218	1378041	But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect as Renegade on Xbox 360.
1379602	1383023	Other stuff I have been playing that's non-Mass Effect.
1383143	1387344	I checked out a little more of Sony PlayStation Home this week thanks to the VOG Clubhouse.
1387784	1390365	It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more.
1391225	1392526	There's positives and negatives.
1392606	1396527	Positives is there's a whole lot more it seems like to do in Home now.
1396887	1399848	A lot more of these mini games that are pretty well-rounded.
1399868	1402808	I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house.
1402848	1404049	You can just walk up to it and play it.
1404069	1405149	It's called Cluster Puck.
1405589	1407433	There's all those double entendres again, right?
1407774	1412944	Which is kind of a, I don't know, it's like Tetris Attack meets...
1415109	1415489	I don't know.
1415989	1422232	There's this weird mechanic where you can actually move pieces up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling.
1422252	1426733	And once you attach it to another piece, it becomes part of the big block that you're moving.
1426753	1430715	And then when they all fall down, if you have three in a row, they go away.
1430855	1432155	It was weird, but I liked it.
1432195	1434036	It was a pretty cool kind of different little puzzle game.
1434316	1436096	And you unlock dumb little rewards for it.
1436677	1438577	I was checking out Sony's E3 booth.
1438897	1443139	I checked out some type of, what is it, Midway thing, but...
1443699	1449582	They won 99 cents for 50 tickets to actually play the games, and it's all a contest.
1449622	1451624	And I was like, eh, I don't think I want to do that.
1452124	1455646	My only real complaint about Home is that some of it's really slow.
1456086	1458988	And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer a lot.
1459068	1463110	Like, you know, if it's your first time in Home, you have to download everything.
1463150	1464371	It kind of takes a little while.
1464391	1466192	And I like to think I have a fast connection.
1466692	1471075	That's really the only thing that really bums me out, though, is that Home is kind of...
1471855	1480000	Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something that you could launch other games from and it was going to be literally home?
1480840	1482301	You wouldn't go into your crossbar.
1482341	1484622	You'd go into home and kind of do everything from there.
1484903	1485723	It's too slow.
1485943	1488184	You could never do anything like that.
1489105	1493868	It's like a computer from the 1980s that takes two and a half minutes to boot sometimes.
1494828	1500830	I mean, when it loads and when you have things, you know, cached, if you've loaded all the areas or whatever, it's pretty cool.
1501250	1504992	You know, once you get in there, like once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse and all that, it's pretty cool.
1505052	1508073	But moving seamlessly is a little rough still.
1508853	1510154	But I do like, they've really expanded.
1510174	1518096	Like if you haven't checked out Home since it first launched three years ago, there's like a million more things in there now and tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters.
1518136	1518797	That's pretty cool.
1519297	1519737	I like that.
1520937	1524299	And multiple theaters dedicated to the Twilight trailer.
1525459	1525879	Oh, really?
1526339	1527420	No, I'm just making shit up.
1527840	1529901	I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home.
1529921	1530741	Is it a Sony movie?
1530781	1531401	I don't know.
1531781	1535403	When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out, you better believe they do stuff like that in Home.
1536994	1542357	Oh, by the way, Rob, before I forget, actually there's one more game that I'm playing.
1543677	1546038	I'm doing the Mass Effect 3.
1547819	1550400	That's like a Facebook game, yeah.
1550460	1552681	Yeah, but I'm already preparing for Mass Effect 3.
1552741	1553742	There you go.
1553782	1554342	You're committed.
1554822	1562806	I've also been playing an iOS game and it's Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game from the makers of Tiny Tower where now you fly planes.
1563186	1564547	Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?
1566389	1566649	Right?
1567490	1571071	No, Pocket Planes is not a rip-off of Dream Heights.
1571211	1572852	I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though.
1574413	1579535	But yes, you buy airports, you buy planes, and you ship people and cargo between them.
1579916	1582457	Exact same artist assets from Tiny Tower.
1582777	1586038	Although, obviously, they had to go in and draw planes and clouds and, you know, things.
1586239	1588260	But it's like the same style, the same universe.
1588320	1592341	I kind of like that they have the two very different kind of games yet in the same universe.
1592642	1595263	I've heard from some people, though, that don't care for Pocket Planes because it's like...
1595683	1599046	It's not as easy to get as Tiny Tower was.
1599166	1600827	Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get.
1601088	1609655	Pocket Planes is a little, like, because not only do you have to manage the airports, you have to manage the planes, so you're not just managing a tower, you're kind of having to juggle two things.
1609995	1615139	There's a lot more places to sink money as well, and there's Twitter integration and all this.
1615499	1623346	The one reason why NimbleBits games do so well, though, is that you really do get the full experience for free, and it doesn't nag you ever about buying things.
1623726	1624126	DarkSakura.com
1643300	1646761	We do have a whole little flight team or was it flight squad?
1646961	1647382	Flight team?
1647402	1647822	Something like that.
1648222	1659206	It's just VOG if you put in as the tag and you can see how you're doing in the world events with folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf and whoever else on the network is playing the pocket planes.
1659726	1660887	Alright, that's it for my gaming week.
1660907	1662767	I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever.
1663748	1664288	Let's move on.
1666135	1668556	Let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1668936	1670156	I'll quickly say housekeeping.
1670536	1675717	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1676157	1685019	One more reminder, we are going to get a notice out there, so hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this, but our 10-year anniversary special is next week.
1685499	1688500	I do know we're going to have some guests that are rarely at, we don't,
1688860	1689480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1712396	1714016	at vognetwork.com.
1715157	1717857	Maybe there'll be some special piece of loot in it for you.
1717977	1719037	Can't say too much, but maybe.
1720838	1724419	It will be on the podcast feed, though, if you absolutely have another commitment Sunday nights.
1724459	1725779	Of course, it'll be on the podcast feed.
1725819	1727059	We would just love to see you live.
1727099	1727579	Cancel them.
1728540	1729200	Cancel them for us.
1730380	1735221	We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time, and...
1735921	1741364	After tonight's show, if you want to leave a message for the 10-year anniversary show, you can do that.
1741424	1743005	And you can do that through Friday.
1743305	1746547	And I'll have more information up on Twitter and Facebook after the show.
1746827	1747908	But that will be open.
1748188	1750989	We encourage our fellow podcasters to call, our fans to call.
1751350	1757553	My only suggestion, because we are anticipating there will be a handful, I mean, not to be all ego, but we know a lot of people have been asking.
1758173	1759214	We are anticipating a lot.
1759514	1761575	So try to keep your messages brief.
1761795	1763916	If you ramble on for five minutes, I can't play it.
1764196	1765377	We're not going to have the time next week.
1765417	1768279	But if you make it 30 seconds, it's a lot more likely to get on air.
1768599	1771400	So we're going to be taking those throughout the coming week.
1772441	1774662	Again, more details on Twitter and Facebook after the show tonight.
1775302	1777003	All right, now we can get into some gaming news.
1777103	1778404	Loki, start us off tonight, please.
1778743	1784365	Okay, so there's some more details regarding the Wii U. Some of the programming stuff.
1784785	1797610	First off, they have infrastructure in place to allow free-to-play games, which is kind of interesting when you think about it because they've made many comments in the past about how they didn't like the fact that some of the games on the iOS platform and stuff like that
1797910	1800113	We're too cheap and devaluing everything else.
1800573	1808843	But apparently they said that we've designed a system from a technical standpoint to allow developers to freely take advantage of things like free-to-play and microtransactions.
1809864	1811026	So that's kind of nice.
1811106	1813048	We'll see some of that stuff coming that way.
1813749	1815151	And of course they're saying, you know...
1817393	1830908	Currently, they're not actively looking to enter the free-to-play market for their first-party content, but they are making it available for anybody else that may want to make a free-to-play game.
1831088	1833330	Just, you know, Nintendo's not going to do that.
1835152	1836273	And then, of course, there's...
1838717	1839617	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1857802	1867988	They're not saying exactly how, just saying that friends codes, they're going to be there, but not the existing friend code system.
1868048	1876874	You'll be able to identify people as friends and have a certain level of interaction versus different level of interaction for more general population.
1877834	1878115	So...
1880080	1883664	I don't know, was that like the Google Groups or something like that?
1883744	1885666	Where you can do that with Google Plus or something?
1886206	1891011	Who knows, but it's still kind of annoying that you have to do that, but whatever.
1891812	1898078	And then of course they also said that the system will allow achievements in games, however it's not mandatory.
1898678	1901441	So some games will have achievements and some may not.
1903034	1927139	I just get this feeling from reading some of this stuff that it's like Nintendo's putting a lot of this stuff that they have available for other platforms right now, like achievements or trophies and some of this other different online playstiff, and they have this available for third parties, but Nintendo themselves aren't really taking advantage of it.
1927299	1927699	It's like...
1928819	1939427	Oh yeah, we're just going to kind of do things the way we have been doing them and we're not really going to do a lot of this online stuff or, you know, have achievements and things like that.
1939447	1941509	I mean, it'd be nice if they did, but I don't know.
1942189	1946132	I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be kind of doing all this new fancy stuff.
1946152	1948694	They're just going to be, you know, repeating what they've done before.
1949275	1952657	Translation, we don't like to do what everybody else does.
1952697	1953918	We're going to do our thing.
1954599	1956080	If everyone jumped off the bridge with you...
1957847	1958287	Perhaps.
1959708	1960468	How high is the bridge?
1964410	1967131	What do you think, though, about that achievement part not being mandatory?
1967191	1972454	I find that kind of interesting because it seems like the makers of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want.
1973154	1979217	I mean, some might kind of make it in parity with whatever's on 360 and Steam and so forth, but others may just decide not to do it.
1979237	1984860	That kind of reminds me of Steam, though, because Steam has that kind of thing where some games do have achievements and some don't.
1985380	1987041	I don't think it's necessarily a deal-breaker.
1987061	1990424	It is kind of disappointing that there's not going to be achievements along there.
1990844	2002271	I mean, for me, it seems like, eh, we don't really want to do that, but I know you guys want to, so we're going to go ahead and allow you to do it, but we're not going to do it.
2002432	2006875	I mean, it just kind of seems like they're just taking the easy way out for a lot of this stuff.
2006895	2008936	Have they straight up said that Pikmin's not going to have them?
2009887	2010007	Weird.
2010027	2010408	It's too hard!
2010428	2010949	So, you know,
2026371	2026711	I don't know.
2028892	2031133	We'll get to that later, but it's just stupid.
2031274	2033615	Do you think they could land some big free-to-play games?
2033775	2041239	You know, I don't know, thinking of Steam and so forth, like, I don't know, well, DC Universe is a Sony game, so no, but maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?
2041759	2041979	You know?
2042678	2069018	it's good that they have that infrastructure in place so they could possibly do that and also it'd be nice to see if they have more of an MMO type thing in place I'd imagine if it's free to play with microtransactions I wouldn't see it being too difficult for them to have microtransactions for subscription models and stuff like that but it's nice to have the options there but at the same time I just kind of wish there was a little bit of a parity between everything that they're doing
2071656	2077343	BlackWolf in our chatroom says certain Nintendo things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza but suck too
2080472	2081573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2103530	2107173	So, of course, Nintendo was asked to comment on this whole situation.
2107253	2112597	How does Nintendo intend to differentiate between what Microsoft's doing with smart glass and what Nintendo's doing?
2112637	2125127	And essentially, according to Satoru Iwata, who was interviewed here, he said that basically it boils down to the fact that the controls on the tablet devices often suck.
2126508	2128730	That sounds like a challenge.
2155524	2162446	You can't play a game in a way you can play with the Wii U. And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website.
2162486	2164826	You can check that out in that interview.
2165026	2166787	That's also officially full of shit.
2167207	2167527	Really?
2167727	2169207	Yes, I mean, because let's see here.
2170447	2181190	What they're describing is basically saying, oh, well, you know, because the Wii U tablet has, you know, the buttons and stuff like that, you can play games using that that you can't play regularly.
2181250	2181370	But
2181850	2182471	Thanks for watching!
2202609	2202949	DarkSakura.com
2226812	2234297	Now, along similar lines here, since we are talking about smart glass, I think it's worth bringing up that the official Xbox Live app on iOS was updated.
2234357	2238581	And yes, there is a Microsoft Xbox app on iOS, officially by Microsoft.
2238601	2239461	My Xbox Live.
2239521	2240082	Yep.
2240322	2242463	It was updated this week, and it was a very big update.
2242563	2246887	And it's starting to show little hints of smart glass features in it.
2247227	2251910	Now, this feature only works on the phone for some reason and not on the iPad, which I found a little strange.
2251990	2252911	But what you can do with it...
2253191	2253671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2274640	2276041	It's nothing really that great.
2276121	2280405	It's kind of a pain to set up because you have to do it each and every time, so it's not like a big time-saving thing.
2280985	2286149	But it's certainly showing hints of what's to come, what they're trying to do with this whole second screen technology.
2286410	2290713	It's a little weird that it's not on the iPad yet, but it is available definitely on the iPhone.
2291774	2292855	And that's up now.
2293055	2293856	You can download that now.
2293876	2300221	The other thing you could argue, though, with Nintendo is I don't have to buy another system to be able to have this technology or whatever.
2301061	2308326	I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet, but at the same time, like I said last week, I'm just worried we're going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff.
2308506	2312969	Not necessarily... First off, I literally think we're going to get DS stuff.
2312989	2314951	I think they're going to do Virtual Console with the DS.
2315411	2315671	Duh.
2316452	2317352	It's got the same setup.
2317873	2319314	So we're going to see that eventually.
2320695	2322556	Literally, it's just going to be using...
2324037	2327720	The second screen for just crap that you would have like in a start menu or something.
2327740	2334925	Because there was a lot of games on the DS that just necessarily didn't really need that second screen.
2335005	2339288	But it was there, so they used it for like, you know, here's a map or, you know...
2340629	2340869	DarkSakura
2370137	2373519	Let's switch on to the Xbox thing.
2373919	2377121	And not under the name of The Lube, unfortunately.
2377381	2379942	Because that would have been awesome.
2380082	2382584	There is a document leak about an...
2383618	2383838	We're done.
2400600	2412469	Well, at any rate, there was a 56-page document that was leaked for what was listed as the Xbox 720, which I'm pretty sure that's not going to be the final name.
2413289	2417172	The picture that looks kind of like a squishy Dreamcast, so I think that's funny.
2418233	2425818	But it was talking about having new things like a Metro dashboard, Xbox TV apps, smart glass, of course.
2426779	2426859	Um...
2428220	2444594	and then it was you know really do you remember Rob that E3 when they announced the 360 and all the stuff they wanted it to do and how they wanted it to be a big hub it looks like they're still trying to keep that hub thing going on with the new one
2445074	2459062	But it's also supposed to have Blu-ray support, native 3D output and glasses, concurrent apps, peripheral support sensors, additional sensors, sorry.
2459782	2465145	And this says something about a Kinect 2, and that they're debating whether or not to use 6 or 8 ARM or the...
2469640	2475882	They're really pretty much debating processors, debating memory, debating the cores.
2476942	2483043	But they're basically trying to make it be the be-all, end-all of anything that you should have in your living room.
2483563	2488865	They're putting a price point on it of $299 with a projected 10-year life cycle.
2489485	2492205	And they think that they'll sell more than 100 million units.
2492405	2493386	And it's supposed to be out in 2013.
2495226	2501408	The one thing on here that I think is kind of neat is what they're calling Project Fortaleza, I guess.
2501888	2506109	The Kinect glasses, where basically it's kind of like a VR thing.
2506509	2510550	You can actually see all those lasers that the Kinect is actually firing out.
2510610	2513211	If you saw some of those early videos, what was it, infrared?
2513531	2517172	If you actually look at the Kinect in infrared, it's like, oh my god, my room's full of lasers.
2518419	2533227	Well, the thing that I think is kind of cool about this is that it's supposed to be like an in-person interactivity kind of thing, which I don't know if you've got to have like a decent living room or if it's adjustable or whatever the crap.
2534187	2534407	But...
2535848	2541291	It makes me think of a kind of augmented reality kind of thing, which honestly I think is fully possible.
2541431	2562084	I don't know if you saw, for anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr, which is, I'll post it later, but on my Tumblr I posted a link about these new lenses that are full-on display that basically will project an image directly to the retina.
2563885	2572491	And, you know, they're using it as, oh, enhancing poor eyesight and portable television that you can watch, you know, with your eyes closed pretty much.
2573292	2577295	And I'm thinking that if they've gone that far, that this is simple.
2577595	2579576	This would be simple technology in comparison.
2581658	2585160	Also, the document that was leaked was removed.
2586641	2612016	um so even if they're saying oh no that's not true um it was removed at the request of Covington and Burlington LLP the international law firm that Microsoft has hired hmm the plot thickens oh and by the way those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014 Loki I know you've been following this news story as well what do you think do you think it's fanboy wank or do you think it's the real deal
2612372	2616653	Well, I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down, so there's something in it.
2616873	2618314	Basically, it's two years old.
2620575	2626016	The document is not exactly brand new, but a lot of stuff, it's interesting.
2627797	2633859	I don't know how much, I mean, it's all speculation and all their stuff that they're just kind of talking about and thinking about.
2633879	2638380	It's not necessarily their step-by-step plan of how they're going to do everything.
2639301	2663100	I did think it's interesting though that how they're talking about acquiring like on live and that one of the things that they're gonna incorporate later on like in 2015 or something after the console would launch would be you know that you would never need another console again it would just any time that you would need to upgrade the games and it can't the platform can't handle it it's just streamed I don't know if that's necessarily gonna work but
2663460	2669926	But, you know, a better Kinect is something obviously that we would expect and, you know, more processing power.
2670506	2672207	The glass thing looks weird.
2672227	2674709	It's kind of like that project glass that Google did.
2675470	2676791	And it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
2676951	2678132	I think that's important to say too.
2678172	2681795	Just because they're talking about this two years ago doesn't mean it's actually going to happen.
2681815	2683937	I mean, look at something like the Wii Vitality Sensor.
2684618	2688100	I mean, that even came out on the E3 stage and suddenly disappeared.
2688481	2691203	You know, it doesn't mean the glasses thing will happen.
2691996	2692556	She was like, butta.
2714361	2720405	Well, no, it's because one time she tried to sue a company or her lawyers sued a company that published a picture of her house.
2720865	2727969	Well, nobody, like four people in the world saw the picture of that house, two of them being the lawyers, until she sued the company.
2728289	2731151	Then millions of people saw the picture of her house.
2731611	2739656	So I think there's a little bit of that going on here because the Microsoft lawyers, by taking down the document, have somewhat proven that there's legitimacy to it.
2739696	2739916	Because
2740516	2743599	Microsoft could have come out and said, oh, that thing is a bunch of crap.
2743819	2747782	And maybe it wasn't crap, but nobody would have been any wiser.
2747822	2751225	No, if they just said, oh, it's crap and then...
2752805	2757406	However, I don't think it's a deep within Microsoft document.
2757766	2762367	It didn't look professional enough to be something that was done deep within Microsoft.
2762527	2765327	I think this thing leaked out of some type of affiliate arrangement.
2765648	2767948	I think a third party company put this thing together.
2768648	2772609	I don't think it is like directly Microsoft necessarily.
2772649	2774989	But I think where there's smoke, there's fire.
2775429	2778270	And I think there's definitely some hot stuff in this document.
2779225	2784051	or perhaps it was a quote leak if you know what I mean.
2785093	2791421	Basically, get it out there long enough for the news centers to catch up on it, yank it, make it look official.
2792883	2793063	Hmm.
2794142	2804512	I also think that, I mean, if it was like a hype-generating stunt or something, I just don't really think it would generate... It's not really generating hype because it's just all very speculative stuff.
2804532	2809757	It's a badly timed one, too, especially if Microsoft's supposed to be announcing a new tablet on Monday, as all the rumors say.
2810117	2814181	You know, doing something like that between E3 and a new tablet is kind of dumb.
2814982	2815402	So I...
2816343	2816643	I don't know.
2817343	2821005	There's too much coincidence in here for this to not be real.
2821445	2823486	And I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing.
2823546	2827247	I think the depth of that document would have been a lot to whip up.
2827327	2831349	I mean, somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one on the internet if that's the case.
2832169	2843253	So again, I think there's some legitimacy to this, but I don't think everything in here should be accepted as fact because A, the age, B, ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light.
2845479	2847341	That's basically what it boils down to.
2847361	2849382	That's what good brainstorming is regardless.
2849683	2849883	True.
2849983	2851824	You throw out the idea, you see if it's possible.
2853946	2867077	And if the whole thing is some dumb underground marketing ploy viral thing, then maybe Microsoft's trying to get feedback on the glasses thing, but I just think this is a dumb way to do it, if that's the case.
2867177	2869919	If you put out anything, the internet will respond to it.
2870540	2871360	It's a guarantee.
2872461	2878143	And if it's something big like Microsoft, anything attached to Microsoft, the internet is definitely going to give some feedback.
2878503	2879363	But let me just put it this way.
2879383	2886386	If they're going to come to the table with something like that in two years' time, that's not good for Nintendo.
2886686	2889867	Because Nintendo, they're not bringing a whole lot to the table right now.
2889907	2892588	They're bringing like, hey, look, we can use the tablet with our system.
2893128	2894669	And it's basically a Wii that does HD.
2895109	2895749	That's not...
2897249	2924716	this opens up a lot of possibilities of how you can make games and other applications and stuff but I don't know we'll see it's just especially since they're talking about these glasses or whatever not launching with the system I don't know probably need to see either way going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com not a whole lot of comments on this story a lot of people still commenting about DS and tech specifications and all this stuff but TigerClaw says smart glass how about dumb glass
2925811	2926371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2949537	2952078	Very few people go that extra mile to use it.
2952178	2952738	Let's be real.
2953639	2956280	Some of you do, especially for movies that you love.
2956360	2958061	That's a given, but very few people do it.
2958161	2967424	And it's not necessarily that this is something that's not possible right now before this update because EA games have been doing this with Mass Effect and stuff.
2967444	2968845	They'll have stuff that ties in with that.
2969205	2971186	Hell, you can even do with Call of Duty Elite.
2971206	2978329	You can get the app for that on your Android or iOS devices and you can tweak shit on there before you play the game.
2980009	3007857	so they have this kind of stuff available already and it's not that like that doesn't sell a game tip for me I mean if you know oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet I'm not gonna go oh I gotta get Madden now I mean it doesn't seem like it's something that's really gonna sell me on games I love this DC Nate in our chat room says an alternate screen for your console Dreamcast sheds another tear it was just it further proves that thing was just ahead of its time well and
3010740	3015833	Nintendo kind of already had that going on with that connection to the...
3017765	3018526	Crystal Chronicles.
3018586	3022768	We'll just call it the Crystal Chronicles because that and Four Swords were the only games that really used it.
3022788	3023168	Pac-Man.
3024409	3026050	And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific.
3026511	3030293	But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals, five games used it and then it disappeared.
3034035	3035136	Like their LAN adapter?
3036337	3038118	One game used it and then it disappeared.
3038318	3042801	And then a bunch of people hacked it so Mario Kart or the Warp Pipe or whatever it was.
3043854	3046076	Well, that was over the internet stuff.
3046096	3048559	I'm talking about using the actual LAN adapter.
3048619	3050661	I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter.
3050922	3054385	Maybe online, but as far as LAN system is concerned.
3054505	3055186	You're right, you're right.
3056027	3062053	All right, let's move on so we can get to the classic game of the week and release dates and all that good stuff.
3062073	3063255	But first, some more news stories.
3063295	3063535	Loki.
3063846	3081417	Alright, so there's some hoo-ha, I guess, about UDRAW, and basically a Georgia law firm is investigating THQ to see if they misled their investors about the demand for the UDRAW tablet.
3081497	3088261	Honestly, I thought it was a really cool idea, so I could see where they could think that the demand would be really high, and then it wasn't.
3088901	3114038	um and also you know i wonder if that a lot of that kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying that i think at one time nintendo was going to make a few um games or whatever that would support it and hell let's just get on the topic of the wii u here why wasn't mario paint one of the launch titles for this system i mean that seems like a perfect title for the wii u just saying um
3116212	3123756	But yeah, they're still checking them out and making sure that there wasn't any false and misleading statements about its progress.
3124516	3133121	I want to say that this is not the first franchise that they were kind of supposedly misleading people on.
3133141	3135662	I want to say maybe UFC or something.
3135682	3137984	I don't know.
3138664	3139204	Interesting.
3139745	3143987	I know those Udraw tablets, they still have a ton of them sitting around and they're going for dirt cheap.
3146331	3150453	Hmm, THQ's been in a company that's had some rough times lately, too.
3150533	3152934	This is a fascinating story to me.
3154134	3166599	What is, like, I mean, could it be that they just said, okay, I understand that they're saying the demand's high, and so what if they believe the demand, they literally believe that the demand is going to be high for it, and it just flops?
3166699	3168860	I mean, is that misleading your investors?
3169300	3174502	I mean, I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate with how much the demand is, but what if it's just like...
3175342	3176884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3196499	3200443	Well, it was that MMO never coming out too that really didn't do well for them.
3200583	3209152	I mean, I always have a problem when you have a device that requires a special peripheral because now you're locked in the buying games that require that peripheral.
3209312	3214657	And if it's not something that's widely used by a bunch of different companies, because it was only THQ that was putting out stuff for it.
3214978	3218661	I mean, they had licenses for like SpongeBob and Disney Princess stuff and all that.
3218982	3219102	But...
3219742	3220142	Outro Music
3241129	3244252	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom theorizes perhaps Mario Paint's coming later.
3244873	3246354	It might just be one of their apps.
3246614	3246914	I don't know.
3247335	3249176	I kind of think Nintendo's over Mario Paint.
3249677	3252439	Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago.
3253040	3253881	It still should.
3255525	3259567	Oh my gosh, what if I don't want to post it publicly?
3259587	3261427	What if I just want to send her a private penis?
3261587	3261807	Oh, well...
3283438	3290064	Private P and I are the best I don't know how deep the moderation goes Are they that deep?
3290204	3297950	I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too How long before penises are being sent all over the Wii U network?
3298070	3305096	Instantly There's no doubt about it The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination?
3305156	3311561	Check out what I do with my Wii U You're listening to Orange Penis Radio Someone will see that penis and it will be the moderator
3311821	3316463	The moderator will come home after the first day like, I have seen so much penis today.
3316904	3318745	I feel like I'm working in the porn industry.
3319285	3321686	Oh, Lord, dry up this river of penis.
3325028	3325968	I knew you would get that one.
3326088	3336954	Well, you know what's funny is that, and I don't remember if we talked about this on the show or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody after the fact, so I apologize if I'm not crediting the right person with this, but somebody was theorizing.
3336994	3338075	I think maybe it was on Facebook.
3338875	3343058	that Nintendo's probably going to hire an outsource company to do all this moderation.
3343958	3355965	So you're going to have this huge call center-esque thing filled with people in either the Philippines or India, and these poor people are going to see penises all day long.
3362316	3363838	It won't be done in Redmond.
3382857	3396065	and, like, Rob keeps dying at this one spot and goes, oh, this is so hard, and I can tell him, quit whining, you fucking pansy, you know, and should be able to have that little thing pop up, you know, over World 3-1 or something like that.
3398146	3399487	Why should that all be censored?
3399928	3401048	You're censoring my fun.
3401528	3402669	No one wants to censor my fun.
3403069	3407892	I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers and all of a sudden, boop, you have a message.
3408072	3408913	Oh, open up the message.
3409133	3409673	Penis!
3411434	3412115	Oh my god!
3414019	3414479	or Tits.
3414980	3421844	They should totally have it in New Super Mario Bros.
3421984	3424526	U where you can draw on the background of the levels.
3424706	3428089	You should be able to just stop and sketch something on the levels.
3429249	3434413	Alpha Cananagram in chat says, Sky, Mario Paint on the DS was Wario Do It Yourself.
3435802	3457181	I forgot about that that was Nintendo we don't want to fucking make a game you make it yourself the game or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me let's see the chat room is wondering where Pen15 is tonight this would be a perfect conversation for him but sadly not here alright anyhow anything else you want to say about Penis or I'm sorry this news story that's it
3457819	3466202	Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U. Apparently, some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo didn't show their big game at E3.
3466602	3472304	After all, Destiny wasn't shown on the Xbox, so maybe something was held back a little bit.
3472765	3478307	And this is because of a tweet that game trailers editor-in-chief Shane Satterfield said.
3479087	3481348	Apparently, he said before E3...
3482228	3503943	That the Wii U launch lineup was looking pretty damn good Well if that's the case, and he's probably the only one that was thinking that But it came out later, he went on Twitter and said, quote Just realized that a Wii U game I knew about well before E3 was never announced at the show I know of one I'm guessing there's others to come as well Oh really?
3504444	3506085	Yeah Care to share?
3506685	3507626	Well, sure.
3507846	3508247	Why not?
3508347	3508667	All right.
3508707	3519837	Because this got me into a topic on Twitter earlier this week that revealed to me what I believe is the actual launch date for the Wii U, which would be November 18th.
3519857	3522019	I have to check my date.
3522279	3522840	It's a Sunday.
3523280	3523660	Of course.
3523900	3524241	Of course.
3524461	3526082	That way you can camp out Saturday, right?
3526102	3527563	Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sunday.
3527583	3529725	Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays.
3529765	3530546	And I don't know why.
3530586	3532067	They're just obsessed with fucking Sundays.
3532567	3534008	So, yes, November 18th.
3534549	3538532	Now, remember before I said, well, the 13th is going to be out.
3538552	3542615	The 13th or before because there was a game that was dated for the 13th.
3543056	3544397	Well, there's other games dated for the 20th.
3544517	3546278	It makes sense.
3546298	3549361	You know, just like the Vita launch, there was stuff that was out the week before.
3549841	3551801	Could it just be a really good guest placeholder?
3551841	3558823	Because honestly, if I were to make an educated guess, the weekend before Thanksgiving, yeah, it's kind of in line with the way they usually do it.
3558843	3561143	But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays.
3562823	3563123	Okay.
3563363	3578706	And the game in question would be from Disney, and it's their big game, which would be Epic Mickey 2, which has not been announced yet for the Wii U, and I don't know when it will be announced, but it's coming.
3579646	3584532	So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup that they didn't talk about at all.
3585453	3593361	WhatupG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rumor has it Nintendo is going to show Retro's game, which of course still is nowhere to be seen.
3594102	3595363	Maybe it's the F-Zero game?
3596084	3598066	Dream, dream, dream, fanboy, wank, wank, wank?
3600879	3601519	It would be cool.
3601859	3603800	I mean... Alright.
3603980	3604260	I don't know.
3604600	3605101	But, yeah.
3605161	3608902	I mean, so... That's, you know, one.
3609262	3612524	And I know that there was one I saw for Transformers.
3612964	3613844	The new Transformers Prime.
3614564	3615485	People don't really care about that.
3615665	3615885	Whatever.
3615905	3616905	But, I mean, Epic Mickey, too.
3616925	3621027	That's a pretty big fucking title not to mention at all.
3621387	3623308	I mean, unless they're worried that it's not going to be out at launch.
3623628	3623808	But...
3626612	3629193	I have things that say otherwise.
3630334	3630694	All right.
3631214	3638697	Well, right alongside that, a story came out that Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U third-party games are yet to be announced.
3639077	3643439	And that's a quote from David Yarrington, who's the head of Nintendo's UK division.
3644199	3646640	Apparently, this was in Nintendo Gamer Magazine.
3646680	3654623	It said, quote, I think a lot of third-party companies are developing for Wii U, and a lot of it hasn't been announced, but we can't comment on speculation.
3654643	3654923	There has been.
3655003	3657285	There are lots of things everybody wishes for.
3657846	3660428	Call of Duty is another one that's confirmed.
3661529	3663431	But they haven't announced it yet.
3665252	3667414	And they also haven't announced it for the Wii yet either.
3667594	3669276	So that comes usually later.
3669396	3669996	What does this mean?
3670016	3673279	Nintendo's waiting for their Tokyo Game Show concurrent event?
3673299	3676402	Because they don't do Tokyo Game Show, but they usually do a big event.
3676922	3705155	they may be announcing more stuff there I think it's just the way that these companies are they don't announce that far out ahead sometimes like Call of Duty every year it seems to be it's always going to be Playstation 3, Xbox 360, PC announced and then later on like last year it was at their live Call of Duty event in LA that they announced the Wii version and then also DS and there was the you know the Elite stuff and the
3707346	3708647	Special Editions and stuff like that.
3708667	3711609	None of that stuff's been announced yet.
3712329	3714511	Reality check, the system's out in five months.
3714931	3718573	Assuming it's out in November, which is obviously a safe bet, that's five months from now.
3719674	3723377	It's not a whole lot of time to finish up the games if you don't already know you're doing it.
3724865	3725686	It's interesting.
3725806	3728688	I mean, maybe there'll be something closer to the end of summer.
3728748	3729749	When is Tokyo Game Show, though?
3729829	3730309	October?
3730569	3731070	September.
3731810	3732371	Oh, it's September?
3732671	3732951	Usually.
3733371	3736654	Maybe two months is enough lead time, but one month definitely isn't.
3737074	3745760	But a lot of these games, I mean, I don't see them talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo Game Show because that's not really a title skewed towards the Japanese market.
3746120	3751164	WhatUpG in our chatroom says, EA says they will announce a couple of games at Gamescom for Wii U.
3752389	3753570	FIFA, probably.
3754330	3760634	I don't know about NBA Live, but FIFA, I think, is for sure on the Wii U. Which Gamescom would be the place to announce that, too.
3760654	3766137	Yeah, I think they've already said FIFA was going to be on the Wii U. Madden is on the Wii U, I believe.
3766297	3767577	I think that's already been announced.
3768078	3769298	AkumaJP is in our chat.
3769358	3772840	He lives in Japan and has gone to Tokyo Game Show and confirms it's September.
3773200	3773500	My bad.
3773520	3774761	I thought it was October for some reason.
3775822	3776082	Still.
3778372	3779053	I mean, I don't know.
3780675	3783539	Yeah, I definitely agree there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet.
3785721	3788084	I mean, for sure, there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet.
3788745	3793431	But I don't know everything that's not been announced.
3793711	3794012	I don't know.
3794312	3804858	I know that one, and I know that has a firm date on it because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff, and there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before and the week after, so it seems to fit.
3806379	3809181	And like I said, they're delaying the game.
3809461	3811282	I don't know if that's even made it out yet.
3811422	3814804	The game is not coming out in September anymore, obviously, on all the other platforms.
3815304	3820067	It's been confirmed, I know, for Europe, but they have not announced North America yet, but that is also going to be delayed.
3820427	3821568	Europe, it's coming out on the 20th.
3822048	3824410	So if you think about it, the console is probably not going to launch.
3824791	3831296	I mean, it's going to launch at the same time roughly in all regions, but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday like they did with the Wii.
3831676	3834698	Wii launched on a Sunday, I believe, if I remember correctly.
3834838	3835239	Yeah, it did.
3835739	3842524	I remember we went out really late at night and we were doing the whole, we gave orange soda and donuts and coffee or something.
3842765	3847008	Remember we were going out and Breslau was here and everything and the lesbians, we all went out.
3847594	3849956	Well, I think it was just me and Kristen.
3850056	3853679	We were at the... Yeah, Extifer was at Target with you guys, wasn't he?
3854780	3855281	Yeah, Extifer.
3855301	3856382	For a little bit.
3856462	3858123	No, Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me.
3859104	3859824	Not at that Target.
3859865	3862006	We were at the... Oh, you guys went somewhere else.
3862026	3862727	Citrus Heights Target.
3863087	3863808	Yeah, so was Extifer.
3864668	3869571	I don't remember him being there with us because we were just sitting there exchanging fanfiction and stuff.
3869611	3872493	Trust me, I had a Wii the day it came out because Xtifer camped out for it.
3872533	3873234	He was at that Target.
3874474	3875455	It was a long time ago.
3875495	3877436	I really don't remember seeing him then.
3877516	3878477	It was a long time ago.
3878497	3880578	Because we would have been hanging out with him.
3880778	3884501	Yeah, because remember we went to Winco, I believe, and something got orange soda.
3885512	3888635	No, all we did was go to Krispy Kreme and get donuts and coffee.
3888756	3889777	Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
3890237	3891979	I only stayed out until about 2 a.m.
3891999	3893381	and then I was like, fuck it, I'm going home.
3893401	3894262	I'm not staying out for that.
3895743	3898887	All right, one more story for you guys, then we're going to travel around the world and look at release dates.
3898927	3900488	But first, Dark Sakura has a story for us.
3901569	3902430	I do, don't I?
3902890	3907373	Well, how about a game that we've brought up on the show before, Draw Something.
3908494	3908934	Over it.
3910055	3910836	I like it.
3911476	3918701	At any rate, it's kind of funny that just as soon as Zynga purchased OMG Pop, people stopped playing it.
3919982	3924025	They dropped something like 10... Never mind.
3924825	3930850	They lost 10 million monthly active users in 30 days.
3932171	3939636	But anyway, they might be doing a TV show with CBS that's kind of along the lines of what Win, Lose, or Draw was.
3940557	3942579	Well, they have that host with the awesome hair.
3942619	3943199	What was his name?
3943299	3943980	Burt something?
3944440	3946021	Not Burt Reynolds, but Burt something else.
3946542	3947943	I don't remember.
3947963	3948863	Oh, man.
3950144	3950345	But...
3952621	3975821	But in the meantime, while that's still in the talks, they're thinking about bringing it out in more languages, including Chinese Well, I mean, if they have a successful TV show based off of it, it would certainly justify some of that extremely high price I have decided that Draw Something would be much easier if I had an iPad
3976761	3981664	Oh hey, this says a complete episode of Win, Lose, or Draw available here.
3982065	3983326	Complete with commercials!
3988409	3990090	I love stuff like this on YouTube.
3990190	3990871	That's amazing.
3991871	3992812	It's a Coke commercial.
3992872	3996575	Wait, let me... Let me fast forward here.
3996675	3997015	Here we go.
3997175	3998036	There's Win, Lose, or Draw.
4000898	4001638	Burt Condie!
4001758	4004220	Yeah, and they all sit on the floor and play.
4007338	4008520	This show is awesome.
4008560	4009781	Dude, that's Alan Thicke.
4015088	4016350	That hair.
4019574	4021156	What ever happened to Lonnie Anderson?
4021697	4022178	Let's find out.
4029909	4031790	Look, I could do this all night, but we better not.
4031910	4035713	Oh, it says right here in the description, Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds, and Alan Thicke.
4037114	4041416	I hope they have awesome B-list celebrities on Draw Something TV.
4041476	4042917	That would be the only reason to watch.
4043898	4045099	Oh my God.
4045199	4045479	What?
4045979	4049141	She just is still kind of plasticky looking.
4049221	4051983	Well, Lonnie Anderson's got to be like 65 at least.
4052023	4052704	She was born in 45, so yeah.
4053533	4062398	I wonder if they'll have people drawing really elaborate pictures to something simple, like Darth Vader holding a cup and it's a cup.
4065319	4066780	She's on her fourth marriage.
4067040	4070082	A sitting vampire in our chatroom says, bring back old game shows.
4070482	4072083	Supermarket sweep, please.
4073544	4074324	Hell yes.
4074404	4076946	The last movie she was in was A Night at the Roxbury.
4077850	4079210	Well, you know what they need to do.
4079330	4080310	So here's the trick.
4080350	4097173	If you want to bring Supermarket Sweep back, you've got to write a new app for iOS that mimics the old game show and throwing hams into a cart and brewing the coffee for a bonus $200 and those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup that were the bonus prizes.
4097613	4100614	And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show out of your iOS game.
4100734	4102514	Here's the last two shows she was on.
4102594	4102934	All right.
4103174	4104595	Was one called The Mullets.
4105415	4105515	Wow.
4105535	4106935	And then So Notorious.
4108044	4110705	Oh god, that was the Tori Spelling Show.
4112125	4113546	Actually, that show was really good.
4115286	4115847	Don't judge me.
4116067	4116787	Do not judge me.
4116827	4117487	You're judging me.
4119108	4119988	I am judging you.
4122049	4123849	You just said, I of judgment, almost.
4124249	4125750	I said, I am judging you.
4126610	4127330	Release dates.
4127350	4135013	Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U. That statement doesn't require extra garbage to play a card game.
4136224	4142990	So coming out actually tomorrow, Pokemon Conquest on the DS.
4143170	4147133	It crosses Nobunaga's Ambition and Pokemon.
4147934	4150957	Because that really needed to be crossed.
4151798	4153199	Some people are looking forward to it.
4154574	4168092	Disney Pixar's Brave the video game on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii and DS Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii 3DS DS Vita and PC
4170948	4176997	and Steel Battalion Heavy Armor, a game that's going to really suck using the Kinect.
4178439	4179901	So that is also coming out.
4180622	4183587	Oh, and I re-released the Quake 4 because now Bethesda is releasing it.
4186036	4205400	of course of course I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering we better not have another power outage before part A finishes here I watch way too much Supernatural I'd rather have the power outage today than next week okay yeah right don't jinx it I'm not jinxing it I don't know what we're next week we're gonna need to have like a moratorium on power in this place because I don't want to blow a fuse
4206000	4215983	Anyhow, going to Japan and looking at release dates over there, we have on the Nintendo 3DS, Hello Kitty!
4216003	4227226	From Compile, who I am pissed Compile is around, and instead of doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making Hello Kitty games.
4228075	4229457	Yeah, get with it, Compile.
4230137	4231679	You know what your people want.
4231979	4233221	Wouldn't it be hilarious?
4233561	4236064	Rare announces, or was it not Rare?
4236164	4242891	Retro Studios announces Guardian Legend Cross F-Zero, the racing action shooter game.
4242911	4244353	I would jizz.
4244393	4245534	I'm not even going to hold back.
4247511	4248351	That's what would happen.
4249612	4254275	Let's see, nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear Solid collection coming out next week in Japan.
4254315	4255456	That's not this week, sorry to say.
4256156	4257037	How about the PlayStation 3?
4257157	4260038	There's some stuff from Sega this week.
4260198	4260899	K-On!
4261359	4263640	Hokago Live HD version.
4264261	4268843	Mass Effect 2 gets a Best Hits version, and I think that's the version that comes with all the DLC.
4269364	4271585	I wonder if that's localized with voice acting for Japan.
4271605	4272185	That's pretty cool.
4273286	4276008	I'd like to play a copy of that just, you know, because it's fun and different.
4276669	4288957	Sniper Ghost Warrior comes out as well, and Shutsugeki Otometachi no Senju 2 comes out from System Soft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game we have over here.
4289017	4289718	I don't think it is.
4290879	4292300	That's not something I recognize.
4292920	4293561	Lol, no.
4295202	4299285	I was looking to see if, yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts, Japanese, I wonder if it's,
4301274	4302395	I want to see some dialogue.
4303556	4303976	Maybe not.
4304076	4305437	Hey, this is kind of cool, actually.
4305697	4305898	What?
4306018	4307879	Something SSJ100Matt said in chat.
4308179	4308499	What's that?
4308700	4313023	I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release days on Sundays.
4313463	4317266	Apparently, back in the Super NES days, they would release games during the week in Japan.
4317686	4321709	When games were released during the week, people would skip work and school to buy and play games.
4322090	4327734	Apparently, the Japanese government requested Nintendo change their release dates to the weekend so there's no lost productivity.
4329015	4329615	Interesting.
4329836	4330016	Yeah.
4331530	4332652	And knowing is half the battle
4343291	4345292	Well, for the UK, not a whole bunch.
4345352	4346773	It's a really short list.
4348774	4352436	On the 20th, Magic the Gathering, Duel of the Planewalkers 2013.
4353497	4355838	On the 21st, Mutant Muds on 3DS.
4357059	4361361	And let's see, on the 22nd, Civ V, Gods and Kings.
4362762	4364543	And Steel Battalion, Heavy Armor.
4364623	4365424	And that's it until the 25th.
4365444	4365844	So, nope.
4367265	4367485	Nope.
4369204	4398097	nothing well I mean nothing I guess really good unless you're a big Civ fan I guess that would apply to you Rob but you're not in the UK so how about well the good news is it's out here and it's out next week or I think it came out this week I need to check yeah I gotta plan an epic Civ 5 night with some friends but like literally that's an all day all night event so it'll be sometime in July yep well so how about moving on to another story
4400822	4401663	All right, we can do that.
4401683	4403344	Because I'm out of stuff for the UK.
4403565	4404105	That's really it.
4404425	4414295	Let's talk about Star Wars and how, you know, something that they announced during E3 that Star Wars, the older public, is going to be free to, well, not really free to play, but you can play for free up to level 15.
4415696	4421301	And, you know, people are wondering, are they actually just testing the market with this?
4421321	4421802	Yeah.
4422542	4442840	and apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case, they're saying that because before they lost 400,000 subscribers, and it's probably going to get worse once the new World of Warcraft expansion comes out, but they're saying if it was just free-to-play games and they weren't very good, it wouldn't even be a question, but
4443200	4446421	There are definitely good games out there and good games coming out.
4446561	4451282	So, of course, all of this competition impacts your plan and with what you want to do.
4451882	4454823	So, it's interesting.
4455443	4458504	Also, the other interesting thing is this article got pulled as well.
4460105	4467747	But maybe they are going to go all the way and make it free play, especially if it's just not panning out like they were hoping.
4468103	4468804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4485646	4486266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4502498	4503238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4521072	4521813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4540796	4567373	Star Wars wasn't didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff to me I mean certainly there were some things inspired by WoW but there was a lot that kind of tied into the other Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth there was a lot it was a good single-player game that's for sure and I think that's what happened a lot of people played to 50 and then that was kind of it you know I think that ended up being part of the problem they invested so much in the single player with all the voice acting and everything but
4567893	4570156	I kind of think that might have been one of the big mistakes.
4570316	4572659	Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much of the voice acting.
4572739	4579927	I mean, yes, it really adds a great deep element and immersion into the game, but I think that was a resource that could have been better spent somewhere else.
4582310	4583211	Like more servers.
4583891	4584792	Well, not even that.
4584832	4585974	They didn't need more servers.
4586621	4587122	Star Trek Online
4607512	4608913	Zachary Quinto did some, right?
4608933	4613154	Yes, as the EMH, the emergency medical hologram for the first mission.
4614055	4616536	And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything.
4616956	4620558	You don't have people saying, hey, give me money or anything.
4620938	4623719	Yeah, and WOW has very limited voice acting.
4623979	4625479	Yeah.
4626020	4630421	But they've managed to get dedicated voice actors for their main people.
4630501	4630761	True.
4630941	4637543	I have to say, even What's-His-Face, Metzen, does half of everybody, including Thrall.
4638803	4643844	But I think their best voice actor, though, is the lady that does Sylvanas.
4644164	4645825	Because, oh my god, that just chills.
4645885	4646065	Anyway.
4646425	4654467	But anyway, so they put the money into making sure there's one dedicated server that can handle everybody that's on it.
4654548	4655908	You've got your beta test server.
4656568	4660149	And as far as the voices go, they didn't license any music.
4660269	4661750	It's really kind of limited.
4662170	4666211	But you don't care once you're playing it because the game itself is in-depth.
4666431	4668532	And I think that's where you're getting into the difference.
4669352	4676296	Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week, and it has to do with Ubisoft, or as a lot of people have been calling them since last week, Boobisoft.
4677116	4679277	Boobisoft is apparently talking to Warner Bros.
4679337	4683219	and Paramount for a movie dealing with Splinter Cell.
4684139	4686761	This is according to a report from Deadline.
4687021	4688602	Ubisoft is in talks with Warner Bros.
4688662	4690983	and Paramount over a film tie-in.
4691403	4693985	It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow.
4694065	4697428	It could also follow a new kind of story set in the same universe.
4698168	4703712	However, it is worth pointing out there have also been in the past deals on Uncharted and Bioshock.
4704313	4705694	Nothing's happened yet.
4706234	4709817	So just because they're talking about it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it.
4710317	4718464	Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft has also registered some domains in regards to their new IP Watch Dogs.
4718864	4726711	Remember, that was the big game they showed at the end of their press conference that made a lot of people pay attention, and some said kind of stole the show away from the big companies.
4727392	4733737	They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie, Watch Dogs The Movie, Watch-Dogs The Movie, and so forth.
4734618	4737200	This could mean that there's plans or talks about a movie
4737680	4742222	I also kind of think this could just be protection of the intellectual property.
4742902	4743703	Just to make sure.
4744363	4747304	Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or whatever or something.
4747384	4750025	And maybe because the game looks so good, it could be a movie.
4750425	4754047	Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it for one when they start seeing the commercials on TV.
4755067	4759329	I don't think you necessarily want to read into this that they're absolutely making a movie because of this.
4759369	4761490	This could just be trying to protect something.
4761790	4782739	It's the same reason why we registered thevognetwork.com Because so many hosts were calling it the VOG Network Kind of a similar thing Alright, let's go back to a time when games were simpler And they weren't making movies out of every single stinking game In fact, the only game that got a movie was Super Mario Bros.
4782859	4783280	And it sucked
4789278	4790278	It's the classic game of the week.
4791178	4796159	And since it's not the classic video game of the week, screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game.
4797240	4799120	It doesn't say classic video game of the week.
4799180	4799860	She's got a point.
4800380	4802220	This is in my house, too.
4803461	4808282	It is Twilight Zone that was done by Bally Midway.
4808402	4809302	That's Mortal Kombat.
4816835	4824998	Anyway, it was designed by Pat Lawler, who is one of the all-time best pinball table designers.
4825178	4827159	Let me go over his list just real quick.
4827719	4830280	He did Earthshaker and Whirlwind.
4830641	4833982	He did Funhaus, where you got to hit that ugly guy in the head a bunch of times.
4834622	4835823	He did Addams Family.
4836923	4837963	He did Safecracker.
4838864	4845746	With Stern, he did Rollercoaster Tycoon, Ripley's Believe It or Not, NASCAR, Family Guy, CSI, and Shrek.
4846387	4850228	I mean, this guy is, he's done some of the best tables out there.
4852449	4852889	DarkSakura.com
4873982	4874402	Shut up.
4875323	4875523	Shut up.
4896029	4896950	I knew you were going to do that.
4897330	4911097	It has a working analog clock that has a timer for different modes, a power field, which is basically like right on top of the left hand side of the thing.
4911457	4917605	Basically, instead of using flippers, you're using magnets to play the ball through this little mini field.
4918126	4926877	And the Powerball, where you use a white ceramic ball that's lighter and it's given that it's not magnetic, it's not affected by the magnets in the table.
4928298	4933500	It also uses the original theme from the Twilight Zone.
4934080	4942444	And it also uses... I don't know who likes their early 80s rock, but it uses the song Twilight Zone by Golden Earring.
4944064	4950427	And it actually has a really good vocal likeness.
4950467	4953088	Tim Kittrow did the voice of Rod Serling.
4953328	4953468	So...
4954868	4962974	Um, it was supposed to be the first game to use the Williams Midway DCS sound system, but it was still being developed.
4963134	4967818	Um, so it used the Yamaha YM2151 Harris CVSD soundboard.
4968879	4975344	Um, and it is considered right now the top rated electronic pinball table of its time.
4977526	4982451	As far as little fun stuff that's in there, and I'm just going to read through the list on here.
4982531	4987315	It has the door from the opening credits right in the center of the playfield.
4987876	4991399	You have the mannequin, the zodiac clock from the very beginning.
4992620	4997063	It has an image of Henry Burness from the episode Time Enough At Last.
4997843	5004147	It's next to the slot machine, the hitchhiker, the slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover.
5004807	5009530	You have the most unusual camera, which is actually a pretty good episode.
5009550	5014532	The invader, static, the piano of the house has the player piano from that.
5015133	5016974	You have Talky Tina from The Living Doll.
5017748	5019089	Here's your extra ball!
5019489	5020549	I know, it's pretty cool.
5020689	5023750	They need the Tower of Terror, where your balls just drop.
5025571	5041777	Robbie the Robot is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center at Whipple's, is on the playfield and in an animation, and different sound effects like the Serling voiceovers, and my favorite one, which we heard right at the beginning, you unlock this door with the key of imagination.
5042757	5045218	May I present a most unusual camera.
5045778	5046918	You know, that type of stuff.
5048619	5063524	But you have different door panel modes where one is like 10 million points, the light the gumball, the town square madness, fast lock, super skill shot, the super slot, the extra ball, the camera.
5063984	5066205	The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game.
5066325	5074268	There's also the spiral, clock millions, battle the power, greed, which actually is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family.
5074528	5075068	Greed
5102921	5103522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5124102	5128583	Where if you light all of the door panels, you get a doorknob with a question mark.
5129064	5135045	And it pops open and you have 45 seconds to make an unlimited number of shots to all the targets.
5135546	5140427	Basically every playable single ball mode is active during this time period.
5140947	5143308	So it's basically 45 seconds of three for all.
5145829	5146149	And then...
5148510	5152274	And most of the machines, though, you have your standard multiball with three being released.
5152714	5154976	There's all kinds of custom mods that people have done.
5156618	5161122	Like one person added in the Robbie the Robot toy into their machine.
5161803	5167148	There's other design mods like the third play field magnet, the gumball flashers, the gumballs.
5167188	5170391	We actually, I think, added an LED into ours, I want to say.
5173013	5175214	We have a Gumball Flasher that's an independent mod.
5176915	5180558	Different colors, different things you can add in.
5181078	5182779	People mod their stuff all the way.
5182839	5184780	Now here's the cool stuff.
5184940	5187822	You can play Twilight Zone anytime you want to.
5188602	5190744	It's a licensed table for the Pinball Arcade.
5191224	5199249	It's out on Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3, PS Vita, and it's supposed to be out for the 3DS, Windows, and Mac OS.
5200589	5227767	and so it kind of is a game like a like a console game well and for anyone who still uses VPN which is basically how we played it for the longest time in my house you can play it on Windows I think there's also a version of pin name and pin name for for Linux I want to say so there you go that's the game it's a Twilight Zone are you lost in the zone do you unlock this door with the key of imagination
5228700	5237782	There it is, Twilight Zone, the pinball game, but now accessible thanks to the wonders of emulation on the 360 and PlayStation Network and iPhone and all that good stuff.
5238542	5238922	There it is.
5240062	5240722	Neat choice.
5241123	5242363	Something a little bit outside the box.
5242423	5242823	I like it.
5243643	5246784	So, we are going to take a quick break, but there's plenty more OLR to come.
5246904	5247464	Don't miss it.
5247524	5255365	We have the Fugle Question of the Week, some rapid-fire news coming your way, and of course, the mailbag and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5255505	5257746	All when we come back after a quick break with more...
5258266	5259968	of Orange Lounge Radio.
5286004	5287426	has his kid, Josh.
5288348	5291252	I see a lot of pictures that the missus has been putting up on Facebook.
5291272	5291713	Very cute.
5291733	5293436	He was playing with another kid today, it looks like.
5293896	5294517	Or the other day.
5294537	5294878	I don't know.
5294918	5296961	I just saw the picture today or the video.
5297262	5297482	Yeah.
5297903	5298383	Still pretty cool.
5298403	5299525	He has the cutest hair.
5300286	5301288	And of course... He has haircut.
5301588	5303570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5320786	5321327	There you go.
5322388	5326973	Clover Nikon in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I am a gamer uncle.
5327313	5327713	You know what?
5327734	5328254	Close enough.
5328955	5332138	I would still say that's a fatherly figure in somebody's life.
5332599	5333199	So there you go.
5333339	5334480	I have a picture of Maruko.
5334501	5335141	I'm going to post it.
5335401	5335642	Awesome.
5335702	5336783	Over to orangelaunchradio.com.
5337003	5339064	Yeah, it's kind of a squinty picture.
5339284	5339644	That's all right.
5339684	5351209	While you're checking out the pictures of the kitties at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, don't forget to swing by VOGNetwork.com because if you are participating live with the show, you can check in and get your points and maybe, just maybe, get some loot.
5351269	5352709	Again, that's VOGNetwork.com.
5353029	5357611	If you're a podcast listener, sorry, can't check into the show yet.
5358551	5359732	That's all I'll say about that.
5360316	5366864	Oh, by the way, I think I should post a picture of the kitty cats kissing outside of your... Oh, the strays out in the neighborhood?
5366884	5367124	The strays.
5367144	5368225	Yeah, that was cute.
5369487	5369607	So...
5370290	5375354	Alright, we are going to get back into some gaming news here with Rapid Fire News.
5376094	5379857	I do want to put out a last call for any tweets you guys want us to talk about tonight.
5380197	5385741	I'm going to get to the Fugle Question of the Week in a minute here too, and I think DarkSakura is on her way to opening up the mailbag, so we don't have a lot of time left there.
5386062	5387283	But let's do some Rapid Fire News.
5387343	5387583	Loki.
5388544	5391666	Sorry, I was looking up US Open results.
5392226	5393387	Since when were you a tennis fan?
5393687	5394447	It's not golf.
5396448	5397068	I'm stupid.
5398209	5399029	Well, no, fair enough.
5399049	5401430	The US Open is also tennis.
5402190	5409974	No, but my grandpa watches it a lot, and we went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue and stuff, and he was watching it.
5410854	5420044	There's this amateur 17-year-old guy who was just out shooting Tiger Woods, which I thought was hilarious, and I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods.
5420084	5426512	Tiger Woods ended up three over par for the three-day course, and I didn't see where he... I don't remember the guy's name, so... Anyways, sorry.
5427152	5427753	It's all right.
5427873	5428754	Totally derailing everything.
5429114	5430196	So let's talk Journey.
5430696	5431017	Journey...
5432478	5433399	Don't stop.
5433539	5433959	Not that journey.
5433979	5434479	Believe.
5434559	5434960	Damn it.
5435280	5436261	The journey was pretty awesome.
5436381	5443285	And of course, the developer, that game company, is now going to go and self-publish their next game.
5444526	5452771	And they've got $5.5 million of capital from Benchmark Capital's Mitch Lasky.
5453852	5459275	And they're going to try to publish their game on multiple platforms, possibly PC.
5459295	5460336	Yeah.
5461932	5467654	And I guess they haven't announced which platform the game is going to be on, but I'm sure it'll be awesome.
5468334	5480177	Also should note that one thing that hasn't been mentioned yet, but I kind of hinted at it on Twitter as well, that Sony will be releasing on PlayStation 3 a Journey compilation.
5480298	5487580	Now, there's only one Journey game, so it leads me to believe that it's Journey, Flower, and Flow on this.
5489040	5492721	Sadly, not the 80s game starring the Superband, although that would be awesome.
5492982	5496743	But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey on top of that.
5496783	5507287	You can throw in the music in there as well, because that's both... Well, it's funny to me, though, that Flower and all that is good, but the Journey... Okay, why would you release this disc?
5507367	5510488	Because people can't go online to download it, or they're not connected.
5510528	5515850	But if you play Journey without being connected, you're not really playing Journey.
5515970	5516890	That's the problem.
5517816	5519417	You're not taking the true Journey.
5519917	5522238	You're like backseat driver.
5525440	5525760	I don't know.
5526161	5526601	Yeah, I know.
5527621	5529042	It's a cash grab, which is fine.
5529082	5539508	I mean, Journey still is a fantastic game, but if you're playing it and not being online, then I think you kind of missed the point, and that's where the other games like Flower and stuff become a little better.
5539528	5543190	And that's where Journey really needs to be on the Vita because that would be amazing.
5544050	5547212	I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best racing games I've ever played.
5548493	5548853	Think about it.
5551396	5553579	PlayStation Home would be interesting on the Vita as well.
5553639	5557923	I don't know if I'd play it though, but I would probably play it more on the Vita than I would on the PS3.
5560563	5563884	So let's talk Minecraft, because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet.
5564004	5568805	And there was a patch that was released earlier, well, Friday, Secret Patch Friday.
5570145	5573306	It's actually a bug fix patch right now.
5573646	5577206	They didn't really do a whole lot as far as any updates to the game.
5578166	5579527	Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes.
5579887	5584848	They added an autosave feature so you can set it up to automatically save every 15 minutes or 2 hours.
5585388	5585468	Um...
5587289	5589391	or, I guess, up to two hours.
5590392	5593234	They've also added a coordinate system to the map, which is kind of good.
5593735	5594195	That's good.
5594335	5596717	You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is.
5596817	5597418	Exactly.
5598499	5602903	Also, they took away the dupe glitch, so you can't dupe items anymore.
5603744	5611611	Some issues with clay not generating in your maps, which is a big no-no, so they finally fixed that, so you can actually craft stuff with clay.
5612731	5615872	Also some frame rate drops, stuff not spawning.
5617072	5621313	I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix, so I sent them a message.
5622053	5632096	Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire and switch to the third-person camera that faces the front of you, you don't see the fire, but you'll see it from the back if you do that.
5632456	5634716	It's one-way fire, I guess.
5635657	5636257	And then I guess...
5639817	5641779	See, here's the other thing I didn't realize too.
5642479	5646563	They said a fix for awaiting approval showing all the time on some signs.
5646803	5647564	I've seen that happen.
5647584	5649745	I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved.
5649905	5650326	They don't.
5651647	5652087	That's weird.
5657515	5658796	I want to point out some comments from chat.
5658936	5663119	Clover Nikon is in chat saying, all the children at the school I work at play the Minecraft demo.
5663179	5664099	And I'm like, well, what age?
5664479	5665040	Eight to ten.
5666541	5668402	Which seems kind of young, but it's cool.
5668422	5670023	I mean, it's a safe game for kids.
5670143	5671504	Yeah, it's a great game for kids.
5671644	5672905	It's pretty awesome.
5673105	5673945	I do like this.
5674166	5677968	The ability, they turn, or you can enable or disable the tooltips.
5678328	5680989	I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time.
5681089	5688233	If my friend's playing, and he's seen all this stuff already, and it'll be just like, hey, did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah, blah, blah?
5688253	5688993	I'm like, yes, I know.
5689433	5691314	I built a giant volcano out of Obsidian.
5691374	5693475	I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian.
5694096	5694416	It's just...
5694836	5712670	I don't know, a little annoying sometimes I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games When I was 12, or maybe 11 We used to go to the lab at the junior high No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers We would play Scorched Earth Oh, yes And it was epic Yes Scorched Earth is still epic
5712890	5713351	and what was it?
5713391	5713711	Tank 256.
5714091	5716674	There was another one just like a Tank 256 or something like that.
5717154	5717895	VGA Tank.
5717975	5718295	I don't know.
5718315	5719837	There was another one just like it.
5720017	5721599	That is a game right there that needs it.
5722239	5727504	That would be the perfect Facebook game if you think about it because it's not something that you take turns.
5727584	5728986	It's a game that you take turns in.
5729446	5734368	And so, why not have it where you would play Scorched Earth on Facebook?
5734408	5739330	And I am not talking about fucking worms, which clearly was inspired by Scorched Earth.
5739430	5742072	I am talking about Scorched motherfucking Earth, right?
5742332	5742872	Exactly.
5745482	5764694	so that'd be pretty awesome there will be an update though for Minecraft the next update that's supposed to add pistons and that fun stuff that's sometime in July I can't wait do you realize literally in one week we're getting that Skyrim expansion may not be in Minecraft for very long
5765703	5768566	Do you realize in one week it's the 10th anniversary of our show?
5768626	5769647	Yeah, but there's Skyrim.
5769727	5771649	That's Bethesda's present to us.
5772029	5774371	And actually, that expansion's coming out on my birthday.
5774711	5778475	So is Bethesda's present to me, the guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim?
5780780	5784342	Brain... You can never play enough Skyrim.
5784942	5787223	And then finally... Tank Wars.
5787283	5788023	Thank you, Jim Sally.
5788043	5789544	I think that was the one I was talking about.
5789604	5790945	Finally, Penny Arcade.
5791045	5793086	Their brand new game is going to be coming out.
5794406	5800869	Not on Xbox Live Arcade, but actually on PC, Mac, on Steam, and Xbox Live Indie Games.
5801370	5803811	It's coming out on June 25th.
5804171	5807953	It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th, but they said wait until July seems dumb.
5808713	5834169	which sounds great to me and the game itself looks awesome I wasn't a huge fan of the kind of adventure game style that the first one had but this one looks straight up like 2D Final Fantasy game so I may have to pick this up I just hope it doesn't require too much knowledge of the other games sorry I was queuing something up here
5834955	5836776	I don't know, I zoned out when you mentioned Minecraft
5857618	5863323	20th Anniversary is going to include... Now, this is the Wii game that's kind of like the Mario game, right?
5863763	5866466	It was announced back in April, but now we know what's actually going to be in it.
5867306	5876674	Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Dream Land 2, Kirby's Adventure, Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3, and Kirby 64 will make up the compilation.
5876915	5880418	There's also going to be a timeline, whatever that is.
5880938	5881959	I guess a poster or something.
5882559	5883619	and a soundtrack.
5883679	5886000	It launches in Japan on July 19th.
5886660	5891162	No North American information as of yet, but I'm sure it'll be just in time for the holidays.
5891662	5892962	Well, I think they've said September.
5894223	5897184	I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game on SNES.
5898979	5899999	Which was the best one.
5900019	5903721	Already, I'm giving this props because it's not a port of a virtual console game.
5903881	5910084	Because that's all the 20th Anniversary Edition was, was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars ported onto the Wii.
5910184	5914146	Literally, game rips of it, the disc rips, were like 30 megs.
5914286	5917167	It was literally the ROM from Super Nintendo.
5917287	5920088	This is at least more than one ROM.
5920628	5922149	And they actually have to make something...
5923666	5927590	Well, Majesco, the makers of Zumba Fitness, which sells really well.
5927970	5930352	And NBA Baller Beats.
5931013	5932094	Oh, Snapples.
5932294	5933575	All right, NBA Baller Beats.
5933915	5936958	Well, they've got another baller franchise that they've just acquired.
5937118	5939481	American Idol is a license they just got.
5939981	5943264	I want to say, when American Idol first came out, Codemasters had it.
5943324	5944325	Then Konami had it.
5944365	5946427	I remember the American Idol Karaoke Revolution games.
5946847	5953232	Well now, I guess Konami lost it, or gave it up, because Majesco now has the license for American Idol.
5953873	5955434	No idea what they're going to do with that.
5956055	5958877	I imagine a type of karaoke game would make some sense.
5960579	5963061	Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you a bunch of compliments.
5963561	5963961	I don't know.
5964262	5975651	You know what's kind of funny is Konami is actually getting out of the music game genre completely, aside from Joy Sound that they have coming out, which is a game that's pretty fucking old.
5976161	5981123	You know, I said for the 10th anniversary we should have a funeral for Bomani and never talk about it again, but I don't know.
5982003	5982504	That would be sad.
5982584	5983624	I don't want to do that.
5984724	5986305	But it's true.
5986385	5991127	If this was the first year, there was nothing on the floor at E3 about Bomani.
5991147	5999650	The very least they should have done was put one of those DDRX3 versus second mix machines in the Konami booth.
5999911	6001131	That would have been at least cool.
6001251	6004492	No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game, which looks pretty awesome.
6006113	6012537	Anyhow, lastly here for me, Mistwalker wants to make RPGs for the Wii U, but nothing planned yet.
6013097	6018760	Mistwalker, of course, made The Last Story, which is finally coming out here in America.
6019140	6023863	Some of the games before that they did, Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, a criminally underrated 360 game.
6024003	6026104	I need to play that game.
6026424	6030126	You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey is that the 360 flop seed in Japan.
6030326	6032087	I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3,
6033268	6034169	We would have had a sequel.
6034789	6036290	I hate to say it, but it's so true.
6036851	6040353	It's just really unfortunate because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG.
6040433	6040854	I love that game.
6040874	6042014	I need to go back and finish that game.
6042195	6042435	Yeah.
6042855	6046998	So anyhow, here's your quote from designer Takuya Matsumoto.
6047859	6058246	The development team and Sakaguchi-san are looking forward to making more, especially for the Wii U because it has another screen right in front of you that will add another level of strategic elements into the action RPG.
6058666	6062169	So we really are looking forward to it, but we really haven't planned anything.
6062449	6064589	It seems like it's something you could easily do.
6064629	6067610	Your little menus, you could even draw attack patterns.
6067990	6074152	I could see role-playing action games working very well with the Wii U as long as it's in capable hands.
6074572	6077632	I think Mistwalker's done a lot of underrated stuff.
6079053	6080433	Could be good if they decide to do it.
6080993	6083834	Since apparently they are kind of married to Nintendo now.
6083854	6084774	I didn't realize this, but...
6086155	6089681	They probably sold more of the last story than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly.
6092105	6093307	Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?
6094605	6095845	Well, I have a few things.
6096446	6102987	We have, first of all, the amount of money the Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at?
6103187	6103788	5.1 million.
6104748	6108089	So all of that is basically, the final amount is 5,105,196, $69.91 in two weeks.
6108109	6111510	They basically blew their previous records from 2 and 3 just out of the water.
6111750	6111810	Um...
6123853	6127275	So basically, we had 598,794 people make purchases, with the average price being $8.53.
6127356	6132899	And it said that Linux users paid more than anyone else at $12.51 per transaction, and Windows users were paying the least at $7.97.
6133760	6134560	They always pay the least.
6148789	6154891	Yeah, but basically most of the purchases were made on PC.
6155951	6161433	And then The Last of Us is going to not be out until 2013.
6161513	6165594	Well, of course, that's when all the games are coming out now.
6165674	6165934	Of course.
6166554	6170316	Well, technically it's late 2012, early 2013.
6172257	6178639	But that's what the Naughty Dog directors said on Jimmy Fallon.
6182481	6183642	and then Dance Central 2.
6184443	6185904	It has a June DLC.
6187305	6191508	It is... I don't know who this person is.
6191528	6192089	Iyaz?
6193310	6193750	Replay?
6194611	6195671	And Nelly's Hot In Here?
6196392	6197993	And Cat DeLuna's Wine Up?
6198053	6201116	Yeah, these are all songs... Well, I've heard the Hot In Here song, but I think it's awful.
6201676	6203417	The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are.
6204598	6206340	So, I don't care.
6206360	6206820	Yeah.
6208968	6209610	Alrighty then.
6210491	6212235	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6219031	6222454	Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google+.
6222634	6224056	Put it together and you get Voogle.
6225957	6228760	This week's question has to do with the story we talked about earlier.
6229440	6235165	One of the stories we were talking about tonight was THQ being suspected of misleading investors on Udraw, which got us thinking.
6235626	6241451	Although all of us may not be financial investors per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money into our gaming habit.
6242152	6245695	When was a time that you felt misled by a gaming company?
6246555	6248276	We kept it a little bit vague on purpose.
6248316	6250717	We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with.
6250737	6252118	There's a lot of interesting responses tonight.
6252158	6253258	Let's start with Facebook tonight.
6254159	6260062	I'm going to start with Rob D. It's hard not to feel constantly misled by Capcom.
6260282	6266325	Their works, and especially their long-running franchises, show that their developers care about their games and have passion.
6266705	6270347	However, we're promised so much, and all we ever get is nickels and dimes.
6271487	6273988	Zombie Princess says the ending of Mass Effect 3.
6274628	6277309	The whole series makes you think your choices will make a big difference.
6277510	6279570	In actuality, it doesn't matter at all.
6280791	6288014	Locopoco says by Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3, not Ultimate, was going to have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3.
6288874	6291395	Then when I bought it, all I got was a bare-bones fighter.
6291775	6294216	Sold it back to GameStop two hours later.
6294956	6296277	That's two strikes against Capcom.
6297137	6302381	Um, let's go to Kareem J, who says, have to agree with the above poster and Capcom.
6302762	6308346	They hype up their franchises, then release a boatload of DLC, which should have been on the disc.
6308606	6312829	Then to add a further kick in the balls, they release a game of the year edition.
6313070	6318534	I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one, but if you're really into one of their franchises, you want the game on day one.
6318874	6320795	You can't help but feel like a sucker.
6321676	6323718	Ouch, that's three punches for Capcom.
6324939	6326881	Joe G says, GoldenEye reloaded.
6327301	6334487	Frankly, I thought Activision was going to make the original GoldenEye 64 pretty with some story, a few new missions, and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan.
6334967	6335888	This isn't the case.
6335948	6342594	They gutted the game, changed around the story to make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay, and they fucking took out the jumping mechanics.
6342974	6346537	You can vault over objects, but it's clunky to say the least.
6347518	6352446	Tyler M says, there's been many times, but nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore.
6353227	6355410	I do remember being kind of let down by Spore.
6355470	6361499	Like, just, Spore wasn't, I think even Will Wright kind of said it best.
6361539	6362961	It just tried to accomplish too damn much.
6363865	6364765	I don't think he said it that way.
6364785	6366086	I'm paraphrasing a little bit there.
6367166	6367566	Let's see.
6368307	6369587	Let me try to wrap some of this up here.
6370128	6372809	Clover N says, Driver was just awfully misleading.
6373149	6375570	Thank heavens EB Games has a seven-day return policy.
6375630	6376530	No questions asked.
6376770	6377310	That's Driver 3.
6377350	6378311	Yeah.
6379731	6380672	Sorry, it's Driver with a 3 in it.
6381312	6383292	It is very entertaining, though, on its own merits.
6383733	6386333	It's lousy for about those first seven days, and then it's over.
6387053	6388314	I remember when you bought that.
6388454	6390114	It's so lousy way after that.
6390134	6392674	It's one of those that you have to keep going back to after a while.
6393135	6393895	I need to go back to that.
6394215	6403277	ShatteredHawk said, Mass Effect 3, all the hours being drawn in by the story and characters only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end.
6403357	6404177	Fuck you, Bioware.
6404657	6409159	That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom and two for Mass Effect 3.
6409599	6412280	Let's go over to the Google+.
6413580	6416161	Uh-oh, only one response on Google+.
6416481	6417902	You know what that means about Google+.
6418382	6419082	No one's on it.
6419603	6421043	That's what it's starting to look like.
6421063	6423864	We have another little kick for Google+.
6423924	6429006	Are you saying that Google isn't the amazing thing that they had us believe that it was?
6429955	6430315	Actdeft.com
6451351	6458638	though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans believing that EA and Bioware have totally scammed them even if they didn't in parentheses.
6459299	6460360	So there you have it.
6460740	6463002	That's not really a third strike against Bioware.
6463022	6466265	That's just kind of a, you know, pointing and laughing at the other people maybe.
6467186	6469368	So it looks like Capcom took the cake on that one.
6469428	6471530	I can't say I blame the listeners there.
6471590	6474993	There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom over the past couple of years.
6475514	6480718	Maybe they'll redeem themselves if Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3 end up being really, really good.
6482700	6486502	Yeah, I would still like to have that Mega Man universe someday, or the Mega Man Legends.
6486942	6489843	Well, they're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing anyways.
6489923	6493844	And on top of that, I don't... I mean, yes, that was terrible.
6494305	6496745	However, I didn't buy the game, so that wouldn't have been my choice.
6496805	6497266	My choice...
6498266	6498587	S, Actdeft, Drew,
6514125	6518127	The DLC, though, on the other hand, is fucking terrible.
6518567	6520789	It's just the expansion packs that they had.
6520889	6523630	I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand the costumes, that's a waste of money.
6524030	6525071	But the expansion packs.
6526091	6528072	I was smart enough not to buy the season pass.
6528592	6533375	Because I know well enough that, you know what, I'd rather pay extra money...
6534955	6543141	And have each one of those expansion packs be definitely good than to just pay $20 and have them all be terrible.
6543941	6548464	And thankfully, I paid $7, bought the first expansion, and it was fucking terrible.
6548904	6550405	Read the reviews on the second expansion.
6550786	6552727	Even more terrible than the first expansion.
6553107	6557550	Third one, hey, we get Johnny Gatbat, except he's a giant mutant.
6557950	6559391	And it's fucking terrible.
6559892	6560192	So...
6561707	6565130	Yeah, I'm not... I feel a little ripped off by them.
6565290	6571034	And also, all the OnDisc DLC... They have more OnDisc DLC than fucking Capcom does.
6571394	6572155	It's ridiculous.
6572235	6576058	They're still releasing stuff today that's OnDisc DLC.
6577419	6584104	And then they have a whole expansion that really could have been an expansion to the game, but now they're going to make its own retail release that's $30.
6585024	6586365	I'm waiting on that one.
6586466	6589868	I do want to play it because I like The Matrix and I like Saints Row III, but...
6591549	6611210	I'm very cautious going into it a lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight Blender agrees with Loki yes Loki Saints Row the third DLC pissed me off Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says Bethesda got away with making the true ending a DLC with Fallout 3 I don't see a problem with Bioware doing it as well
6612311	6629288	he makes a good point there about sometimes our attention spans we let one company get away with something but then don't let the other so lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com let's go back to some news I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later maybe some emails so let's go to Loki with news
6629830	6634752	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Retro and what their plans are.
6635633	6643437	Apparently, Retro Games, it's been rumored for a while, well, they've come out and said, hey, we'd love to do a Zelda game.
6644237	6648219	And, you know, people started asking them, hey, what's Retro working on?
6648239	6651561	Because, you know, you're not really saying anything about them.
6653703	6668759	and, you know, of course, Miyamoto basically saying, you know, in terms of them working on a Zelda game, it's not out of the question, but, you know, right now they're incredibly busy with other things.
6669226	6675151	And then of course they said, traditionally I think the Zelda team has always had close contact with anyone who's working on a Zelda game.
6676693	6683859	Traditionally, except for maybe in the CDI days where they did not have close contact with people that were working on that game.
6684460	6687222	At least they probably distanced themselves.
6687262	6692147	Yeah, but ever since then, that's why Nintendo has had a close relationship with
6692327	6699152	Yeah, of course they're saying, you know, Retro is too busy for that sort of thing right now.
6699172	6702854	You know, saying that they're working on something else.
6703775	6708638	And, you know, very busy right now, but I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is that they're working on.
6709919	6711320	Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game.
6711500	6713782	Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright, but...
6715931	6718712	I'm kind of curious to see if they are making a Zelda game.
6719553	6721354	Could they be doing the next-gen Zelda game?
6721374	6728477	Because if you think about the next-gen type Zelda game for the Wii U, because Nintendo hasn't really worked in next-gen stuff.
6728517	6731819	I don't know if Retro's really gotten their feet wet with that.
6731899	6732219	I don't know.
6733940	6734220	We'll see.
6735302	6738164	All right, well, I mentioned a minute ago we could come back and talk about Google+.
6738424	6741367	This is not a good thing for the service.
6742167	6748312	PopCap and Wooga Games, they're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform.
6748672	6752635	Wooga already shut down Monster World around May 1st.
6753656	6757339	EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz from the service this week.
6757379	6758460	I think it's already happened.
6759160	6763482	They're going to, quote, redeploy our resources to other adaptations of Bejeweled.
6763822	6771945	I think that's their nice way of saying, fucking no one's playing it on Google+, so we'd rather do the phones and the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at.
6772806	6783690	Wooga said, quote, they decided to, quote, decided to remove certain games from Google+, because we have had a much larger following on Facebook, and they are active users.
6783950	6786571	So goodbye, Bubble Island and Diamond Dash.
6786611	6787932	Those are leaving on July 1st.
6788692	6816377	PopCap does say Google is a valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA and will continue to develop for Google platforms that probably means Android I would think also maybe Chrome because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration with games and stuff like that Chrome has a bunch of the sort of add-ons with it too with games which is strange that you know it doesn't that that won't therefore integrate into Google Plus automatically but maybe it does I don't know
6817837	6821679	I remember seeing ads for Google+, like at the movies and stuff.
6821699	6825800	They really tried to push this, and people just aren't taking the bait.
6826740	6829081	And I'm not sure I totally understand why.
6829161	6830301	I mean, is it the interface?
6830341	6831182	Is it because maybe it's...
6832162	6835044	Maybe people don't like the oversimplification next to Facebook.
6835464	6837986	I do see some dedicated Google Plus people.
6838066	6841528	There are definitely some people I see that use Google Plus more than they use Facebook.
6841828	6845570	And I have to admit, I get so sick of Facebook shit.
6845970	6848932	There is so much shit on Facebook I don't need in my life.
6849132	6849832	I really don't.
6850033	6852234	You know, there's a lot of toxicness there.
6852594	6853735	There's a lot of just...
6855165	6856366	There's a lot of stuff on there.
6856526	6864349	And I'm not saying Google Plus is any better in that regard because I think if everybody was on Google Plus instead of Facebook, it would just be the same thing in reverse.
6864989	6866710	But I don't know.
6868671	6872973	I'm just surprised more people didn't run away to Google Plus in a way.
6873513	6874854	Well, for a while people did.
6875674	6878455	And then it's like, oh, everyone else is still on Facebook.
6878475	6879836	Because people needed attention.
6882738	6883318	It's true.
6883438	6884338	It is absolutely true.
6884619	6886940	People needed attention so they went back to Facebook.
6887260	6890902	I will totally admit, in some ways, that's why I'm still posting on Facebook.
6891062	6894124	It's been a great promotional tool for the show.
6894564	6895605	Now, I will say this.
6896445	6898387	I think there's a huge...
6899187	6925713	and I hope to hell this doesn't go away because I think there's a huge potential to do something great with Google Hangout and some of the interviews and some of that and I think there's some cool untapped stuff there so I hope they don't just close Google Plus altogether and you know what I don't care if we only have like five fans on Google Plus that's five fans that we have so you know I don't want to like stop supporting Google Plus or whatever but you know it is the fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook
6927560	6928821	But Myspace, fuck them.
6929641	6930482	Fuck Myspace.
6930542	6931303	We don't care about that.
6931343	6932644	Yes, fuck Myspace.
6933584	6935325	I still get messages on Myspace.
6935365	6940669	I'm like, I don't even know where my page is anymore, let alone all these artists.
6940689	6942350	Hey, listen to my shit.
6942370	6943011	I'm like, no.
6943491	6946613	Zether in our chatroom says, RIP Google+.
6947574	6949175	Well, yeah, I mean, the game's leaving.
6949235	6950115	Bejeweled leaving.
6951296	6955839	When your PopCap games are leaving, it's really not a good sign.
6956260	6956600	Yikes.
6958485	6958765	Alright.
6959485	6961186	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
6962547	6963267	DarkSakura.
6963367	6963667	News?
6963767	6965388	Who pays attention to news?
6965968	6967468	How about some stuff about StarCraft?
6967489	6969049	Because that would make people perk up.
6970550	6973611	StarCraft 2 Heart of the Swarm is 99% done.
6974471	6982254	The lead designer, Dustin Browder, basically said, and this is a quote, 99% done, but that last 1% is a bitch.
6983855	6987076	So, they're saying, basically he says he could do a playthrough of
6987614	6988074	I'm sorry.
6988154	6990255	Then it's not really 99% done.
6990535	6992135	That was something he said to get quoted.
6992395	6993476	May I finish?
6994936	6997717	So they can do a playthrough and are like, wow, this is great.
6997857	7000898	Or you can do a playthrough and then find more items to fix.
7000938	7004499	So basically it's like they're in that last beta stage.
7005339	7006499	Or I should say alpha stage.
7006699	7008920	Where they're finding those little last minute things.
7009020	7010340	It sounds like it's all a bunch of tweaking.
7010960	7013441	Which really is like the last little bit.
7014141	7014742	So you're like 90% done.
7014802	7014902	Yeah.
7019614	7025878	So that's the only thing holding it back At least they're waiting until it's done I'll give you that What exactly do they have to do?
7025938	7029321	They have the game done They're adding an expansion pack
7030439	7034442	StarCraft 2... I don't know if I want my unit right here or over here.
7034462	7035082	Do you play StarCraft 2?
7035362	7037484	They are doing some more units and campaigns.
7037784	7038424	Here's the thing.
7038725	7042247	StarCraft 2 has to be balanced right.
7042687	7047951	There is so much esports and competitive gaming and things that go into something like StarCraft 2.
7048391	7049692	It has to be right.
7050032	7057617	So I understand there's going to be some extensive testing that goes on with this because they cannot afford to have a fucked up balance in StarCraft 2.
7057657	7057877	Literally.
7058137	7058598	Literally.
7059178	7060319	StarCraft 2 League of Legends
7079022	7080644	StarCraft, Warcraft Arena League of Legends
7095496	7098739	Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys in the mailbag.
7098779	7102523	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and Skype line in a little bit.
7102723	7103724	But for first, Loki.
7103824	7110330	Well, something I was talking a little bit about earlier is things that Nintendo says that they're doing and then doesn't.
7111031	7116636	We just talked about StarCraft 2 and similar type of gameplay style on RTS, Pikmin 3.
7117777	7119459	They're not doing online multiplayer.
7119720	7133957	A brand new system that's coming out, HD, and they're not fucking doing online multiplayer because they said, well, we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around, so it would be hard for us to track all those accurately on other systems.
7136120	7136200	Uh...
7138220	7140482	No, that doesn't make any sense to me.
7140702	7141242	I'm sorry.
7142623	7147066	Because if you think about it, there are multiplayer RTS games out there.
7147586	7149648	There are multiplayer console RTS games out there.
7149728	7152390	I just fucking named some in the competitive space.
7152450	7155111	Hello, StarCraft, League of Legends.
7155472	7165318	And you can't fucking, I mean, don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around at one time, but dude, it's not like billions of Pikmin running around at the same time.
7165338	7166539	Ever heard of the Zerg?
7168620	7172222	Yeah, so it just seems like a piss poor excuse for that.
7172242	7174023	I mean, you have a launch title.
7174203	7176565	You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system.
7176765	7178586	Your system finally gets online.
7178666	7182508	It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U, Nintendo fucking gets online.
7182748	7184869	But no, they don't fucking get online.
7185209	7186470	They don't at all.
7186870	7188571	It's no online multiplayer.
7188611	7193754	Now you can share your me online and send pictures of your penis to your friends.
7194494	7195174	Yay!
7195715	7197256	But there's co-op local multiplayer.
7197336	7199117	Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again.
7199637	7207181	It's just all the online functionality that they've shown right now, it's the same functionality we have with the 3DS and the Wii.
7208062	7212484	Send messages back and forth and see what your friends are playing.
7216066	7217787	That's not very functional.
7217827	7220068	Which you can fucking do on the 3DS with Swapnote.
7220629	7221089	Or on the Wii.
7221249	7222330	Wii has online gameplay.
7222350	7222430	Okay.
7223496	7225598	We had online gameplay with Mario Kart.
7225758	7228180	You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart.
7228540	7231843	Why can't you do online gameplay for Pikmin?
7232143	7233444	Oh, I don't know.
7233464	7235166	We've never coded online games before.
7236127	7236587	What's the deal?
7237248	7239730	Oh, but we have local multiplayer.
7240310	7241451	Thanks for watching!
7260881	7261401	Just saying.
7263182	7270147	And they even said, you know, one of the other things was that the Wii U, the whole idea was almost scrapped because of the price concerns.
7270627	7276250	They were saying, you know, sometimes during a final discussion we almost gave up on the idea of additional screen.
7276651	7280173	This was due over the concern of expected high cost.
7280313	7286257	It may not have been feasible to create this and sell it at a reasonable price point for the consumers.
7287378	7287478	Um...
7289099	7315195	and of course they haven't said what the reasonable price point is yet maybe now it's more reasonable to pay $400 for a system because there's tablets out there that cost that much but I guess it's just gonna we're gonna have to wait and see you know how much the system's gonna cost and if it's too much it's gonna flop if it's the right price point it'll do okay but I don't know
7318308	7319549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7344344	7352870	If you're not sure what this game is, it's the whole Level 5 and Studio Ghibli collaboration, which has been out in Japan already for a little bit.
7353691	7355853	I don't remember when it's finally coming out here.
7355873	7357154	I think it's towards the end of the year.
7357214	7357654	January.
7357674	7358475	2013, yet again.
7360836	7362457	The reasons why they kept the name the same.
7362678	7363138	I love this.
7363198	7366240	This is Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee.
7390476	7393159	White Witch versus the original Japanese title.
7393179	7393460	You know what?
7393480	7394761	You know what that means though, right?
7394821	7395041	Huh?
7395161	7395782	Second Country.
7397504	7397924	Interesting.
7397965	7399266	Ni no Kuni, Second Country.
7399747	7402410	But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country, you know?
7402650	7402930	Yeah.
7403311	7404552	I'm glad they did keep that name.
7404572	7411520	You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell with a title that, you know, isn't English, then why not?
7411909	7412089	Yeah.
7413129	7422831	That's why I was pissed that Dew Prism had a different name because I had been freaking looking forward to hoping that Dew Prism would be out and then I hear about Threads of Fate and I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?
7423691	7424091	Stupid.
7424111	7436614	Speaking of Fight Quest 6, I really do think that they should bring over Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3 which is what I would call Toe Ball 3 because they really need a Toe Ball 3 because Toe Ball 2 is awesome.
7437434	7437934	Just saying.
7440234	7441835	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
7441935	7457764	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst, surrounds herself in the hundreds of thousands of emails we get every week and pulls out a lucky few to read here on air.
7457984	7459705	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7459865	7461046	That's exactly what happens.
7461894	7463156	Well, we've got a few.
7464378	7466681	And there's one actually that we got from Redertainment.
7467242	7473110	And just to say right now, I've read it and I'm reading your thing and I'll give you feedback.
7473290	7475673	Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback.
7476514	7477716	Oh, it was an off-air question.
7477756	7478217	Okay, sure.
7478237	7478798	I'll peek later.
7480316	7490289	So, anyway, this one, Dear OLR, I first have to say that I love the show even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to.
7490870	7492192	Anyway- Cancel your plans.
7494321	7496922	Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about an OR memory I have.
7497443	7507247	The greatest memory I have, aside from getting pretty close to Dark Tetsuya, is that the day my father passed away, June 25, 2003, from cancer, you guys were there for me.
7507808	7512370	I remember we were holding a show that day, and I had delivered the news that he passed on.
7512810	7516432	And to help me get through it, you guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirits.
7517253	7519538	Ever since then you guys have been a huge part of my life.
7519738	7522344	Thanks OLR for the memories and keep up the good work.
7522424	7524328	Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl
7524861	7525501	Wow, that's heavy.
7526282	7541890	Like, you know, I think we sometimes forget that, like, people have their lives and their drama and the things that they're going through, and yet OLR is kind of something that stayed constant through 10 years, and I think some people have kind of, you know... It's really weird to say.
7542391	7546153	I mean, not in a bad way, but to hear something like that is very powerful.
7547253	7553637	I mean, when somebody's looking for normalcy, so they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights to help them get through it, like, that...
7555245	7559554	Like I said, we don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners to feel that kind of power.
7559634	7563963	That took one person in this case.
7564985	7565827	I'm glad we could help.
7565867	7566789	That's all I can really say.
7574546	7575907	Greetings, OmniBeings.
7577048	7580309	Attached to this email is a picture I took at a Best Buy on Saturday.
7580790	7583671	It's of the PC version of Final Fantasy XIV.
7584072	7586213	The game is drastically reduced.
7586593	7591075	Not only does the price sticker read $20, the red sticker on the game means the game is reduced to $10.
7592236	7595517	Still, even at $10, I questioned whether this game was worth my money.
7596197	7599819	I posted this picture on Twitter asking if the game was worth my money.
7600119	7605681	The only reply I received told me that the Wolverine movie game next to Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing.
7607621	7619886	What does it say about Final Fantasy XIV that I, a gamer who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII, would question buying this game and when asked, people replied that I should buy a movie tie-in instead.
7620886	7621906	Stay Black Entertainment.
7621926	7627628	This message has been brought to you by a locally produced microbrew beer, which is what I bought instead of a game.
7628748	7633349	You could take a risk that the 2.0 version is going to kick a lot of ass.
7633369	7636850	You know, one thing we didn't talk about this week, there was a blog post on Sony's blog.
7637270	7640871	Apparently it's still happening on the PlayStation 3 whenever the 2.0 version happens.
7640911	7642411	There's going to be a beta test later in the year.
7642811	7644572	I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet.
7645072	7649513	I just... I mean, rebooting an MMO and expecting people to care?
7649673	7649953	I mean...
7651095	7653036	It's a big risk.
7654096	7659618	But if you think about it, if you buy the game now for $10, you're not going to have to buy it again when the 2.0 upgrade comes out.
7660459	7661239	At least on PC.
7662419	7664820	I just hope that means free to play Final Fantasy XI.
7665200	7666441	Free to play Final Fantasy XI.
7667281	7669982	I wish those rumors about the Vita Final Fantasy XI were true.
7670242	7670922	Oh, God.
7671243	7672403	Dream on, Internet.
7674909	7675769	We have two more actually.
7676429	7679411	But I never remember saying this, so okay.
7680851	7685634	I agree with DarkSakura 100% when she implied that Nintendo redeveloped Super Mario Bros.
7685794	7692557	U with a Crysis or Unreal-type graphics engine and put Mario in real-world 2D side-scrolling environment.
7692737	7694978	Oh, with real skies, trees, and weather effects.
7695398	7697339	Real gold coins abuse the power of the Wii U.
7697799	7706683	I think I had said that it should be like, remember how Fantasy Zone, the Sega Ages 2500 is?
7706823	7709004	Where it's all 3D, but it's side-scrolling?
7709085	7710285	Oh yeah, sorta, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7710865	7712766	I think that's what I had said.
7713947	7719309	But I don't know that I would want it to be like Crysis or Unreal.
7720810	7723191	I just want it to be 2D side-scrolling.
7724352	7725973	But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D.
7726832	7732173	I think more like a game like Castlevania Symphony of the Night kind of had 2D but a little bit of 3D thrown in.
7732333	7732653	I don't know.
7733054	7733254	Yeah.
7733834	7735594	And we had one last mail that came in.
7735734	7736654	How about Paper Mario?
7736775	7737675	That's a good example too.
7737795	7738015	Sorry.
7738135	7739375	It came in last minute.
7739435	7739995	Last minute?
7740575	7743476	And dear lord sir, please spell out your words.
7744496	7746437	Well, sent from my iPod.
7746497	7747137	That's what's happening.
7747177	7748177	That's no excuse.
7748237	7753099	I type out all of my words fully on my iPhone so if I can do it, you can do it.
7753559	7754219	And I'm lazier.
7755159	7760801	Hey Lord of the Orange Lounge, what's your most shameful moment in video games?
7761221	7763462	Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about.
7763842	7775046	Mine is Star Wars Galaxy since the hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard just so I could make hundreds of stem packs because I want to be a medic just that bad.
7775186	7777087	That stupid game was such a letdown.
7777487	7781729	I spent tons of money and time never swinging a fucking lightsaber once.
7782029	7782949	Kisses, Jim Sally.
7783948	7787350	I may not want my coworkers to know about my World of Warcraft podcast.
7788830	7794713	Actually, a lot of them already do know about that and they don't get it, but they think it's interesting.
7795213	7798054	I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work.
7799215	7806938	I mean... You have to remember, I work primarily, not exclusively, but primarily with middle-aged women.
7807638	7808339	So when I say...
7809738	7811339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7833624	7834185	I will say this.
7834225	7842391	The person I work closest with at my work, who's another trainer, and her and I are the same subject matter experts, I will say this.
7842671	7845753	I adore her very much.
7845813	7846834	We work great together.
7846854	7847575	We're a great team.
7848275	7854520	But I do love the fact that even though she may not totally get all my game talk, she kind of is a closet nerd.
7854620	7857963	And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show, but it's not like you guys know her anyway.
7858003	7859604	She's totally into comic books.
7859904	7860925	Oh, I totally know who that is now.
7861945	7873070	But no, she was telling me about like, oh no, before you go see the Avengers, you need to go see Captain America because there's parts of the story that are in there that you're not going to see in the Avengers.
7873751	7878553	She likes to tell me about how her and her son read comic books together.
7878573	7879633	That used to be a bonding thing for them.
7879854	7882575	She was talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons together with them.
7882595	7883455	And I thought that was just neat.
7884016	7884476	It was neat.
7887517	7888698	There's nothing to be ashamed of.
7889398	7890439	Unless you're a DC fan.
7890899	7898082	That's why, just to bring this back to an empowering moment, that's why I love VOG, the voice of Geeks Network.
7898322	7900563	There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek.
7901143	7902204	Let your voice be heard.
7902904	7903124	Nope.
7904285	7906826	Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway.
7907546	7908366	About what, VOG?
7908486	7911407	No, about people knowing what my fandoms are.
7911828	7914689	You've made a career out of it, woman.
7915009	7915889	At least a nighttime career.
7915909	7920551	Well, I mean, but I really am completely happy.
7921511	7924032	My nerdy stuff makes me happy.
7925813	7929374	If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like, yeah, I play games.
7929794	7931215	Play Mass Effect right now, yo.
7931455	7931695	You know?
7932415	7935798	I took one of my co-workers to the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco.
7935818	7936218	We drove over there.
7936278	7936838	It was awesome.
7936858	7937459	She had a blast.
7938560	7938820	Anyway.
7960529	7962430	She's also a fan of this page on Facebook.
7963251	7964452	One of my coworkers, yeah.
7964752	7966213	Hey, be a fan of my page.
7967213	7969515	Well, you can go like Jamie too, but I do want to say this.
7969715	7974758	The Orange Lounge Radio page is two people short of 500.
7976119	7976439	Like it.
7976459	7980382	Do you think for our 10th anniversary you could get us 500 likes on Facebook?
7980642	7983484	Like I could go, oh, we want 1,000 likes on Facebook and 5,000.
7983864	7988227	Of course we fucking want 5,000 likes on Facebook, but I'm going to keep the goal reasonable.
7989656	7992837	DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast next week Meanwhile, let's get angsty
8026135	8029578	My FU, I have a few FUs, but I also have a thank you.
8030398	8043569	My first FU goes towards this trend lately of people having like, you know, a Camry or some shit up on these huge ass wheels with like bicycle spokes in them.
8043929	8045070	You know what I'm talking about, Rob?
8046940	8047380	DarkSakura.com
8062188	8072939	and it's like, it doesn't add any, first of all, it reduces, it decreases their gas mileage because they have higher wind resistance.
8073639	8078724	It adds no grip to the ground and it's just not at all good for their suspension.
8079305	8080146	It's stupid.
8080306	8082548	I mean, and you know what we want to know what broke my heart, Robb?
8084011	8085391	You know, oh no, it really broke my heart.
8085452	8086332	What?
8086832	8091233	1970 Dodge Challenger, which is one of my favorite muscle cars, with the fucking wheels like that.
8091434	8092514	I wanted to kill a bitch.
8093474	8095415	I would have cut them so hard.
8095935	8100337	Now, I think that I would just fall over dead if I happened to see one of the 72 Chevelle SS.
8100497	8101457	I mean, that would murder me.
8102177	8122280	and then there were there was just the the people this is the other thing and people try to sneak around you without saying excuse me when you don't see them all you have to do is go oh excuse me may I get by please and I'm like I'll step aside and be like okay what it's California in particular where people don't do that
8122981	8129385	and like anywhere else that I've been, people will tap me on the shoulder and say, excuse me, may I move around?
8130046	8130966	But they don't do it here.
8131126	8132007	I don't get why.
8132407	8137230	All you have to do is just speak to somebody and not treat them like they're an inconvenience.
8137871	8144475	I love my mom, but I have to direct an FU in her direction.
8145409	8147652	You know, actually, I've got it in front of me on Facebook.
8148773	8154298	I am going, making adjustments in my diet because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick.
8155759	8160124	And my mom says, I've lost eight pounds in two weeks and I ain't no vegan, I eat meat.
8161125	8161666	Waterweight.
8161726	8166392	So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol?
8166792	8168595	You're a bitch, but that's why we love you.
8168815	8175624	And then I said, I also greatly appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy and eat food that's good for me and lose a little bit of my extra bulk.
8175724	8176946	Thanks mom, slash sarcasm.
8178127	8202357	and uh so uh it's just this thing with my mom basically anything that is not in her scope of reality she sort of just rejects it and substitutes it with her own version of reality and in some uh places they call that insanity so I don't know if it's just a mom thing she just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view so I guess this isn't oh I just noticed
8202637	8204218	I know, look at that, look at that.
8204238	8205359	500, 500 likes.
8205379	8207161	Thank you, whoever just liked us.
8207281	8210384	I can't see who it is, but... 50 for every year of the podcast.
8210444	8211464	All right, now let's do 600.
8212946	8215068	Well... Or no, I want 666 now.
8217429	8218510	Well, to continue.
8218711	8218891	Yes.
8219811	8220552	It's just that...
8222073	8222954	Again, I love my mom.
8223014	8224416	It's not exactly an FU.
8224516	8226237	It's just a, really?
8226798	8227338	You know what I mean?
8227839	8228720	Where you just go, really?
8229120	8229420	Really?
8230201	8237388	It's like that meme where the girl is looking sideways and making the face, which you can't see, so this is really good radio.
8237788	8239090	You have a lot of FUs to give tonight.
8239510	8240491	Oh, my thank you.
8241172	8241912	My thank you.
8242633	8244515	Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods.
8245509	8273235	Who let me and my small little purchase go through And said, oh no, you've only got a couple You go ahead of me, I have a bunch more than you And I was like, well thank you You have a nice day And she's like, well you too, I hope you have a great evening Bless her heart, I hope she gets some tonight Yeah But it just I'm glad that there's nice, considerate people in the world And there need to be It just takes one act of kindness To make sort of a ripple effect Because you know
8273755	8280858	If you take that moment and make a difference in somebody else's day, then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference in somebody else's day.
8280958	8281739	That's all I'm saying.
8282899	8283259	I'm done.
8284000	8284300	Spent.
8285120	8285520	Loki!
8288382	8290603	Uh... I don't know.
8290923	8291603	I don't have anything.
8292844	8295285	F you to my throat being sore for a third week in a row.
8296666	8299327	It's not going away, so I guess I gotta go see the doctor now.
8309559	8322389	I have to make mine intentionally extremely vague tonight, but F you to my fear of the uncertain and the uncomfortable, probably causing me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity.
8323470	8324291	That's all I'm going to say.
8325880	8328302	Rob, really, there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear.
8329783	8331104	Nothing wrong with changing brands.
8331164	8333045	No, that part's fine.
8334787	8336128	Are you kidding?
8336288	8339650	I know they might fit a little differently than your current brand.
8339690	8342092	No, no, that's the incentive to lose weight.
8342192	8345995	It's like, Rob, if you lose weight, you can go buy new underwear.
8346495	8346975	Yes!
8347656	8349257	I meant, like, changing your brand.
8350178	8350298	Oh.
8350942	8352624	They may fit a little weird in some places.
8352664	8353845	Maybe a little too snug.
8354705	8355866	But it's a new opportunity.
8356807	8359750	I don't know how comfortable... They might be cheaper and better made.
8359930	8363873	I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear on Orange Lounge Radio, so I think we need to move on.
8364754	8365555	It would be a good idea.
8365655	8368057	Loki, please, let's move on with something else.
8368257	8371940	Let's talk about Harmonix and what they're planning on working on.
8372240	8377884	They actually have three more projects, or three or more projects, that are in the work right now.
8378225	8381487	And none of them are Rock Band or Dance Central.
8382948	8384249	So that's pretty awesome.
8384670	8392296	Of course, they can't talk about it, but at least they're coming out with something new.
8393994	8417180	eventually but they said yeah they'll have some crazy stuff to talk about hopefully next year hopefully soon coming soon or not someday eventually alright let's move on
8417853	8420796	Street Fighter IV Street Fighter IV
8435493	8436434	and DarkSakura.com
8453112	8457377	But apparently enough fans pestered Capcom, they kind of let him do it, and there we go.
8457497	8464385	Now, I don't know if you forgot, but he had this whole thing where he suffered from exhaustion, like legit.
8464405	8469491	I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion, I'm talking about he was just exhausted, and he had to...
8470612	8472133	Capcom didn't even acknowledge that I'd been in the hospital.
8472153	8473074	There was no change in my schedule.
8473094	8477097	I was at home for an entire week before the doctors allowed me to return to work.
8495071	8498272	When I returned to my desk, there was a ticket to Rome waiting for me.
8498352	8499293	There's no mercy.
8499713	8502914	Everyone in the company says, Ono-san, we've been so worried about you.
8503354	8506976	Then they hand me a timetable and it's completely filled with things to do.
8507496	8509617	That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer.
8509677	8515239	But then again, when you made Street Fighter 4, which is kind of, you know, making Capcom a lot of money right now, I guess you can do that.
8515499	8517560	And that is kind of messed up.
8517720	8517980	I mean...
8518920	8544064	I don't know is it just here in America that you can kind of get that like if you have an incident like that I know if somebody at my work had a bad incident like that you would get what's called the work accommodation where you work a limited schedule or whatever your doctor that's what happened when I had chronic fatigue yeah whatever your doctor orders which I still have for several months right well and you didn't you went back to work I took two weeks off two weeks off and basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to
8545993	8553317	which I mean which might to some people might sound like oh what a lazy but no this is like a legit diagnosed thing your doctor said she's got to do it.
8553978	8574730	It's related to an immunodeficiency issue and I was also lacking in B12 and vitamin D and it's almost in some cases I've seen people compare it to narcolepsy where you start finding you'll be aware though of yourself nodding off you know it's just overwhelming exhaustion where you hurt all the time
8575530	8599493	it's it's horrible and anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls all right anyhow um what is this uh I guess Ono was continuing to talk I thought this was crazy quote was this a quote from Ono I guess it was uh Capcom was very good at squeezing people to the last drop of their blood to get work done
8601568	8601748	Ouch.
8603090	8603230	Ouch.
8624008	8624568	Finland too.
8624949	8631914	Because they're a socialist democracy and they have the highest level of reported public happiness in the world.
8632214	8632754	Just saying.
8633995	8634856	Learn from this America.
8638359	8638739	Alrighty.
8640784	8643765	Uh, that's it for my story there.
8643805	8645606	I guess we're about ready to open up the Skype line.
8646046	8647527	How's it sound when we open up the Skype line?
8647547	8649168	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8649568	8652249	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8652789	8659132	And we'll get to the Twitter topics in just a minute as well, but I want to ask Loki, surprise him here with any last minute stories he might possibly have for us.
8659713	8666425	Just real quick, there's going to be a different circle pad attachment that's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet.
8666966	8672075	It actually kind of conforms to the 3DS shell, so it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS.
8674209	8675269	PC, JoyMashers, Oniken
8696258	8697118	Looks pretty awesome.
8697138	8700940	Supposed to be coming out on, I guess, Dessura for $4.99.
8702220	8703400	And that's out.
8703580	8707482	It was actually out this coming Friday on the 22nd.
8708622	8712683	And I guess Mac and Linux versions are coming out later on.
8713523	8718145	But the game looks a lot like Strider, so it could be cool.
8720069	8720650	Which Strider?
8720770	8722032	NES Strider?
8723014	8733692	Well, I mean, it's an NES-styled game, so yes, I like NES Strider, but I mean, it sort of resembles Strider, but not Commando, you know, generic futuristic action game.
8734994	8736815	All right, the calls are coming in, so let's go to the phones.
8736855	8737775	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8737795	8738136	Who's this?
8738916	8739716	It's Shane.
8740457	8741577	Hi, Shane.
8741597	8742298	How are you?
8743879	8744419	How are you?
8745760	8748901	I'm burning up and achy and tired.
8750762	8753744	For those that listen to Horde House, how are you doing after the surgery?
8755020	8756401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8777748	8779149	You even have comments in the chatroom.
8779189	8780751	Blackwolf says, is Shane awake?
8781872	8782412	I am.
8782672	8783093	Hooray.
8784774	8785615	Crap.
8785915	8790039	I totally had what I was going to say and now I forgot because you interrupted me.
8790319	8790759	I'm sorry.
8791019	8792601	Well, surely it was about Mass Effect.
8793902	8794382	Percocet.
8794603	8795964	Surely it was about Mass Effect.
8796664	8801008	I honestly don't think it was, which might shock everybody.
8801548	8803250	They replaced him after the surgery.
8804372	8804612	What?
8805453	8805773	Nothing.
8806533	8806774	Nothing?
8806794	8807514	You're not a pod person.
8807554	8808435	Was it E3?
8808575	8809515	Was it something we talked about?
8809535	8811777	No, I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop.
8811897	8812117	Okay.
8812697	8817160	So I got that indie bundle that had all those really good games for super cheap.
8817901	8818801	The most recent one.
8819422	8822444	Sorry, BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep.
8823885	8824385	That was good.
8824405	8824845	That was good.
8825346	8825526	All right.
8825546	8825946	Sorry.
8826106	8826847	Yes, the humble bundle.
8827847	8855388	and I started playing Bastion which you know I heard so much about I saw all the banners at E3 last year I was like oh that looks stupid and now I'm playing it and the game it's okay but I want every game to be narrated now because that is the best part of the game it's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers it's the part of the game that makes people feel so like hipster and that they're playing something artistic is like my game has a deep voiced bassy narrator
8855948	8863730	I don't feel hipster, but I like to jump off, you know, well, I fell off the world once and he narrated that and that's where I was sold.
8864030	8865230	I thought it was so awesome.
8865490	8870391	I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice commercial in the style of the Old Spice commercial.
8870431	8872892	That Mustafa guy?
8873012	8873912	That would be awesome.
8874172	8876653	I want a game narrated by Gilbert Gottfried.
8877353	8880355	I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees.
8880736	8881736	What is up with that?
8882017	8883558	That would be terrible.
8884318	8885439	Nobody wants that.
8886200	8886940	I would play that.
8887120	8888061	I would buy that day one.
8888141	8890603	Oh my god, I think you just died.
8891343	8893705	You're the worst video game player ever.
8893865	8899909	Have you seen the funny video of Gilbert Godfrey doing the audiobook for Fifty Shades of Grey?
8899929	8900630	No.
8901450	8902871	Yes, yes I have.
8903211	8905092	Oh my god, it's fucking amazing.
8905152	8906092	Yes, yes I have.
8906292	8907333	Rob's finding that.
8907353	8908613	Fifty Shades of Grey.
8909313	8911594	Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate.
8911954	8912515	Oh my god.
8913155	8913815	So Shane.
8914375	8914655	Yes.
8915596	8918417	I am addicted and I blame you and Rob.
8919895	8920496	That's fine.
8920556	8924839	I'll take all the blame for that because now, well, here's the thing.
8924879	8930102	It's kind of like a pyramid scheme, so now you have to go and find somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them.
8930362	8931042	I'm working on it.
8931082	8933644	I'm trying to get Dan to play it so that our entire house is infected.
8934965	8936065	Can Shermie play it?
8936426	8937766	No, she'll just shit.
8938687	8939908	Oh, that's disgusting.
8941069	8942089	Well, everyone poops.
8942750	8943450	That's true.
8943650	8944891	I know from my little puppy.
8944911	8946212	Especially your new puppy.
8946592	8947913	What did you end up naming your puppy?
8948496	8960366	Hilo from Battlestar Galactica Cool, okay Now I am completely addicted to including Garrus in everything because I kind of dig my Birdman
8962020	8962840	He is awesome.
8962961	8963821	He totally is.
8963981	8966923	But I am looking forward to the hotness of Miranda.
8967383	8968223	But I don't know.
8968403	8970344	I'm not too impressed with Caden yet, really.
8970665	8973046	Because he's just not doing anything.
8973166	8975987	He's just sort of like... It's because you're not taking him places.
8976148	8978909	I heard earlier, you're like, I don't bring him along.
8979229	8981070	He's just sort of like, hi, Shepard.
8981370	8981771	Wink.
8982951	8985853	Okay, no, the same thing I felt for Liara.
8985893	8990896	I hated Liara, and then I beat 3 and I kind of liked her, and then I started taking her through my playthroughs.
8991416	8993257	Oh, I can't say stuff.
8994598	8997640	And she became my hag, and I like Liara now.
8998160	8998420	Okay.
8998440	9000321	So I have her in Kaiden all the time.
9000601	9005484	Well, then maybe I'll leave Rex at home for a while and take Kaiden out.
9007565	9008426	Yes, do that.
9008526	9009586	That's a much better idea.
9009606	9012348	Although, people have been spoiling crap for me.
9013140	9017023	Well, you should unfriend them and then drive to their house and punch them in the throat.
9017183	9021386	It's because I was looking up the stuff that I'm not doing in Mass Effect.
9021766	9026409	Like, I was reading the wiki and I don't want to shoot somebody.
9028891	9029712	Oh, yeah.
9030372	9032754	So, that made me mad.
9033054	9037557	That and the triple palette swap that I won't go into further detail about.
9039428	9043551	We can talk later about that because I don't understand what that is.
9043951	9046013	That doesn't tell her the full picture.
9046293	9046773	What?
9046993	9048574	That doesn't tell her the full picture.
9048695	9050116	I'm still going to play the whole thing.
9050156	9051056	I'll find out, Rob.
9051336	9052357	Okay, I'm just saying.
9053318	9068488	Before I hang up here so you don't hang up on me, something we'll probably talk about on Horde House this week that I saw today, I guess it was data mine for Diablo 3, that you'll get some stuff for having the collectors miss the Pandaria.
9069389	9085527	um you'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some banners and stuff but there's also possibly these wings that say in the like the code string that they give you quad damage now how fair is that to get something that's actually worth like
9086428	9086948	Holy f*** is this wrong?
9116343	9119766	But holy hell, is it erotic!
9140964	9146783	1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9149086	9151107	Do we have any other last minute stories or should I go over to Twitter?
9151147	9152348	I had Twitter up on the iPad.
9152848	9153248	Tweet it.
9153589	9156750	Well, there is something I was just going to mention real quick that was kind of interesting.
9156770	9165574	Remember how, well, we were just talking about Pinball Game during Part A where Twilight Zone was the game of the week here.
9166375	9168456	There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently.
9168536	9170297	Pinball Arcade, the Twilight Zone.
9170637	9174779	It's to get the Twilight Zone, I guess, on consoles.
9174879	9175839	Well, it must have worked.
9176140	9176320	Let's...
9177020	9178501	Jessica Harper from Understation Live, Saturday Nights at VOG
9204901	9205482	Not much.
9205562	9213590	I thought that, you know, since you've actually been showing support for us these past two Saturdays and stuff, I would actually call in.
9214231	9214691	Well, thank you.
9214711	9215993	And say, hi, guys.
9216193	9216754	Thank you so much.
9216774	9220457	You know, being able to check in and get points really helps motivate me to show.
9220498	9223861	No, I mean, obviously, I do love the points.
9223901	9226664	There's no other reason aside from going and getting points.
9226804	9232390	No, the whole reason, there's two reasons I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night when I can.
9232750	9234952	Honestly, I won't be there next Saturday, but neither will you.
9234972	9235893	And they're both disco.
9237134	9237995	There's two reasons.
9238175	9239516	One of them is disco disco.
9240257	9241458	Disco disco!
9241959	9245102	And somebody was asking me when we were going to do disco disco on Orange Launch Radio.
9245122	9246123	I said, you don't understand.
9246603	9249406	Travis already thinks I steal all the bits from Understation Live.
9250267	9250908	I'm not going to...
9251528	9255090	I'm not going to further give him evidence.
9255110	9256331	There is a ban on Disco Disco.
9256791	9260113	The closest thing, you can go Disco Disco in PlayStation Home.
9260313	9261414	That's as close as we're going to get.
9263355	9266677	But I will say the second reason is Recursive Travis.
9267257	9267558	Yes!
9268998	9270960	Recursive Travis always makes me giggle.
9270980	9274642	It doesn't matter how pissed off I am, how upset I am.
9274702	9276503	Recursive Travis just every single time.
9277268	9283432	I do love, though, that you guys... I gotta say, props to Travis, and I don't know if you're part of this effort as well.
9283472	9290036	You've gotta be cracking the whip or something behind the scenes, because Travis is now getting his podcast up, same day, which is amazing.
9290876	9296640	You know, it's all because of the VOG aura.
9296820	9299682	It's like it got into his veins or something, and now he...
9300632	9303674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9317063	9317983	Yeah, yeah, for real.
9342054	9344215	Well, Travis is now saving the Ustreams.
9344475	9348117	So if you're JVmon in our chat room asking, what is Disco Disco?
9348577	9351278	You could go to Ustream and watch.
9351658	9353039	Now you can watch and watch.
9353059	9355159	You can actually feel like you're there.
9356180	9358741	Watch me Disco Disco last week with no pants.
9359481	9360522	Yes.
9360642	9361802	And watch his, you know, beard.
9362202	9363443	Get the dirty thoughts out of your head.
9363463	9365284	You didn't see anything below the belt except my leg.
9366448	9366969	But I have.
9369711	9373294	I've just seen Robin very tight lacy panties.
9373715	9373975	What?
9374315	9374996	Not lacy.
9375376	9377839	Silky is what I meant.
9378119	9384905	You need to give some background to this because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy walking around in women's panties or something like that.
9385246	9386427	Yes, it was Rocky Horror.
9386447	9387488	There's a big difference.
9388249	9388949	There's a difference.
9388969	9390050	It's still funny to say.
9390190	9390851	There's a difference.
9393993	9396154	Is there any video games you've been playing lately, Iguana Girl?
9398356	9402298	Well, pretty much what I play over and over and over again is Lotro.
9402598	9404059	I am addicted to Lotro.
9404239	9406240	Yeah, you suck DarkSakura into that whole thing.
9406840	9407481	I'm trying to.
9409142	9411563	I see her over there once in a while and she's like, oh, it's so pretty.
9411603	9413764	I'm like, yeah, that's why I keep trying to tell you people.
9414065	9415365	It seems like it's working a little bit.
9415586	9418307	I'm trying to play it at least once a week.
9418787	9419508	At least once a week.
9419968	9423130	Because I don't know if you know about My Guild Druidia.
9424560	9426526	I was seeing something about that, yeah.
9426567	9429074	We now have an all-Druid guild called Druidia.
9429536	9431462	It was either going to be that or the Order of Vespa.
9432996	9436898	She has to fit in her time between Tumblr and Facebook, too.
9438558	9441439	I've had design work to do for reals that I'm not even getting paid for.
9441919	9443020	I'm kidding, lady.
9443100	9443620	Lighten up.
9443640	9445501	She just has such a busy gaming schedule.
9445521	9446721	She has to fit everything in.
9446881	9447681	You have a rough life.
9447701	9454384	Yeah, my Mass Effect and my Fractal and my Wow's and my Lotor's and my Stowe's.
9456664	9458966	I only have time in my life for one game.
9459746	9461587	That's my MMO addiction right there.
9462027	9462748	Hey, you know what?
9462808	9466690	Getting addicted to an MMO still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes.
9467510	9468951	See, here's how bad I am though.
9469331	9471733	When it comes to console gaming, I used to be right on top of it.
9471753	9472713	You remember how I used to be.
9474418	9476579	I don't own any modern system.
9477019	9478539	The only thing I have is a PS2.
9480420	9481080	You know what, though?
9481540	9485341	Gaming can be an expensive hobby, and there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer.
9485361	9498826	We have a lot of people listen to the show that's kind of in your boat, where it's like, you know, I'd love to have a 360 or a PlayStation 3 or whatever, but I have to buy stuff at flea markets and stuff.
9498866	9500126	I like paying my rent.
9500506	9501106	Exactly.
9501126	9501727	It helps.
9502167	9502567	But, you know...
9503887	9514093	I've gone through a lot of life changes since my gaming days I now live in a place all by myself and it's in downtown Sacramento so it's a little bit more expensive but you know
9515168	9516228	You do what you have to do.
9517509	9521630	I'm not sharing rent, so I can't go out and buy the pretty toys and what have you.
9521690	9523550	You know what we could do?
9524730	9525551	Typing of the dead.
9527711	9534673	Unfortunately, when I was going through all of my very, very difficult times, my Dreamcast was one of the things that went away.
9536098	9537820	You girls can borrow mine anytime.
9537840	9538821	You can come to my house.
9539041	9539642	If I can find it.
9540142	9540623	Yes, I could.
9541124	9544167	Yes, so we can type zombies to death at my house.
9545248	9545829	Yeah.
9545949	9548251	And as mentioned in chat, I do have Chewy as well.
9548271	9549833	You do have a Chewy and that's very important.
9550354	9552236	And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well.
9552296	9552716	And space.
9553557	9554358	A lot of my attention.
9554658	9555499	Yeah, a lot of my space.
9556500	9557401	All right.
9557502	9560085	Jessica Harper, I got to let you go to try squeezing a couple more calls.
9560125	9561127	But thanks so much for calling in.
9561147	9562088	It's so good to hear from you.
9562128	9564111	And feel free to stop by the studio anytime.
9564772	9570300	Next week might be a little crowded, but if you want to squeeze in here and say hi with everybody else, we would welcome you with open arms.
9570996	9572216	Oh, but next week I can't do.
9572417	9573917	Oh, you're going to Disneyland.
9574077	9574998	I'll be in Disneyland.
9575338	9575898	Oh, well, I can't.
9576078	9576518	You know what?
9576798	9579199	Can't blame you on that.
9579619	9580420	Real quick before I go.
9580600	9581120	Yeah.
9581580	9583641	Just for those listeners who don't normally tune in.
9583941	9584201	Yeah.
9584241	9587362	So Saturday nights, USL also on VOG Network.
9587782	9589423	So if you want to check it out, do so.
9590423	9593964	We're very happy to be a part of this and we're super excited.
9594205	9597866	So, yeah, come hang out with us and have a good show, guys.
9598186	9601967	And just to let people know, it's more the geek side of the Voice of Geeks Network.
9602067	9603207	It's, you know, tech chat.
9603307	9604348	It's sci-fi chat.
9604488	9605068	And disco.
9605268	9606608	Lots of Doctor Who parodies.
9606888	9607948	And disco disco!
9608189	9609209	And all that.
9609289	9610189	Yes, and disco disco.
9610469	9610889	And Heino.
9611309	9613030	You know, you should just write it as Disco Square.
9613590	9613930	All right.
9614790	9615670	All right, thanks, Jess.
9615710	9616271	Have a great one.
9616411	9616751	Take care.
9617091	9618011	Have fun at Disneyland.
9620633	9621634	Take me with you.
9621714	9627035	Lucky her going to Disneyland and getting to sit in that five-hour line for Radiator Springs Racers.
9627536	9628816	My wife's going to Disneyland.
9629436	9631017	Everybody's going to Disneyland but me.
9631417	9632257	Well, you can go with her.
9632457	9633358	I was just there two weeks ago.
9634058	9636619	I want to take one more trip in August.
9636759	9639620	I want Alan and I to go on a weekday after the kids are back in school.
9639740	9641501	She's trying to convince Christopher to go with her.
9641781	9642121	Oh, really?
9643035	9648497	Well, because she's going, because I said, you know, originally she wanted to take Josh and stuff.
9648537	9657140	I'm like, that's going to be a fucking pain in the ass to try to, you know, haul a little kid on a plane and he's not used to sleeping anywhere other than his crib.
9657160	9659401	So I'm like, listen, you just go because I don't ride.
9659901	9666084	I used to love, like, okay, like for some reason I'm terribly afraid of roller coasters and I don't know why because it's weird.
9666564	9666804	I am.
9667124	9669065	Like, I was terribly afraid of roller coasters.
9669325	9671426	Then one time Disneyland, it was awesome and then...
9673167	9676569	The only real rollercoaster I'll ever do is screaming.
9676649	9676969	Okay, Rob.
9677129	9678270	Alright, let me get to the phones here.
9678290	9679910	I just want to read and chat real quick, though.
9679970	9682872	BlackWolf is complaining, You guys just went.
9683272	9684893	I haven't been in over a year.
9685533	9686294	Yeah, well, still.
9686394	9687695	Two weeks is two weeks too long.
9687935	9688815	Alright, caller.
9688855	9689836	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9689856	9690256	Who's this?
9690696	9691197	Hey, what's up?
9691217	9691937	This is X-Link.
9691977	9692477	Hey, X-Link.
9692497	9693698	I haven't heard from you in a while, buddy.
9693718	9694098	How you doing?
9694118	9694518	Doing good.
9694658	9695859	BlackWolf, don't feel too bad.
9695899	9697200	I live right around the corner from...
9697600	9701681	How do you feel now that the Steam Workshop has now been available for Civ 5?
9721972	9726835	I haven't really got to play around with it yet, but I'm excited about the potential that's in there.
9726915	9735039	I mean, there's always been some great mods for Civ, so it just seems like a logical step, and I'm kind of glad that they're kind of embracing each other, Steam and Civ.
9735379	9742042	I haven't admittedly played a lot of Sim 5 ever since I got into the Mass Effect series, but I definitely want to go back and revisit it.
9742362	9748225	I heard the game fell out of balance bad with the last patch that they did, so my friends were like, I don't really want to play.
9748246	9749026	It kind of sucks right now.
9749306	9753510	But I'm imagining they fixed it with this Gods and Kings expansion.
9753830	9756073	So I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months.
9756273	9764481	Yeah, they did a lot of work on it from what I understood from this last patch alone when they were adding the Steam Network workshop onto it.
9764561	9771748	And then I'm hearing on top of that they're also going to be doing a little more odds and ends to that when Gods and Kings does come out in the following week here.
9772028	9772508	Right, right.
9773369	9779835	Which will be very interesting because knowing that you can make your own religion, it's going to be kind of interesting and intriguing to see what happens.
9779975	9781696	That is a little bit scary, but good.
9781776	9783277	I was going to flip this question on you.
9783357	9786640	What do you think about Steam Workshop and Civ integration, Civ V?
9786680	9788962	Hey, I think it's going to be pretty interesting what they're going to do.
9789082	9793986	Sharks with lasers or nuclear weapons or, you know, or bionic robots, you know.
9794006	9795748	I mean, the sky's the limit.
9795808	9801993	So, I mean, it's going to be intriguing to see what kind of different mods and stuff people are going to come up with for the game, so...
9802313	9803414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9822777	9841998	Siv 2 is my favorite Siv game so this made me smile and Sid Meier even did a reaction to it if you haven't heard basically and this was all over Reddit and all that stuff so I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this but this man has been playing his Siv game for 10 years he's now in the game I mean not obviously like straight he's been playing 10 years on and off
9842558	9847043	His world is in the year 3991 A.D.
9847703	9849485	That's a long ways into the game, trust me.
9849866	9857133	And basically his world has the Celts, the Vikings, and the Americans stuck in thermonuclear war for 1700 in-game years.
9864080	9865841	That's crazy.
9865961	9870143	They're saying, is it a strange reflection on where society is headed?
9870183	9872644	It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts this week.
9872904	9874104	Did you hear about that, XLink?
9874664	9875825	No, I did not, actually.
9875905	9877245	It's kind of intriguing hearing about that.
9877265	9879826	I'll definitely go back and reread that.
9879947	9882007	But, yeah, that's crazy.
9882187	9884648	Though I thought they could have sworn they'd stop it.
9884668	9886449	Like, at some point, they do stop the game.
9886469	9889730	Like, if you get to a certain area, it's like, you can't play it after that.
9890151	9892372	Unless it's Civ 3 or 4, I'm thinking of that.
9892392	9893492	They probably put that on there.
9893712	9895413	It must be the later Civs.
9895613	9900297	I thought the game always ended at a certain point as well, but maybe two had been left open-ended.
9900617	9901397	I can't remember.
9901818	9905260	Or maybe his game was modded somehow to let it go on forever.
9905320	9907482	I didn't read about the details on that.
9907502	9909483	In 10 years, that's a lot of time.
9909503	9914947	Hopefully, I don't know, we take maybe a turn a day or something, or a turn a week, or...
9916286	9920608	I don't know, that's very intriguing, but that's very cool nonetheless to hear about that.
9922108	9924489	Sid Meier's response was really interesting.
9924590	9930272	He said, quote, My first thought was, wow, I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2 for that long.
9930652	9937435	It's been more than 15 years since we released that game, and I don't think any of us expected a decade-long game would come out of it.
9937895	9944298	It would be amazing if we could come back in 2025 and find out if someone's had a 10-year game of Civ 5 going.
9945038	9950340	Well, you know, it's kind of like, if you look at it and the way it's played in Ran, it's kind of similar to Monopoly, really.
9950540	9956041	If you play it right, it could go on for, I could see it actually going on for that long periods of time.
9956262	9970486	If, you know, it's going back and forth type of deal and you're not really making, okay, I'm going to build up, you know, 50 units and go in there and try to, you know, and try to massive wipe these towns and cities in the short period of time.
9971198	9977022	If he's taking his time and just doing it, building, you know, say like day by day, I could actually see something like that happening probably.
9977202	9986328	Let me read this comment from JV Mon in our chat room saying, I know Civ 3 stops scoring once you hit 2050 AD, but you can keep playing if you want past that.
9986488	9987269	I think that's it.
9987329	9988109	I think that's it.
9988470	9989390	The game stops.
9989530	9991031	Yeah, I think that's exactly what it is.
9991311	9996175	But I will say this, and I know I'm going to get shit for this because he just said that he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time.
9996255	9998776	But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3?
9998816	10000718	That one's the worst one in the whole series.
10002922	10007373	I kind of agree now, especially the way that it's advanced over time.
10007413	10009137	Yeah, I can actually see that, but...
10010653	10036324	you know all the games if you go back you're like wow but it's kind of cool though it's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play from the beginning and going through and it's kind of cool like even you said yourself when you're playing Mass Effect seeing the changes that's been done from part one to part two to part three part four you know so on so forth so it's kind of cool to see the transaction and seeing what happens throughout that time period and and taking uh
10036914	10037795	DarkSakura DarkSakura
10057065	10058566	Alright, X-Link, I gotta let you go.
10058626	10060106	Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?
10060987	10062547	Not really that I can think of at this time.
10062748	10064809	I'm probably gonna go back and play some Rift now, so.
10065069	10065869	Alright, good luck.
10065909	10066509	Have fun with Rift.
10066829	10067470	Yeah, thanks.
10067490	10067950	Appreciate it.
10069771	10083377	You know, him talking about MMOs, and obviously I used to play a lot of WoW with X-Link until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding, but I was playing some of the beta this week, and I gotta say, the beta's come a long way, and I was doing some panda tanking, and it was actually quite fun.
10084665	10086066	Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call.
10086086	10093548	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10093869	10095629	Meanwhile, I got to get through some of these tweets.
10096289	10099091	I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon who said, shout out.
10099151	10100031	I actually retweeted it.
10100391	10103472	Shout out to OLR, longtime fan from many moons ago.
10103872	10105413	Rediscovered you recently.
10105813	10107834	Now listening to you live with my fiance.
10108683	10109704	Well, thank you for tuning in.
10110284	10117169	That's kind of, you know, and I realize sometimes people just don't have time for OLR anymore or kind of fall out of the habit of listening.
10117209	10119230	You know, it happens, but it's really cool.
10119310	10119591	I do.
10119811	10120972	I stop listening.
10121372	10123813	At least you haven't fallen asleep during the damn show.
10123934	10125735	I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft.
10126715	10127136	Fair enough.
10127456	10133700	Jim Sally sent a tweet that said, Hey guys, can you tell me how to spend you a tweet while you're live on air?
10134060	10136601	I wish I could figure this out, you kids and your twittering.
10137142	10140644	Well, speaking of which, let's take this phone call and see who might be there.
10140684	10141724	Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio.
10141744	10142125	Who's this?
10142205	10145147	Chugga chugga choo choo sexies.
10145687	10147088	It's Jim Sally.
10147448	10148028	Hey, baby.
10148268	10148789	Hey.
10149209	10149669	How funny.
10149749	10151130	I was just talking about you.
10151170	10152071	Were your ears burning?
10152967	10154968	A little bit, but I didn't... What did you say?
10155108	10156148	I was reading your tweet.
10157148	10158049	I wrote a tweet to you?
10158229	10158649	Oh, yeah.
10158689	10159249	Sorry about that.
10159289	10160550	Or somebody hacked your account.
10161210	10162190	No, that was me.
10162290	10166472	I was a little bit funny before, and I thought I would tell that joke.
10167372	10167992	Did you like it?
10168573	10169013	I did.
10169173	10169513	I did.
10169633	10173334	I was saying, can you tell me how to spend a tweet while you're live on the air?
10173994	10175335	You kids and your Twittering.
10176895	10179876	You pretty much got Twitter in a nutshell right there.
10179957	10180837	Bad grammar and all.
10181847	10183028	That's the Jim Sully way.
10183888	10185088	That's the Jim Sully way.
10185108	10186969	I'm making my own English.
10187309	10191170	I was just going to say, to what do we owe this great phone call tonight?
10191651	10193791	I got you another little present like you asked.
10194011	10197553	I'm the 500th person to like your Facebook page.
10198413	10199073	Get out.
10199113	10199954	That's awesome.
10200154	10200674	Thank you.
10200694	10203615	I thought as soon as you said it, I said, how come I haven't done this yet?
10205370	10208412	I felt a little ashamed, so I rectified my situation.
10208612	10209553	Thank you for the support.
10209933	10213355	What kind of prize should we give Jim Sally for being the 500th fan?
10213555	10214236	I have one.
10214596	10216597	I should get 500 VOG points.
10217778	10218578	Jamie has a prize?
10218758	10218978	Yeah.
10219279	10219539	Okay.
10224302	10225522	You got a round of applause.
10226363	10227864	I was using my slow clap processor.
10231129	10233331	So I'm not going to get the 500 VOG points.
10233891	10234311	And hearts.
10234371	10234932	You get hearts.
10235072	10236493	And you have VOG points.
10239095	10240416	Don't they go away at the end of the month?
10240456	10242237	I think someone told me to go away at the end of the month.
10242357	10242998	Sort of.
10243118	10248562	The main leaderboard is monthly, but we are still going to keep track on a year basis.
10249022	10251604	But that one is going to be a little more for fun.
10251844	10253705	And let me tell you the reason behind that.
10255526	10261430	Go back to the tweet earlier where somebody said, Hey, I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while, but I recently rediscovered you guys.
10261851	10275860	Well, if somebody kind of comes into VOG a little bit late, and we're going to be adding more shows to the network soon, so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out, we don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up or they can't ever play the game because they're never going to be able to beat the score.
10276320	10276620	So...
10277901	10282785	We're going to reset the boards every month for that reason so people have a chance to win every month.
10283325	10289009	Listen, Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG Network knows they can't keep up with Jim Salley.
10289309	10291931	So you might as well just give me the 500 points first off, okay?
10292351	10294552	Second off, it's Father's Day and I'm a good dad.
10294913	10295833	I'm a stay-at-home dad.
10295853	10300816	I work hard every day, keep my baby girl clean and pretty and nice and put her in dresses and stuff.
10301277	10306060	And all I ask for at the end of the day is maybe some extra VOG points.
10307020	10309982	and a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something.
10310282	10317107	All right, Jim Sally, just because you call in to the shows and you do show your support, I will see what we can do.
10317287	10318087	No promises.
10318527	10319448	You're the boss.
10319468	10320268	You can do it.
10321109	10327053	Now, here's the thing is that Bobby did all the coding work and he's very passionate about his game.
10327373	10328433	I'll see what we can do.
10328934	10330375	Come on, Bobby.
10331215	10333536	Bobby, don't be a douche, okay?
10333596	10334817	Give me my 500 points.
10335457	10340059	Listen, Bobby, douche wolf, you don't give me 500 points.
10340199	10341660	You're not going to win fans that way.
10342100	10343340	You win.
10343360	10343520	What?
10344041	10344921	Is that how you do it?
10345601	10347642	You catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
10349183	10351224	Listen, Bobby, I don't care about honey or vinegar.
10351284	10352524	I care about my VOG points.
10352865	10356006	Actdeft, this fucking Google Plus loving motherfucker, he's ahead of me.
10356026	10357126	And I won't have it.
10357447	10358227	And I won't have it.
10359810	10361713	I'll give him something to Google Plus about.
10362275	10363437	Jeez.
10363517	10364539	I deserve those points.
10364599	10365221	I work hard.
10365641	10367926	I think without me, where would I be?
10368764	10379871	If anything, if anything, okay, listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points, then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG Network enough, or too much.
10380032	10384034	Fine, I award you 500 points for Gryffindor!
10384835	10385875	For Gryffindor!
10387156	10388617	What is it you were going to say, Rob?
10388717	10391319	It's a bummer the points aren't compatible with each other.
10391339	10393180	Yeah, it's the conversion rates.
10393260	10395682	What is it that you were looking at me funny?
10396124	10399145	Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning very loudly.
10399565	10400786	No, it was nothing.
10400966	10401286	All right.
10401566	10403826	Jim, Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10403927	10406587	Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points?
10409568	10409888	No.
10410289	10413610	I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now.
10413630	10414870	Bobby, make it happen, Bobby.
10414910	10415390	Come on.
10415850	10416931	A lot of people are.
10417031	10417371	All right.
10418191	10418611	Take care.
10418991	10420032	Take care, Jim, Sally.
10420072	10420612	Have a good one.
10421704	10422904	Thanks for the points, Bobby.
10423005	10423765	Good night, everybody.
10448334	10449774	We are doing no such thing.
10450034	10453495	Bobby and I are already discussing something in secret.
10454035	10454755	That's all we can say.
10454795	10455416	It's in secret.
10456456	10457156	A couple more tweets.
10457176	10458436	I gotta get some of Tigerclaw's tweets.
10458456	10460997	I posted the best picture in chat, by the way.
10461077	10462937	This whole page, Tigerclaw tweets.
10463037	10465198	Okay, but I posted the best picture in chat.
10465638	10465818	What?
10465938	10466578	Of Peek-a-thoo-loo.
10467918	10469059	Tigerclaw sends us a tweet.
10469079	10470419	Tigerclaw305 on Twitter.
10470739	10474160	Microsoft's first Android title, Connectimals.
10475239	10476260	Remember Connectimals?
10476320	10477220	They're still around.
10477921	10484825	Apparently it's the first Android game that they've launched on Google Play's store, not to be confused with Google+, which we were talking about earlier.
10485926	10487027	It is out now.
10487147	10495953	It's also on iOS, just saying, but you can get it $2.99 on Google Play for Android, a little tie-in there to the Kinect game that I know Loki's a big fan of.
10497934	10498955	He gave me a big thumb.
10499135	10501737	That was a gladiator moment right there with a big thumbs down.
10503391	10505953	All right, let me read one more tweet here from Tiger Claw.
10506673	10509895	PBS taking a look at modern 8-bit culture.
10510335	10511076	That's really cool.
10511756	10513237	The evolution of 8-bit art.
10513317	10520601	I guess it's like a PBS special that's going on there that's talking about, I imagine it's gotta be things like the 8-bit exhibit and all that stuff.
10520621	10522142	Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff.
10522162	10522903	That's pretty cool.
10523644	10529211	Talking about some of the recent games like VVV, Mega Man 9, and some of that stuff that's really caught on.
10529231	10529852	That's really cool.
10530413	10531534	And murals and so forth.
10531594	10531995	You know what?
10532095	10534779	It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods and all that.
10534859	10539305	So I can totally see why it's in our popular culture and all that.
10539785	10548610	Anyway, I got to close up the tweeters, close up the mailbag, close up the phone because it is about closing time here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10548630	10550411	We got to wrap up the show and say goodnight.
10550751	10554654	I want to check in with Loki one more time to see if he has any other last minute stories.
10555734	10563496	Nope Alright, then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk about this What is this that you brought?
10563636	10577320	The FP It's basically a movie where there's these two post-apocalyptic gangs that compete and fight each other by playing DDR Wasn't that in a Madonna video?
10577880	10585002	Hated it It's really cheesy I don't know It's a screener I had
10585475	10586736	I'll have to check that out at some point.
10588037	10588357	All right.
10589678	10593180	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10593661	10597603	My final thought tonight is dinner.
10598504	10599925	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10602146	10602707	Peek-a-thoo-loo.
10603687	10605809	And Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
10606930	10612854	My final thought is this mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter, Zombie Playground, looks too much like Pedo Bear.
10613494	10614515	It's Pedo Raccoon.
10618038	10619800	That is Pedo Raccoon for sure.
10620461	10622103	And Zombie Pedo Raccoon.
10622483	10623604	But that is Pedo Raccoon.
10623985	10624305	Fun!
10625486	10625767	Wow.
10626539	10626899	All right.
10627440	10633404	Hey, before we close up shop here, I just want to say thank you guys very much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
10633764	10636866	Thank you for your support over the past nine years and 51 weeks.
10637166	10640308	You know, all we ask, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.
10640368	10641469	Help spread the word.
10641829	10645672	Hey, we got fans 499 and 500 tonight on Facebook.
10645692	10646873	That's exactly what we're talking about.
10647233	10648694	I know 500 was Jim Sally.
10648714	10653877	I don't know where 499 came from, but thank you, whoever that was and whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio.
10654177	10656339	Help us spread the word, word of mouth and all that.
10657920	10666026	And as you know from behind the scenes stuff, there will be easier and more ways to spread that word soon enough.
10666486	10666907	Uh-huh.
10667027	10667587	Very true.
10667707	10668147	Very true.
10668187	10668848	We've seen things.
10669789	10677517	And also, I want to say, next week is the 10-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
10677937	10684223	Please help spread the word, especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while, such as the Twitter comment I read earlier.
10685044	10688207	I would really love to hear from the folks from OLR's past.
10688587	10694453	The Skype line will be open in about an hour after the show to take your calls and messages.
10695173	10698555	if you have anything you want to leave for us to play next week.
10698715	10703297	I'm really looking forward to it and I kind of can't believe it.
10703377	10705338	That's why we haven't said much about it.
10705378	10706699	We kind of can't believe it.
10706739	10707760	It's been 10 years.
10708600	10709701	Shit, we are old.
10710201	10711161	It's our 10-iversary.
10711922	10716064	We'll be back next week to celebrate 10 years of Orange Lounge Radio.
