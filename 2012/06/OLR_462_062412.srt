00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're listening to The Bog Network. Up next, the show where every gamer has a voice.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio, live.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good evening, everyone. Pekaruno here from the UK.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I just wanted to congratulate all of you at Orange Lounge Radio for your tin jubilee.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Over the past ten years, you have provided top-notch video game news in a passionate, entertaining, but most of all, refined way.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Even though I have not been the most regular of listeners, it is obvious to me just how much you care about both your hobby and your dedicated fans.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and all of your guests and listeners, congratulations once again, and long may you broadcast over us.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hi guys, it's your friendly Jessica Harper from Under Station Wives, just wishing you guys a happy ten years, and looking forward to many more with you guys.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Love the connection that we have between the shows, and definitely looking forward to sharing more in the future.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Happy anniversary. Bye.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, what's up? This is Tigerclaw. I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy tenth anniversary.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been listening to the radio show for many, many years now, and I really hope you guys continue doing this for ten more years.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Have a great show, and take care.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey, it's Oscar calling in to wish you guys a happy ten year anniversary, and why stop there?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just continue for like another hundred years, because you guys are going to live forever, right? Right? Right?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want you old and wrinkly in wheelchairs and doing this show while playing DDR with your wheels or something. Okay, I'm done. Bye.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey guys, it's Sturlok here, and I can't believe you guys have been doing this thing for ten years. That is awesome.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I think I've been listening for about five of those years, and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and Black Wolf.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago, and that was a lot of fun.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So have an awesome teniversary, and hey, maybe you guys will make it to another ten years. That would be awesome.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Anyway, stay black.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, aka YYR. Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR dream game Bungie Farah Tossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it. I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives, thank you slaves, but I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last ten years, so Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's up, OLR? It's Zether. I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say they're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to, because if you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts, I like that.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love the Classic Game of the Week segment. It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for ten years, starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining, too.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, yeah, congrats, guys. Congrats on the ten years. Hopefully, you can do ten more of this, maybe. I don't know. Congrats.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, Orange Balance Radio. This is Bletch N'Zoth. We're wishing you the best. Ten years. Ten years. That's pretty long for a radio that started off as doing D.J. Armbarmani and then morphing into video games, but still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.

32
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years, and for that, I tip my hat to you, and no, I'm not drunk or hot. Have a good one.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey, D.J. Armbarmanis here from Anime Jam Session. I've been a listener of Orange Balance Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The OLR community is not just friends. It's become a massive, wonderful family, and as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that. They all talk about video games, a game of culture, and a game of lifestyle, but there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us, and we have to sit and discuss, which I think is great.

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:05,000
OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose, but when you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.

36
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's like you got different rankings of it, and that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years. As for me, I admire them, and I totally respect them for what they do,

37
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match, and from that point on, I said, you know, I want to do something like this,

38
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and because of what they do, and what I do with Anime Jam Session, with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting our own family thing, and if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I am eternally thankful for their contribution, and in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people, so to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you, congratulations on 10 years, and I will be around for another 10 more. Take care.

40
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki!

41
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Orange Lounge Radio

43
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. Established 2002.

44
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-hosts. Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

45
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.

46
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It took me about 7 to get it right.

47
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sakura!

48
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.

49
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sakura!

50
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's been some bad ones in the past.

51
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There have been.

52
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you gonna make me go back into the archive?

53
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No I'm not, no I'm not.

54
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do I have to go back into the archive?

55
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think you're making me go back into the archive.

56
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.

57
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you? It's disturbing me a little bit.

58
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But Garris.

59
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Alright, hold on, hold on. What do I have here? We have, uh.

60
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was still tempted to go after Thame, but Garris.

61
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But Garris, let's see.

62
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's the answer to everything from here out, but Garris.

63
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let me dip back into the archives here since DarkSakura made me do it.

64
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Make you do shit.

65
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's see how I pronounce her name.

66
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

67
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

68
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Any arcade.

69
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.

70
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh yeah.

71
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And so many different arcades.

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She gets around.

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes, I will spank your child.

75
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you're not gonna do your job, god damn it, I will.

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There you go.

79
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
In the meantime, enjoy.

80
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That was episode one right there. Episode one.

81
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That was the little promo cut from episode one.

82
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Has your opinion changed after ten years?

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And now I'm happy being the aunt.

87
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.

88
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's a great arrangement.

89
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, it's perfect.

90
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let me go also, of course, to the man who wasn't even supposed to be here today in the beginning.

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But we just, he loved the show so much we made him a third co-host.

92
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And it's honestly, he retroactively is a host from episode zero through twenty.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Because how could he not be a full-time host orange entree.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The show would not be the same without him.

95
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Techmaster Loki.

96
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hi.

97
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How are you, Loki?

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have a headache.

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Aww.

100
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All this time later and now you have a headache.

101
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it.

104
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But caffeine will work.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Nah, probably not. But we'll try.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the tenth anniversary of OLR.

107
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Um, McDonald's because it was very late.

108
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And that's really the only reason why.

109
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's because I had to get some, I was like, sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something.

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I need to just stop what I'm doing.

112
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I need to leave now.

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VoG Network.

116
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The Voice of Geeks Network where we tape live six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

118
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
www.vognetwork.com

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,

121
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OLR was two hours?

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It kind of outgrew that time frame.

123
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast,

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.

125
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20 minute show.

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, that didn't work out so well.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SSG100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.

128
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Arigato.

129
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All right.

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm getting better.

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're getting better.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A little better, a little bit.

134
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's only taken me 10 years.

135
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All right.

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.

137
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We've filled things up here in the OLR studio tonight.

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show.

139
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And I want to say hello to them for a little bit.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Up first.

141
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Rob, is your guy doing the Cabbage Patch?

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, I am in the-

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Lord.

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
On a DDR machine nonetheless.

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Dark Soccer is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse,

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
which I think I'm the only one in right now.

147
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And he's doing the freaking Cabbage Patch.

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
On a DDR machine.

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?

150
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
By doing a dance from the 80s.

151
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We turning 10.

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We turning 10.

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank God this is radio.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Huh.

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And it's radio.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You'll never get to see it.

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But these guys just saw that.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Say hello.

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Joining us all the way from St. Louis, Missouri.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Say hello to Misty.

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because I know you're wondering, between delays, layovers, and actual travel time,

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
it took about three days to get here.

165
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now that's because you don't fly.

166
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Exactly.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But you took the train.

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But you're like a huge train fan.

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're a train fanatic.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yet I never rode on trains.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was this really weird thing.

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You are so fired.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I guess not.

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So.

177
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Alright, anyhow.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, hello to you.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How are you today, I guess?

180
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Very good.

181
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What made you want to be here for tonight's show?

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Gee, I wonder.

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Gee.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It is kind of a big deal.

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Alright, say hello as well.

186
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Joining us from, I don't remember exactly what suburb.

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I just say New York City.

188
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's kind of like, we're in the Bay Area, although not really.

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This next guest is from New York City.

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Say hello to JV Mon.

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hello, everybody.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
How are you doing?

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Good, and you?

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Good.

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your first time on OLR.

196
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
First time in person, yeah.

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, it's kind of hard to be on the show when you're 3,000 miles away.

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

199
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Where in the city are you exactly?

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

202
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, so you're in, okay.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can never remember.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a big city.

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a big place.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And it's far away.

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I went once.

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah?

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Once.

210
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Once?

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What did you do in New York City?

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, nothing.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Just played at Carnegie Hall.

214
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, okay.

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Just a little something something.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Band trip.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What brings you to California?

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That and my sister also, yes, just for that.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Nothing else, no.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I've just been here for like the past week.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I was like, oh, my vacation comes inside with the 10th anniversary.

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Might as well make a visit.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What a nice convenience.

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry that the drive was all trafficy.

227
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're trying to get here today.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No, yeah.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, Pecorino says, my fellow, you're a beat nerd.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Am I?

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My name does come from Digimon, yes.

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Bimon was my favorite Digimon growing up.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Growing up.

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.

239
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think Dar Sakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you very much.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Thank you very much.

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The show we started in our...

244
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's in another 10 years.

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You do the math.

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's okay.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We feel young, and that's the important thing.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Now get off my lawn.

250
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No.

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is the Metreon even still open?

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I haven't been to the Metreon since like 2004.

256
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Metreon was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago.

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Like there was an epic, you know, one where they gave away a DDR machine,

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and then they had that epic arcade, and they had all the crane machines,

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and they had the oops cat.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What the hell?

262
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oops, I went to hell store.

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What was her name?

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That mascot.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I used to love those shirts.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Somebody in chow will think of it.

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then there's the official Sony store was there as well.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And now they're talking about putting a Target in there.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The fuck?

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And look, I love Target, but...

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You know they have like the gamer walk of fame?

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh yeah.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That little catwalk thing?

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They do. That's right. That is there.

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it,

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and so half of it was like white, and the other half of it was like DDR machine,

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and even the screen was faded.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was awful to play on.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But Garris.

280
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Since it's my first vacation in like four years, and my first time out here in like eight,

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Touristy stuff?

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I've been pretty much at all the tourist tracks.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You went to Pier 39, and Alcatraz, and Napa.

286
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I went to Sonoma, not Napa.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, excuse me, princess!

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's all booze.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I got myself lots and lots of wine. I was very happy.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Good times.

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became. I saw the Riptire arcade was gone.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yep, that we...

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I cried a little bit. I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That was actually, I gotta say, that was one of our earliest achievements really as a station,

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
was that we did, we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments,

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and we did the Sacramento ones, of course, we broadcast.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Not that very first one in Folsom, because we didn't really have the ability to do it,

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but I know we did a couple from Scandia,

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and then we took our rig all the way to the Bay Area and broadcast live from that.

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I think the tournament was called B3, and it was a great time.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because that was when me and Megumi decided we were going to just leave the second day.

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Awesome. So, yeah, good times.

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay, and when do you leave?

305
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's not talk about that on air. Maybe after the show.

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Whoops.

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
All right.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You heard nothing.

310
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.

311
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.

312
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe later, if you're good.

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's right. Of course.

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We're going to have a poetry slam.

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR, like by pure coincidence.

317
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We implanted that way, but my birthday is Tuesday, so, you know, yay, I'm old.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All right.

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Also joining us tonight, now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's the one person I know was here for episode one that has been here for pretty much every single episode since.

321
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, give or take a couple.

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He probably tuned into it on the podcast at some point.

323
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, here in the studio tonight, OLR's oldest listener.

324
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know, not like actual age, but like how long he's been listening.

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Say hello to Dark Tetsuya.

326
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey, guys.

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How you doing, Dark Tetsuya? You might want to talk to this mic.

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, good, good.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So, what's new?

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.

331
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Not us.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one,

333
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What's changed in 10 years?

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, well, DDR kind of died.

336
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If you were in PlayStation Home right now, it would look like it's still – look at that.

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tiger Claw got up on the machine with me, and now we're both dancing.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You would think DDR is all the rage if you were in the VOG Clubhouse right now on Home.

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So, it's still the rage.

340
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What has kept you motivated to listen to this show over the past 10 years?

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know, just, you know, being able to hang out with you guys all this time.

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you hear that, Dark Sakura? We're awesome.

343
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I know, and old.

344
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Dark Tetsuya, if this happens to be somebody's first week listening to OLR,

345
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
what piece of advice would you give them about the show?

346
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, man, I – put me on the spot here.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know, man, just –

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Be prepared for anything.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Absolutely. It's live and uncensored.

351
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Say hello, final guest tonight.

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's right, the OLR ferret is in the house.

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Actually, this is the OLR ferret's cousin because we don't know where the original OLR ferret is,

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.

356
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Thanks to the magic of radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.

357
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There you go, OLR ferret there in the house.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, there we are.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.

360
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.

361
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And, you know, the scene was really hopping then.

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There was tournaments and, you know, all these things that would go on, a huge website, DDR Freak, that everybody posted on.

364
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was a really big community.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And because I was co-participating in a show about another community, a Rocky Horror Picture Show show called Under Sedation Live,

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
that was born of that community, I kind of had that seed planted in my head.

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And Dark Sakura did as well, having guessed it on that show so many times.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Hey, why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.

370
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And that's kind of what happened.

371
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob. Thank you.

372
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You're welcome. Anytime.

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, and here we are 10 years later.

374
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.

375
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We went from being two hours to three hours.

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And then, you know, we've been on three different networks now.

378
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And it's just it's been a crazy ride.

379
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But here we are. Some things stay the same.

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And here we are after 10 years.

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it.

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Whether you started listening last week or this week or your dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between.

383
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for Dark Soccer and Loki.

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll let them speak in a minute here.

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But if you ask me what kind of motivates me over the past 10 years to continue to do this show and I get asked this quite often by other podcasters.

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You know, there's a lot of great people that have achieved a lot of great things out in podcasting.

387
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But occasionally I get asked from a podcaster who's been doing it for six months.

388
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This is a lot of work. How have you done this for the past 10 years?

389
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody is listening.

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And by somebody, I mean one person listening is is an amazing accomplishment.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I mean, it really is. And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.

392
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It is it is a true community that we've built here.

393
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I mean, it's a small community. We're not IGN.

394
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We're not one of the top shit. We're not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And, you know, it's it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.

397
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You know, because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Once in a while, we might then get in big trouble for it.

399
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But it's it's awesome that, you know, you guys turn it tune in to hear our opinions.

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And we're so thankful. Dark Soccer, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

401
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, my God. Actually, I just got a link from one of our listeners who wrote us,

402
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
who played a happy birthday song for us on Ukulele on YouTube.

403
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm going to send this to you. Really? He used to work with Dan.

404
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, yeah. Well, is it safe to play on air?

405
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I can't hear it on here. So I guess that's the only way we'll find out.

406
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
All right. I'll cue it up. But in the meantime.

407
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But my motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.

408
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And Garris.

409
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Garris is the reason for life.

410
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No, it's pretty much what you said. That and, you know, needing my ego.

411
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
To be petted like it's a fine Persian cat.

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You want your E-peen to be huge.

413
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No, I want my E-vage to be tight.

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Wow.

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I've been waiting to say that for a while.

416
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Wow. That's one to send to Travis. All right.

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

418
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm motivated. It's news to me.

419
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Bacon. Bacon has kept you motivated.

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know. I just come here every week.

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, you know, I you and I personally went through some really big changes.

422
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm sure Dark Sakura too. But I'm thinking of, you know,

423
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you had a big personal life thing happen during the show.

424
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I had a big personal life thing happen during the show where I was very sick and I damn near died.

425
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I think you heard Rama say it there in the little piece of the opening there.

426
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like sometimes we kind of get into these things about our lives that really have nothing to do with gaming.

427
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But the fact that you guys still like care like means a lot.

428
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And, you know, I know there was a lot of people thinking of me when that was going on,

429
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
thinking of you when you had your crisis going on, thinking of Dark Sakura.

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't know when she gets sick every week. No, I'm sure Dark Sakura had something.

431
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't get sick every week.

432
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Every other week.

433
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I started a job.

434
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Actually, you did. Well, you. Well, OK.

435
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The chatters thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?

436
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah. And I actually I was doing the show when I had the plague.

437
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's true.

438
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I remember when I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.

439
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So. But the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot anyway.

440
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Just saying. All right. That's not good for anybody involved.

442
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Look, I just want to plug this to as well.

443
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Vogue network dot com. The voice of Geeks Network.

444
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
As you know, our third network where we've done O.L.R., it's new.

445
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's still kind of got the new paint smell.

446
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
There's lots of exciting things that are happening at Vogue Network.

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Our forums just got a facelift this week. They look great.

448
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I do want to plug as well. Make sure you check into tonight's show.

449
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If you're listening live, you get a special piece of one time loop for listening.

450
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Podcast listeners, I'm so sorry we don't have anything for you yet in that regard.

451
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But I do want you to know we are working on podcast listeners being rewarded as well.

452
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Keep in mind the site is only a month old and we have one guy, Bobby Black Wolf.

453
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
He's the man building it all.

454
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So do you know, we want to be fair for everybody and let the podcast folks have their say too.

455
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But we just need a little more time to get all that program.

456
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So bear with us.

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

458
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So am I going to play this? Am I going to play the birthday song here?

459
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This is a birthday song from, what's the name he goes by now?

460
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Shezro? Is his name online I think?

461
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Here we go. I'm going to play this YouTube here.

462
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Hey, what's up guys? It's your boy, Scarzo.

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Just want to give a quick birthday shout out to the one and only OLR aka Orange Lounge Radio.

464
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Man, ten freaking years. Ten years running strong, making a kick ass live show and a wonderful podcast.

465
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart, I mean heart, yeah.

466
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So anyway, before this video gets...

467
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Did he say the bottom of his fart?

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.

469
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
His fucking heart.

470
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But he censored himself and then it made it sound like he said fart.

471
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Camp, I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts.

472
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And when I think about you, you make me wanna...

473
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Too long, I take too much of your time.

474
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm just going to play a song for you real quick. Check it out.

475
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Lounge Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.

476
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The show rocks. Like who else is going to get serenaded by a ukulele?

477
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's awesome.

478
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's so awesome. Thank you so much for that.

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm dying to know what this related video here is on the side that says Asian Giggles.

480
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I guess I'll have to find out another time.

481
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Because we have to get into our gaming weeks and the type of stuff that you have been playing this week, your gaming week.

482
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
How was it? Dark Soccer, starting us off tonight.

483
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Garris.

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because I, when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for 11 bucks with the first one, thank you Shane.

485
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.

486
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.

487
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
She is amazing. I love her so much. You'll love her.

488
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But it came with the, whatever. Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.

489
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.

490
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.

491
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well that's why he makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.

492
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And Grunt kind of is weird but yeah, so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garris again because I was happy.

493
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And I've, so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I, and I was already a little sick.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And I got so motion sick playing it doing the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.

495
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
OMG spoilers in those first five minutes. Whatever.

496
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about 10 minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5am.

497
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wow this morning.

498
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
How is Sil gonna feel that too much Mass Effect made you miss Girls Gone Wow Wednesdays on VOG?

499
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That I was also like really not feeling well. Oh I'm sorry.

500
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I missed seeing Brave this morning too because Dan was going to take me to see Brave and I was like I didn't sleep.

501
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And then I apparently texted you in my sleep.

502
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Well you're not alone in your love for Garris by the way we have Fifth Dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I have girlgasms for Garris and I'm a boy.

503
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay see see. Anyway so I did actually play some World of Warcraft like for because we have the Druid Guild, Druidia. So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.

504
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids. Don't you think so?

505
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And Rob's got one in there. Miss Nomi Malone. I do I have Nomi Malone. I'm a dancer not a stripper. Yeah.

506
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So I did a little bit of that and I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Which I mean because like six hours I check it do more missions turn it off check it another six hours you know because that's how long it takes.

508
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.

509
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Awesome. I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one. Right?

510
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Garris. Like it's not that the first one's a bad game. Bitch needs to give me his mission.

511
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He will soon. He needs to give you more than that I imagine. Some bird love.

512
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Alright anyhow anything else in your gaming week DarkSira? Mario Marathon.

513
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh yes this is the weekend for them. That was sort of part of my gaming week because we watched people in odd Mario costumes with a neat looking game room play Mario.

514
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
They were on 64 when I stopped watching.

515
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I almost feel bad because we have some people that have been tweeting us and so forth saying that they stopped watching Mario Marathon to come you know to our 10th anniversary show.

516
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Which I deeply appreciate I almost feel bad because that's a charity event but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating and I figure you know if you're watching them for 72 hours you can spare one for us.

517
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And since we aren't asking for donations tonight we will say go donate to a great charity child's play through Mario Marathon.

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well Dan and I donated and if you look at when they hit level 72 you will see Dan and Jamie parentheses OLR.

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh nice.

520
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So that's our donation put them to level 72.

521
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Very cool.

522
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So go look at their page and give them some money after the show.

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Awesome. Let's move on and Tech Master Loki how was your gaming week?

524
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I played Minecraft. More Minecraft. I've been working on the mine cart track entrance to my giant volcano thing.

525
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
How are you dealing with Friday's patch?

526
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh it's just fine. There's still way to do pin it so it doesn't matter.

527
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Of course. Of course where there's a will there's a way.

528
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And then what else. Oh I played Lollipop Chainsaw and I'm disappointed.

529
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and you know over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.

530
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
How is that possible?

531
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I mean you just can't but yet they found a way to do it.

532
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And yes it is an incredibly boring game that I literally said I'm not playing the same word.

533
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That's really disappointing.

534
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

535
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I want to play it.

536
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I know I still want to play it.

537
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's my friend's copy.

538
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh.

539
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Don't.

540
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Anything else?

541
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
A little bit Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3 and yeah that was it.

542
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So I didn't play a lot of new games this week but I think I might have a problem.

543
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Because here's the thing.

544
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So I have Mass Effect on Xbox right?

545
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And Dark Soccer.

546
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh shoot.

547
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I know right. I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.

548
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's all right. No because wait till what I'm going to say next.

549
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC and then Alan plays it on PC as well and he's like oh the graphics are better and da da da da da.

550
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Which is true.

551
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Your video card will look so nice.

552
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Da da da.

553
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.

554
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So I was like ah all right I'll buy it.

555
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'll buy it.

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again and this time I'm playing as her Renegade and da da da.

557
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99.

558
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC.

559
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's right.

560
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now.

561
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long when I haven't been doing stuff for the show.

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't feel bad anymore.

563
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like it is addicting.

564
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And I got to say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war.

565
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
There's advantages to both.

566
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
There really are.

567
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I do miss playing on my TV.

568
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller.

569
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But I got to say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse.

570
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with the controller.

571
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and mouse.

572
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm so much better with it.

573
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And like I am kicking ass with my engineers which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
My little combat drones and setting people on fire.

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's amazing.

576
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm playing in Adept.

577
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So but I have literally bought the same game.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Same three games.

579
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Twice.

580
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
On two different systems.

581
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I have a problem.

582
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Loki do I have a problem?

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He's nodding yes I have a problem.

584
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You know what Rob don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.

585
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.

586
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Alright.

587
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Otherwise that was pretty much it as far as like making.

588
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing things on the iPhone and so forth.

589
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But not a lot of new stuff.

590
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So that's really it for my gaming week.

591
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Let's all and yeah.

592
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
This is the really sad part.

593
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You ready?

594
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Olenko says Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.

595
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding sky.

596
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots.

597
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week.

598
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with the keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking.

599
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh my God maybe I should like get into first person shooters.

600
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
What is happening to me?

601
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Well you know how I got into PC gaming right?

602
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What?

603
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
My hand.

604
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh yeah because when your hand was was not as well.

605
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And I'm doing all this with a trackball.

606
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So.

607
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But like I literally sat there today like seriously you guys have listened to the show a long time.

608
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Many of you.

609
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You guys on the couch you've all been listening for a long time.

610
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I sat there looking at the PC going.

611
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe I should give battlefield a try.

612
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Something's happening to me and I don't like it.

613
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Suddenly I want to play first person shooter.

614
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Are you feeling not so fresh?

615
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This is so weird.

616
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Like am I going to want Madden next?

617
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Rob needs a gaming douche.

618
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Oh my God.

619
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Anyhow.

620
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I think I may have to try.

621
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.

622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Chat.

623
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm going to ask chat.

624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Chatters.

625
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What first person shooter should I play next?

626
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer.

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
What first person shooter should I play next?

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch.

629
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.

630
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Misty how was your gaming week?

631
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
More than, it was actually more existent than I anticipated.

632
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And even for being on a train.

633
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,000
StepMania oddly works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.

634
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.

635
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Dabbled at Pocket Planes a bit.

636
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That seems to be it.

637
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Alright.

638
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Playing games on the train.

639
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Going faster than the speed of light.

640
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Not really but.

641
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Going to our chat room.

642
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I want to see some of the comments here.

643
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Let's see.

644
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Jim Sally says Battlefield on PC.

645
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Nietzsche says Battlefield 3.

646
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Act Def says screw that get Team Fortress 2.

647
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I do like Team Fortress.

648
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I have played a little Team Fortress.

649
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That is kind of fun actually.

650
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Because I like playing a healer in that and using the little like bandaging gun.

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's actually kind of fun.

652
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's like the opposite of other first person shooters where you're not shooting things.

653
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You're like shooting them with life.

654
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Dark Knight says Monday Night Combat.

655
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I've heard that one's pretty good.

656
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Drunami says Gears of War.

657
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I see a lot of people seeing Halo.

658
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
See I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.

659
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You guys keep shouting Halo 4.

660
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I can't play a game that's not out yet.

661
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I was not in love with Halo 3 I got to say.

662
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny.

663
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I do have that on Steam.

664
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I tried to play that for a little bit.

665
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So maybe I should go back and do that.

666
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Zether says Quake Live.

667
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I do love Quake.

668
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Quake is real good.

669
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So thank you for the suggestion.

670
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I second Borderlands because you like loot right?

671
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?

672
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I like loot at vognetwork.com.

673
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Well I'm just saying that you can also.

674
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That's basically a first person shooter with a lot of loot.

675
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That's cool.

676
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You like tons of weapons.

677
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I like shinies.

678
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's funny.

679
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Alright I think Borderlands might be a winner.

680
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'll have to check that out.

681
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Is there multiplayer in Borderlands?

682
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
4 player co-op.

683
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh sweet.

684
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Kind of like Mass Effect.

685
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I like co-op shooters because people are nicer on that.

686
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Like I have yet to meet jerks on Mass Effect.

687
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
One thing that really annoyed me about Mass Effect though.

688
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I forgot to say this.

689
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Okay buying it on Best Buy.

690
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Fuck that Best Buy front end program that I had to use to download it.

691
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Because once I downloaded it.

692
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.

693
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Thank God it took my key.

694
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I had to re-download.

695
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I had to download 10 gigs twice.

696
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Because that stupid Best Buy front end program can't talk to Origin.

697
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.

698
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.

699
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I mean it's fucking better when it's all your games right?

700
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But.

701
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah I was really pissed at having to download 10 gigs of stuff twice.

702
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Anyway.

703
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Hi JV Mon.

704
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Sorry.

705
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Hello.

706
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
How was your gaming week?

707
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Pretty good.

708
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I've been playing Vita and 3DS.

709
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah?

710
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah.

711
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

712
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Luminous Electronic Symphony.

713
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Pokemon Black.

714
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.

715
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Nice.

716
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.

717
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.

718
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well I reserved a copy of Gravity Rush at work.

719
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But the shipment never came in before I left for work the day before I flew out here.

720
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So I'm kind of sad I didn't get to play that because the demo was so good.

721
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You know what I need to get the demo for since you brought up 3DS.

722
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance demo.

723
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yes.

724
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah I want to check that out.

725
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Bobby's talking about tonight.

726
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I just played that too.

727
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That was pretty good.

728
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Nice.

729
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Nice.

730
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And what else have I been playing?

731
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Civilization III even though you'd think it's terrible.

732
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Worst one in the series but okay whatever.

733
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Don't worry Rob everyone's allowed to be wrong.

734
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's right you are allowed to be wrong.

735
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm just saying Civ V is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week.

736
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like 3 days later.

737
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'll probably check out Civ V once my boyfriend gets a better PC.

738
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization.

739
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Okay that's cool.

740
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah I think Civilization III is like the most recent one he can run on his computer.

741
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh I see it's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old for lack of a better term.

742
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah.

743
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Alright.

744
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Dark Tetsuya what have you been playing this week in gaming?

745
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Not too much I mean a little dusted off the 2DS controller played a little bit of that.

746
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We can barely hear you so I'm going to have you switch mics.

747
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Dusted off the 2DS controller.

748
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.

749
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Let's see a little bit of StepMania.

750
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play till I drop.

751
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers Wii trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.

752
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And a little bit of Mario Kart.

753
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but hey that's whatever.

754
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about.

755
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.

756
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We went on an adventure to break the law.

757
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
No we thought about it but we went to Roseville Golf Land.

758
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Which you know we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.

759
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It is the place we all met right?

760
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Milpitas.

761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land it gets sadder and sadder.

762
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So Misty and I went this weekend.

763
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.

764
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Easy.

765
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And let me put it this way.

766
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like.

767
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh my God they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.

768
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.

769
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the next two.

770
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Didn't even touch the Disney Mix.

771
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I played doubles on Disney Mix.

772
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I played doubles on Disney Mix.

773
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Because I'm hardcore.

774
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Anyhow.

775
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Alright.

776
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
That's enough for our gaming weeks.

777
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let's move on folks.

778
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We got to get into the news tonight.

779
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
A little bit of housekeeping.

780
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.

781
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Part B. There's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.

782
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Just you guys.

783
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Emails, tweets and phone calls.

784
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.

785
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Or get the phone number down.

786
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

787
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.

788
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But for now let's get to tonight's news.

789
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.

790
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yes.

791
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's talk about...

792
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's kind of a duh.

793
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because we knew that there was a new system coming.

794
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Just...

795
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We thought that would be a little something something extra on there.

796
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But it's not.

797
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.

798
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS.

799
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No duh.

800
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And it doesn't have another circle pad.

801
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It only has one circle pad.

802
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What are they doing?

803
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the circle pad pro and other accessories.

804
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like the...

805
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't think it works with the...

806
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Circle pad pro attachment?

807
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Like the circle pad pro attachment.

808
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

809
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So Nintendo really just fucked that thing didn't they?

810
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah.

811
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's hilarious too because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the circle pad.

812
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Except um...

813
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now.

814
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Well...

815
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No there probably was supposed to be a circle pad there but they didn't want to like...

816
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Admit failure so they just said...

817
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We'll just put it out larger.

818
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Is it possible that they might release a circle pad pro XL and in a smart move this time not make it exclusive to one store?

819
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So that maybe I'll get one?

820
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So how wide is this thing gonna be?

821
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I mean seriously if it's larger as it is I gotta add something on top of that?

822
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's gonna be like 4 feet long.

823
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I mean...

824
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's ridiculous.

825
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Why would we...

826
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.

827
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Well not that I would necessarily have to buy the circle pad pro because I'm not playing any games that would...

828
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Utilize it like Resident Evil which was apparently not very great.

829
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.

830
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
If you're a lefty you get a lot of use out of it especially in like Kid Icarus and some of that.

831
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Um...

832
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well...

833
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You would if you know...

834
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You can hold on to...

835
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah if you can actually hold the thing yeah.

836
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I...

837
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
There's a lot I like about the XL.

838
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I mean obviously if you've played a DSi XL those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen.

839
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You know it's really cool.

840
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So I like the idea that there's gonna be a 3DS that's huge like that.

841
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.

842
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.

843
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Um...

844
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But yeah I mean the bigness is gonna be nice it's gonna make the games look even better.

845
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Which is exciting but then I...

846
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The realist in me is like dude you already have a 3DS you don't need another one.

847
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I mean yeah it has better battery life.

848
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Whatever there's no...

849
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
There's really no must have thing.

850
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
If you need more battery life you can buy an extra battery for like another 30 bucks instead of buying a new system for another $200.

851
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
If I...

852
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah if I didn't have a 3DS I'd buy this.

853
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.

854
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
He's gonna be like Rob I want that for Christmas.

855
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Anyways yeah the new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.

856
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to...

857
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.

858
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And apparently I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff it's actual size for you know the regular DS.

859
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Which would be nice because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS.

860
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Although I didn't play that many DS games so who knows.

861
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And of course yeah price $1.99.

862
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So August 19th.

863
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Alrighty and that's the same day that that...

864
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I know this isn't coming up on our show roll so we can mention here that Mario...

865
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
New Super Mario Brothers 2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game.

866
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
With the whole DLC.

867
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Now Nintendo is like alright I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.

868
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I guess that's kind of where things are going.

869
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video this is a full featured game out of the box.

870
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.

871
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And why should I buy the DLC?

872
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean I don't know they're just experimenting.

873
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.

874
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They have never been online before.

875
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What a decade into the internet or two decades into the internet.

876
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And this is their first time getting online.

877
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.

878
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You know some things never change.

879
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Why is it talking to me?

880
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.

881
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Some things have to stay the same.

882
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
They need to grow up though.

883
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Going to some comments in our chat room.

884
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I almost said the old one there.

885
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.

886
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen.

887
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So it's less pixel depth.

888
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm still getting one.

889
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
YYR says I mean it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.

890
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And I guess that's oh the whole fact about the DSi XL. What the hell is going to happen to that?

891
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That's a good question.

892
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Will that go down in price?

893
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I imagine they've got to phase out the old DS.

894
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May.

895
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Might have to drop it again.

896
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He makes a point there.

897
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Only $30 difference.

898
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That's going to really kill the DSi XL.

899
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
They need to put that out for $99.

900
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Tigerclaw in chat asks a Nintendo related question.

901
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Says Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC,

902
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?

903
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It depends what new awesome thing they're going to put on it.

904
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You're also assuming I'm going to buy a Wii U.

905
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I may not at this point.

906
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It really depends on how great those games are.

907
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So we'll see.

908
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Let's move on to some more news. This is Nintendo related.

909
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's about a highly anticipated Nintendo game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

910
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
We knew that Nintendo was working on this game,

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
but what we didn't know that was announced this past week,

912
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Namco Bandai is involved, and Bandai Namco both ways.

913
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Both those studios are helping on the game.

914
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.

915
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.

916
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That's interesting.

917
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.

918
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And for the haters, I just want to remind you,

919
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega,

920
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.

921
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So, but then I think, all right,

922
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.

923
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M.

924
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I didn't dislike it as much as other people did,

925
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M.

926
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So what do you guys think? Namco Bandai is involved now.

927
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I think that means it's pretty obvious.

928
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We're going to see some Namco characters show up now

929
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake

930
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and all those characters before.

931
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We're going to get what? We'll have Pac-Man.

932
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari to Mashi,

933
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?

934
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?

935
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There was supposed to be a DS version, but I don't think they ever made it.

936
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.

937
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What? Maybe from the Tales games? I don't know.

938
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I might be stretching here, but what?

939
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
They could still do the Prince.

940
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Pac-Man's going to eat him up, yum, yum.

941
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That's true.

942
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Just because, you know, they could do this stuff from the old school Namco games.

943
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Mm-hmm. Like really old school games?

944
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Like Dig Dug.

945
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, Dig Dug. The Digger? Actually, that could be really bad

946
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
if they have a character in the game called Digger.

947
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That could be very bad.

948
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Mr. Driller.

949
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, Mr. Driller. That's even better.

950
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Mm-hmm.

951
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Or maybe Mitsurugi.

952
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Vandy in our chat room suggests his pole position.

953
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
LocoPoco suggests Klonoa.

954
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yes!

955
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?

956
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And they'll have Hupal.

957
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube.

958
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Or, excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least, had one game.

959
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And the Wii.

960
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And the Wii?

961
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah.

962
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I guess that could happen. There you go.

963
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie?

964
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Mm.

965
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
From that game that never came out in the U.S.

966
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Brothers being developed by Namco, in part?

967
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
JVMon, aren't you a Smash Brothers fan?

968
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah, but it's not gonna come out for, like, another five years,

969
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
so it's no point getting excited for it now.

970
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Good point. Let's move on.

971
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Darth Zakra.

972
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Garris. I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.

973
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
The Extended Cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360, on June 26th,

974
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and on the 4th of July, which means it's already out for those two platforms,

975
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.

976
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
By the way, just tangent.

977
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Actually, it's not already out, because that's my birthday.

978
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
My birthday's Tuesday.

979
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Sorry, brain. I'm a week ahead, Rob. I'm a week ahead.

980
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's all right.

981
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But, by the time some of these people download it, you know.

982
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
That's true.

983
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But, by the way, what the hell, 4th of July on a Wednesday, anyway.

984
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So, it's going to expand on the events at the end of Mass Effect 3 through, quote,

985
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.

986
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And there's another quote on here on how to access it.

987
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
To experience the Extended Cut, load a save game from before the attack on the Cerberus base,

988
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and play through to the end of the game.

989
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I had to do my, uh, sorry.

990
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Welcome to, no.

991
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Welcome to the Citadel.

992
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Stop.

993
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Sorry.

994
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the Consort.

995
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
She just sounded so perky.

996
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You know what's interesting to me, though, Jamie, is that, you know,

997
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
you're a new Mass Effect fan.

998
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough

999
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.

1000
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending.

1001
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So, my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first,

1002
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your ending?

1003
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I think I want to go into the Extended Cut just because of how much of the original was spoiled for me.

1004
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And it's partly my fault because I watched the damn video, you know, the music video,

1005
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
which I don't even remember which one it was now.

1006
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But I think that I would like to go through and see it, have that be my experience,

1007
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and see if I'm still pissed off, and then go back and watch the other one.

1008
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Because I can always YouTube the other endings.

1009
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently like nobody else,

1010
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
like the one where everyone gets all mixed up.

1011
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Black Lab is in chat. Puppy.

1012
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Puppy.

1013
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, I saw him earlier.

1014
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.

1015
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We got to fix that.

1016
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, what's up with that, dude?

1017
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Lost Puppy.

1018
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.

1019
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Well, didn't you hear? It's my birthday.

1020
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And it's all the game companies rewarding me for talking grand about all three of these games on Orange Laundry.

1021
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No, I don't know what it is. It is a crazy day for DLC.

1022
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I know Alan is really torn because he's both a Skyrim and a Mass Effect 3 fan.

1023
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I think he'll go for Mass Effect 3 first because that's the one he doesn't have to pay for.

1024
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Well.

1025
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
We'll see.

1026
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.

1027
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.

1028
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.

1029
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.

1030
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
No. There's no way it's going to be that.

1031
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.

1032
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.

1033
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So that means there's like 20% what of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.

1034
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.

1035
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned.

1036
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And rushed the ending.

1037
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Because I had been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing.

1038
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody.

1039
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Which I kind of believe, I mean, I don't know what to believe.

1040
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.

1041
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You know, I just, I'm hopeful for the DLC.

1042
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I did not hate the ending as is.

1043
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole, I mean, the let down for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.

1044
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Maybe you get a two second scene.

1045
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.

1046
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I mean, it's very little.

1047
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That's the part that got me.

1048
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.

1049
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I understand that there's some things they want to close up.

1050
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.

1051
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I understand that.

1052
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.

1053
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I just, you know, and I think there's some people that are mad about that.

1054
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
They want the same universe to continue and so forth.

1055
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.

1056
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What are all those people going to eat?

1057
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You can't eat Earth food.

1058
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Each other.

1059
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I mean.

1060
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.

1061
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
No.

1062
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm just thinking of all, they're going to have a long road home.

1063
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then all the other people who can't get home.

1064
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
That's just very sad.

1065
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending.

1066
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
That's all I left it at, Rob.

1067
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.

1068
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
All right.

1069
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So this is, I'm kind of surprised by this.

1070
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney.

1071
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games.

1072
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Plus, they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.

1073
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Well, interesting enough, the game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.

1074
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.

1075
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.

1076
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.

1077
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But that would be the case, so I don't know.

1078
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Very interesting. But that is coming out later on this fall.

1079
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That is interesting.

1080
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Especially if, you know, the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.

1081
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:19,000
My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii, like, DS and 3DS versions right now.

1082
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version.

1083
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.

1084
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That makes way too much sense.

1085
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Well, they definitely won't be doing that.

1086
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
How dare you bring logic into this show!

1087
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
How dare you.

1088
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It's very possible that they may not.

1089
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I mean, like, Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July and they cut out the PS3.

1090
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.

1091
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
YYR in chat says, Activision would release on every platform if possible. There must be some sort of deal.

1092
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Well, just like I said, no. I don't think so.

1093
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Because if they think that it's only going to reach the kind of children demographic, then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.

1094
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Alright, let's talk about a remake.

1095
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.

1096
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.

1097
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's Okami HD.

1098
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.

1099
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling. How do we please them?

1100
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So they're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.

1101
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's full 1080p HD.

1102
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.

1103
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced on Twitter and of course on YouTube.

1104
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It is going to be launching. This is the really interesting part.

1105
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen. That's about 50 bucks.

1106
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
In the US, Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.

1107
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Haha, we get a deal. Sorry, Japan.

1108
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But that is awesome.

1109
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.

1110
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, you never know. The one in Japan might come with like, I don't know, stickers.

1111
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark.

1112
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Maybe a soundtrack or something extra.

1113
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Now, now, now. It was only...

1114
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Oh, that was the Wii version.

1115
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I thought it was the...

1116
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
There was something with the DS Okami-din, I think, that had some funky with that too.

1117
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Maybe the box art. I don't know.

1118
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30. That was a Bubble Bobble game.

1119
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
You know what's funny? This is one of those games I never really got around to playing.

1120
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I missed it. I played a demo. That was about it.

1121
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But I really wanted to try this out.

1122
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And I think the price of 20 bucks, download online, is a great place to see this.

1123
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons

1124
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer.

1125
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And it looks great. When they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.

1126
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
There's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in the studio.

1127
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And then it goes, oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color. It's great.

1128
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So, yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.

1129
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And trophies for your E-peen.

1130
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates.

1131
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which, yes, of course, we have one tonight.

1132
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Dark Sakura, first up with some news.

1133
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
How about some Blizzard stuff?

1134
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
This actually, they're clarifying the restrictions on the Diablo 3 players.

1135
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Basically, patch 1.0.3 has new measures in it to make sure that players have to wait up to 72 hours

1136
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
before they can access the whole game.

1137
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So they're trying to make it more secure.

1138
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And the quote here says, for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service,

1139
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete

1140
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
before they can access certain game features.

1141
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So basically, it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW,

1142
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.

1143
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So here's the official list.

1144
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
No public game access for unverified digiter, digital purchasers.

1145
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
No auction house access, real money, or gold for unverified digital purchasers.

1146
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.

1147
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.

1148
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests,

1149
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.

1150
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Global play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.

1151
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:02,000
But they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and Level 13.

1152
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Well, I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house, especially when real money's at stake.

1153
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online.

1154
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way.

1155
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
But my god, this real money auction house is really a lot of hassle.

1156
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You know, that auction house has really fucked this game up.

1157
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I mean, it's the reason why we have to be connected all the time, even in single player,

1158
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and why all those launch problems happen,

1159
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and now it's the reason why you can't even truly buy the game online unless there's a wait period.

1160
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it,

1161
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3,

1162
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and then, you know, they're doing that.

1163
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
But I don't know. God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.

1164
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.

1165
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
But yet Diablo 3 is a huge game. Huge, huge game. Go figure.

1166
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
SHJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

1167
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.

1168
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming, it sounds like.

1169
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Hmm. Interesting.

1170
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.

1171
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans,

1172
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.

1173
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Is it really a damning number or no?

1174
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?

1175
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So, you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.

1176
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates

1177
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and some things that are coming to a game store near you.

1178
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
This week we've got a few things.

1179
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Starting off with Spec Ops The Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1180
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
London 2012 Olympics on PS3 and 360.

1181
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Also, Dead Island Game of the Year edition on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1182
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS.

1183
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360.

1184
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And... that's it.

1185
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I hope that Amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.

1186
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The game looks pretty good though.

1187
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Really?

1188
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
The game is done by, was it Benox? I think they're the guys that did the last two games.

1189
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's open world and it looks pretty awesome.

1190
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.

1191
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I was watching the YouTube interview with him.

1192
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I was just like, what the fuck is that?

1193
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.

1194
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah, you're the creator of the game.

1195
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man. Okay.

1196
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.

1197
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.

1198
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.

1199
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Hurry before he dies.

1200
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Seriously?

1201
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Let's be real, the celebrities we love, they're getting older.

1202
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Him and Morgan Freeman, man. They just keep the old people and get them acting more.

1203
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
They should do a buddy comedy.

1204
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Morgan Freeman.

1205
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And Adam West.

1206
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I don't know. Maybe.

1207
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It's just cool old bastards.

1208
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Cool old bastards.

1209
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
You know what? Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold.

1210
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.

1211
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Nice.

1212
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.

1213
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners.

1214
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Cricket, cricket.

1215
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction.

1216
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.

1217
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I've never heard of that company.

1218
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

1219
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.

1220
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
This looks like it's another, I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.

1221
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
What the hell? Wait a minute. It's like, yay, little girls are happy and dah dah dah dah dah.

1222
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on.

1223
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And then, robots!

1224
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So Neon Genesis.

1225
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I don't know what the hell that is.

1226
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
What is that that it comes with? Look at that.

1227
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's a microphone.

1228
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Cosplay pieces.

1229
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Howdy partner.

1230
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together.

1231
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
In our school uniforms.

1232
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
What the fuck is this?

1233
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Pointing!

1234
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Giant mecha rancher.

1235
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Look at my finger.

1236
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I don't understand.

1237
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
That one she's pointing and the look on everybody's face is like, oh my god.

1238
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's like she's saying, who wants to smell my finger?

1239
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Are you sure that's a chick?

1240
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yes, but if she had yellow ribbon in her hair I'd be like, is Haruhi?

1241
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't know.

1242
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Let's see.

1243
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Zether in chat explains, Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.

1244
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Oh, well that explains everything. I'm so fucking angry.

1245
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Have you ever heard of Steins Gate?

1246
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, you have?

1247
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah.

1248
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Explain it to me.

1249
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I just heard of it. I don't know what the hell it is.

1250
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.

1251
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
There is a book report due Sunday.

1252
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
This is why I love having a chat room.

1253
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.

1254
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection.

1255
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well.

1256
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Atlier Aisha.

1257
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Kokon no Daichi no Rekonjutsu in regular and premium flavors.

1258
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3.

1259
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But Dot Hack.

1260
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Sekai no Mukoni plus versus hybrid pack.

1261
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
What is this?

1262
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Is this like the whole... Oh, it's a movie.

1263
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Oh, okay. I get it.

1264
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's the movie and the fighting game.

1265
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
That's what this is.

1266
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's a bundle pack there.

1267
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Wouldn't it be weird if they did Dot Hack MMO?

1268
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
That would be very good.

1269
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2 though.

1270
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Have they done one on PlayStation 3?

1271
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I don't think they have.

1272
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
This is the closest we get is a fighting game.

1273
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Alright, well.

1274
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then...

1275
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I guess anything's possible.

1276
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Taking a look quickly at the PlayStation Vita,

1277
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Metal Gear Solid HD Edition comes out in Japan this week.

1278
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I know that's one people will be looking forward to.

1279
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And there will be a crystal white PlayStation Vita.

1280
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Because, you know, who doesn't love more colors for their handhelds?

1281
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Speaking of companies that love colors for their handhelds,

1282
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
on the Nintendo 3DS this week,

1283
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Cult Sept comes out in Japan.

1284
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I love this series.

1285
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And it's like a cult series.

1286
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
A lot of people don't play it here, but Cult Sept is like,

1287
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
it's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

1288
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah, you know this series?

1289
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Yes, I love this game. I'm importing it.

1290
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I didn't even know it was coming out.

1291
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Did you know they have one on the 360?

1292
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.

1293
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.

1294
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Uh oh, Rob's going to get it.

1295
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Uh oh.

1296
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1297
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.

1298
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Two people in the world, old Cult Sept saga on the Xbox 360.

1299
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Well, they're you and I have a friend to play with.

1300
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I do, yay, we're friends, yay.

1301
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Are you my Xbox 360 friend?

1302
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Friends.

1303
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Friends.

1304
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Aww, that's so sweet.

1305
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
They still haven't removed that 100 person limit,

1306
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago,

1307
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
so they could do that. Yeah.

1308
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?

1309
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
How about the Wii? Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?

1310
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yes.

1311
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
People still do the Wii.

1312
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
One game, and it's called Zero.

1313
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Shinku no Chul comes out this week,

1314
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly,

1315
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and it's like a ghost scary game.

1316
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh, this is a scary game.

1317
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Wait, crimson butterfly, that sounds familiar.

1318
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Was that a...

1319
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
That's a Wii game?

1320
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Those graphics are pretty good for a Wii game,

1321
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
unless that's a cutscene.

1322
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Crimson butterfly, that sounds awfully familiar.

1323
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, it does.

1324
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Fatal frame? Oh, is this a fatal...

1325
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh.

1326
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
No, there was one, it was a PS...

1327
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I'm thinking maybe it was a PS3 game,

1328
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
it was a PlayStation Network download thing, I don't know.

1329
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Well, regardless, that is out on the Wii this week, so there you go.

1330
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1331
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But I want biscuits.

1332
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.

1333
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's part of the Fatal Frame series.

1334
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.

1335
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Okay.

1336
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.

1337
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You know, that means dro.

1338
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
27th, we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD Collection on PS3,

1339
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and the Dark Side Chronicles HD for PS3.

1340
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The 29th, Harvest Moon, The Tale of Two Towns,

1341
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
because we can't have enough sheep and cows.

1342
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Mini Ninja...

1343
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it

1344
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
when that is totally incorrect.

1345
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So I am not going to say it the way it is on the box,

1346
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
it's Mini Ninja Adventures.

1347
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection,

1348
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir,

1349
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Spec Ops The Line,

1350
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
and The Amazing Spider-Man.

1351
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Spider-Man!

1352
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Alright.

1353
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week,

1354
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and I've been assured that Dark Sakura has picked a special game

1355
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
for the classic game of the week this week.

1356
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But first, Loki!

1357
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.

1358
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Good for him!

1359
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Get off that sinking ship.

1360
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday,

1361
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and basically just, you know,

1362
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't know, just moving on to better things.

1363
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And, you know, he said,

1364
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
both as individuals and as a group,

1365
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
you know, you have taught me more than I could have ever thought possible,

1366
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.

1367
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.

1368
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Okay, maybe I made it up to the last part.

1369
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Could this be the very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?

1370
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I don't know.

1371
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yes!

1372
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I don't know. I mean, honestly,

1373
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games,

1374
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
but it's a team that puts that stuff together.

1375
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It's not just one dude, so...

1376
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
He's not the only guy, too.

1377
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
We just had a story last week about, you know,

1378
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.

1379
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Yeah, I probably saw that and didn't want to be worked to death,

1380
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.

1381
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Did he say where he went?

1382
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
No.

1383
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It could be interesting to see where he ends up.

1384
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
That's the part of the story I want to know.

1385
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
What did he leave for another opportunity,

1386
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
or did he leave because he would rather go work,

1387
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
like, at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?

1388
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I'd be very curious to know that.

1389
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
He's going to work on the Phantom where he never has to touch video games again.

1390
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
All right.

1391
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
This is one of those stories that I think slipped under the radar

1392
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
for a lot of people, but I think this is actually a huge deal.

1393
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So I want to talk about this a little bit,

1394
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and this is a story that was on Game Politics,

1395
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
but, you know, it probably was on some other websites, too,

1396
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and it's about Tetris.

1397
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
That's right, a game that is...

1398
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
How many years old is Tetris now? It was done in the 80s or so,

1399
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
so it's a very old game, but...

1400
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
At least as old as you are.

1401
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
One of the best...

1402
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Well, technically, that's true.

1403
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
This is true.

1404
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's not...

1405
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Hi!

1406
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's older than the show.

1407
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Hi!

1408
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.

1409
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
All right, moving on.

1410
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I got ferreted.

1411
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
That felt good after ten years.

1412
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
All right, so the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court

1413
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
against a clone game,

1414
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these,

1415
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and it's out of control,

1416
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
because Apple doesn't...

1417
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
The people that are screening the games don't necessarily know

1418
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
what intellectual property is what,

1419
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out,

1420
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
but, you know, what stuff...

1421
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or...

1422
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was, like, the number one thing,

1423
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and all it was was an app that was, like, pictures of Pokemon or something?

1424
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Pokemon, and the gold is going in my pocket.

1425
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
That's right. Pokemon, give me your money.

1426
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Anyhow, Xio Interactive made this game called Mino,

1427
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and they said it was inspired by Tetris,

1428
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
but when the Tetris company found the game,

1429
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
they sued Xio for copyright infringement in New Jersey,

1430
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
and during the legal fight...

1431
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Xio, Xio? I don't know. I'll say Xio.

1432
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Xio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.

1433
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Rules cannot be covered by copyright.

1434
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets,

1435
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
so this game infringed on the copyrights,

1436
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris,

1437
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs,

1438
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
but the difference is Xio was, like, a fucking copy, right?

1439
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So in the ruling, the judge basically says,

1440
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
here's what is and what isn't copyright.

1441
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
The judge says the basic rulesets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.

1442
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
He says the basic ruleset of Tetris is not copyrightable,

1443
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen

1444
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board

1445
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
is not an idea you can copyright, hence Dr. Mario.

1446
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier,

1447
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
but I am now, since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.

1448
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen

1449
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?

1450
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It would be interesting to te- I mean, now-

1451
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Well, according to some court cases against two competing games,

1452
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
they were very similar like that.

1453
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It was settled. It never went to court, did it?

1454
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I believe it was settled.

1455
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
So anyway, I'm just curious.

1456
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
The world will never know.

1457
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I-

1458
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Does that mean it's old?

1459
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario,

1460
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.

1461
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And I'm sure all of us go,

1462
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously,

1463
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing,

1464
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
but it's not Tetris.

1465
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but you know, I digress.

1466
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?

1467
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's-

1468
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah, anyway, but Xayo, according to the judge, copied more than this.

1469
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They copied the exact dimensions of the play area,

1470
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
the shape, the color of the pieces,

1471
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I didn't even know that was a thing that was consistent in Tetris,

1472
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
and other mechanics.

1473
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.

1474
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games

1475
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
that showed that they were identical.

1476
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They said that Xayo altered enough of the game,

1477
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
oh, I'm sorry, the judge said that if Xayo had altered enough of the game,

1478
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior,

1479
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
it would have avoided this whole mess in the first place.

1480
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So what does this mean?

1481
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And again, going off the article at gamepolitics.com,

1482
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
they say, not much.

1483
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,000
The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.

1484
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.

1485
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court,

1486
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
which means it could change.

1487
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But let's imagine, according to game politics here,

1488
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
that it did have varying across the U.S.

1489
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Would it help people against the fight for other clone games?

1490
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It says not likely because the ruling is narrow in scope.

1491
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's a win for Tetris, but it's a win for outright clones

1492
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
as opposed to heavy inspiration clones.

1493
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And they go on to say, tiny tower versus dream heights? Nope.

1494
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Radical fishing versus ninja fishing? Nope.

1495
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Even though some of us sit here and go,

1496
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Zinga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to tiny tower.

1497
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,000
But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.

1498
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Well, Zinga is smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties.

1499
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this.

1500
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And you're gold.

1501
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And Game Guru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

1502
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.

1503
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
No, that is a good thing.

1504
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says,

1505
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days,

1506
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
including the color of each piece.

1507
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I never realized that. Crazy.

1508
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating,

1509
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,000
especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network,

1510
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
you know, the store and all that.

1511
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So, yeah, there you go. We'll see what happens in the future.

1512
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.

1513
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
But of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.

1514
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Speaking of years and years and years and years,

1515
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:43,000
every week here on the show, Dark Soccer likes to spotlight the classic game of the week.

1516
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
All of which I'm older than.

1517
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
A game from the archives that Dark Soccer says,

1518
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
hey, you should be respecting this game and you should play this game.

1519
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And for the tenth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio,

1520
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I'm sure Dark Soccer has picked something very special tonight.

1521
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Dark Soccer, what is tonight's classic game of the week?

1522
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Pong. No.

1523
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Could have been. Pong would have been a good choice.

1524
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
No, it wouldn't.

1525
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
All right.

1526
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Boop. No. Beatmania 2DX.

1527
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
A good choice.

1528
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Because with as crazy about DDR as we were, Beatmania was really our thing, don't you think?

1529
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Beatmania 2DX was the one that would give you a boner, yeah.

1530
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And I have to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.

1531
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I started with a little game called BM98,

1532
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:43,000
which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.

1533
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.

1534
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Pollock.

1535
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
It's a Beatmania 2DX song.

1536
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Heck yeah. Heck yeah.

1537
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.

1538
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.

1539
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.

1540
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.

1541
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.

1542
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?

1543
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
But you have two extra keys than the original five key Beatmania.

1544
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And your turntable is on the opposite side depending on what side you're playing on.

1545
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So this has started right side pride and left side pride.

1546
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
A lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.

1547
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Ooh, good for you. I play right side.

1548
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Left side pride, weakling.

1549
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.

1550
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.

1551
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.

1552
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Or me.

1553
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Lisa.

1554
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You're a girl.

1555
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
D'Artessio over there says Lisu.

1556
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I don't remember him. Yeah.

1557
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.

1558
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time and a backspin scratch.

1559
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So you have to scratch directionally.

1560
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
For difficulty, you go from one to seven.

1561
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And then in fifth style, you had a flashing seven that was the highest difficulty.

1562
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
With 10 style, you actually had level eight.

1563
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And then an eight plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.

1564
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.

1565
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So it's getting way past me.

1566
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I think the last one that I was really into was eight style.

1567
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Which I think was the last one I bought.

1568
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Which we're looking at right now.

1569
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yeah.

1570
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.

1571
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Ooh.

1572
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And also seventh style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage.

1573
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song.

1574
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And then 13 Distorted had multiple extra stage songs.

1575
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Gold had two different ones. The 1ES and the 1OMES.

1576
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So yeah, it was really getting crazy there.

1577
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Like where else can I go with it?

1578
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.

1579
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller, and the effector.

1580
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So basically you could control what it sounded like.

1581
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?

1582
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah, to make it really noisy.

1583
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So you could hear it over every freaking thing else.

1584
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Can I admit something here real quick? Not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.

1585
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Watching this video is making me very nostalgic, I have to admit.

1586
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
No, it really does. I really miss playing this game, especially in the arcades and stuff.

1587
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I mean, yeah, I could try to go dig up my own version, but shit, my controller probably wouldn't even work anymore.

1588
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I don't even know if my Japanese PlayStation 2 works.

1589
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
You have problems trying to hook them up to newer HDTVs anyway.

1590
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
You have to find the song that got me into your beat.

1591
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
What song is that?

1592
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Ultra High Heels.

1593
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Oh really?

1594
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I can do that.

1595
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I beat the hell out of that song, because I freaking loved it.

1596
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.

1597
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Also the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs, so you could see the song information and titles while you played.

1598
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah, turn this up.

1599
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.

1600
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's just for me, I mean, even if...

1601
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
A lot of people were like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they were just songs that were fun.

1602
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,000
So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.

1603
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:31,000
As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever, A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.

1604
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.

1605
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You also had, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.

1606
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:07,000
All kinds of really, really good artists, not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.

1607
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.

1608
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:26,000
There were, they put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.

1609
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:36,000
As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller, so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play.

1610
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:44,000
There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller, and it would not work. They wouldn't take my credit card.

1611
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I tried. I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan who was going to ship it to me. It didn't work.

1612
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
One time I got Dan to agree to this. Oh, I was so pissed.

1613
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But there are aftermarket arcade style controllers that you can get, and tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.

1614
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:12,000
For all the different music, I mean you had it from, we just heard some Eurobeat, we have different types of dance, we had, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions I'd like to say.

1615
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Some crap songs in the earlier version too.

1616
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:26,000
As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced lingle? I guess. 600 songs.

1617
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Dingle.

1618
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Dingle.

1619
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Dongle. Maybe a 2DX19 dongle edition.

1620
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Awesome. I support that.

1621
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Basically the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD, so for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit. Like I said, hard drive.

1622
01:31:46,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tram, who is the little alien chick with white hair, we have Yamatotora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.

1623
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Try saying that a few times fast.

1624
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I mean, there's basically a lot of cool characters, and you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like who did the DJs.

1625
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Like Eriki, QJack, Nix, all of them. I freaking...

1626
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.

1627
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:41,000
In fact, I've actually got an issue of Cosmode that has its all 2DX cosplay. So Celica, all of that.

1628
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So anyway, there you go. You may need a 2DX. If you don't know what it is after listening to this show, climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears.

1629
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
There it is.

1630
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
My man. I love you, Taku.

1631
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
This song was so much fun to play.

1632
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I want to have lots of Tran babies with you.

1633
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
That is a...

1634
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Not really.

1635
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:09,000
A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Laundrio. BeatMania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.

1636
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yeah.

1637
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Just kidding.

1638
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Dongle style.

1639
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Dongle style. 2DX dongle style.

1640
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Alright, that does it for part A of our show. But don't go anywhere, guys. We have part B coming up.

1641
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And guess what? No news. Part B is all about you guys tonight.

1642
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundrio is with you guys.

1643
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We'll friend your butt.

1644
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Alright.

1645
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news. We do have some news standing by if we need to.

1646
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Otherwise, Loke, you'll just run through it quick. It's a last minute thing.

1647
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
But we're hoping to get some calls here in part B.

1648
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But first, a break. Don't go anywhere. We got to save part A in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.

1649
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th style.

1650
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, I'm very sorry we don't have a music break tonight.

1651
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
But we do have clip show. That's right. Ten minutes worth of clips here during our break tonight.

1652
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And I want to thank Dark Tetsuya for scouring the internet and finding some of these clips from the OLR archive.

1653
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I want to tell you guys, a lot of this shit is fucking old.

1654
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Like most of this, I think the newest clip in here is from episode 148.

1655
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Otherwise, this shit is old. And it starts with a clip from episode number one.

1656
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed.

1657
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And it's a parody on this show.

1658
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh, yes. Here we go. We'll be back after this.

1659
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I hate you.

1660
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
That's right. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are live on our very first broadcast.

1661
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
How's it feel, Jamie?

1662
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It feels like burning.

1663
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
My thoughts exactly.

1664
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.

1665
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
So we thought we'd tape the show a little early. So it's actually Wednesday night. We're at Golf Land.

1666
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But we are taping live. No do-overs. It's just like it was a live show.

1667
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So what do we want to do? We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land.

1668
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I don't want to do anybody publicly.

1669
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Do you want to?

1670
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I'm holding adventure stuff. Who wants to hold my wood?

1671
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Thank you for volunteering for that. We just got a funny. Hi.

1672
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Oh, we're doing a school project. Yeah.

1673
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
For.

1674
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
No, we're doing an online radio program. So we have an Internet radio show.

1675
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Would you like to say some words for our listeners?

1676
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.

1677
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Oh, we're just recording ourselves.

1678
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
God damn it, Rob. These things burn at a thousand degrees. I feel like burning heat.

1679
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot. I'm going to do my next shot here. This is some hot damn.

1680
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So cheers. I'm going to toast Loki's water here.

1681
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Well. Oh, wait. It looks like a wall tussin.

1682
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.

1683
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Oh, wow. He sounds like a woman. Shut up.

1684
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Oh, God.

1685
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It tastes like it tastes like 20 like Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.

1686
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Contestants, here we go. Snubs got to catch up. And here's his answer.

1687
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

1688
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Good answer. Okay.

1689
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her.

1690
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Skyline says, oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better.

1691
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:56,000
He said orange bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick.

1692
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So we have remote collar exploder dealie and boom stick.

1693
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Alright. Jamie, what's your answer?

1694
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Orange bat.

1695
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Orange bat. I knew it, too. That's right. You're already in the lead, Skyline. You don't need it.

1696
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Alright. As Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.

1697
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Okay. Our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel.

1698
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Big black cock.

1699
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Her big black cock.

1700
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Sorry, that's not a match. But funny. Puppy.

1701
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
The ferret.

1702
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,000
The ferret. Good answer, but not a match.

1703
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Loki. Her secret weapon was her Iraqi suicide babies. Iraqi suicide babies.

1704
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Jamie, is this true?

1705
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I admit it. I've been exporting them. I keep them in my trunk.

1706
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.

1707
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

1708
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It sucked ass, kinda. It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

1709
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Never read whatever the hell that movie was. It was bad.

1710
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Envy of the dot dot dot.

1711
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:25,000
The film that we watched was called Envy. Actually, it says Envy on the box. It's actual full title. It's called Penis Envy.

1712
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It's a story about these two drifting chicks. They're walking through the desert and they go to this bar and they get really drunk.

1713
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And I mean, this is talking about like white trash America. They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.

1714
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

1715
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And so they walk around and lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen guy.

1716
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And then they go and ask the penis fairy for a penis and they get a penis and with the penis comes great responsibility.

1717
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And they have, you know, mustaches and body hair and tattoos and they start acting like guys.

1718
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Hey, Loki? Was it Mr. Spanky?

1719
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And then they start like, you know, screwing this one chick and then this other guy.

1720
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And then eventually they get tired of having a penis. And so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A. where she's at a gay bar.

1721
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis.

1722
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:29,000
But the one chick likes the penis so much and then she ends up getting killed in the end.

1723
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That was beautiful. Thank you.

1724
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Extrovert, what were you doing on my computer last night? Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.

1725
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago. You remember how messy my desktop used to be?

1726
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Like it was just icons everywhere, right? And you couldn't even see my background.

1727
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Now you have balls on it.

1728
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?

1729
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Okay. Now, Extrovert went in and last night while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop.

1730
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And now I have folders that say big boobies number one, big boobies number two, big boobies with cocks in them, blood spattered boobies,

1731
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:16,000
boobies and sunflowers, boobies for milking, boobies in pee, mastectomy leftover boobies, hot hairy saggy man boobies.

1732
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And then my last, my favorite here, women in roller skates peeing in glass bowls.

1733
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
What the hell? Why did you do that?

1734
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I'm not going to, you know, if you're going to download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.

1735
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.

1736
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
By the way...

1737
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Did they use something other than bleach?

1738
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

1739
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
No.

1740
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Oh, well, you know how you have like...

1741
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Crest white strips?

1742
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Yes, it's like crest white strips only put on your asshole.

1743
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
You leave it for, you leave them for like a few minutes and then you just strip them off and hey...

1744
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?

1745
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I'm disgusted. I am so disgusted.

1746
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Girls just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out, I'm coming out, here it is.

1747
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Loki singing I'm coming out at the county fair with Teninga.

1748
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Here we go.

1749
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Remember, he goes, I'm coming out, you know, you know how it goes, you know how this one goes?

1750
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Okay, here we go.

1751
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:33,000
JNN.

1752
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I'm singing and I'm okay.

1753
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm singing, I'm happy with women.

1754
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I'm singing, I want the world to know, I'm happy with pussies.

1755
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I'm singing, I want the world to know, got them ready to show.

1756
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
There's a new me singing and I'm just happy.

1757
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
He's laughing.

1758
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I'm gonna be happy, I'll be happy.

1759
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Stop making me laugh, damn it.

1760
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Like you never knew it, I'll make it through.

1761
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.

1762
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I have to shout that I'm staying in, I'm staying in.

1763
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I want the world to know, I'm happy with the pussy.

1764
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I'm staying in, I want the world to know, I shop on the same sad street.

1765
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I got to show the world, yeah, I wanna see.

1766
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
All my abilities, there's so much for me.

1767
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Somehow I have to make them, just understand.

1768
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I've got it all in hand, oh how I've got it planned.

1769
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm spreading the love, there's more for me to fear.

1770
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And I just feel so good every time I hear, I'm staying in.

1771
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I'm happy with the females, gotta let it show.

1772
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm actually passing this song, that's pretty amazing I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

1773
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.

1774
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1775
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah, work in the crowd.

1776
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Yeah, yeah, there's my pictures in the crowd, fuck yeah.

1777
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I'm coming in, I want the world to know, let it show.

1778
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I'm staying in, I'm happy with hetero, just want everyone to know.

1779
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I'm staying in, I want the world to know, women are my thing.

1780
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I'm staying in, I'm sick of this song, you're gonna really die.

1781
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:46,000
God, this is long, it just doesn't fucking end, just keeps on going on.

1782
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I'm gonna kill anyone in the chatroom that has a recording of this, you're gonna so die.

1783
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I know where you live.

1784
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,000
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

1785
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:07,000
A score of 6,964 points for Loki, not even a gold record, there is no justice in this world, okay.

1786
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now, oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

1787
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I laughed so hard, I peed, okay, I peed a little, I peed a little bit.

1788
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I can't lose my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight huh Rob?

1789
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Oh, that hurt so bad, oh my god.

1790
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.

1791
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I did want to play something and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro

1792
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
because I was actually trying to make a new intro but then I didn't do that and then I did something else and

1793
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:55,000
it's cheesy but it's funny and it's fun with text to speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.

1794
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Here we go.

1795
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Do you know how they celebrate it? If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.

1796
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,000
This next test is very dangerous. To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death,

1797
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:55,000
smooth jazz will be deployed in 3, 2, 1.

1798
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.

1799
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

1800
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
That was cute, I like that, good job.

1801
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Thank you.

1802
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Alright, let's get back into the show guys.

1803
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Welcome back everybody to-

1804
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Technical failure. You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.

1805
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You done. Here we go.

1806
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June 24th of 2012 with the 462nd episode of our show,

1807
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:23,000
the 10th anniversary special. That's right, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.

1808
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And here we are 10 years later, getting older, but still talking about the games we love, having live radio fail,

1809
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Mike sneezes, and the games we don't love so much sometimes too.

1810
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into part B tonight, and here's the thing, we didn't really pull any stories for this,

1811
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
because we're going to open up the Skype line here real soon. We do want to do the mailbag first though,

1812
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
we got some emails.

1813
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yeah, I gotta load that.

1814
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
While you load that though, we do have the foogle question of the week. We still did that this week,

1815
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
so I'm going to go ahead and load that up. Here it is, the foogle question of the week.

1816
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
As a reminder, the foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.

1817
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Put them together and you get foogle. Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+,

1818
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:21,000
it really should be like Gacebook or something, because sadly you're not a lot of Google Plus users.

1819
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:26,000
But we do have some, and we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+,

1820
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
and we did get some answers to our question of the week. Here it is.

1821
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,000
It is a little self-serving this week. Considering the occasion, deal with it.

1822
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:40,000
We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts,

1823
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,000
or a friend told you about it. What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?

1824
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
So going to Google+, here are the answers.

1825
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
We have 13xforever says, personally, I've tried a lot of other shows at the time,

1826
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
but yours has a strong personality to which makes it rather enjoyable to listen to every week.

1827
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Besides, your general views on gaming as a whole are quite close to mine,

1828
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and it's useful to have a second opinion on some games that I plan to buy and whatnot.

1829
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, and Ferret, even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization,

1830
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
or at least it looks like it.

1831
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Tony M. replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.

1832
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games,

1833
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them,

1834
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:37,000
because you're real people who have to purchase, oops, oh, crap, I almost closed the window on accident.

1835
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Jeez, Rob.

1836
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Fail.

1837
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.

1838
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Perfect. I can relate to you all better than them, because you're real people who have to purchase your own games,

1839
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
and this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.

1840
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
The shows coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either,

1841
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.

1842
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Technist says, at the beginning, when OLR was a Bamani-focused show,

1843
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
it was due to that you were really one of the few shows that actually talked about the games and the culture around them.

1844
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
As I listen more and more to later episodes in the early years,

1845
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
you all have just a great chemistry that's just infectious.

1846
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I've been kicking myself because I missed a great chunk of your episodes before coming back

1847
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
just right around when you started the To Go podcast.

1848
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Even when the format changes, station changes, site changes, I still have stuck with you for gaming news.

1849
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news,

1850
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.

1851
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic,

1852
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.

1853
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Finally, I will end with this.

1854
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.

1855
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think,

1856
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.

1857
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
That's really nice. Thank you.

1858
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.

1859
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Let's see, we've got 20 answers. Do you think I can read them all?

1860
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Oh, go for it.

1861
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
This chick named Nelly replied and said, spousal pressure.

1862
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
What's up with that?

1863
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Let's see, Picaruno said, seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining,

1864
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the host

1865
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
in such a familiar way as something you don't really get anywhere else.

1866
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005,

1867
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.

1868
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Stay independent.

1869
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Rama says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.

1870
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.

1871
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Who said we were good friends? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Girl.

1872
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Red The Hayes says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.

1873
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006

1874
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.

1875
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It's okay to say All Games Interactive, by the way. It was a great show. It was.

1876
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It's really a bummer. It's not on anymore.

1877
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I then decided to check out the podcast, and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast

1878
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
and just how really nice people y'all are.

1879
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.

1880
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
More power to you guys and gals, and may you have another ten years of awesome.

1881
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,000
P.S., again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.

1882
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:37,000
The Super Bowl? Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head,

1883
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
and then the announcer voice says, blah, blah. Makes me laugh.

1884
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Let's see. Dekeman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lawns Radio to go.

1885
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.

1886
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.

1887
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Fabrice A. says, the chemistry between three good friends. Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.

1888
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Thank you for noticing that, because we really do.

1889
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Terry J. says, I've been listening since late 2005.

1890
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.

1891
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
To put it simple, you guys know your shit, and your presentation proves it.

1892
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.

1893
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Don't tell Loki he knows this shit. It only increases ego. I'm just kidding.

1894
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
It's why my head hurts. It can't fit.

1895
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy is why he's listened twice.

1896
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.

1897
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.

1898
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Benny L. says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.

1899
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.

1900
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:54,000
A Local Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.

1901
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Dan M. says, I kept listening because it was relatable.

1902
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.

1903
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I was also told there would be cake.

1904
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
We have cookies.

1905
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
It's behind the other door. It's cake day, you know.

1906
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I prefer pie. There's a joke there.

1907
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Clover N. says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole

1908
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.

1909
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.

1910
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,000
What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.

1911
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.

1912
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco

1913
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.

1914
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.

1915
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.

1916
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.

1917
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast

1918
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.

1919
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.

1920
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Wow, he had a reputation? I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.

1921
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.

1922
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I really enjoyed the segments, such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.

1923
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.

1924
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.

1925
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Flow Walker, Mel B says, I was down with OLR since day one.

1926
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:44,000
It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.

1927
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.

1928
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Well, that helps.

1929
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.

1930
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Still do.

1931
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And you know, Mel B was like one of the freestyle kings when the show first started, and he brought his cred to OLR very early on.

1932
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
They were on like episode six or something like that, Mel and Mel.

1933
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And you know, we're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.

1934
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
And I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.

1935
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Just another good friend I made because of DDR, believe it or not.

1936
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Let's see.

1937
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.

1938
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You know what? It's a special show.

1939
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm reading them all.

1940
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I don't care.

1941
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Chigger says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.

1942
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.

1943
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Always a witty comment from Dark Sakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki, and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.

1944
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I love you guys so much.

1945
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Add the extra O.

1946
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
So much.

1947
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.

1948
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Keep it up, and here's to another 10 years.

1949
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Dave Falcon says, I was in college.

1950
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.

1951
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC, and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints, and cheats on the internet.

1952
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?

1953
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
OLR came up in the search, so I checked it out.

1954
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

1955
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Gee, however did discussion on The Sims trigger our show, Dark Sakura?

1956
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Shut up.

1957
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways. Hush.

1958
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.

1959
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Garris.

1960
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Alright, let's see.

1961
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Oops, I lost my place here.

1962
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Oh yes, so I checked it out.

1963
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

1964
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Fast forward to 2012.

1965
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I'm living in Washington, D.C. since 2007, working in social media, and got engaged in December 2011.

1966
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
P.S., my fiancé is a huge video game lover.

1967
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Well, you lucked out.

1968
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Ospher says, I saw Sky's post on ddrfreak.com back when those forums were still popular.

1969
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I thought I'd check out the show, and admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly bimani to video games in general,

1970
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
but it turned out to be a really entertaining show.

1971
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view, which are all pretty different and unique.

1972
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I was hooked, and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on.

1973
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Alright, last comment. You ready? Last one.

1974
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Dun-dun-dun.

1975
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Orange Right says, the first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.

1976
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.

1977
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much,

1978
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.

1979
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Stay gold.

1980
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Great feedback, guys. Thank you.

1981
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I apologize if you thought that went on a little long, but you know what?

1982
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I really enjoyed reading all that stuff, so thank you very much.

1983
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I have fuzzies now.

1984
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Alright.

1985
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
They're kind of warm.

1986
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Tuma JP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems, so he sent me a private message, so why not?

1987
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Do it.

1988
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:00,000
The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants, and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.

1989
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
That's pretty powerful, actually.

1990
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:08,000
And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.

1991
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
But you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.

1992
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now you're working in the game industry.

1993
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.

1994
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do UmLoud, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.

1995
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I got to do the design for UmLoud last year.

1996
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Exactly. We've had a great experience through him.

1997
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I have other friends that probably would appreciate it. I don't name them.

1998
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:40,000
But I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.

1999
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Really appreciate it. All right. That's it for the FUGL Question of the Week.

2000
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,000
What do we do next? How about the mailbag? I think the mailbag's up next. Does that sound good?

2001
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Oh, good Lord.

2002
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
All right. So we got some emails tonight?

2003
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
A few.

2004
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
A few.

2005
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I'm going to read them all.

2006
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
All right. I read them all. Go ahead.

2007
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

2008
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
All right. This is actually from Darktensia. But there's, like, a lot of pictures.

2009
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:18,000
So, uh, I actually, um, this, why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?

2010
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I will see what I can do. Oh, oh, Joe. Oh, yeah, Joseph here. Hi, Joe.

2011
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.

2012
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
That's right.

2013
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:35,000
But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio Battle Royale thing, which, interestingly enough,

2014
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day. Was that the Paper Plate Battle Royale?

2015
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Oh, Lord. I remember because I won.

2016
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Um, they can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.

2017
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Oh, hey.

2018
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Oh, here. Use this one.

2019
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
She's in chat right now.

2020
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah.

2021
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Sorry.

2022
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So, yeah, these will have to go on, uh, on the forum.

2023
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Okay. Um, okay, so next up, oh, it's from Robert Kidman.

2024
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Send me some biscuits.

2025
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Um, evening all and happy birth-a-versary.

2026
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I just wanted to say quite simply thank you.

2027
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Thank you for 10 wonderful years in your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.

2028
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays,

2029
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:27,000
finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.

2030
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
If it weren't for OLR, there would be no geek life.

2031
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Tiara and I wouldn't have met, and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.

2032
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Strange how these things happen.

2033
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.

2034
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
So, yeah, thank you. Long may it continue.

2035
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.

2036
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
That's Rob from Geek Life.

2037
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
By the way, huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well.

2038
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
And I love Geek Life. I'm going to be doing a guest column for them.

2039
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Tiara received an opportunity, and she didn't think of the other Rob.

2040
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
She didn't think of Dan. She didn't think of Jamie.

2041
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
She thought of me, and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed, and I'm so excited.

2042
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Cool. Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.

2043
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.

2044
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Okay. I make this promise from here out. I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week.

2045
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Because I still have to finish part two of TableTop Gaming.

2046
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
There you go.

2047
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Okay.

2048
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Due Monday. Just kidding. I'm kidding.

2049
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Wednesday. It's due before Wednesday, Rob.

2050
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Hey, OLR and OLR me. I wanted to give a shout-out and congratulate you on ten years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.

2051
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
It's quite a feat.

2052
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I remember when I first met Rob. It was New Year's 2008 slash 9.

2053
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
He was sick and quiet on the couch.

2054
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
We got to chatting, and he mentioned he was a gamer.

2055
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
G-A-Y-M-E-R.

2056
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I knew then he'd be a good friend, and then he told me about his podcast.

2057
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I figured, man, why not? I'll download it.

2058
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.

2059
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.

2060
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.

2061
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.

2062
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.

2063
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.

2064
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I've seen your last two to three studios, and I know you're on a shoestring budget.

2065
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So as Dark Soccer is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

2066
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Wait, what?

2067
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.

2068
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Let me finish reading it, Rob.

2069
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Okay.

2070
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So take note of the time and count them up. Let me know what the total is, and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.

2071
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I believe in the work that you do. Please keep it up.

2072
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.

2073
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.

2074
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft Matt.

2075
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
DS, you guys are old as fuck.

2076
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Did I just hear that somebody is donating ten dollars for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?

2077
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
So our chat-

2078
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
For every- donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

2079
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?

2080
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
In the chat room?

2081
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Yeah.

2082
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
How many people?

2083
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's seventy-nine people in chat right now, and I got a print screen right there. Seventy-nine people in the chat room.

2084
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
We love you Matt!

2085
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Honestly, that's a huge gesture. I'm not gonna hold him to it if he didn't realize what a big commitment he's making.

2086
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
He's allowed to put a cap on that for sure, even if that cap is ten dollars, it's fine.

2087
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But I will say this, that would go a long way in funding this station for a year because the money so far has come out of our pockets.

2088
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Especially mine, especially Bobby's in getting this station running, so I would say that would be a hugely appreciated gesture, and thank you.

2089
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Well two of them are bots according to Bobby.

2090
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Oh, so I'm sorry, seventy-seven.

2091
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Seventy-seven real people in chat.

2092
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
There you go.

2093
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Wow, that's super full.

2094
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.

2095
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Okay.

2096
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Well it's three bots, seventy-six.

2097
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Okay.

2098
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Alright, this is from Robobobobobobob.

2099
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:45,000
The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.

2100
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
It's a link on here about fall unlocking this Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.

2101
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
God, I hope so because I'm not buying those things.

2102
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:02,000
You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.

2103
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,000
But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.

2104
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Remember one versus one hundred Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes, so they must have felt it was too much like money.

2105
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.

2106
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Strangely, we can have a skeeball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.

2107
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
And that's from Robobobobob.

2108
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Okay.

2109
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Moving forward.

2110
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Hey, OLR.

2111
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Hi.

2112
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

2113
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since.

2114
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program.

2115
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:45,000
It might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants.

2116
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
My personal favorite was the one about the Wii peripherals.

2117
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Or, as Loki put it, $20 pieces of awkward shit.

2118
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with.

2119
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Okay, wow.

2120
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Regardless, doing this show for ten consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of.

2121
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:14,000
With that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters, myself included.

2122
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Congratulations for reaching the ten-year mark.

2123
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Here's to another ten years of successful podcasting.

2124
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Your faithful listener, Degenerate Johnny.

2125
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
P.S. I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.

2126
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
What selection would you suggest for a first comer?

2127
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.

2128
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
You know who should be giving us money per each listener?

2129
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Pinkberry!

2130
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
It's Pinkberry.

2131
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Um, my personal favorite is the chocolate.

2132
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.

2133
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.

2134
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Moving forward.

2135
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Thank you, Johnny.

2136
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Thank you, Johnny.

2137
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Howdy, O.L.R.

2138
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Howdy, partner.

2139
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I just wanted to say congrats on ten years of doing the show.

2140
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.

2141
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.

2142
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and gal to look up to.

2143
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Here is to ten more years of O.L.R., Brad.

2144
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It's from Brad at Pod Culture.

2145
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
We love Pod Culture. Mondays on vlog.

2146
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I still need to get you your missing stuff. Sorry.

2147
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Is it premiering this week?

2148
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Uh, a premier episode of Pod Culture?

2149
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yeah.

2150
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I believe it is this week, yes.

2151
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Okay.

2152
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Yay!

2153
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Alright.

2154
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Dear O.L.R., I was hoping to write a long, rambling email in honor of your tenth birthday on how this show has kept my attention for seven years.

2155
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.

2156
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.

2157
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Use. Use an honor.

2158
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I can recognize it.

2159
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:58,000
On how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out.

2160
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show.

2161
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
But unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the twentieth anniversary instead.

2162
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Cheers for everything, guys. Elliot B.

2163
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Elliot is from the UK. He's one of the vlog contributors.

2164
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
He is from the UK.

2165
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Yep.

2166
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And thank you. I, you know, I'm just me.

2167
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
And I like video games.

2168
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And...

2169
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
And I have a boyfriend.

2170
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
It is what it is.

2171
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
And I thank you guys for just, you know, not giving a shit.

2172
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Which people shouldn't.

2173
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Be happy that people are in love.

2174
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
That's what it's all about.

2175
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
And Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection.

2176
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but alright.

2177
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.

2178
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Oh, okay.

2179
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Okay. This one has a title in Spanish and he actually corrected me about el telefono es en fuego.

2180
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
That's not how it's actually supposed to be said.

2181
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
But I don't know anything about Spanish grammar so my bad.

2182
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Yo no se.

2183
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right.

2184
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja.

2185
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Naranja. Or is that it?

2186
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I guess that's orange.

2187
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deaf.

2188
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,000
It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag.

2189
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?

2190
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I've been listening to you guys since around 2005-2006, right after I graduated from university.

2191
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I discovered you guys from the old DDR Freak forums back when Bimani and DDR were still relevant to our lives.

2192
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And it still kinda is, just not as important as it was before.

2193
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I didn't start to listen religiously until late 2006 when you got some Bimani exclusive for a DDR game back then, probably UltraMix 4.

2194
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And while I came in for DDR, I stayed for the show.

2195
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I wasn't a fan of internet radio talk shows or podcasting back then, but you guys really got me into it.

2196
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I still remember the live 365 days, so do we.

2197
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.

2198
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Hey, I got speakers.

2199
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
You did.

2200
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I did.

2201
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
At least we got something. We didn't get a trophy but we got speakers.

2202
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I played bingo and won speakers.

2203
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Though it was unexpected to hear that you were leaving them, but not surprising after hearing the reasons why you left that service.

2204
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
But then came the All Games era.

2205
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
The show didn't change that much, it was pretty much the same.

2206
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:22,000
And so I discovered the Bobby Black Wolf show, met really great people over at the All Games chat room, and made some new friends over the years.

2207
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:28,000
There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff.

2208
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
But it also helps to show how great the community can be.

2209
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Always supportive to the show, in good times and especially bad times.

2210
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:40,000
You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.

2211
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I'm scrolling up.

2212
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
We have also learned a lot from you guys.

2213
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong.

2214
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
And to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.

2215
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad.

2216
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
To not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.

2217
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Okay.

2218
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
And Loki, you've taught us to question everything, not to accept anything as it is.

2219
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:14,000
And that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions.

2220
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I laughed.

2221
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Love it.

2222
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,000
You're an inspiration for all of us listening, whether it's been ten years, five years, or even just a few months.

2223
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
We are forever grateful for making every week a blast.

2224
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:30,000
You may not have many awards or recognition, but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet.

2225
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
You know, the one award we have is Sitting on My Mantle.

2226
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And it's not moving.

2227
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
It was a good award. It was the first podcast award for gaming.

2228
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Yeah.

2229
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Congrats Orange Lounge Radio. Congrats for ten fabulous years.

2230
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and while anything the OLR has given me all these years.

2231
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:55,000
And while you may act like a ten-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person a hundred years old.

2232
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of a hundred years old, however.

2233
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.

2234
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So here's for another ten whole years.

2235
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Raises glass.

2236
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Toast!

2237
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Thanks for everything.

2238
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Speaking of toast.

2239
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Speaking of toast.

2240
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Yay!

2241
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
French toast!

2242
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Wait, what?

2243
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Ew, hello not French toast.

2244
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I love French toast!

2245
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
French toast is amazing.

2246
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,000
There is a place, okay, I'm going on the food tangent.

2247
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:32,000
There's a place in Sacramento that has French toast made out of challah.

2248
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
What's challah?

2249
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Challah!

2250
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Challah?

2251
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:45,000
It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.

2252
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
That does sound delicious.

2253
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
This is the best French toast.

2254
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Challah French toast.

2255
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.

2256
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.

2257
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.

2258
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.

2259
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, ten more years.

2260
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
What do you say?

2261
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
To our 40s?

2262
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
I'm trying not to spill.

2263
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
We had clingies.

2264
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Cling.

2265
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Okay.

2266
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Misty, Misty, Misty.

2267
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
And now everyone get drunk.

2268
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
As I spill it on my shirt.

2269
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
That's some good wine.

2270
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I'm gonna get water intoxicated.

2271
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
It's making my headache feel a lot better, so.

2272
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
That's good.

2273
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake, but.

2274
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:40,000
It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey,

2275
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I'm gonna do this real quick.

2276
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
And then my brain's like, no.

2277
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
By the way, I have a follow up.

2278
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:52,000
And I kind of didn't react because I kind of did like this double take, like what, what?

2279
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
But I'm text messaging grandpa right now.

2280
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said it says this number, but it's 76 when you

2281
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
subtract the bots.

2282
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
And I said, I won't hold you to that.

2283
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
You really don't have to.

2284
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
He replied back, I'm of my word.

2285
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
760 bucks for VOG right there.

2286
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Sweet.

2287
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,000
So that's, um, I'll throw in another 40 just around that up to 80.

2288
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
What?

2289
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Really?

2290
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Yeah.

2291
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And then there's listening.

2292
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I like round numbers.

2293
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Well there.

2294
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
And you know what, Rob?

2295
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
What?

2296
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
What I will do, cause you know, I had that account open.

2297
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Um, how about we go take it and convert it to a business account.

2298
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Sounds great.

2299
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
We'll get started on that.

2300
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
We have plenty.

2301
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
We have at least two or three people in chat.

2302
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
They want to donate.

2303
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
There's like five bucks left in it right now because I started putting my design money

2304
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
in it.

2305
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Um, it may not be much in the scope of things.

2306
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I mean, let's be real, you know, for a business, but I, uh, you considering black Wolf and

2307
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I have probably paid about that much out of pocket.

2308
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Like I can't speak to a black Wolf has spent, but I know I've spent enough.

2309
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running.

2310
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
And I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much.

2311
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
If not about twice as much from his end of the things, cause he bought software and designs

2312
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
for the site.

2313
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So just to like get that money to for the next year is, is a great, great burden off

2314
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
our shoulders actually.

2315
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to

2316
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working

2317
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
on it.

2318
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And, um, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone here.

2319
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Who's been listening to, but, um, you know, there'll be more coming up about the book

2320
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
cause I'm, I'm designing it beginning to end.

2321
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
So, um, as soon as people send me old logos, Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say

2322
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
how you don't make any money on the show.

2323
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.

2324
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,000
We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would

2325
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
be nice.

2326
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Uh, the money's going to go right back into the show.

2327
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I can tell you, I came this close, this close to drop in threes.

2328
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:06,000
This close to drop in $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise

2329
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
for the show.

2330
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
And the only, cause I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like,

2331
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Oh my God.

2332
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
But the only thing that stopped me is that we would have to have three mic stands.

2333
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
And in my little bitty apartment that ain't going to fly.

2334
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Unless we get rock bandstands.

2335
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Maybe.

2336
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
We'll see.

2337
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
We'll see.

2338
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
You can also get the ones that are there on the swing arm things.

2339
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Like they have the little, they look like, yeah, so desk lamps or you can use a desk

2340
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
lamp.

2341
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
So all the money is going right back into the show.

2342
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
And don't forget my husband works at radio shack.

2343
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
So, all right.

2344
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Um, thank you guys so much.

2345
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
We will have, as soon as, as soon as Jamie has the account set up, we will tell you guys

2346
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
how you can donate.

2347
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,000
We have to, we have to tread carefully here though, because I'm really worried about tax

2348
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
stuff.

2349
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I don't know that stuff at all.

2350
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
So I need tax help.

2351
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,000
If anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us, I, that's what

2352
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I could really use.

2353
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Well, I mean, I think it's actually, and I'm not going to say any more about this, but

2354
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license.

2355
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
We had one.

2356
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
We did.

2357
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Yeah, we let it lapse.

2358
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Yeah.

2359
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Anyway, we won't talk about that on there.

2360
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Okay.

2361
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
All right.

2362
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
We have four emails left.

2363
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Yes.

2364
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Dear orange launch radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday

2365
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
and an attempt to keep this email short and to the point.

2366
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Let me say thank you.

2367
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I started listening to the podcast back on March.

2368
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
What?

2369
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I heard snorting.

2370
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Just chat.

2371
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Okay.

2372
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I started listening to the podcast back in March, 2010 after I bought my first iPod touch.

2373
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Wow.

2374
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
From that point on, sky, dark soccer and lucky have become an important part of my life.

2375
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Do we touch you?

2376
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Okay.

2377
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Anyway.

2378
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Sundays became orange launch radio nights instead of moaning and groaning for the upcoming

2379
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
workweek.

2380
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life and I

2381
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
fully agree with the listeners.

2382
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Through bad relationships, major family issues and a brief period of unemployment.

2383
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
OLR has been a constant positive in my life.

2384
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room

2385
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
and fellow listeners have become my second family.

2386
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Once again, thank you orange launch radio for running strong for 10 years.

2387
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak and you have definitely

2388
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.

2389
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to

2390
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
be there just like how OLR has been there for me.

2391
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.

2392
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Happy birthday.

2393
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
And that's from Sherzo, AKA Gion.

2394
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,000
And you're, I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.

2395
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I'm feeling verklempt.

2396
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Here's a topic.

2397
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Talk amongst yourselves.

2398
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Sorry.

2399
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
No.

2400
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Okay.

2401
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Three more to go.

2402
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Holy moly.

2403
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
To Rob, Loki and Dark Sakura.

2404
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,000
As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you

2405
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
have done over the past 10 years in that effort to entertain your listeners.

2406
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.

2407
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Live 365.

2408
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Ah, who cares?

2409
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
They sucked anyway.

2410
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Bite me.

2411
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
And then that was just on behalf of them.

2412
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
We had good years on Live 365.

2413
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
They took care of us for a little while.

2414
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
We did.

2415
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
We did.

2416
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Betty was nice.

2417
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Betty was nice.

2418
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
And then becoming a member of the all games community and finally joining you on your

2419
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
very own network vlog.

2420
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I have met each of you at least once, although I am fairly certain it is more than that.

2421
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.

2422
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meetup

2423
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.

2424
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,000
I remembered listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed, the whole

2425
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:35,000
group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.

2426
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble

2427
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.

2428
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face

2429
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.

2430
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.

2431
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Congratulations on this incredible milestone and I look forward to seeing everyone again

2432
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
at future events.

2433
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
And that's from ShadowNextGen.

2434
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I agree.

2435
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:08,000
That was a great memory and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that

2436
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.

2437
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yeah.

2438
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Well, this one isn't an anniversary memory.

2439
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
It's actually news.

2440
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Alright, fair enough.

2441
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
The next one.

2442
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
What do you mean?

2443
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
There's gaming news this week?

2444
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic.

2445
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
And this is Turrican, sorry.

2446
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
We'll be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra

2447
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
November 10th in Cologne, Germany.

2448
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Have a good one, guys.

2449
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Wow.

2450
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
That comes from RDG.

2451
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turrican soundtrack.

2452
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
It's a link from Kickstarter.

2453
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Very cool.

2454
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Okay.

2455
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Oh, dude, we got another email in too.

2456
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?

2457
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
This one comes from Dan Shadow.

2458
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Congratulations on 10 years, guys.

2459
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two

2460
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
parts and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.

2461
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.

2462
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Since the show, I, uh oh, lost my virginity.

2463
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Me too.

2464
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
No, just kidding.

2465
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
He graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie,

2466
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,000
ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.

2467
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Feel old yet?

2468
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Phoenix Force 5 for the win.

2469
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Thanks, guys.

2470
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I'm Batman.

2471
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:30,000
That's, okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.

2472
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Alright, yeah.

2473
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.

2474
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
He didn't talk like that, so he's Batman.

2475
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
No, I am Batman.

2476
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And then this one, okay.

2477
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Dear OLR, I love the podcast.

2478
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
However, there is one thing I must say.

2479
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having

2480
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
at the moment.

2481
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry.

2482
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,000
So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening.

2483
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite.

2484
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:05,000
You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.

2485
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
We had pizza because we were playing Catan.

2486
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
What does that have to do with pizza?

2487
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.

2488
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.

2489
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Bacon and garlic pizza.

2490
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
That actually sounds pretty epic.

2491
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I also have never had Pink Berry and hope to try it someday.

2492
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
What flavor should I get?

2493
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Chocolate? Strawberry?

2494
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I seriously want Pink Berry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.

2495
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.

2496
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:44,000
We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.

2497
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I want blood orange lounge radio.

2498
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Yes.

2499
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Thanks and keep up the great work, Randy.

2500
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
You know what?

2501
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,000
That is two emails on our 10th anniversary going, congrats, tell me more about Pink Berry.

2502
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,000
You know what, Rob?

2503
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
The name Randy always makes me laugh because of a catering place that's near my house called Randy Peters.

2504
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And that really makes me laugh because Randy.

2505
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
And the name Peter is also a nickname for certain parts of the male genitalia.

2506
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
The penis.

2507
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Yes, Loki. The penis.

2508
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,000
So Randy Peters.

2509
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Are you feeling Randy?

2510
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Starring Randy Peters. Yeah, I can see that.

2511
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
That would be the best male porn name ever.

2512
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
That sounds like a British male porn name.

2513
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Or Sir John Thomas.

2514
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
All right. Is that it for emails?

2515
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
That is it. I closed it.

2516
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Well, you know what comes after the emails.

2517
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Ten years of pent up angst.

2518
02:25:44,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Here's your mama.

2519
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:05,000
F you to me because I missed Girls Gone Wild today and I was so excited about it.

2520
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
But I was like I was dreaming about the show.

2521
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I texted Rob in my sleep.

2522
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Okay. And and Garris.

2523
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I blame Garris for this, too.

2524
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And I blame Shane for me blaming Garris because about Mass Effect.

2525
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I have played over since yesterday.

2526
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I played 20 something hours of Mass Effect.

2527
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I do not know what's wrong with me.

2528
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:41,000
I never even did that on WoW. So the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy 6 when I was in high school.

2529
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Just saying. Just saying.

2530
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I'm done.

2531
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Fuck you to my headache because I hate games.

2532
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I think it's a sinus headache because it's been a little windy today.

2533
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post a vlog about this show having a ten year anniversary.

2534
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Because they can have wonderful topics like,

2535
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Woman hit by balls sues little leaguer.

2536
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Or work in progress zombie survival short story.

2537
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Or hey is this person on the forum gay?

2538
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:23,000
You know they can have those posts on there. Oh but I post about something and they're just like eh no.

2539
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
We need to remove that post.

2540
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
That is kind of stupid.

2541
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Eh whatever. They're kids.

2542
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Why am I on a forum about.

2543
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Fuck kids.

2544
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Why am I a modding forum with all fuck me. Seriously it's all kids.

2545
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I mean not really.

2546
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I mean.

2547
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I'm not like that guy at Penn State.

2548
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I talk to these people online and then like I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about like modding and stuff and they're like teenagers.

2549
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I mean I feel so old.

2550
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I'm like yeah I'm like thirty something and you're sixteen seventeen.

2551
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I don't know.

2552
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Black Wolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.

2553
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,000
We never made the front page but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.

2554
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Probably helped that we asked pretty please on Facebook and so forth but anyway.

2555
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:17,000
My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.

2556
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Moving on.

2557
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.

2558
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
The stuff that I brought is wheat free.

2559
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.

2560
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Gamer girl has this FU too.

2561
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:33,000
She has this what is that carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.

2562
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
So FU to that.

2563
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:42,000
FU to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today.

2564
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:47,000
And he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza.

2565
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So FU to Loki.

2566
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Misty.

2567
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I will go ahead and second that FU to carpal tunnel.

2568
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist.

2569
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Other than that.

2570
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Yeah again not winning the lottery.

2571
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Because when I win the lottery once I get all the tech shit dealt with I will supply money for the fort.

2572
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Awesome FU to not having a fort.

2573
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I think that's what it comes down to.

2574
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Thanks you guys.

2575
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Alright that does it for the FUs of the week.

2576
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Let's see.

2577
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
So we did FUs.

2578
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Check.

2579
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
We did mailbag.

2580
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Check.

2581
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Fugal.

2582
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Check.

2583
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Hey I think it's time to open up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.

2584
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2585
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2586
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
The Skype line is now open for your calls on this very special 10th anniversary.

2587
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Whatever you want to talk about.

2588
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
If you want to talk about you know the 10th anniversary.

2589
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Cool.

2590
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
You want to talk about something going on in gaming.

2591
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Awesome.

2592
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
They're taking bets on who the first person is that's going to be through right now.

2593
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
We'll see what happens.

2594
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Meanwhile I could go to Twitter.

2595
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I want to read some of the comments from Twitter actually.

2596
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Because we got some really nice 10th anniversary.

2597
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I guess not because the Skype line is fired up.

2598
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
So let's go to the Skype line and take some calls.

2599
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2600
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Who's this?

2601
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Hola.

2602
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Bienvenidos.

2603
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.

2604
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Hello.

2605
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Hello?

2606
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Caller we can't hear you.

2607
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Hi.

2608
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Who's this?

2609
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
This would be wonderful if Skype would actually decide to work with me tonight.

2610
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Who is this?

2611
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
This is Jason.

2612
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Hi Jason.

2613
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
What's on your mind buddy?

2614
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Jason of the awesome.

2615
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:30,000
F you to Loki because I'm really hungry.

2616
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,000
So I'll second JV Mon.

2617
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Well that's not all I have to say but that was the most important thing in the last five

2618
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
minutes that's for sure.

2619
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,000
It's always important to turn to Loki and say hey buddy F you.

2620
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Oh it is.

2621
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Oh it is.

2622
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Time and time again.

2623
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Oh I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show

2624
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,000
that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 02.

2625
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I know I was still in high school so that puts it in 03 I remember my group of friends

2626
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:06,000
that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani

2627
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:11,000
discussion that we all know and love and obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less

2628
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
than that.

2629
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
A lot less.

2630
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I have no idea why I just said that.

2631
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Obviously it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.

2632
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Hopefully in a good way.

2633
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Oh absolutely.

2634
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Well thank you.

2635
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Numerous events of live coverage and yeah definitely hopefully that all starts coming back.

2636
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,000
And thank you it's very important to also say thank you as well to Jason because Jason

2637
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:40,000
if people don't know this Jason pretty much is the guy behind the website and the fact

2638
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:46,000
that we have a space to post or to post our podcast is thanks to Jason without him we

2639
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:50,000
may not have a place or we would have to dip into having ads in order to be able to host

2640
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,000
it or something but Jason made that happen for us so we really appreciate that.

2641
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Yeah and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.

2642
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Thank you so much.

2643
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Unless you guys want to that's all your choice of course.

2644
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Outside of the vlog stuff no not really.

2645
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,000
We still have a place to host our show so.

2646
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Shit anything else you want to say?

2647
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I want to be back on the show but that's for the future.

2648
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Come visit get on a train you might cross paths with Misty.

2649
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
July, August, November, January and then at the very least continuing perpetual August

2650
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
and January after that seems kind of definitive.

2651
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Let me whenever you want Jason just let us know when because you know we'll have your

2652
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
sexy radio voice on anytime.

2653
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Hell yeah my microphone and tone.

2654
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:42,000
If you're needing these suggestions if you go after some more microphones let's talk

2655
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:47,000
because you know I brought mine and we're kind of I'm kind of up on the lingo of microphones

2656
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
lately.

2657
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Yes I would love I want my voice to be sexy like yours how do I make that happen?

2658
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Pay way too much money unfortunately is the answer to that question.

2659
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Hooray.

2660
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
And next time warn me so we can crash it together.

2661
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Yeah yeah absolutely.

2662
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Amtrak buddies for life.

2663
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Who needs planes?

2664
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Who needs planes?

2665
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
All right Jason I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls but thanks again for

2666
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
all you do.

2667
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Good night guys congratulations.

2668
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Take care thanks.

2669
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Couldn't have done it without you.

2670
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Later.

2671
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
1877 game OLR or the calls keep on coming in.

2672
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

2673
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
It's Shane.

2674
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
It's Shane what's up?

2675
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Well I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world can you guess them?

2676
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:32,000
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio you're talking to me and talking about Mass Effect

2677
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
with me.

2678
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Talking about none of those are the right answer.

2679
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I am playing Mass Effect I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.

2680
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:47,000
So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.

2681
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Thank you appreciate your paying attention yes.

2682
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
And I wanted to say that for me without this show I never would have worked at Konami and

2683
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:02,000
that's a major thing for me so I have to thank the show for that.

2684
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I'm kind of sorry about that too at the same time.

2685
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
No I'm kidding.

2686
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
You had some great memories at Konami though right?

2687
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Yes like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.

2688
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,000
That was one of my best memories.

2689
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?

2690
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?

2691
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
No.

2692
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR

2693
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
that you can talk about?

2694
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:35,000
I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR but I would say one of the more scandalous

2695
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:41,000
things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one.

2696
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:51,000
We had no females work there anymore so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.

2697
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I mean he still had underwear on but he decided that since there were no females there was

2698
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
no reason for pants.

2699
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Hey Shane last week I went to work with no pants.

2700
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
What was that?

2701
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Last week I went to work with no pants.

2702
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Maybe you were wearing a skirt.

2703
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
This is true.

2704
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
He was not wearing a skirt.

2705
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
This is really important Shane this is the most important question.

2706
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
You tell a kilt.

2707
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Was it boxers or briefs?

2708
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
It was boxers.

2709
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Okay because boxers that's kind of like swimwear.

2710
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,000
That's not that bad.

2711
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,000
That's still going with no pants.

2712
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000
That is true.

2713
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Now boxer briefs are fairly exciting.

2714
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
They're kind of in the middle.

2715
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Because then you get the grippy with the.

2716
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Alright look that's not what we're here to talk about tonight.

2717
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
I don't know what show you're listening to.

2718
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Underwear lounge radio.

2719
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
This sounds about par for the course.

2720
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
That's what you're talking about.

2721
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
And Garris.

2722
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
That's a great story about Konami.

2723
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Some of the games were designed with no pants.

2724
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
You think they would have come out better.

2725
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
No just kidding the Ultra Mix games were the best in the series.

2726
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
You know I've always said that and it's not just because you guys were working on them.

2727
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Pantsless rage.

2728
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
But think about this you guys.

2729
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:02,000
If it weren't for this show then Shane would have ended up at Konami.

2730
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:08,000
In a way this show impacted the game we made this show about.

2731
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
It's true.

2732
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:13,000
And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusives reveals.

2733
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Because I was the one that brought those songs to you.

2734
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
That's true you brought the first couple.

2735
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:22,000
And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.

2736
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And you know unfortunately we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.

2737
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,000
But he was a big part when Ultra Mix 4 was coming out.

2738
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
He let our show straight up have the exclusives on everything.

2739
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
And that was a wonderful honor.

2740
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
And you know he is greatly missed.

2741
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,000
As is well Jason didn't pass away.

2742
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
But Jason you know moved on from Konami.

2743
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Or had to move on from Konami.

2744
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,000
And obviously his lack of impact.

2745
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You know not being at Konami anymore has greatly been felt.

2746
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
You know so.

2747
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
This is true.

2748
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal.

2749
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.

2750
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
That's true.

2751
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
But as I was I think talking to him one night about.

2752
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Like I go back and look at my old stuff.

2753
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
And some of it's garbage.

2754
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Like really really truly garbage.

2755
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
And I wish I could get a do over.

2756
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
It's kind of funny too.

2757
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Because someone like you know you got me into Echo Image.

2758
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Which is like one of my favorite bands ever now.

2759
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Because of DDR.

2760
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
And maybe I'm not supposed to say this.

2761
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
But oh shit oh well it's been seven years.

2762
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,000
You told me about that song long before the game was out.

2763
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Because it was amazing.

2764
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
And played the CD for me. What?

2765
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
It's been seven years?

2766
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
It's been a long time hasn't it?

2767
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
How long has it been since Ultra Mix was out?

2768
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
A million years I don't know.

2769
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Like 2005?

2770
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I've known Shane for.

2771
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:56,000
You and I met because of this show obviously.

2772
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Yeah it was because of Animal Crossing.

2773
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
That's right it was.

2774
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
And then so god I've probably known you at least nine years.

2775
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Because I remember you came to this show like during its first year.

2776
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
And all that.

2777
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
But yeah you told me about Skulk and all that.

2778
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
And then we found the CD somewhere.

2779
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
And I fell in love with that CD.

2780
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
And that's one of my favorite bands ever now.

2781
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Even though they only ever did one stinking album.

2782
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yes because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.

2783
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Which is you know the same thing.

2784
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
They're just high.

2785
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Alright Shane I gotta let you go to get more calls.

2786
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
They're busy wrestling me.

2787
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Anything else you want to say especially about us?

2788
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
No why would I want to talk about you?

2789
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I don't know. Because we're awesome.

2790
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Because of Garris.

2791
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
I thought it's but Garris not because of Garris.

2792
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Because without us Shane you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.

2793
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
That's a lie. It's reverse.

2794
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Alright bye.

2795
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Bye.

2796
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,000
1877 game OLR. Our username on skype is orange launch radio.

2797
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Or the phone is already ringing so you can just go to another phone.

2798
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Oh hi.

2799
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2800
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:01,000
I wasn't expecting to be next but hi.

2801
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Hi.

2802
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Shut off your radio stream because I'm hearing myself.

2803
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Oh okay.

2804
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
I don't know why I'm hearing myself.

2805
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Go ahead and say what you want to say.

2806
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Oh I'm sorry.

2807
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years.

2808
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Well off and on.

2809
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
And I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.

2810
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Yay.

2811
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Give me a second.

2812
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Dang it.

2813
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Alright.

2814
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I wanted to say that

2815
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I enjoy listening to you guys.

2816
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
When I came back from

2817
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Rhode Island and I was starting to get into

2818
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Dance Dance Revolution

2819
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I found you guys on

2820
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Live 365 and

2821
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I started listening

2822
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
and I met a lot of good friends like

2823
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Richie which is

2824
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
you know

2825
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I forget his name

2826
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
while here.

2827
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
I've met Junami and

2828
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I just stayed for a long time.

2829
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
And if you guys weren't here

2830
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I wouldn't have started, had the

2831
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
inspiration to start this ingenious radio.

2832
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
We're just still going by the way.

2833
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Congratulations on that.

2834
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
I actually was, I mean this is going to sound terrible

2835
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
but I knew you guys had started the show

2836
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
or the station. I knew it was kind of like

2837
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
you know a spin off of what had

2838
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
been going on at OLR but I actually thought

2839
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
it stopped during the time

2840
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
we were doing all games but apparently it hadn't.

2841
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
It's still going.

2842
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Yep. We're still doing. Congrats on that.

2843
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
You guys have got to be getting up to like

2844
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
eight or nine years yourselves.

2845
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
No. Really?

2846
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Probably about four or five maybe.

2847
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I thought it was more than that. Alright.

2848
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
We've been around for a while. I started on Live 365

2849
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
back in the day

2850
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
and like I was just starting it

2851
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
and I was like huh.

2852
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of

2853
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
like took over from there and

2854
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
created like a solid stream and everything.

2855
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
I ask him every now and then if I can

2856
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
start my own stream you know

2857
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
stream on the station

2858
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
and he lets me every now and then

2859
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
but I haven't gotten contact with him

2860
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
for like a few months but I do too.

2861
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I think one of the best comments we ever

2862
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
get on the show about

2863
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
doing the show is that you know you guys

2864
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
because of you guys I kind of

2865
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
figured out how to do my own podcast or

2866
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
I learned that any idiot can podcast

2867
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
because you guys do it so I started

2868
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
my own show and believe it or not that's actually

2869
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
like you know what they say imitation

2870
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
is the finest form of flattery.

2871
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Not to say that everybody's copying us because

2872
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
I don't think they are but just the fact that

2873
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
we're empowering people to let their own voices

2874
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
be heard means a lot

2875
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
and it's a great compliment. It really is.

2876
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Yeah.

2877
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Thank you for being around. If you

2878
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
weren't around I would never

2879
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
have any friends from the DDR

2880
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
universe. I've been friends with

2881
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Junami for over seven years.

2882
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Wow. Well congrats and

2883
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
thank you for listening and being here

2884
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
with the show. Do you have anything else you want to share

2885
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
tonight? I love you guys.

2886
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Mwah. Heart heart heart heart.

2887
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Hold on hold on somebody else wants to send

2888
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
kisses. Here he is.

2889
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
There you go.

2890
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Alright. Have a great night

2891
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:07,000
uni. Bye. Bye.

2892
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I don't even have to give the number. The calls just keep coming in.

2893
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio. Who's this?

2894
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Hello.

2895
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Hello and let me just say

2896
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
if you're not getting through

2897
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
on Skype it's never

2898
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
been this busy on the phone so just keep

2899
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
trying. We'll get to you eventually. We have

2900
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
a good 30 minutes still to take calls.

2901
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
What's on your mind SSJ100 map?

2902
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Not much. Just want to

2903
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
congratulate you guys on ten years

2904
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
of amazing work in our radio.

2905
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Thank you very much.

2906
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Well you know I was

2907
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
trying to do the map and how long

2908
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
I've been actually listening and I came up

2909
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
with 2004

2910
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I started listening to the show.

2911
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Wow that was a long time ago.

2912
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
And thank you for the holiday news.

2913
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
The funny thing is

2914
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I didn't start listening to

2915
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
all our posts. I think

2916
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
I told you this several times that

2917
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
I started listening to

2918
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
a show that you would have on Wednesday nights

2919
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
on lives 365.

2920
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Outside the Box.

2921
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Oh yes. Outside

2922
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
the Box. Oh god. The spinoff

2923
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
shows. Before there

2924
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
was Horde House

2925
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
there were shows, spinoff shows

2926
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
on the Orange Tons

2927
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Radio network. Yes I

2928
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
remember Outside the Box very well.

2929
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Which is kind of you know the prerequisite

2930
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
to the video game show

2931
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
that this became.

2932
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
In a way yeah.

2933
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
I never really thought about it that way

2934
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
which I know sounds weird but you're right.

2935
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
We kind of

2936
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
started doing the general gaming

2937
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
chat there. I think I kind of always

2938
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
had the fire in me

2939
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
to do like a general gaming show

2940
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
and like I think maybe subconsciously

2941
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.

2942
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
So that's why we had Outside the Box.

2943
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I think you know back then

2944
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
it was you

2945
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
DDR Angel and Wanky Style

2946
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
kind of thing.

2947
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
So

2948
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
yeah now that's what I started with.

2949
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I was originally

2950
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
introduced to the show by Sephora 12

2951
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
16

2952
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
who

2953
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
you know

2954
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
who caught on to it from

2955
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
DDR Freak re-broadcasting

2956
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
the show.

2957
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Oh yeah DDR Freak.

2958
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Yeah they re-broadcast it.

2959
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
They re-broadcast it.

2960
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Like that.

2961
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
SSJ 100 Matt I have something special

2962
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
just for you.

2963
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Since you brought up old memories

2964
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
here's a really old memory.

2965
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
You ready?

2966
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
It is Wednesday night.

2967
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
You are tuned in to Outside the Box

2968
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
live on Orange Lounge Radio.

2969
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000

is a show dedicated to

2971
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
video game news, reviews

2972
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
and all the other randomness

2973
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
you might discover

2974
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Outside the Box.

2975
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000

Sky, Rice Princess

2982

and Wanky Style.

2983
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I remember the one

2984
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
cause I used to play

2985
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Final Fantasy 11 right next to you guys

2986
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
on that.

2987
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
It was

2988
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Final Fantasy 7

2989
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
where you guys were playing One Winged Angel

2990
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
or whatever.

2991
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
MURDER!

2992
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Yeah that was a good memory.

2993
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
You know you bring up a good point

2994
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
that really was

2995
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I mean especially as you listen to the intro

2996
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
it's about video games

2997
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
and all the randomness outside the box.

2998
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
That's kind of this fucking show

2999
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
now.

3000
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
So in a way Outside the Box took over

3001
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
you make a damn good point.

3002
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Yeah.

3003
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Well most of all you know

3004
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
all of that has always been about the community

3005
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
the fans and everything

3006
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
and I think over the past ten years

3007
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
we've kind of grown to a really nice community.

3008
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
We've

3009
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
gotten friends involved in the show

3010
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
I mean I've got

3011
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I've told a couple of people

3012
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
and now you guys

3013
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
while we are

3014
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
going to have a dream game about you

3015
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
guys coming out.

3016
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
So you know

3017
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I've always said tell a friend

3018
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
and it's true

3019
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
tell a friend

3020
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.

3021
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
That's right and then it funds my future trips

3022
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
to New York which I'm trying to get back to

3023
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
but $800 will go a long way

3024
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
and get me back to New York. No I'm kidding

3025
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
but I will be trying to get back to New York

3026
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
with my own money very soon so that will be awesome.

3027
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
It's true you know

3028
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations

3029
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
and

3030
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
next time I see

3031
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
any of you guys

3032
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I'll buy you a beer or

3033
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
probably in your case red mango

3034
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
or pinkberry.

3035
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I'll take free beer

3036
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
and free yogurt.

3037
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
And I will always exchange holiday cards with you.

3038
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
That's true.

3039
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Alright well thank you so much for your

3040
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
support SSG100M. It was a pleasure

3041
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
meeting you a couple times and

3042
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I'm sure I'll see you guys again

3043
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
up in New York. Absolutely.

3044
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Alright take care buddy.

3045
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
You know without SSG100M

3046
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I want to say without him

3047
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show

3048
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
and I see YYR is in chat so he can confirm

3049
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
or deny this. YYR of course

3050
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
is making the first

3051
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
OLR dream game a reality

3052
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
budget ferret tossing which I guess he's in like

3053
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
push push push mode with it right now and it sounds

3054
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
like it's gonna be

3055
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
a big game. Like it's gonna be

3056
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
one that people are talking about outside this show.

3057
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
That is awesome. Cause it's

3058
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
gonna be awesome. We're gonna do all we

3059
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
can to make bungee ferret tossing a success.

3060
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
You know what I actually have

3061
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
to thank SSG100M for having

3062
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
a hand in helping me with my

3063
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
conversion. Oh

3064
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
that's true. That is that's there

3065
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
we go. That's the big thing you went through personally.

3066
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Yeah. On this show.

3067
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Well I did get married. Oh yeah

3068
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
there's that too. Eh that's no

3069
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
big deal. I'm just kidding.

3070
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Alright um

3071
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I mean I got married too.

3072
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
I'm not making a big deal out of it. I got

3073
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I had like four boyfriends

3074
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
alright listen

3075
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
but this one's the best one

3076
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
obviously. I agree.

3077
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Me too. Alright let's move on.

3078
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3079
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Hello.

3080
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's

3081
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
this? This is Rama from

3082
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Indonesia. Whoa

3083
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000

3084
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Yes. I

3085
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
recognize your name from Twitter. I'm

02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
happy you're listening live. What's up

3087
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
buddy? Yeah

3088
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
it's fun. It's nice to talk to

3089
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
you finally because I've been here

3090
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
for you know like um

3091
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
since 06 I guess.

3092
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Oh my gosh. Well to what do

3093
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
we owe this phone call tonight?

3094
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Yeah so I just want to say

3095
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
that you know maybe I'm the

3096
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
father's caller.

3097
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I did enjoy everything

3098
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
that you know even though I'm blind

3099
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
personally I can enjoy everything

3100
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
that you've done. I'm

3101
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
especially lucky and all

3102
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
of that kind of joke

3103
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
it's nice. Unfortunately

3104
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
because of the distance you're breaking up really

3105
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
bad and we're having a hard time hearing you but

3106
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
I think I heard something about and I

3107
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
know this is true about you from Twitter and everything

3108
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
that you are a blind gamer and

3109
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
you know what's funny is that we've had a couple

3110
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
you're not the only one which is funny

3111
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
we've had a couple blind gamers that I've

3112
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
heard from from Twitter and we've gotten emails as

3113
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
well and um it's really

3114
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
it's really

3115
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
humbling in a way because you know

3116
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
sometimes we take things for granted

3117
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
like you know sight

3118
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
you know that not everybody has

3119
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
and I

3120
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I'm so happy that we get to kind of deliver

3121
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
something that you don't need that

3122
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
for to be able to participate in this

3123
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
program. I

3124
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
it's just a

3125
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
it's a really humbling

3126
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
how big am I in this universe type of feeling

3127
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000

I want to wish you guys a happy

3151
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
10 year anniversary since

3152
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
you're wondering if your podcast I know has been around

3153
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
for 10 years

3154
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
we are finally snatching the crown

3155
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
of we are the longest running video game

3156
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
podcast on the internet we've done some heavy

3157
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
research and we don't

3158
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
think anybody has been around

3159
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
right now anyway as long

3160
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
as we have

3161
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
you know it's a nice feather to put in our hat

3162
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
um but what we don't want

3163
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
to do is we don't want to be all like

3164
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
well we're the best

3165
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
cause we've been around that long cause that's

3166
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
not the impression we want to give there's a lot

3167
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
of great great shows out

3168
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
there and you know just the other day I was

3169
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
kind of talking on twitter with uh

3170
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
video game outsiders you know I brought them up on the show plenty

3171
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
of times I think they're a great show they have a

3172
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
very similar chemistry to what we have here

3173
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
except they kind of like whereas

3174
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
our foundation is DDR

3175
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
they were an adult gaming community

3176
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter

3177
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
games so obviously a very different type

3178
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
of thing but they were talking about like wow

3179
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
we've been around for 7 years but

3180
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I guess they had to correct somebody like oh yeah

3181
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
OLR's been around longer but I'm like dude don't

3182
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
sell yourselves short what you guys have accomplished

3183
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
in 7 years is amazing

3184
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
most shows don't get to

3185
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
6 months or 1 year

3186
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
and you know to have your

3187
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
own community and all that is just

3188
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
it's an amazing

3189
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
feeling it really is so anyway

3190
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
that's exactly the reason why

3191
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I try to listen to you guys

3192
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
as much as I can because

3193
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
it's mostly the community that actually has

3194
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
me hooked on it I've met

3195
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
a lot of great people on there

3196
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
some in real life and some I wish

3197
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
I could meet in real life one day

3198
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
you know I've met some

3199
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I knew DJ Ramus from a while back

3200
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
from some of the conventions I finally

3201
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
got to meet actually I got to hang out with Misty

3202
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic

3203
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I got to meet

3204
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
some of the other people like the

3205
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Effective Candy way back in the day

3206
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000

3207
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
friends now and even

Jamie it's like so I don't talk to her

3209
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
I still consider her really cool and

3210
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
one of the people I admire the most

3211
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
aww

3212
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000

02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000

and just we really need to make

3224
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
an effort to get to more conventions and

3225
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
do these like especially packs because that's

3226
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
you know that's the one that all the fans want to get to

3227
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
and just like try to get people together and just like

3228
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
hey let's let's go do

3229
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
what this show

3230
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
was think about it

3231
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
this show is because we used to go to the

3232
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
arcades and play video games and talk shit

3233
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
so let's get together IRL

3234
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
play video games and talk shit

3235
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
exactly

3236
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
oh my god did you see that guy

3237
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Rob holding onto the bar

3238
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
what you did this week

3239
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I forgot I mentioned um

3240
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
well I didn't play it but I installed Step

3241
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
maybe on my laptop mainly because

3242
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
I was looking for sound files from 4th Mix

3243
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
but I couldn't find them but uh

3244
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
yeah

3245
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
I have to admit when I was playing

3246
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
DDR this week cause I did play Max 2

3247
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
and I played Disney Rave once each

3248
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
and I have to admit there was a part of me

3249
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
that even though that dance pad was ass

3250
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
cause it was from a golf land and one of the buttons

3251
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
didn't even work there was a part of me that went

3252
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
I kind of missed this

3253
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
yeah well I was watching was it 4th

3254
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Mix Plus and 4th Mix

3255
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
videos and stuff like that I'm like damn

3256
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I missed that machine was awesome

3257
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
even just 4th Mix and stuff

3258
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Max and Max 2 were

3259
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
pretty sweet and

3260
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
I kind of wish we had like something cause like I was even

3261
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
looking at some of the uh cause I never really

3262
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
got into Supernova and Supernova 2

3263
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
and like I don't even know what the hell they have

3264
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
now it's like uh that

3265
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff

3266
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
and there's like you know

3267
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I don't even know what

3268
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
half of these songs are anymore

3269
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
because I haven't played any of the

3270
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
you know Bomani games in a while but it's like

3271
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
that'd be kind of fun to go back

3272
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
I have to admit there was a part of me that didn't want

3273
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
to get up on the machine because I was like here I am

3274
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
there's all these teenagers running around

3275
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
all these people at the water park

3276
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
here I am 34 years old

3277
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
and I want to get up on that machine

3278
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
and play DDR and make a fool of myself

3279
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
but there really came a point where I said you know what

3280
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
fuck em

3281
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
hey man

3282
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I did the same exact thing um

3283
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
when I was at Anime Central this uh this year

3284
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
they had a 4th Mix Plus machine

3285
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
and I got on

3286
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
and I started

3287
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I started doing tech and then

3288
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
I think through the 2nd song I said ah

3289
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
fuck this I'm not a techie

3290
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
so I freestyled the rest of the damn

3291
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
damn stages

3292
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
nice that is awesome

3293
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
and also there in over

3294
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
New Jersey down to Jersey Shore

3295
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
there is an older but still

3296
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
workable 7th Mix

3297
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
wow

3298
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
that's pretty cool

3299
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
that's awesome that there's still lots of DDR machines

3300
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
that are working everywhere you know I should make it a goal

3301
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
to go play DDR as many places as possible

3302
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
before it's a thing of the past for real

3303
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
for real so

3304
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000

I found you guys was through Bobby Black Wolf

3314
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
show because I was a big fan of

3315
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Friday Night Gaming and I believe

3316
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
that the partnership that you guys

3317
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
have got

3318
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
together now is going to

3319
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
bring you to a much better future

3320
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
and I'm so

3321
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
glad to be around

3322
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
seeing this you know

3323
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
well you know Bobby and

3324
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
us you know are very kind of like

3325
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
minded I mean Bobby was a big music

3326
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
game fan as well if you

3327
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
kind of look at our classic game of the week BeatMania

3328
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
2DX Bobby will admit that's one of his

3329
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
favorite games he even said in chat he would have

3330
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
that game in his basement so there's a lot

3331
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
that Bobby and us have in common yet we're

3332
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
different enough where that our shows kind of

3333
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
are different you know he's the very NPR show

3334
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
we're the very morning room

3335
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
waka waka waka type of show

3336
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
and uh you know

3337
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
we need a waka waka waka soundboard

3338
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
but you know the two of us

3339
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
actually compliment each other very well and I think

3340
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
kind of professionally there's a lot we

3341
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
look at too and you know especially

3342
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
you know obviously it's no secret there's been some

3343
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
big changes in the past year and there was

3344
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
a lot that we were looking at going

3345
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
what could we be doing better we kind of

3346
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
feel like right now we're kind of

3347
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
we're kind of riding a stationary bike

3348
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
right now we're doing our things

3349
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
we're burning calories we ain't going anywhere

3350
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
so how can we take

3351
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
this to the next level and you know that's

3352
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Bobby's a great business partner

3353
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
in that regard and shit I mean

3354
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
look at what he has done with vog network

3355
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
dot com look at that website

3356
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
that is in a month

3357
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
I mean it's amazing

3358
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
so and you

3359
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
know and I wouldn't have been listening to your show

3360
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
without him and I'm so

3361
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
glad that I stumbled upon it unfortunately

3362
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
during my

3363
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
my current situation at the time

3364
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
when I first started listening to

3365
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Bobby I wasn't able to hear your

3366
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
show but now that I'm more involved with it I'm

3367
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
just like so glad to be

3368
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
a part well thank you

3369
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
we're happy to have you here

3370
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
the vog network clubhouse and all that

3371
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
and I still have an open

3372
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
invitation for you guys if you ever pass

3373
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
through Napa I have

3374
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000

3375
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
tour for you set up

3376
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000

I bet JV Mon wishes he'd known that

3380
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
the other day when he went out there testing

3381
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
I'd be down for that as long as someone

3382
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
you know carrying me by the time we're

3383
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
done yeah I would have to get a DD

3384
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
but if we could figure that out I'm not a fan

3385
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
of wine. Jamie trust me I know the bus

3386
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000

3397
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
for the vog network clubhouse

3398
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
you know that shit is epic

3399
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
you know what Rob?

3400
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
go ahead Dark Soccer first

3401
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
in the article that

3402
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Tara wrote on Geek Life there's actually a link

3403
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
to

3404
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio

3405
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
back in the day that talked about our first few shows

3406
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
so I relinked that in the chatroom

3407
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
yes very cool

3408
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
speaking of the clubhouse I was trying to visit the clubhouse

3409
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
yesterday

3410
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
I'm so glad I've never come back

3411
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
to home because I tried

3412
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
you know I downloaded the new client

3413
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
and which I'm pissed off

3414
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
because it didn't fucking save my crazy

3415
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
hobo Santa

3416
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
which is weird

3417
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
so I had a new character so I was like

3418
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
okay I'm going to check out the clothes in there

3419
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
crash okay fine

3420
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
I'm not going to check out the clothes relaunch the whole thing again

3421
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
I'm going to try altering my appearance

3422
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
crash again so I'm like fuck this

3423
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
I'm not coming back to home

3424
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
we got another call coming in I want to get to but let me just say this

3425
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
I think home would benefit greatly if they would just

3426
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
force you to do a 2 gig download

3427
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
up front I mean there's just so much

3428
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
buffering and loading

3429
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
and you know it's just that's the one

3430
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
drawback it's not as

3431
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
smooth it's not

3432
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
as seamless that's what I'm looking for of an experience

3433
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
as it ought to be and if it was

3434
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
that seamless experience I think home would

3435
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
be the thing everybody's talking

3436
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
about but certainly it has its fans

3437
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
you know and I think because of

3438
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
the environment that it does provide it's

3439
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
kind of similar to Second Life but for gamers anyway

3440
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
I won't get too far into that let me go to the phones

3441
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?

3442
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
It's the one and only Ranma

3443
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
Hey Ranma what's up you finally got through

3444
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Yes cause you know you can't have an anniversary show

3445
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
without me doing the toast

3446
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Oh you missed us with

3447
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
the wine already but I guess

3448
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
I have some grapefruit soda

3449
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
for you buddy

3450
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Of course you know cause this year

3451
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
it's ten years

3452
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
ten great years of friendship which is

3453
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
an awesome thing cause you know why?

3454
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
Friends rock? Friends give you money when you're

3455
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
poor? Yes my friendship is magic don't forget

3456
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Ugh die

3457
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Hehehe

3458
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
But I have here

3459
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
three drinks I have a Loki

3460
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
I have a Jamie

3461
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
and I have a Rob

3462
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Now the first drink I dedicate to Loki

3463
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
is a shot of very

3464
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
strong honey mead

3465
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
because he is straight forward

3466
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
to the point we'll say what he

3467
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
has to say and in the end

3468
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Honey Badger doesn't give a fuck

3469
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
And it burns a little going down does it?

3470
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Ah yes

3471
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Let's just walk away from that comment

3472
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
On the bottle

3473
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Ew he's eating that snake that's disgusting

3474
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Now

3475
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Next up I

3476
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
have for Jamie

3477
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Now for Christmas I got this nice

3478
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
bottle of rum

3479
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
It's very potent, very powerful

3480
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
and I only open it for

3481
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
special occasions and close friends

3482
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
and Jamie is my darling Oogchon

3483
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
so I toast

3484
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
this glass to her

3485
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Thank you Ronchon

3486
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
I think it might have onions in it

3487
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
I think it might have a little onion in it

3488
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
I'm gonna have a beer for you when I get home

3489
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Make sure it's a Guinness

3490
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
I'm not a Guinness but it's a Killians

3491
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Now

3492
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
I have here a drink

3493
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
that Ron would probably enjoy

3494
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
because we made this at a con a couple

3495
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
of years ago, it's called

3496
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Captain Fabulous

3497
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
It's one part Captain

3498
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Morgan and two parts

3499
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Fruit Punch, thus the name Captain

3500
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Fabulous

3501
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
I remember Captain Fabulous

3502
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
and it is Fabulous

3503
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Oh definitely, oh girl

3504
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Do you remember the drink we invented at Fanime?

3505
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
When all we had was the

3506
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
bottle of pineapple Malibu so we

3507
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
paid five bucks for twenty ounce

3508
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
of 7-Up

3509
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
That was so epic

3510
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
We made that 7-Up last and we're

3511
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
playing apples to apples

3512
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Oh hell yes

3513
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Drunk on pineapple Malibu and 7-Up

3514
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Oh Oogchon you are the party girl

3515
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
And you saw me through

3516
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
my horrible cosplay

3517
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
There's no such thing as horrible cosplay

3518
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
get over that, come on now

3519
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
We didn't get to go to

3520
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Fanime to do like, because that was one of the plans

3521
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
was well we're gonna do something at Fanime for our

3522
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
ten year anniversary or whatever

3523
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
I still have my costume from Halloween

3524
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
in my car

3525
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
I was waiting to use that again

3526
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Alright well Ron I gotta let you

3527
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
go to try and squeeze in a few more calls

3528
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
I didn't even do it, I didn't even take the drink yet

3529
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
Drink it! Drink it!

3530
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
What are you waiting for? Chug chug chug

3531
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
Here's to you, here's to me

3532
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
the best our friends will ever be

3533
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
If we should ever happen to disagree, well

3534
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
fuck you and here's to me, and it's going down

3535
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
So I have to show you the other

3536
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
toast

3537
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Here's to us, who's like us?

3538
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Damn few, and they're all dead

3539
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Woo!

3540
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000

Happy Pride Rama

03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
Okay, stay Luigi

3548

Will do

3549
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
1877 game OLR

3550
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
username on skype is orange

3551
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
lounge radio, it was gay pride this weekend

3552
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
by the way, in San Francisco

3553
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
and that brought up the conversation in the chat room

3554
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
what if OLR had a pride parade

3555
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
what would be the first float

3556
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
and I said of course the opening

3557
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float

3558
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
followed immediately

3559
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
by Dykes on Bikes, because you

3560
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
can't have a parade without

3561
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
Dykes on Bikes, I'm sorry

3562
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
That's what the people are coming out to see

3563
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
I totally saw Dykes on Bikes

3564
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
today at the parade

3565
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Did you?

3566
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Yes, there was a few naked

3567
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Dykes on Bikes at the parade today too

3568
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
That's cause you're in San Francisco

3569
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
home of the finest, alright let's take some more

3570
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
calls, hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3571
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Hey this is Acteft

3572
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Hey Acteft, what's up?

3573
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
Well, first of all

3574
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
I want to again

3575
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
thank you for 10 years of

3576
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
magnificent online radio

3577
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Thank you very much

3578
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
and thank you for being a part of it

3579
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
I actually say

3580
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
my words in Spanish, even though

3581
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
you probably won't understand it, but

3582
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
you know the message, you know the feeling

3583
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
So

3584
03:05:43,000 --> 03:06:05,000
...

3585
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
There it is

3586
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
That was very nice, thank you

3587
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
I wanna make a joke about how

3588
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
we know that's a song you sing at funerals

3589
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
but I'm gonna stay away from doing that joke

3590
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
cause it'd be disrespectful and I think

3591
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
that was

3592
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
very lovely, no really, thank you

3593
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
It's humbling

3594
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
to know that it's a worldwide

3595
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
show and we've even been complimented before

3596
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
and I take great pride

3597
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
in this, speaking of OLR Pride

3598
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
I take great pride in the fact that we do try to

3599
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
remember that we do have a worldwide audience out there

3600
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
that we're not, you know, the show from the Americas

3601
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
you know, there

3602
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
there is a whole world out there

3603
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
And thank you for doing a bumper for us

3604
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Yeah, for VOG, yeah

3605
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
Yeah, no problem, and again, thanks

3606
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
for being, well, who you are

3607
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
and bringing us every week

3608
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
a very good show, even though we have

3609
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
we have had some problems

3610
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
from their side and even on my side

3611
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
it's still a pleasure

3612
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
and still pretty

3613
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
enjoying to listen to you

3614
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
well, listen to you every week

3615
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Damn, I'm

3616
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
kinda nervous because I'm excited

3617
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Let me put it this way, if friends

3618
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
agreed on every single solitary thing

3619
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
they'd be really boring

3620
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
That's true

3621
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
So we'll end on that note

3622
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Act Def, thank you so much, and enjoy

3623
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
that Kirby collection coming out later this year

3624
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Yeah, I will. I thought of you when I saw that

3625
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Alright, later buddy

3626
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Later

3627
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR

3628
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3629
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
We have one or two more calls

3630
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
coming in. I hope we get through them all

3631
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
it's already after 9

3632
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
That's alright, we can go a little long tonight

3633
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
We can go a little long tonight

3634
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
I gotta let the rest of that wine burn

3635
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
off so I can take

3636
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
It's already gone

3637
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
I had to put mine in the fridge, I didn't want to finish it off

3638
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
because I don't want to drive drunk, that's irresponsible

3639
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
so

3640
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Alright, oh

3641
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
there it goes, lighting up again, hi, you're on

3642
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3643
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
Hello, this is George Takei

3644
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Oh my

3645
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
Oh my

3646
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
What's up Georgie?

3647
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you

3648
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
on your teniversary

3649
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Pretty soon this show will be older than you, George

3650
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
I know, I'm looking forward to it

3651
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?

3652
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
That's what I want to know

3653
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
Oh, I don't know

3654
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
I guess it's just my natural charm

3655
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
No, it's

3656
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
Sturlock, hi, how's it going?

3657
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
It's good, no, that was a good impression

3658
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
I gotta say

3659
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
Oh my

3660
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
What's on your mind, Sturlock?

3661
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Besides, apparently, George Takei

3662
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
No, I don't know

3663
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
I've always wanted to do that

3664
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
I don't know, a long time ago

3665
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned

3666
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
something about George Takei

3667
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
and um

3668
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
He needs to be my gay daddy

3669
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Well, I thought about calling in

3670
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
to the voicemail or something

3671
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
and just leaving a message as George Takei

3672
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
saying like, oh, I heard your comments

3673
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
and I just wanted to say thank you

3674
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
but uh, anyway

3675
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
It's that George Takei

3676
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
has a really sexy voice

3677
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
That's just all it is

3678
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
It's a sexy, sexy voice

3679
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
It is

3680
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Ever since that one commercial he did

3681
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
about the basketball player

3682
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
you know, running his hand along the guy's thigh

3683
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
I was like, that is a porn voice

3684
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
You

3685
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
You forget, when you hear George Takei's

3686
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
voice, you kind of forget that he's 78

3687
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
and you still want to sleep with it, you know?

3688
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I know, he doesn't, you cannot tell

3689
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
by his voice that he's that old

3690
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know

3691
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
He just always had that deep and

3692
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
melodious theatrical voice

3693
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
Oh my

3694
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
and there was also reaction today

3695
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
from a prominent member of the gay community

3696
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
including this celebrity

3697
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:57,000
who went so far as to tape a PSA

3698
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Heh

3699
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Heh

3700
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Heh

3701
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Heh

3702
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Heh

3703
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:53,000
Heh

3704
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Alright, I'm sorry, that was quiet

3705
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
but unfortunately that was at max

3706
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
volume because YouTube's aren't

3707
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
standardized, unfortunately

3708
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I hadn't heard that, actually, that was awesome

3709
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Oh, it's frickin' amazing, I love George Takei

3710
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
But anyway, I wanted to

3711
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
talk about how I discovered

3712
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
O.L.R. Oh, please

3713
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
Kind of an interesting

3714
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
I came in at a weird time

3715
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
I came in

3716
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
sometime in 2007

3717
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
back when

3718
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
It was in that weird point where

3719
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
you guys were being syndicated

3720
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
on All Games but not

3721
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
broadcasting from there

3722
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
Oh right, yeah, we were the first affiliate show

3723
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
on All Games Radio and

3724
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
yeah, and again, Bobby was the station

3725
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
manager at All Games at the time and you know

3726
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
because he liked O.L.R.

3727
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
and he knew we were doing the syndication

3728
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
with DDR Freak Radio for a time

3729
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
he'd offered it up to us and we were like

3730
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
heck yeah, more people to hear our show? Of course

3731
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
Why not? So yeah, that was

3732
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
a great thing for us

3733
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
So I remember when the whole

3734
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
live 365 crap went down

3735
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
when they were raising their prices

3736
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
and you guys weren't sure what

3737
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
you were going to do for a while

3738
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
That is very true

3739
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
But yeah

3740
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
I've been, I don't know

3741
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
I forget what my first

3742
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
exact episode was

3743
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
It was like

3744
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
I don't know, in the 150's I want to say

3745
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
or maybe 250's

3746
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
But

3747
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
I don't know, there was just something

3748
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
about the chemistry

3749
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
there with the three guys

3750
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
and it was just a lot of fun to listen

3751
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
to and very funny

3752
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
and entertaining and I was just

3753
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
kind of hooked

3754
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Well thank you for getting hooked on whatever

3755
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
crack cocaine we must be offering because

3756
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough

3757
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
I just gotta go back and get another hit

3758
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
I don't know

3759
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
Now it's just like, I can't imagine

3760
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
not listening to it on Sunday nights

3761
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like

3762
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
well shit, what am I going to do for three hours?

3763
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
It's a nice sentiment but it's also

3764
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
a little bit scary I got to admit because you know

3765
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
as they say, all good things

3766
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
must come to an end. There will be a time when

3767
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
OLR will end. I'm not saying it's happening now

3768
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
or that it's even planned

3769
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
but you know, shit happens

3770
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
Yeah And we've had our scares

3771
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
We have had many scares here

3772
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
on Orange Lawns Radio

3773
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still

3774
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
here but you know, there is going to come a time where

3775
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending

3776
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
and that's

3777
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
the impact that's going to have on some

3778
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
people, I'm always like

3779
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
well thank god we have an archive of

3780
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
400 plus episodes that people

3781
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
could always go back and listen to

3782
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode

3783
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
that I have and just marathon it

3784
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
I have a new friend

3785
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well

3786
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
You know this girl, right?

3787
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
And she loves

3788
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
Beverly Hills 90210

3789
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended

3790
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
Not the new one, we don't count it

3791
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended

3792
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD

3793
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Aww

3794
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
We hope

3795
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
It's just like with the new

3796
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
Thundercats where

3797
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon

3798
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
but it's like

3799
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
like most things

3800
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
that are remade, it just

3801
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
pales in comparison to the classic

3802
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
80's cartoon

3803
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
The same mutual friend introduced

3804
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
me to a side a while back that's actually gone now

3805
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
that's called Elijah Wood is very

3806
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
very very very very very gay

3807
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
It was all

3808
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
kind of fuchsia colored

3809
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
Nice

3810
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
I saw her the other day!

3811
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
I know, she told me about it. Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that

3812
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
because there's something else involving her that's happening

3813
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
next week that I want you to be a part of

3814
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
Alright, and you're going to tell me no

3815
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
Anyway,

3816
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
the philosopher in chat says

3817
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
Don't ever end, I will cry so hard

3818
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
Not half as hard as we probably will

3819
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
Except for Loki, he doesn't cry

3820
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
He'll cry a single man tear

3821
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
Let's not talk about that

3822
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
10 more years, right kids?

3823
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
Yes

3824
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
Oh, and I didn't have it ready

3825
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
but I was going to get you with the vuvuzela again

3826
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
I didn't think of it until like 10 seconds ago

3827
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Oh, darn, I'm so upset

3828
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
that you weren't able to find that

3829
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
What am I going to do?

3830
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
You can try and squeeze in at least one or two more calls, okay buddy?

3831
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
Alright, take care

3832
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

3833
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3834
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
Let's go to the phones

3835
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3836
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Hey guys

3837
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Is that DDR Angel?

3838
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
It is so good to hear from you

3839
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
The brain's behind the EcoMaker

3840
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
I know

3841
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
Isn't he great?

3842
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
Well, okay, only brain

3843
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
Exactly, website

3844
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
That's your job because you're going to bring back the other thing

3845
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
You can plug the website all you want

3846
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
I can't do that

3847
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
I plugged it

3848
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
Plug's done

3849
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
That's the future, I want to talk about the past

3850
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
But Garris

3851
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
Okay, shut up

3852
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
DDR Angel, you were here

3853
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
for many of the early episodes

3854
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning

3855
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
No, I wasn't

3856
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Pretty fucking close, all things considered

3857
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39

3858
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
In the scope of

3859
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
462 episodes

3860
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
39 is pretty much the beginning

3861
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
Yeah, well

3862
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
But Angel

3863
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
Shit, I don't even know what to say

3864
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
Thank you

3865
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
for being a big part of those first few episodes

3866
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
I know, I think of you

3867
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
in many ways as one of the

3868
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
first really

3869
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
hardcore passionate people about

3870
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
this show

3871
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
I still love it, you know, every Sunday

3872
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:31,000
So, even though I might not be

3873
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,000
in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always

3874
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,000
paying attention to tweets and everything else

3875
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
too, so

3876
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
I'm pretty much just like

3877
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,000
Joe sitting on the couch over there

3878
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
I just want you to know

3879
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:45,000
we really appreciate it, because that type of

3880
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like

3881
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
Joe, Misty, JV

3882
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,000
You know, we have lots of people that are

3883
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,000
so enthusiastic and everything

3884
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
I just remember you were one of the first

3885
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
I always thank you for that

3886
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
And I personally thank you guys also

3887
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
because, not only for ten years of friendship

3888
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
Thank you

3889
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
But if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have

3890
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
met and married my husband and all that other stuff

3891
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
It's just, you know, it's been a

3892
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
crazy ten years, and I'm just looking forward

3893
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
to ten more plus

3894
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
The crazy thing about what you just said

3895
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
is that you're the second person

3896
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle

3897
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
your story because it's amazing, but

3898
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook

3899
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
that inadvertently, you know, because of

3900
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
OLR, there was Geek Life

3901
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
and because of Geek Life, there was Dan

3902
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
So, kind of the same thing happened for her

3903
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
in a way, and it's... She has a Dan

3904
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
I have a Dan It's so

3905
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way

3906
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
It blows my mind, and in some ways

3907
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
I mean, I didn't meet

3908
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Alan through OLR, but Alan

3909
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
and I probably got a lot closer because of it

3910
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
So even my own life, this show has had

3911
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
an impact on in that kind of way

3912
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
It's crazy, it's very crazy

3913
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
But great

3914
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
And humbling

3915
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
But maybe we can get together and see if you guys

3916
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show

3917
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
I'm sure we can arrange that

3918
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
Let's work out the beats

3919
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
Yeah, that'd be great

3920
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from

3921
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier

3922
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
I'm not going to be very interesting tonight

3923
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
Big hugs for you and the hubby

3924
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
and thanks for being a part of OLR's history

3925
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
Hugs to you guys too

3926
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Happy ten years again

3927
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
Bye!

3928
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
That's the time she played DDR was

3929
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
Maybe she's just Angel now

3930
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what

3931
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
Rama wants to know where is

3932
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up

3933
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
Alan is working tonight, he couldn't make the show

3934
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
because he's working

3935
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Well, you know what, in this economy

3936
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
I am fucking thrilled, he's working tonight

3937
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
don't get me wrong, so

3938
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
But I'm sure he would be here to say hello

3939
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight

3940
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:49,000
I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in

3941
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
because I saw a couple

3942
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
But we are getting towards the end of the show

3943
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
How's your headache doing? Are you feeling better?

3944
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
I feel bad

3945
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
I want to say thanks as well to

3946
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
JV Mon because I didn't get to say this on air

3947
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
because you did it during break, but you got us presents

3948
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:07,000
and there's nothing I love more in the world than presents

3949
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
and I got brought

3950
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Dunkin Donuts K-Cups which you can't

3951
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
buy in California

3952
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines

3953
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
We have the old school

3954
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
Keurig machine which we don't use anymore

3955
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
because it sucks

3956
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
but the new one is pretty awesome

3957
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
They need to bring a Dunkin Donuts over here

3958
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
because we don't have a

3959
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
well we have a Krispy Kreme but it's all in Roseville

3960
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
I did drive there one time when I woke up

3961
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
for work at 5 in the morning

3962
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
because I'm like

3963
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
I can't go back to sleep

3964
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville

3965
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
I want a donut

3966
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
Let's go back to the phones

3967
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

3968
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
Who's this?

3969
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
Chugga Chugga

3970
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
Chugga Chugga

3971
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
Choo Choo

3972
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
It's Jim Sally

3973
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
What is up Jim Sally?

3974
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
Not much everybody

3975
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
Happy anniversary everybody

3976
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
Thank you, would you buy me?

3977
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
Well I'll tell you what

3978
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,000
In honor of the donations I will donate

3979
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
one dollar for every minute

3980
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
that this call goes on for

3981
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
How's that sound?

3982
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
Please hold

3983
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
Alright I seriously I'm not going to be

3984
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
looking at the time but that's hilarious

3985
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
What's on your mind buddy?

3986
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
Not much man, I wanted

3987
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
to call in and share some of my

3988
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
Orange Launch Radio stories

3989
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
Please

3990
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
I used to always listen to you guys

3991
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
I'll listen to the Bobby Show

3992
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Everyone knows about the Bobby Show, it's a great show

3993
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
He's the man

3994
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
He is the man, I wish Bobby lived close to me

3995
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
But anyway I listened to the Bobby Show

3996
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:45,000
Then I would listen

3997
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
to a little OLR on live

3998
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Because I have to always

3999
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
work early in the morning

4000
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
and maybe get like an hour into it

4001
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
This sounds bad, don't take this the wrong way

4002
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
Guys I love you guys, don't take this the wrong way

4003
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,000
Listen, I would

4004
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
go to bed listening to you and I'd fall

4005
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:03,000
asleep listening to you every night

4006
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
I know that sounds horrible, it's just because I was really

4007
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:07,000
tired and I had to go to bed

4008
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:09,000
I listen to you while I sleep

4009
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,000
It sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear

4010
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,000
at night is my voice

4011
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes

4012
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,000
I don't want to say that

4013
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:19,000
And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like

4014
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:21,000
God damn it!

4015
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:23,000
Yeah

4016
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
I was the champion wrestler in high school man

4017
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,000
I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen buddy

4018
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
I would snuggle

4019
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:31,000
As a caller three calls or so ago would say

4020
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,000
Oh my

4021
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Oh that guy was awesome

4022
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,000
But you know what, no wait guys

4023
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:39,000
You know what's nice though, I had a baby

4024
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,000
about a year ago

4025
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,000
So I've been having to stay home so my baby would always be

4026
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,000
shitty at nighttime

4027
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
How'd you accomplish that? I thought you were ill equipped

4028
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,000
No, I'm Jim Salley

4029
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
I can do anything baby

4030
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
This train is fully equipped

4031
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
You know what I'm saying?

4032
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,000
Let's not go into details

4033
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
You know what I'm saying?

4034
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you

4035
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:03,000
and then I'd listen until midnight, I'd sit in the rocking chair

4036
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,000
with my baby beside me and the iPod on the

4037
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:07,000
table and me and my baby

4038
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,000
for the last ten and a half months that she's been on

4039
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
we listen every week

4040
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:13,000
I don't know if I want to influence a baby

4041
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:15,000
because that could be bad

4042
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000
I totally want to influence a baby

4043
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,000
I already know how that turns out

4044
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:21,000
It's nice having a baby, it's like a little padawan learner

4045
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,000
teaching her soul and shit

4046
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:25,000
She chokes the shit out of the cat right now

4047
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:27,000
She's going to be ready when she gets

4048
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:29,000
Fuck that dark side man, all the way

4049
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:31,000
Fuck them light side bitches man

4050
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
That's what I tell my baby every night

4051
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,000
You grow up to be an ultimate fighter

4052
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
I hope so, oh my god

4053
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
My little girl is an ultimate fighter

4054
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000
Oh my Jesus

4055
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
Can you imagine?

4056
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000
There's only two things I want from my little girl

4057
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,000
But now there's two things I want from my little girl

4058
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:49,000
Number one, please become an MMA fighter

4059
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
The best MMA fighter in the world

4060
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,000
Pencil hold motherfuckers to death, oh I love her

4061
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,000
Number two, I pray to Jesus every day

4062
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
She's a lesbian

4063
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
Every day I pray

4064
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
Oh my god, I say Jesus, I think of myself

4065
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:03,000
When I was a little boy, when I was like a 15 year old kid

4066
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
I was a pig, I don't want no pig boys

4067
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,000
hanging around my girl

4068
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
Fuck that shit, I want her to just be a nice lesbian

4069
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:11,000
Find a nice girl

4070
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
Get them married, and then when they want to have kids

4071
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:15,000
I got two ovens to be baking babies in

4072
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,000
Double that bacon up baby, bacon ovens baby

4073
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:21,000
Double them up

4074
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
The most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear

4075
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
you've given this some detailed thought

4076
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:27,000
I'm telling you right now

4077
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:29,000
If there was like, you know you can

4078
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
pay for procedures and stuff

4079
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
Do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever

4080
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
If you could pay to turn the gay switch on

4081
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
I would turn it on

4082
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy

4083
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:41,000
That's when you gotta

4084
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,000
sink those genetics in there, I would have done it a long time ago

4085
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
I've thought about this myself

4086
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
cause you know, Dan and I were trying

4087
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
And I wanted to have a lesbian

4088
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
And I'll tell you why

4089
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
I'll tell you why, okay

4090
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:55,000
I don't have to

4091
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
pay for a bris

4092
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
And number two

4093
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
I

4094
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
I think of all the money I would save

4095
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:05,000
if I had a really dykey baby

4096
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:07,000
Well you also gotta think about this too

4097
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000
cause you're a chick right, if you had a dykey baby and she was

4098
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:11,000
more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe

4099
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
All of a sudden you're wearing the best

4100
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:15,000
clothes ever, right, your kids buy them

4101
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:17,000
You just steal her from her closet, aw man

4102
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:19,000
I gotta say, one of the perks about

4103
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:21,000
being gay is that like if I have no clean

4104
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:23,000
shirts, oh Alan has a clean shirt, I'll steal that

4105
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:25,000
Like it works out really well

4106
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,000
Clean shirts man

4107
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:29,000
Geez, did you really go for pride weekend this weekend guy?

4108
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,000
No because you know I

4109
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:33,000
usually don't because Sundays are the show

4110
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:35,000
And I know this

4111
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:37,000
I swear I'm not saying this to get pity, I'm really not

4112
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
The show kinda comes

4113
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,000
first before that, I haven't gone

4114
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
I've gone to some prides

4115
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
but I usually have to like run home in time for the show

4116
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
And I wanna say once or twice

4117
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
in the ten years I did cancel out

4118
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
on the show that week so I could you know do stuff in the city

4119
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000
But you know I don't know, I don't get

4120
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000
it's all, it's

4121
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:57,000
too many people for me

4122
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
I get gay pride

4123
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:01,000
like you know in the

4124
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:03,000
60's when it was not

4125
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,000
okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk

4126
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
about and you had to hide it from the

4127
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:09,000
world you know and

4128
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:11,000
cops tried to arrest you because

4129
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:13,000
you know you were gay

4130
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,000
there was a point where we said

4131
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000
you know a bunch of gay people in a bar

4132
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,000
in New York City said fuck you

4133
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000
fuck the police, we are not gonna take this

4134
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
shit anymore and that's what pride

4135
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
is really about celebrating is it's

4136
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:27,000
like you know what we're gonna be

4137
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,000
whoever the fuck we wanna be

4138
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
and deal with it

4139
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
Well can I share a story

4140
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,000
not to be a complete downer?

4141
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
Well you know what last week was

4142
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:39,000
Alan Turing's 100th birthday

4143
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:41,000
Oh right yes of course

4144
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:43,000
Basically because of him we have computers

4145
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:45,000
pretty much and

4146
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:47,000
you know at the end of his life

4147
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:49,000
it came out that he was gay

4148
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
and his choices were either go to jail or go through

4149
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:53,000
hormonal treatment so he killed himself

4150
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000
Go to jail? That's so

4151
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,000
stupid what they would do you know

4152
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,000
This was in England

4153
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
Well what can you expect sometimes right?

4154
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
They're pretty

4155
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
old school over there I guess. It's dumb though right?

4156
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
It's totally dumb like I'm straight

4157
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:09,000
but I go to pride every year and I make a t-shirt

4158
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
every year. Last year I had

4159
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
I'm straight

4160
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
364 days a year and on the back it said

4161
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
today's your lucky day

4162
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:19,000
That was a funny shirt right?

4163
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
Like why not? This year I had

4164
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
can a straight guy get some lovin'

4165
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
and I just walked around my arms and I just got hugs from dudes right?

4166
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
Just get some hugs

4167
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens

4168
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
to our brothers man

4169
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:33,000
and gentlemen, straight boys

4170
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:35,000
I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again

4171
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:37,000
the more gay dudes there are in the world

4172
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
the more boobies there are for us okay?

4173
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
So help them out

4174
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,000
Give them the pride week you know what I mean?

4175
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
Put on this shirt and just go out

4176
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,000
and have a good time. You can bring your girl

4177
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000
no one's gonna hit on her. So why wouldn't you

4178
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
bring your girl with you?

4179
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
It's the best. I remember the first time I went to

4180
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
Gay Days at Disneyland

4181
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
and there were two brothers and one of them says

4182
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000
I'm not but he is on his shirt and the other one says

4183
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,000
I am but he's not

4184
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
I've been to Disneyland. I think every day

4185
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:05,000
might be Gay's Day at Disneyland. I don't know

4186
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:07,000
This is when everybody's

4187
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
walking around in red shirts

4188
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,000
You either think it's a bunch of death waiting

4189
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:13,000
to happen if you're a Star Trek fan

4190
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:15,000
but anyway

4191
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,000
Alright Jim Sally

4192
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
I gotta let you go but I have loved

4193
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:21,000
this call and I've loved talking to you tonight

4194
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
and thank you for your support over the years

4195
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:25,000
and whether your daughter

4196
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
grows up to be an

4197
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
MMA fighting champion or she

4198
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,000
grows up to be Miss Canada

4199
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
I know she's gonna be great

4200
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:37,000
Thanks guys. I'm just gonna

4201
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
go to bed now and I'm gonna

4202
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:41,000
try to smuggle with Loki

4203
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
and go to sleep

4204
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:45,000
Goodnight. Goodnight Jim

4205
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,000
Can Loki say it?

4206
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,000
He went to the bathroom

4207
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:51,000
Your call made him pee

4208
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:53,000
I scared the piss out of him

4209
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
Alright Jim

4210
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
Take care buddy

4211
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,000
Bye

4212
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,000
Oh my gosh. Alright. I gotta try

4213
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,000
One more call maybe?

4214
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
We're gonna have to say no more

4215
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,000
at some point. Hi you're on Orange Noms Radio

4216
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,000
Who's this?

4217
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:11,000

4219
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000

Can you hear us?

4221
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,000
Could I just make up whatever you're saying right now?

4222
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
Try again later

4223
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,000

Alright

4226
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:29,000
Hi you're on Orange Noms Radio

4227
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
Who's this?

4228
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
Legend Zaku

4229
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:35,000
Zaku

4230
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,000
Hi

4231
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
Legend Zaku

4232
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
What is up?

4233
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
Nothing much just having some

4234
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
internet issues at home trying to

4235
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
put out fires

4236
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
You're the first one that got

4237
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
cheers from the whole studio

4238
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:53,000
just so you know

4239
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
What's up buddy?

4240
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
Really? Ah nothing much

4241
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:59,000
I mean well aside from you

4242
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,000
celebrating 10 years

4243
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
it's kind of a milestone in the sense

4244
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,000
that you can walk from one niche

4245
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:07,000
genre of video games to encompass

4246
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:09,000
just about every genre

4247
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:11,000
and I guess part of it

4248
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:13,000
was also evolving

4249
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
you had to adapt to the fact

4250
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:17,000
that you couldn't just keep

4251
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,000
shoveling the money for

4252
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:21,000
affinity and at some point you had to

4253
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:23,000
become a bit more mainstream

4254
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:25,000
and so far

4255
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:27,000
At some point we had to go from

4256
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:29,000
Charmander to Charizard

4257
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:31,000
that had to happen

4258
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:33,000
That is true

4259
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:35,000
That's the whole point of evolving

4260
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:37,000
and the fact that you adapted

4261
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:39,000
you won podcast awards left and right

4262
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:41,000
or you were at least nominated for them

4263
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:43,000
Zaku we just wanted to be the very best

4264
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:45,000
that no one ever was

4265
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:47,000
And also everyone thinks you should be pounding

4266
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:49,000
on your keyboard while you're talking

4267
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:51,000
I'm not. I'm on my phone

4268
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:53,000
right now. I'm still trying to

4269
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:55,000
set up a new router that I had to put out

4270
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:57,000
fires with. Don't pound the phone

4271
03:30:59,000 --> 03:31:01,000
So yeah I mean

4272
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,000
we're pretty much my routine for the past

4273
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:05,000
eight years

4274
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:07,000
almost on a consecutive basis

4275
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:09,000
except for the night that you were off

4276
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
obviously that breaks the streak but

4277
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:13,000
you get the idea. It was pretty much consistent

4278
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:15,000
Like almost Sunday night

4279
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,000
starting from like 2004 onwards

4280
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:19,000
we're just like listening to you guys

4281
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,000
pretty much that was it

4282
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:25,000
just like going there, listening to all our

4283
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:27,000
and that's become almost

4284
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:29,000
a routine

4285
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:31,000
It is like

4286
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:33,000
as you were saying

4287
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:35,000
It is kind of life changing

4288
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:37,000
that you have something

4289
03:31:37,000 --> 03:31:39,000
that you

4290
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:41,000
just listen to that you try to

4291
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:43,000
out of curiosity

4292
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:45,000
all of a sudden

4293
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:47,000
it just sticks

4294
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:49,000
in a good way

4295
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:51,000
Well Zaku after all these years what would you say

4296
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:53,000
would be your favorite memory involving

4297
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:55,000
you and OLR because I know

4298
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,000
that I have my favorite memory

4299
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:59,000
involving you and OLR

4300
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:01,000
Oh

4301
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:03,000
Me and Kat?

4302
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:05,000
Really?

4303
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:07,000
You know what I mean?

4304
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:09,000
Well

4305
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,000
It's been in and out

4306
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:13,000
but yeah I get the whole point

4307
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:15,000
I'm trying to remember right now

4308
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:17,000
Geez

4309
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:19,000
I think

4310
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:21,000
getting like interrupted

4311
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:23,000
during a Skype call

4312
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:27,000
a few years ago

4313
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:29,000
man there's so many

4314
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:31,000
it's really really hard to actually

4315
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:33,000
nail down on like

4316
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:35,000
something

4317
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:37,000
and it's just me and Kat

4318
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:39,000
and the whole thing else

4319
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:41,000
Alright Zaku

4320
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:43,000
no matter what I tell the other callers

4321
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:45,000
you're my favorite

4322
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Yeah I'm right

4323
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,000
Alright take care of Zaku have a good night

4324
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:51,000
Yeah definitely

4325
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:53,000
and maybe 10 more years

4326
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:55,000
left upon you

4327
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:57,000
We will try our best

4328
03:32:57,000 --> 03:32:59,000
We'll need lots of booze to get there

4329
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:01,000
Hope to see you when I come to New York next

4330
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:03,000
Thank you

4331
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:05,000
Hopefully you make it out there

4332
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:07,000
like soon

4333
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:09,000
Date TBD

Nobody asked for it tomorrow

4339
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:21,000
Hello

4340
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:23,000
Oh it's the intern

4341
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,000
Hi Drew

4342
03:33:25,000 --> 03:33:27,000
It's the one who forgets to choose his audio input before calling

4343
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:29,000
Yes echo 123 intern

4344
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:31,000
after all these years

4345
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:33,000
It's been a while

4346
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:35,000
Can I be unfired yet?

4347
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:37,000
If you write on the blackboard

4348
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:39,000
100 times

4349
03:33:39,000 --> 03:33:41,000
I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Naugahyde

4350
03:33:41,000 --> 03:33:43,000
I burned it

4351
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:45,000
I burned all of them

4352
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:47,000
All of the books

4353
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:49,000
I just want to congratulate you guys

4354
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:51,000
I know I've been with you guys since

4355
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:53,000
episode 2

4356
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:55,000
and it's been a long crazy ass ride

4357
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:57,000
I wasn't even there

4358
03:33:57,000 --> 03:33:59,000
Joe has you beat by one show

4359
03:33:59,000 --> 03:34:01,000
How does that make you feel?

4360
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:03,000
I know there can be only one

4361
03:34:03,000 --> 03:34:05,000
so I'm going to have to take his head off one these days

4362
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:09,000
What was your favorite memory of OLR

4363
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:11,000
because I know I have mine involving you

4364
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:13,000
and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table

4365
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:17,000
God dammit man

4366
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:19,000
I'm just giving you shit, Drew

4367
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:21,000
Karyuki Revolution

4368
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,000
anything involving Karyuki Revolution

4369
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:25,000
God what was it

4370
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:27,000
Episode 69 we decided to prank you with jelly beans and milkshakes

4371
03:34:29,000 --> 03:34:31,000
and you took a sip on air

4372
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:33,000
the reaction was golden

4373
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:37,000
Absolutely priceless

4374
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:39,000
You'll have to go find that in the OLR archive

4375
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:41,000
Geez, Drew

4376
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:43,000
it's been ten years

4377
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:45,000
you've been listening to this show for ten years

4378
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:47,000
well on and off

4379
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:49,000
I imagine

4380
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:51,000
what kind of impact has this show had for you?

4381
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:53,000
Well, for one it gives me something interesting to talk about

4382
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,000
at conventions

4383
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:57,000
but for that

4384
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:59,000
you know, I'm not a really boring guy otherwise

4385
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:01,000
And you did transform from being our young Republican

4386
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:03,000
to being a long haired hippie

4387
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,000
Sorry, I'm recovering

4388
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:07,000
That's true

4389
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:09,000
We really did go through a very

4390
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:11,000
psychological shift at one point

4391
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:13,000
too, it's kind of neat

4392
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:15,000
We all grow up, most of us

4393
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:17,000
Y'all do whatever politics you want

4394
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:19,000
I don't care

4395
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:21,000
this is a diverse place

4396
03:35:21,000 --> 03:35:23,000
I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360

4397
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:25,000
Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person

4398
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:27,000
go through that type of change, for sure

4399
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:29,000
360?

4400
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:31,000
I don't own one of those

4401
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:33,000
Better than the Xbox lube

4402
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:35,000
Alright, Drew, any final thoughts

4403
03:35:35,000 --> 03:35:37,000
before we let you go?

4404
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:39,000
Hoping for many more years to come

4405
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:41,000
and I'm really appreciating

4406
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:43,000
the way Orange Launch Radio

4407
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:45,000
is going with Voice of Geeks

4408
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:47,000
and hopefully everything turns out

4409
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,000
well, I'll still keep listening

4410
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000
I'll still keep phoning in

4411
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000
and I'll be a big part of the community

4412
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:55,000
that

4413
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:57,000
I mean, come on, it's been ten years, I grew up with you guys

4414
03:35:57,000 --> 03:35:59,000
You did, quite literally

4415
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:01,000
Powerful thing to say

4416
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:03,000
And you went to school with me

4417
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:05,000
Yes, I did

4418
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:07,000
We would often run into each other on the lawn

4419
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:09,000
at ARC

4420
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:11,000
The grassy knoll, which no shots

4421
03:36:11,000 --> 03:36:13,000
were fired at

4422
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:15,000
Which is actually now sort of off limits

4423
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:17,000
since they're building the new student center

4424
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:19,000
Yeah, which I will never get to see

4425
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:21,000
Aww

4426
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:23,000
You can always go back and forth

4427
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:25,000
Well Drew, thank you so much

4428
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:27,000
for being a part of the show for ten years

4429
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:29,000
and we'll see you next week

4430
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:31,000
Definitely!

4431
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:33,000
Bye

4432
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,000
I think with that I'm gonna finally

4433
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:37,000
close the Skype line

4434
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:39,000
I am so sorry to those that didn't get through

4435
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:41,000
but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B

4436
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:43,000
in addition to an hour and a half for Part A

4437
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,000
Guys, it's okay because of Garris

4438
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,000
Yeah, and the fact that

4439
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,000
Dark Soccer and Loki do have to work tomorrow

4440
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV

4441
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:53,000
Yay

4442
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
Which is even worse

4443
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:57,000
I am so sorry to those of you that didn't get through

4444
03:36:57,000 --> 03:36:59,000
If you still want to leave some messages, you can certainly leave those on the Skype line

4445
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
Emails would be great too

4446
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:03,000
Mailbag at orangeonshooter.com

4447
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:05,000
We will get back to them next week because I think it's important to say

4448
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:07,000
Same shit, new week

4449
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
next week

4450
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,000
with episode

4451
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
463

4452
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
Alright, we gotta go around

4453
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:17,000
and wrap up the show tonight

4454
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:19,000
quickly, last minute stories

4455
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:21,000
Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list

4456
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:23,000
and then you can add whatever you want to it

4457
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
Just real quickly, some last minute stories

4458
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
that we didn't get to tonight

4459
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:29,000
Iron Brothers crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it

4460
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:31,000
There's a Kickstarter going on about that

4461
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:33,000
And he's local, that's kind of funny

4462
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:35,000
And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him

4463
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:37,000
and see if he wants to come on OLR to promote that

4464
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:39,000
Haven't done that yet, but we will

4465
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:41,000
Apparently reskinning the characters, but saying

4466
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:43,000
it's not just a reskinning, they want to do

4467
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:45,000
vertical levels as well as horizontal

4468
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:47,000
It makes sense because you put all this

4469
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,000
time into a game and then it's like

4470
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:51,000
well, I can't really do anything with it because it has all these licensed characters

4471
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:53,000
so they're changing it enough to where

4472
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:55,000
they can, like we talked about earlier

4473
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:57,000
changing it enough to where you can release it without

4474
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:59,000
violating any copyright laws

4475
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:01,000
Or being violated by the copyright holders

4476
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:03,000
Valve and Adult Swim

4477
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,000
for Team Fortress, I didn't

4478
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
Jamie, this was one of your stories, I don't remember

4479
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:09,000
what this was about Yeah, and I already forgot what it was about

4480
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:11,000
They're doing some sort of crossover content

4481
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
thing or something, they didn't really say why yet

4482
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:15,000
Yeah, it was like

4483
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:17,000
a quickie I can only hope it's a

4484
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:19,000
TV series because that would be awesome

4485
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:21,000
based on like, you know, the meet the

4486
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:23,000
whomever

4487
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:25,000
Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on

4488
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,000
Xbox.com, so that's likely to be

4489
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:29,000
coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon

4490
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:31,000
Dark Soccer, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?

4491
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,000
Not really, nothing was as good as the first one

4492
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
I mean, I'm serious, we tried Sonic Adventure 2

4493
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:37,000
was not as good as the first one But there are

4494
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:39,000
some fans that will be very happy about that

4495
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:41,000
I'm sure And they're wrong

4496
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:43,000
Jay's raising his hand over there, Jay, are you a big

4497
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:45,000
Sonic Adventure 2? Yeah

4498
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:47,000
If Xbox Live could take pre-orders

4499
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:49,000
I'd pre-order it right now

4500
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:51,000
Awesome

4501
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:53,000
DreamWorks and EA are gonna make a need

4502
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:55,000
for speed movie

4503
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:57,000
Cause Fast and the Furious just

4504
03:38:57,000 --> 03:38:59,000
wasn't enough I'll be hiding in a cave

4505
03:38:59,000 --> 03:39:01,000
Very interesting, Capcom

4506
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:03,000
plans to make some Mega Man 25th

4507
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,000
anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath

4508
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:07,000
over Mega Man universe or whatever

4509
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:09,000
Maybe announce a soundtrack that's in it Yeah, exactly

4510
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:11,000
Yeah, more

4511
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:13,000
downloads of the old stuff will be

4512
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:15,000
coming to your way

4513
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,000
Looking quickly at the Twitter

4514
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:19,000
real quick, TigerClod sent us a couple stories

4515
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:21,000
Marvel vs. Capcom

4516
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:23,000
The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming

4517
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,000
history coming soon

4518
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:27,000
Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix

4519
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,000
Yikes

4520
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:31,000
ActDeaf says

4521
03:39:31,000 --> 03:39:33,000
OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio

4522
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:35,000
Virtual Phil

4523
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:37,000
who was on Hoardhouse this week

4524
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:39,000
says, if you had to live in a video

4525
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,000
game for the rest of your life

4526
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:43,000
which game would you choose? Pro Tip

4527
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,000
not Silent Hill

4528
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:47,000
If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life

4529
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:49,000
I would live in the Pokemon universe

4530
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,000
cause let's be real, Pokemon are adorable

4531
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:53,000
and you could just, you could teach them

4532
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:55,000
to do your killing

4533
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:57,000
I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet

4534
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:59,000
with that

4535
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
is like low on the list of harvesting

4536
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
where you could cuddle with Garris

4537
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,000
Yeah, I would live on the palaban

4538
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:07,000
Loki? You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third

4539
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:09,000
but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach, Volleyball

4540
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
Good answer, anybody on the couch

4541
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
what game world would you want to live in most of all?

4542
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:17,000
Oh god, Animal Crossing

4543
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Animal Crossing says Star Tetsuya

4544
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:21,000
Jay?

4545
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
Cause Cole's kinda hot

4546
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:25,000
Good answers, good answers

4547
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,000
Misty, did you have one?

4548
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:29,000
Yeah, I agree with Pokemans

4549
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:31,000
cause fuck, I picked my name

4550
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:33,000
my nickname from it

4551
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:35,000
Ah, there you go, that's true

4552
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,000
Misty

4553
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:39,000
You know, it just occurred to me that it would actually be really good

4554
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:41,000
The

4555
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:43,000
Doctor Who games

4556
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:45,000
That's cheating

4557
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
I'll hide on the TARDIS

4558
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:49,000
I second that

4559
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:51,000
Really want to give thanks to you guys

4560
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:53,000
that all gave us OLR 10th anniversary

4561
03:40:53,000 --> 03:40:55,000
shout outs and retweets, there was an awful lot

4562
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,000
of you, I can't name everybody

4563
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:59,000
but I just want to say a big thank you to everybody

4564
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:01,000
on the Twitter who gave

4565
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:03,000
their thank yous to us

4566
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:05,000
so that brings us

4567
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:07,000
almost to the end of the show

4568
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:09,000
but just walking in from work

4569
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:11,000
can I bug you for a minute?

4570
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:13,000
Hi, SalaciousPop or Allen is

4571
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,000
home, how was work?

4572
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:17,000
Good, happy 10 years to the OR

4573
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,000
Thank you, anything you want to

4574
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,000
say, cause we're almost at the end

4575
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:23,000
anything you want to say about the anniversary or whatever?

4576
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:25,000
It's a good show, there's tons of

4577
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:27,000
people in the apartment right now, just came home and it's a

4578
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:29,000
big party, but I knew it was going to be like that

4579
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:31,000
When are all these people going to leave?

4580
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:33,000
They're fine, they're fine

4581
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:35,000
Okay, well if

4582
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:37,000
Allen is home from work, that means

4583
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:39,000
we really got to wrap it up and get on

4584
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:41,000
out of here, Loki, any last minute stories you want to add?

4585
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:43,000
Final Fantasy XI is getting another

4586
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:45,000
expansion

4587
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting

4588
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:49,000
a new class Geomancer

4589
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Geomancers are cool

4590
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:53,000
I said a long time ago it should have got

4591
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:55,000
Geomancer, so I'm excited they're actually getting it

4592
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,000
So they're doing that, and that's just kind of crazy

4593
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:59,000
because I guess it's

4594
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:01,000
also been around for

4595
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:03,000
a long time

4596
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:05,000
and then Skylanders are getting some

4597
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:07,000
sidekick characters and

4598
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:09,000
exclusive Frito-Lay

4599
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:11,000
things

4600
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:13,000
Yay, so

4601
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:15,000
you're going to get those in bags of Frito-Lays

4602
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:17,000
and you get little characters that I think

4603
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:19,000
are compatible with the game, maybe

4604
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:21,000
Neat

4605
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:23,000
And then

4606
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:25,000
there is a

4607
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,000
I don't know if it's a hint

4608
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
or if it's sort of a tease or something, but

4609
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
apparently there was

4610
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:33,000
an image tweeted by

4611
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:35,000
the creator of Seaman

4612
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:37,000
that is a Santa Seaman

4613
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:39,000
perhaps

4614
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:41,000
hinting that there may be an

4615
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:43,000
announcement or a game release

4616
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:45,000
regarding Seaman

4617
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,000
maybe?

4618
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,000
That's been teased for a while I think, so that could be very

4619
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:51,000
interesting

4620
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:53,000
And I guess

4621
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,000
Kim.com is

4622
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:57,000
launching a new mega upload

4623
03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
site called Megabox

4624
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:01,000
So it'll be interesting to see

4625
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:03,000
what happens there

4626
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:05,000
Megabox

4627
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:07,000
Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy 11 again

4628
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:09,000
to play Geomancer with him, and you know Shane is really

4629
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,000
good at peer pressure, right Jamie?

4630
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,000
I'm telling you

4631
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:15,000
free to play and my life is over

4632
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:17,000
Is it going free to play?

4633
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:19,000
I wish

4634
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
I already started

4635
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:23,000
playing Lord of the Rings

4636
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:25,000
I think by the time Final Fantasy 14 comes out

4637
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
it probably would

4638
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:29,000
Alright, we really have to

4639
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:31,000
bring this show to a close and say good night

4640
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:33,000
First off

4641
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
over the past 10 years you guys have

4642
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:37,000
tuned in and supported our show and we just want to

4643
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
say thank you and

4644
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:41,000
you know we never ask for your money

4645
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:43,000
although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts

4646
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:45,000
want to help pay to keep it going

4647
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:47,000
and trust me we really, really appreciate it

4648
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:49,000
but you know all we ask most of all

4649
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:51,000
tell a friend or 20

4650
03:43:51,000 --> 03:43:53,000
about the show and help

4651
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:55,000
spread the word, give us a nice 5 star review on

4652
03:43:55,000 --> 03:43:57,000
iTunes or whatever pod catching site you use

4653
03:43:57,000 --> 03:43:59,000
Stitcher Radio, you can give us

4654
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:01,000
thumbs ups and stars on, we appreciate that

4655
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:03,000
and just whatever to help spread the word of our show

4656
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:05,000
Before we go though

4657
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:07,000
of course we have to get everybody's

4658
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:09,000
final thought, I want to thank everybody for being here

4659
03:44:09,000 --> 03:44:11,000
in studio tonight

4660
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:13,000
Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight

4661
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:15,000
Oh man, I don't even know

4662
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:17,000
I

4663
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:19,000
I don't even know

4664
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:21,000
10 years

4665
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:23,000
you know

4666
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:25,000
I did have a request though

4667
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,000
Sure!

4668
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:29,000
Is this DJ Melvis'

4669
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,000
promo?

4670
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:33,000
I think so

4671
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:35,000
Yes, I can do that

4672
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:37,000
I did an interview with him and he mentioned it

4673
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:39,000
On orangelaunchradio.com you can see

4674
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:41,000
Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now

4675
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:43,000
and

4676
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:45,000
I will play that by request

4677
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:47,000
It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long

4678
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:49,000
They're talking about C-man in chat and AlphaKananagram

4679
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:51,000
said Siri man

4680
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:53,000
That might almost work

4681
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,000
You know there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles

4682
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:57,000
There's people requesting

4683
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:59,000
Siri versus GLaDOS

4684
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:01,000
and the guys there are seriously considering it

4685
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:03,000
Alright

4686
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:05,000
To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series

4687
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:07,000
on orangelaunchradio.com, here's his final thought

4688
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:09,000
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF

4689
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:11,000
and for an extra $1.99 a minute

4690
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:13,000
my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all

4691
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:15,000
the fun together

4692
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:17,000
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am

4693
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:19,000
why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

4694
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:21,000
and still the fun is just as great

4695
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:23,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights

4696
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:25,000
Kick it with me and you

4697
03:45:25,000 --> 03:45:27,000
just might realize the best things in life

4698
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:29,000
are free

4699
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:31,000
Thank you Rob

4700
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:33,000
Of course, anytime buddy

4701
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:35,000
JV Mon, thank you so much

4702
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:37,000
for coming out here all the way from the Bronx

4703
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:39,000
You're very welcome

4704
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,000
I hope you had a great time in San Francisco and all that too

4705
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:43,000
I did, and I had a great time here tonight

4706
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:45,000
I'm sorry the traffic sucked

4707
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:47,000
and thank you once again for the coffee

4708
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:49,000
My favorite thing in the world

4709
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:51,000
You squeaked a little bit

4710
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:53,000
You had to go change your pants

4711
03:45:53,000 --> 03:45:55,000
I did, I did

4712
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:57,000
Rob had special feelings in the pantsal region

4713
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:59,000
Do you have a final thought tonight, Jay?

4714
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:05,000
Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't

4715
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:07,000
You're going to have to come back to me on that one

4716
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,000
Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show

4717
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
to give that final thought later on

4718
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
So how do you like that?

4719
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:15,000
I will return, there you go

4720
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,000
I'll be back

4721
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:19,000
Misty, thank you for

4722
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:21,000
getting on a train all the way out here

4723
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:23,000
I hope you had fun in Sac-A-Tomato

4724
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:25,000
What's your final thought tonight?

4725
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:27,000
To confirm your theory

4726
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:29,000
Out of 50 milliliter bottles of UV cake

4727
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,000
4 out of the 6 that I packed

4728
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:33,000
plus the glass of wine

4729
03:46:33,000 --> 03:46:35,000
Yes, I am drunk by my usual standards

4730
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:37,000
Whoo!

4731
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:39,000
Party!

4732
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:41,000
Good times, good times

4733
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,000
Where to start?

4734
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:45,000
Lowkey, your final thought tonight?

4735
03:46:45,000 --> 03:46:47,000
My final thought is next week is going to be interesting

4736
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:49,000
because

4737
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
apparently

4738
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,000
12 AM Eastern Time

4739
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:55,000
on July 1st

4740
03:46:55,000 --> 03:46:57,000
which happens to be in the middle of our show

4741
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:59,000
is when the Jade Gate opens

4742
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:01,000
and you know I gotta play that

4743
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:03,000
Oh lord

4744
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:05,000
Alright

4745
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:07,000
I was ranked 159 last time

4746
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:09,000
I'm going to try better

4747
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:11,000
Go for 158

4748
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

4749
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,000
I have to drive home

4750
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:17,000
and I have to go to work tomorrow

4751
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:19,000
but this is

4752
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:21,000
going to be a very

4753
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,000
I'm going to be dreaming in orange

4754
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:25,000
I'm going to be dreaming

4755
03:47:25,000 --> 03:47:27,000
and by the way

4756
03:47:27,000 --> 03:47:29,000
reject false icons

4757
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:31,000
Why not?

4758
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:33,000
My final thought tonight is

4759
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:35,000
thank you for giving a shit

4760
03:47:35,000 --> 03:47:37,000
I really mean that

4761
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:39,000
and 10 more years my friends

4762
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:41,000
Oh, Rob?

4763
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:43,000
What?

4764
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:45,000
Well duh

4765
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:47,000
That's going to do it for another

4766
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:49,000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4767
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:51,000
for all of us here in studio

4768
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:53,000
We will see you again

4769
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:55,000
next week

4770
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:57,000
That's

4771
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:59,000
not the outro

4772
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:01,000
Who did that?

4773
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:03,000
Who did that when I wasn't looking?

4774
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:05,000
Who did that?

4775
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:07,000
Somebody

4776
03:48:07,000 --> 03:48:09,000
Somebody switched

4777
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:11,000
or rude that on me when I wasn't looking

4778
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:13,000
Bastards

4779
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:15,000
Alright here it is for real

4780
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:41,000
Thank you everybody

4781
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:47,000
See you next week

4782
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Alright if you really

4783
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
don't want to call it a night just yet

4784
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:21,000
One more round, one more round

4785
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:23,000
Here it is

4786
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:25,000
and god I'm just really not prepared

4787
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:27,000
tonight I was going to say here it is your fortune cookie message

4788
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:29,000
of the day but I

4789
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:31,000
didn't have it up

4790
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:33,000
Fail I'm a failure what can I say

4791
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:35,000
Alright let me

4792
03:49:35,000 --> 03:49:37,000
get to the show roll

4793
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:39,000
I even forgot what it was What do you want to do next week?

4794
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:41,000
Let's go to Pinkberry

4795
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:43,000
I'm telling you

4796
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:45,000
they should be matching grandpa's contribution

4797
03:49:45,000 --> 03:50:13,000
Here it is your fortune cookie message of the day

4798
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,000
I bet you didn't know that

4799
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:19,000
when I eat

4800
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:21,000
beans

4801
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,000
I say it in my own little cloud

4802
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:25,000
Nobody

4803
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:27,000
comes to visit

4804
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:29,000
me in my

4805
03:50:29,000 --> 03:50:31,000
little

4806
03:50:31,000 --> 03:50:33,000
cloud

4807
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:35,000
I don't know why

4808
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:37,000
maybe because I'm

4809
03:50:37,000 --> 03:50:39,000
cutting muffins

4810
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:41,000
because I love

4811
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:43,000

every day

4814
03:50:47,000 --> 03:50:49,000
Beans are an excellent source of

4815
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:51,000
protein

4816
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,000
