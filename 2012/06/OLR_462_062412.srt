00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,036
[SPEAKER_32]: That is awesome.

27
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:28,828
[SPEAKER_32]: and I think I've been listening for about 5 of those years and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to and you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and BlackWolf

28
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:59,374
[SPEAKER_32]: and my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the Vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago and that was a lot of fun so have an awesome 10iversary and hey maybe you guys will make it to another 10 years that would be awesome anyway stay black

29
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:02,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, a.k.a.

30
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:03,543
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR.

31
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:13,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR Dream Game Bungie Ferritossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it.

33
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:22,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.

34
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:28,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.

35
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives.

36
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:33,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, slaves.

37
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.

38
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:44,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last 10 years.

39
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.

40
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,357
[SPEAKER_45]: What's up, OLR?

41
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,238
[SPEAKER_45]: It's Zeether.

42
00:03:51,138 --> 00:04:05,972
[SPEAKER_45]: I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say that you're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to because you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts.

43
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,293
[SPEAKER_45]: I like that.

44
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,134
[SPEAKER_45]: I love the Classic Game of the Week segment.

45
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:15,179
[SPEAKER_45]: It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for 10 years.

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,865
[SPEAKER_45]: Starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining too.

47
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:26,308
[SPEAKER_45]: So yeah, congrats guys, congrats on the 10 years.

48
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:29,551
[SPEAKER_45]: Hopefully you can do 10 more of this, maybe?

49
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:30,451
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't know.

50
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,572
[SPEAKER_45]: Congrats.

51
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:39,098
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Orange Violence Radio, this is Bajazan here, wishing you the best for 10 years.

52
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:46,917
[SPEAKER_28]: 10 years, that's pretty long for the radio that started off as, you know, doing DJ Ranma Mani and then morphing into video games.

53
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,939
[SPEAKER_28]: But still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.

54
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:59,641
[SPEAKER_28]: Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years.

55
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,242
[SPEAKER_28]: And for that, I tip my hat to you.

56
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:03,703
[SPEAKER_28]: And no, I'm not drunk or high.

57
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:04,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one.

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here from Anime Jam Session.

59
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:25,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been a listener of Orange Dogs Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.

60
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,266
[SPEAKER_14]: The OLR community is not just friends.

61
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:33,748
[SPEAKER_14]: This has become a massive, wonderful family.

62
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that.

63
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:41,714
[SPEAKER_14]: They all talk about video games, the game of culture, and the game of lifestyle.

64
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:48,539
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us.

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have to sit there and discuss, which I think is great.

66
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:59,768
[SPEAKER_14]: OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose.

67
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:05,009
[SPEAKER_14]: When you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.

68
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,670
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like you got different rankings of it.

69
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,330
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years.

70
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:16,092
[SPEAKER_14]: As for me, I admire them and I totally respect them for what they do.

71
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:25,834
[SPEAKER_14]: And my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match.

72
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:30,816
[SPEAKER_14]: and from that point on, I said, you know, I wanna do something like this.

73
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:43,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of what they do, is now what I do with Anime Jam Session with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting like our own family thing.

74
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.

75
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So I am eternally thankful

76
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,830
[SPEAKER_14]: for their contribution.

77
00:06:56,551 --> 00:07:00,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people.

78
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:06,760
[SPEAKER_14]: So to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you.

79
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations on 10 years.

80
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,725
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will be around for another 10 more.

81
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:12,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

82
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:44,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.

83
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:59,100
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio.

84
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,441
[SPEAKER_20]: The show where every gamer has a voice.

85
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Established 2002.

86
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:09,946
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-host.

87
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:14,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

88
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:17,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.

89
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,791
[SPEAKER_20]: It took me about 7 to get it right.

90
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:25,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.

91
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,196
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been some bad ones in the past.

92
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you going to make me go back into the archive?

93
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:30,638
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

94
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,579
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have to go back into the archive?

95
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you're making me go back into the archive.

96
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:39,163
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.

97
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:44,126
[SPEAKER_20]: You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you?

98
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,807
[SPEAKER_20]: It's disturbing me a little bit.

99
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:46,708
[SPEAKER_08]: But Garris.

100
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:50,091
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

102
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:43,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts DarkSakura and Sky where we'll talk about all things Bomani.

103
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:44,332
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

104
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,572
[SPEAKER_24]: In the meantime, enjoy.

105
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,433
[SPEAKER_20]: That was episode one right there.

106
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:48,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Episode one.

107
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:51,114
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the little promo cut from episode one.

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,361
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.

109
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,082
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.

110
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:00,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Has your opinion changed after 10 years?

111
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:08,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.

112
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm happy being the aunt because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.

113
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:17,488
[SPEAKER_20]: TechMasterLoki

114
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:41,688
[SPEAKER_37]: I have a headache.

115
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,294
[SPEAKER_20]: All this time later and now you have a headache.

116
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:45,835
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

117
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:51,626
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it, but caffeine will work.

118
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:53,930
[SPEAKER_37]: Nah, probably not, but we'll try.

119
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:58,588
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the 10th anniversary of OLR.

120
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:01,349
[SPEAKER_37]: McDonald's because I'm late.

121
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,090
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's really the only reason why.

122
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:13,034
[SPEAKER_37]: I was sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something and I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.

123
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,495
[SPEAKER_37]: I need to stop what I'm doing, need to leave now.

124
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:18,076
[SPEAKER_37]: And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.

125
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:22,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.

126
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:35,862
[SPEAKER_20]: If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network, where we tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show, www.vognetwork.com.

127
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:39,324
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com.

128
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:43,125
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,

129
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,208
[SPEAKER_20]: It kind of outgrew that time frame.

130
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:55,115
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast, the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.

131
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,358
[SPEAKER_20]: The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20-minute show.

132
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that didn't work out so well.

133
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:08,387
[SPEAKER_20]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.

134
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:10,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Arigato.

135
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:11,629
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

136
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,291
[SPEAKER_19]: You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.

137
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:15,052
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting better.

138
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:15,973
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting better.

139
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:16,593
[SPEAKER_20]: A little better.

140
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:17,054
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit.

141
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:17,954
[SPEAKER_20]: It's only taking me 10 years.

142
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:18,335
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

143
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.

144
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,959
[SPEAKER_20]: We've filled things up here in the OLR studios tonight.

145
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:29,384
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show, and I want to say hello to them for a little bit.

146
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Up first.

147
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:32,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, is your guy doing the cabbage patch?

148
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:36,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I am on a DDR machine nonetheless.

149
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:44,431
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse, which I think I'm the only one in right now.

150
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:46,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's doing the freaking cabbage patch.

151
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,692
[SPEAKER_20]: On a DDR machine.

152
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,894
[SPEAKER_20]: How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?

153
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:52,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I doing a dance from the 80s?

154
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,836
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.

155
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,237
[SPEAKER_20]: We turn in 10.

156
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,897
[SPEAKER_20]: We turn in 10.

157
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God this is radio.

158
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.

159
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:07,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's radio.

160
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,142
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll never get to see it.

161
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,182
[SPEAKER_20]: But these guys just saw that.

162
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:10,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Say hello.

163
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Joining us all the way from St.

164
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:13,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Louis, Missouri.

165
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,365
[SPEAKER_20]: Say hello to Misty.

166
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:21,366
[SPEAKER_46]: Because I know you're wondering between delays, layovers, and actual travel time, it took about three days to get here.

167
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,395
[SPEAKER_20]: Now that's because you don't fly.

168
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:24,376
[SPEAKER_46]: Exactly.

169
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:27,456
[SPEAKER_20]: But you're like a huge train fan.

170
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,397
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a train fanatic.

171
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,777
[SPEAKER_20]: You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.

172
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:37,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.

173
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Yet I never rode on trains.

174
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:39,680
[SPEAKER_20]: It was this really weird thing.

175
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,780
[SPEAKER_46]: You are so fired.

176
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,960
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess not.

177
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:44,981
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, anyhow.

178
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, hello to you and how are you today, I guess?

179
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:50,022
[SPEAKER_46]: Very good.

180
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:51,683
[SPEAKER_20]: What made you want to be here for tonight's show?

181
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,338
[SPEAKER_46]: G, I wonder G, I wonder

182
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:20,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

183
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Where in the city are you exactly?

184
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:23,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.

185
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:24,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

186
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:25,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, so you're in... Okay.

187
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:26,788
[SPEAKER_20]: I can never remember.

188
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:28,408
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a big city.

189
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,109
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a big place.

190
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:29,989
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's far away.

191
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I went once.

192
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:31,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

193
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Once.

194
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Once?

195
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,492
[SPEAKER_20]: What did you do in New York City?

196
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:35,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nothing.

197
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Just played at Carnegie Hall.

198
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

199
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, just a little something-something.

200
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:39,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Band trip.

201
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,118
[SPEAKER_20]: What brings you to California?

202
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:45,080
[SPEAKER_20]: You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?

203
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,621
[SPEAKER_17]: That and my sister also.

204
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:46,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

205
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Just for that.

206
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:48,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing else.

207
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:49,222
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

208
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,984
[SPEAKER_17]: My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.

209
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:52,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

210
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:58,605
[SPEAKER_17]: and I've just been here for like the past week and I was like, oh, my vacation coincides with the 10th anniversary.

211
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Might as well make a visit.

212
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,786
[SPEAKER_20]: What a nice convenience.

213
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:04,627
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry that the drive was all traffic-y, you trying to get here today.

214
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:05,187
[SPEAKER_20]: No, yeah.

215
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.

216
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:12,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Picaruno says, my fellow Eurobeat nerd.

217
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:13,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

218
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.

219
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:19,023
[SPEAKER_17]: My name does come from Digimon, yes.

220
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:21,005
[SPEAKER_17]: V-Mon was my favorite Digimon growing up.

221
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:21,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

222
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.

223
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?

224
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,913
[SPEAKER_20]: I think DarkSakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.

225
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:32,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

226
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

227
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:37,498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in another 10 years.

228
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:40,660
[SPEAKER_20]: The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.

229
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,281
[SPEAKER_20]: You do the math.

230
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,248
[SPEAKER_20]: We feel young and that's the important thing.

231
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Now get off my lawn.

232
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,974
[SPEAKER_20]: What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?

233
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?

234
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:54,337
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

235
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the Metreon even still open?

236
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,504
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.

237
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:00,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't been to the Metreon since 2004.

238
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:29,125
[SPEAKER_20]: Metron was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago like there was an epic you know one where they gave away a DDR machine and then they had that epic arcade and they had all the crane machines and they had the oops cat what the hell oops I went to hell store what was her name that mascot I used to love those shirts somebody in shall think of it and then there's the official Sony store was there as well and now they're talking about putting a target in there

239
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,976
[SPEAKER_20]: And look, I love Target, but... You know they have like the Gamer Walk of Fame?

240
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:35,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

241
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:36,637
[SPEAKER_08]: That little catwalk thing?

242
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:37,998
[SPEAKER_20]: They do, that's right, that is there.

243
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:48,303
[SPEAKER_08]: But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it and so half of it was like white and the other half of it was like, you know, DDR machine and even the screen was faded.

244
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:50,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awful to play on.

245
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:52,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But Garrus...

246
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,366
[SPEAKER_20]: So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?

247
00:16:56,046 --> 00:17:02,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Since it's my first vacation in like four years and my first time out here in like eight, I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.

248
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:03,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Touristy stuff?

249
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,249
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been, you know, pretty much at all the tourist traps.

250
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:10,211
[SPEAKER_20]: You went to Pier 39 and Alcatraz and Napa.

251
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to Sonoma, not Napa.

252
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well, excuse me, princess.

253
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,840
[SPEAKER_17]: I got myself lots and lots of wine.

254
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,061
[SPEAKER_17]: I was very happy.

255
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:23,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Good times.

256
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,303
[SPEAKER_17]: But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became.

257
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:28,505
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw the Riptide Arcade was gone.

258
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:30,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I cried a little bit.

259
00:17:30,907 --> 00:17:32,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.

260
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:36,971
[SPEAKER_20]: We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.

261
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:45,017
[SPEAKER_20]: That was actually, I got to say, that was one of our earliest achievements, really, as a station, was that we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments.

262
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,979
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did the Sacramento ones, of course.

263
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,519
[SPEAKER_20]: We broadcasted.

264
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,579
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,711
[SPEAKER_17]: I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.

266
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not talk about that on air.

267
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:21,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe after the show.

268
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:21,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoops.

269
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:23,735
[SPEAKER_17]: You heard nothing.

270
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:32,140
[SPEAKER_20]: I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.

271
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,763
[SPEAKER_20]: And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.

272
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,484
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe later, if you're good.

273
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.

274
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:40,665
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

275
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:41,305
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course.

276
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,346
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have a poetry slam.

277
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:48,247
[SPEAKER_20]: In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR.

278
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:49,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Like by pure coincidence.

279
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,187
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't plan it that way.

280
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,308
[SPEAKER_20]: But my birthday is Tuesday.

281
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:52,988
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, yay, I'm old.

282
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:53,688
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

283
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:55,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Also joining us tonight.

284
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:01,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.

285
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,411
[SPEAKER_20]: He's the one person I know was here for episode one.

286
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:06,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Tetsuya Dark Tetsuya

287
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:26,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Good, good.

288
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,691
[SPEAKER_20]: So, what's new?

289
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:32,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.

290
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:32,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Not us.

291
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:41,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one, and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.

292
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,587
[SPEAKER_20]: What's changed in 10 years?

293
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, DDR kinda died.

294
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:50,002
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura

295
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and old.

296
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:16,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

297
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:17,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Put me on the spot here.

298
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:18,184
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, man.

299
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:18,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Just...

300
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Be prepared for anything.

301
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.

302
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

303
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,401
[SPEAKER_20]: It's live and uncensored.

304
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:45,364
[SPEAKER_20]: And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.

305
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,565
[SPEAKER_20]: Say hello, final guest tonight.

306
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:50,366
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

307
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:52,487
[SPEAKER_20]: The OLR ferret is in the house.

308
00:20:54,568 --> 00:21:00,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, this is the OLR Ferret's cousin, because we don't know where the original OLR Ferret is, but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.

309
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks to the Magicka Radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.

310
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:06,332
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

311
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:07,173
[SPEAKER_20]: OLR Ferret.

312
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:07,753
[SPEAKER_20]: They're in the house.

313
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:10,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, there we are.

314
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:16,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.

315
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:18,729
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.

316
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:24,430
[SPEAKER_20]: We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.

317
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,071
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, the scene...

318
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:27,471
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.com

319
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:54,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?

320
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:59,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.

321
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,151
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's kind of what happened.

322
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:02,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob.

323
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:03,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

324
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:04,092
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

325
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Anytime.

326
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,194
[SPEAKER_20]: And here we are 10 years later.

327
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,335
[SPEAKER_20]: And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.

328
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:12,596
[SPEAKER_20]: We went from being two hours to three hours.

329
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:18,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.

330
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:42,495
[SPEAKER_20]: and then you know we've we've been on three different networks now and it's just it's been a crazy ride but but here we are some things stay the same and here we are after 10 years and I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it whether you started listening last week or this week or your Dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for DarkSakura and Loki I'll let them speak in a

331
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:44,317
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

332
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:00,192
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a lot of work.

333
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,453
[SPEAKER_20]: How have you done this for the past 10 years?

334
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:08,015
[SPEAKER_20]: And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody's listening.

335
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:13,918
[SPEAKER_20]: And by somebody, I mean one person listening is an amazing accomplishment.

336
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:14,938
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it really is.

337
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:20,320
[SPEAKER_20]: And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.

338
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,541
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a true community that we've built here.

339
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:24,882
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's a small community.

340
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:26,362
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not IGN.

341
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:27,643
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not one of the top...

342
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:31,544
[SPEAKER_20]: We're probably not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.

343
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:38,027
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.

344
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:46,410
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.

345
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.

346
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:51,992
[SPEAKER_20]: Once in a while we might and then get in big trouble for it.

347
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:58,077
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's awesome that you guys tune in to hear our opinions and we're so thankful.

348
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,099
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

349
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, actually.

350
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a link from...

351
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:10,669
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our listeners who played a happy birthday song for us on ukulele on YouTube.

352
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to send this to you.

353
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:12,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

354
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,011
[SPEAKER_08]: He used to work with Dan.

355
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:17,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

356
00:24:17,132 --> 00:24:17,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it safe to play on air?

357
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:20,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't hear it on here, so I guess that's the only way we'll find out.

358
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,535
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, I'll cue it up, but in the meantime.

359
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,197
[SPEAKER_08]: My motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.

360
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:29,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And Garris.

361
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Garris is the reason for life.

362
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:35,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

363
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:36,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm motivated?

364
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:04,760
[SPEAKER_37]: DarkSakura.com

365
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:26,978
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

366
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:50,172
[SPEAKER_37]: Every other week.

[SPEAKER_08]: I started a job.

368
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:52,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, you did.

369
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:53,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, okay.

370
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:57,041
[SPEAKER_20]: The chatter's thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?

371
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:57,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

372
00:25:57,902 --> 00:25:58,462
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

373
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I was doing the show when I had the plague.

374
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:01,446
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

375
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:01,987
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

376
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I said being sick.

377
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.

378
00:26:06,716 --> 00:26:11,877
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot.

379
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:16,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we will By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.

380
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,239
[SPEAKER_20]: Just saying.

381
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not good for anybody involved.

382
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,941
[SPEAKER_20]: Look, I just want to plug this too as well.

00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, 10 freaking years.

400
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,910
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years running strong, making a kick-ass live show and a wonderful podcast.

401
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart.

402
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean heart, yeah.

403
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:46,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, before this video gets- Did he say the bottom of his fart?

404
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:48,454
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that what Sully was about to say?

405
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.

406
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:51,416
[SPEAKER_20]: His fucking heart.

407
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

408
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:55,337
[SPEAKER_20]: But he censored himself, and then it made it sound like he said fart.

409
00:27:57,378 --> 00:28:04,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Camp I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts, and when I think about you, you make me wanna- Too long and I take too much of your time.

[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Niles Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.

414
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,141
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, starting us off tonight

415
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:20,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Garrus.

416
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:35,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for $11 with the first one... Thank you, Shane.

417
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:41,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.

418
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:54,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.

419
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,222
[SPEAKER_20]: She is amazing.

420
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I love her so much.

421
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:58,643
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll love her.

422
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But it came with the... Whatever.

423
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:06,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.

424
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw.

425
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:17,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.

426
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:19,833
[SPEAKER_20]: I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.

427
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:24,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's why it makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.

428
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:50,029
[SPEAKER_08]: and Grunt kind of is weird but yeah so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garrus again because I was happy and I've so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I and I was already a little sick and I got so motion sick playing it doing the the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.

429
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,329
[SPEAKER_20]: OMG spoilers in those first five minutes of the game.

430
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:04,679
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about ten minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5 a.m.

431
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wild this morning.

432
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Girlgasms for Garrus and I'm a boy

433
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:35,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, see?

434
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:36,295
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

435
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:44,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so I did actually play some World of Warcraft because we have the druid guild, Druidia.

436
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge, we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.

437
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:55,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids.

438
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:56,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think so?

439
00:31:57,968 --> 00:31:58,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rob's got one in there.

440
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss Nomi Malone.

441
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,731
[SPEAKER_20]: I do, I have Nomi Malone.

442
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:03,372
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a dancer, not a stripper.

443
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:05,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

444
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:07,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did a little bit of that.

445
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:11,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.

446
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:19,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, I mean, because like six hours I check it, do more missions, turn it off, check it another six hours, you know, because that's how long it takes.

447
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.

448
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:25,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

449
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one.

450
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:29,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?

451
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:31,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Garrus!

452
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, it's not that the first one's a bad game.

453
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch needs to give me his mission!

454
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:36,614
[SPEAKER_20]: He will soon.

455
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:39,298
[SPEAKER_20]: He needs to give you more than that, I imagine.

456
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Some bird love.

457
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

458
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,523
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else in your Gaming Week, DarkSakura?

459
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Marathon Mario Marathon

460
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,982
[SPEAKER_20]: I deeply appreciate it.

461
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:13,548
[SPEAKER_20]: I almost feel bad because that's a charity event, but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating, and I figure if you're watching them for 72 hours, you can spare one for us.

462
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:20,214
[SPEAKER_20]: And since we aren't asking for donations tonight, we will say go donate to a great charity, Child's Play, through Mario Marathon.

463
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:29,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan and I donated, and if you look at when they hit level 7-2, you will see Dan and Jamie, parentheses, O-L-R.

464
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:45,466
[SPEAKER_08]: oh nice so that's our donation put them to level 7 too very cool so go look at their page and give them some money after the show awesome let's move on and Techmaster Loki how was your gaming week?

465
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:58,369
[SPEAKER_37]: I played Minecraft more Minecraft I've been working on the minecart track entrance to my giant volcano thing how are you dealing with Friday's Patch?

466
00:33:59,255 --> 00:33:59,995
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, it's just fine.

467
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,876
[SPEAKER_37]: There's still Way the Doop in it, so it doesn't matter.

468
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:02,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course!

469
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, where there's a will, there's a way.

470
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:07,657
[SPEAKER_37]: And then, what else?

471
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:13,879
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, I played Lollipop Chainsaw, and I'm disappointed.

472
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:22,201
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and...

473
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:29,774
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.

474
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,295
[SPEAKER_37]: How is that possible?

475
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,417
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, you just can't.

476
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,398
[SPEAKER_37]: But yet they found a way to do it.

477
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,780
[SPEAKER_37]: And yes, it is an incredibly boring game.

478
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:40,903
[SPEAKER_37]: That I literally said, I'm not playing this anymore.

479
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:42,364
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really disappointing.

480
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:43,245
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, it is.

481
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:43,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play it.

482
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:45,567
[SPEAKER_37]: I know, I still want to play it.

483
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:46,348
[SPEAKER_37]: It's my friend's copy.

484
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:47,969
[SPEAKER_37]: Don't.

485
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else?

486
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:55,273
[SPEAKER_37]: A little bit of Modern Warfare 2, or Modern Warfare 3.

487
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:57,074
[SPEAKER_37]: And, yeah, that was it.

488
00:34:57,815 --> 00:35:02,398
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I didn't play a lot of new games this week, but I think I might have a problem.

489
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, here's the thing.

490
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,701
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I have Mass Effect on Xbox, right?

491
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:09,582
[SPEAKER_20]: And DarkSakura... Oh, shoot!

492
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:10,203
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, right?

493
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:15,366
[SPEAKER_20]: I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.

494
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,548
[SPEAKER_20]: That's alright, no, because wait until I'm going to say next.

495
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:21,231
[SPEAKER_20]: But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC.

496
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,013
[SPEAKER_20]: And then Alan plays it on PC as well.

497
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:26,315
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's like, oh, the graphics are better and da-da-da-da-da.

498
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:26,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is true.

499
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Your video card will look so nice.

500
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:33,381
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.

501
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:36,544
[SPEAKER_20]: So I was like, all right, I'll buy it.

502
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:37,105
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll buy it.

503
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:39,727
[SPEAKER_20]: So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again.

504
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,749
[SPEAKER_20]: And this time I'm playing as a renegade and da-da-da.

505
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:42,109
[SPEAKER_20]: And then...

506
00:35:43,030 --> 00:36:05,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99 So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC That's right, I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long When I haven't been doing stuff for the show I don't feel bad anymore

507
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:31,641
[SPEAKER_20]: like it is it is addicting and I gotta say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war there's advantages to both there really are I do miss playing on my TV I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller but I gotta say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse and that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with a controller but Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and

508
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,382
[SPEAKER_20]: I am so much better with it.

509
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:39,547
[SPEAKER_20]: And like, I am kicking ass with my engineers, which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.

510
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:42,329
[SPEAKER_20]: My little combat drones and setting people on fire.

511
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,010
[SPEAKER_20]: It's amazing.

512
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing an adept.

513
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:47,593
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but I have literally bought the same game.

514
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Same three games.

515
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Twice.

516
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:52,471
[SPEAKER_20]: On two different systems.

517
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a problem.

518
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:55,392
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, do I have a problem?

519
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:56,712
[SPEAKER_20]: He's nodding.

520
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:57,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I have a problem.

521
00:36:58,332 --> 00:36:58,953
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, Rob?

522
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:02,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.

523
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:08,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.

524
00:37:11,678 --> 00:37:12,058
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

525
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,420
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, that was pretty much it as far as my gaming week.

526
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,043
[SPEAKER_20]: I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing, things on the iPhone and so forth, but not a lot of new stuff.

527
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:23,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's really it for my gaming week.

528
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,985
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, this is the really sad part.

529
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,385
[SPEAKER_20]: You ready?

530
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Alinko.

531
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Says, Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.

532
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:51,981
[SPEAKER_20]: uh Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding Sky but I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week this whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with a keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking oh my god maybe I should like get into first person shooters

533
00:37:53,393 --> 00:37:54,573
[SPEAKER_20]: What is happening to me?

534
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know how I got into PC gaming, right?

535
00:37:58,574 --> 00:37:58,795
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

536
00:37:59,095 --> 00:37:59,535
[SPEAKER_08]: My hand.

537
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:03,216
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, because when your hand was not as well.

538
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:05,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm doing all this with a trackball, so.

539
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:08,757
[SPEAKER_20]: But, like, I literally sat there today.

540
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:12,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, seriously, you guys have listened to this show a long time, many of you.

541
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,319
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys on the couch, you've all been listening for a long time.

542
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:21,001
[SPEAKER_20]: I sat there looking at the PC going, maybe I should give Battlefield a try.

543
00:38:21,021 --> 00:38:21,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

544
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:26,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Something's happening to me and I don't like it.

545
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,871
[SPEAKER_20]: Suddenly I want to play first person shooters.

546
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you feeling not so fresh?

547
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,394
[SPEAKER_20]: This is so weird.

548
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:35,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, am I going to want Madden next?

549
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:36,818
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob needs a gaming douche.

550
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:38,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my God.

551
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:40,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow.

552
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:44,006
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.

553
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:45,887
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to ask chat.

554
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Chatters, what first person shooter should I play next?

555
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,153
[SPEAKER_20]: If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer, what first person shooter should I play next?

556
00:38:54,273 --> 00:39:00,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.

557
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:01,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Misty, how was your gaming week?

558
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,452
[SPEAKER_46]: It was actually more existent than I anticipated.

559
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:15,015
[SPEAKER_46]: And even for being on a train, Step Mania I believe works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.

560
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:24,039
[SPEAKER_46]: Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.

561
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,199
[SPEAKER_46]: Dabbled at pocket planes a bit.

562
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,241
[SPEAKER_46]: Seems to be it.

563
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:35,991
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, playing games on the train, going faster than the speed of light.

564
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:40,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Not really, but going to our chat room, I want to see some of the comments here.

565
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:42,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, Jim Sally says, Battlefield on PC.

566
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:45,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Nietzsche says, Battlefield 3.

567
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Actdeft says, screw that, get Team Fortress 2.

568
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,819
[SPEAKER_20]: I do like Team Fortress.

569
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,300
[SPEAKER_20]: I have played a little Team Fortress.

570
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,102
[SPEAKER_20]: That is kind of fun, actually, because I like playing a healer in that and using the little bandaging gun.

571
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:58,383
[SPEAKER_20]: That's actually kind of fun.

572
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:01,745
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the opposite of other first-person shooters where you're not shooting things.

573
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:07,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight says, Monday Night Combat.

574
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:08,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard that one's pretty good.

575
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Drew Nami says, Gears of War.

576
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,358
[SPEAKER_20]: I see a lot of people seeing Halo.

577
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,402
[SPEAKER_20]: See, I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.

578
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:17,505
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys keep shouting Halo 4.

579
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:19,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't play a game that's not out yet.

580
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:40,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I was not in love with Halo 3 I gotta say Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny I agree with that one You know what, I do have that on Steam and I tried to play that for a little bit so maybe I should go back and do that Zether says Quake Live I do love Quake Quake is real good So thank you for the suggestion I second Borderlands because you like loot, right?

581
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:43,708
[SPEAKER_37]: You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?

582
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:50,713
[SPEAKER_37]: I like loot at vognetwork.com Well, I'm just saying that you can also, I mean, that's basically, it's a first-person shooter with a lot of loot.

583
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:51,434
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

584
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:52,434
[SPEAKER_37]: You get, like, tons of weapons.

585
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:53,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I like shinies.

586
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:54,236
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's funny.

587
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:56,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I think Borderlands might be a winner.

588
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,158
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll have to check that out.

589
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:57,994
[SPEAKER_20]: 4Player Co-op

590
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:21,838
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck that Best Buy front-end program that I had to use to download it because once I downloaded it, Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.

591
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:22,918
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God it took my key.

592
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,199
[SPEAKER_20]: I had to re-download.

593
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:30,421
[SPEAKER_20]: I had to download 10 gigs twice because that stupid Best Buy front-end program can't talk to Origin.

594
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:33,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.

595
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:37,744
[SPEAKER_20]: I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.

596
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,345
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's fucking better when it's all your games, right?

597
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:42,206
[SPEAKER_20]: But

598
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,881
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

599
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:07,624
[SPEAKER_17]: and at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.

600
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:08,965
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice!

601
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:14,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.

602
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,054
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.

603
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,058
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

604
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry Rob, everyone's allowed to be wrong.

605
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:55,906
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right, you are allowed to be wrong.

606
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:25,144
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just saying Civ 5 is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like three days later I'll probably check out Civ 5 once my boyfriend gets a better PC because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization okay that's cool yeah I think like Civilization 3 is like the most recent one he can run on his computer

607
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:26,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I see.

608
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:33,552
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old, for lack of a better term.

609
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:35,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

610
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:36,513
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

611
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,954
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkTetsuya, what have you been playing this week in gaming?

612
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:41,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Not too much.

613
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:44,134
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, a little dusted off the 2DX controller.

614
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I played a little bit of that.

615
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:47,235
[SPEAKER_20]: We can barely hear you, so I'm going to have you switch mics.

616
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:49,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Dusted off the 2DX controller.

617
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:51,736
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.

618
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, let's see, a little bit of Stepmania.

619
00:43:56,009 --> 00:44:02,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play until I drop.

620
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:07,101
[SPEAKER_16]: That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Bros.

621
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:12,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Wii, trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.

622
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:15,270
[SPEAKER_16]: And a little bit of Mario Kart.

623
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:22,291
[SPEAKER_20]: I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but that's whatever.

624
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:29,281
[SPEAKER_20]: You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.

625
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:31,765
[SPEAKER_20]: We went on an adventure to break the law.

626
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:31,825
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

627
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:39,589
[SPEAKER_20]: We thought about it, but we went to Roseville Golf Land, which, you know, we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.

628
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:41,870
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the place we all met, right?

629
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Milpitas.

630
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:44,931
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

631
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:46,552
[SPEAKER_20]: It was actually Milpitas.

632
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:49,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land, it gets sadder and sadder.

633
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:52,054
[SPEAKER_20]: So Misty and I went this weekend.

634
00:44:52,094 --> 00:44:54,375
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.

635
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:54,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Easy.

636
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:56,536
[SPEAKER_20]: And let me put it this way.

637
00:44:57,617 --> 00:45:05,224
[SPEAKER_20]: The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like, oh my god, they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.

638
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:15,732
[SPEAKER_46]: I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.

639
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:20,616
[SPEAKER_46]: So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the mechs too.

640
00:45:21,057 --> 00:45:22,218
[SPEAKER_46]: Didn't even touch the Disney mechs.

641
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:31,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I play doubles on Disney Mix I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I play doubles on Disney Mix because I'm hardcore

642
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:33,554
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow.

643
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:34,695
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

644
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,957
[SPEAKER_20]: That's enough for our gaming weeks.

645
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:38,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on, folks.

646
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,539
[SPEAKER_20]: We got to get into the news tonight.

647
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,500
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit of housekeeping.

648
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,423
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.

649
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:48,225
[SPEAKER_20]: Part B, there's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.

650
00:45:48,505 --> 00:45:51,548
[SPEAKER_20]: Just you guys, emails, tweets, and phone calls.

651
00:45:51,928 --> 00:45:54,550
[SPEAKER_20]: So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.

652
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,192
[SPEAKER_20]: or get the phone number down, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

653
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:01,492
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.

654
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:05,114
[SPEAKER_20]: But for now, let's get to tonight's news.

655
00:46:05,414 --> 00:46:07,014
[SPEAKER_20]: And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.

656
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:18,478
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, let's talk about... It's kind of a duh, because we knew that there was a new system coming, just we thought there'd be a little something-something extra on there.

657
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,379
[SPEAKER_37]: But it's not...

658
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,461
[SPEAKER_37]: So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.

659
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:27,543
[SPEAKER_37]: The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS, no duh.

660
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:31,426
[SPEAKER_37]: And it doesn't have another circle pad.

661
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:32,827
[SPEAKER_37]: It only has one circle pad.

662
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:33,707
[SPEAKER_37]: What are they doing?

663
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:44,154
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the Circle Pad Pro and other accessories like the... Circle Pad Pro attachment?

664
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:46,836
[SPEAKER_37]: Like the Circle Pad Pro attachment, yeah.

665
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:50,238
[SPEAKER_20]: So Nintendo really just fucked that thing, didn't they?

666
00:46:51,266 --> 00:47:01,089
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, it's hilarious, too, because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the Circle Pad, except I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now?

667
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:09,812
[SPEAKER_37]: No, there probably was supposed to be a Circle Pad there, but they didn't want to admit failure, so they just said, we'll just put it out larger.

668
00:47:10,272 --> 00:47:18,435
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it possible that they might release a Circle Pad Pro XL and, in a smart move this time, not make it exclusive to one store so that maybe I'll get one?

669
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:20,597
[SPEAKER_37]: So how wide is this thing going to be?

670
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:24,662
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, seriously, if it's larger as it is, I got to add something on top of that?

671
00:47:24,702 --> 00:47:26,384
[SPEAKER_37]: It's going to be like four feet long.

672
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,426
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

673
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:32,732
[SPEAKER_37]: Why would we... I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.

674
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:33,392
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm a little...

675
00:47:34,494 --> 00:47:42,882
[SPEAKER_37]: Not that I would necessarily have to buy the Circle Pad Pro, because I'm not playing any games that would utilize it, like Resident Evil, which was apparently not very great.

676
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:46,005
[SPEAKER_20]: The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.

677
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:50,509
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're a lefty, you get a lot of use out of it, especially in Kid Icarus and some of that.

678
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:58,537
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, you would if you can hold on to... If you can actually hold the thing, yeah.

679
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:02,589
[SPEAKER_20]: I, I, there's a lot I like about the XL.

680
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:10,455
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, obviously, if you've played a DSi XL, those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen, you know, it's really cool.

681
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:15,099
[SPEAKER_20]: So I like the idea that there's going to be a 3DS that's huge like that.

682
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,642
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.

683
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:22,985
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.

684
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:27,307
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I mean, the bigness is going to be nice.

685
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:30,369
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to make the games look even better, which is exciting.

686
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,091
[SPEAKER_20]: But then the realist in me is like, dude, you already have a 3DS.

687
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:34,971
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't need another one.

688
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:38,173
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, yeah, it has better battery life, whatever.

689
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:40,254
[SPEAKER_20]: There's really no must-have thing.

690
00:48:40,274 --> 00:48:46,077
[SPEAKER_37]: If you need more battery life, you can buy an extra battery for like another $30 instead of buying a new system for another $200.

691
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:47,878
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, if I didn't have a 3DS, I'd buy this.

692
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,022
[SPEAKER_20]: But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.

693
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:59,005
[SPEAKER_19]: He's going to be like, Rob, I want that for Christmas.

694
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:05,069
[SPEAKER_37]: The new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.

695
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:10,833
[SPEAKER_37]: And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to, or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.

696
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:29,200
[SPEAKER_37]: and apparently, I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff, it's actual size for the regular DS, which would be nice, because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS, although I didn't play that many DS games, so who knows and of course, yeah, priced $199 so, hmm

697
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:41,347
[SPEAKER_20]: All righty, and that's the same day that that... I know this isn't coming up on our show roll, so we can mention here that Mario... New Super Mario Bros.

698
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:48,232
[SPEAKER_20]: 2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game with the whole DLC.

699
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:54,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Now Nintendo is like, all right, I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.

700
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:56,477
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess it's kind of where things are going.

701
00:49:56,797 --> 00:49:59,079
[SPEAKER_20]: But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video...

702
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,061
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a full featured game out of the box.

703
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:07,643
[SPEAKER_20]: The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.

704
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:10,845
[SPEAKER_37]: And why should I buy the DLC?

705
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:11,125
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean...

706
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:13,292
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

707
00:50:13,352 --> 00:50:14,453
[SPEAKER_37]: They're just experimenting.

708
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:16,876
[SPEAKER_37]: Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.

709
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,537
[SPEAKER_37]: They have never been online before.

710
00:50:19,378 --> 00:50:21,800
[SPEAKER_37]: What, a decade into the internet?

711
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,461
[SPEAKER_37]: Two decades into the internet.

712
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:26,364
[SPEAKER_37]: And this is their first time getting online.

713
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:31,588
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.

714
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:33,590
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, some things never change.

715
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Why is it talking to me?! !

716
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:40,771
[SPEAKER_20]: It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.

717
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:42,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Some things have to stay the same.

718
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:45,614
[SPEAKER_20]: They need to grow up though.

719
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:48,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Going to some comments in our chat room.

720
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:50,017
[SPEAKER_20]: I almost said the old one there.

721
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:52,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.

722
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:01,864
[SPEAKER_20]: Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen so it's less pixel depth.

723
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:03,285
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm still getting one.

724
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:10,028
[SPEAKER_20]: YYR says, I mean, it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.

725
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:14,730
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess that's... Oh, the whole fact about the DSi XL.

726
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,871
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell's going to happen to that?

727
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:18,652
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a good question.

728
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:20,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Will that go down in price?

729
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:22,374
[SPEAKER_20]: I imagine they've got to phase out the old DSs soon.

730
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:25,315
[SPEAKER_37]: They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May, so...

731
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:28,959
[SPEAKER_20]: I might have to drop it again.

732
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:29,899
[SPEAKER_20]: He makes a point there.

733
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:31,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Only $30 difference?

734
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,321
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to really kill the DSi XL.

735
00:51:34,982 --> 00:51:35,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Need to put that out for $99.

736
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:41,545
[SPEAKER_20]: TigerClaw in chat asks a Nintendo-related question.

737
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:49,548
[SPEAKER_20]: Says, Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC, are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?

738
00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:50,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

739
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:54,151
[SPEAKER_20]: It depends what new awesome thing they're gonna put on it.

740
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,914
[SPEAKER_20]: You're also assuming I'm gonna buy a Wii U. I may not at this point.

741
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:01,296
[SPEAKER_20]: It really depends on how great those games are.

742
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:02,577
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll see.

743
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:04,190
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

744
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:29,314
[SPEAKER_20]: Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.

745
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:35,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.

746
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:36,576
[SPEAKER_20]: That's interesting.

747
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:39,717
[SPEAKER_20]: Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.

748
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:51,081
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the haters, I just want to remind you, the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega, we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.

749
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:58,368
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but then I think, alright, but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.

750
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:07,519
[SPEAKER_20]: The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M. I didn't dislike it as much as other people did, but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M. So what do you guys think?

751
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Namco Bandai is involved now.

752
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:20,389
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that means it's pretty obvious we're going to see some Namco characters show up now as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake and all those characters before.

753
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,570
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to get what?

754
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,851
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll have Pac-Man.

755
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:28,936
[SPEAKER_20]: What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari Damacy, although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?

756
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,448
[SPEAKER_20]: or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?

757
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:34,729
[SPEAKER_37]: There was supposed to be a DS version but I don't think they ever made it.

758
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:36,490
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.

759
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,050
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

760
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,111
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe from the Tales games?

761
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

762
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:40,591
[SPEAKER_20]: I might be stretching here but what?

763
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:41,852
[SPEAKER_20]: They can still do the Prince.

764
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:43,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man's gonna eat him up yum yum.

765
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:43,813
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

766
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:44,909
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Driller Mitsurugi

767
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:09,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Vandy in our chatroom suggests his pole position.

768
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:11,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Loco Poco suggests Klonoa.

769
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,177
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?

770
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:15,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll have HuPow.

771
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,360
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube, or excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least.

772
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:19,921
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Wii.

773
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:21,042
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Wii?

774
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:21,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

775
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:22,583
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess that could happen.

776
00:54:22,603 --> 00:54:23,023
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

777
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:30,068
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie from that game that never came out in the U.S.?

778
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:34,331
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Bros.

779
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,372
[SPEAKER_20]: being developed by Namco in part?

780
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,782
[SPEAKER_20]: JV Mon, aren't you a Smash Bros.

781
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:39,022
[SPEAKER_20]: fan?

782
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:45,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but it's not going to come out for another five years, so it's no point getting excited for it now.

783
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:47,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Good point.

784
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:47,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on.

785
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:49,869
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.

786
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:51,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Garrus.

787
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.

788
00:54:54,352 --> 00:55:08,362
[SPEAKER_08]: The extended cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360 on June 26th and on the 4th of July which means it's already out for those two platforms and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.

789
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:09,543
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, just tangent.

790
00:55:09,703 --> 00:55:11,705
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not already out because that's my birthday.

791
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:12,926
[SPEAKER_20]: My birthday's Tuesday.

792
00:55:12,986 --> 00:55:13,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, brain.

793
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:14,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a week ahead, Rob.

794
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:15,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a week ahead.

795
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:16,188
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

796
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:19,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.

797
00:55:38,212 --> 00:55:41,493
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's another quote on here on how to access it.

798
00:55:41,993 --> 00:55:48,596
[SPEAKER_08]: To experience the extended cut, load a saved game from before the attack on the Cerberus base and play through to the end of the game.

799
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to do my... Sorry.

800
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:53,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to... No.

801
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:55,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the Citadel.

802
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:55,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

803
00:55:56,139 --> 00:55:56,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

804
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the consort.

805
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,401
[SPEAKER_08]: She just sounded so perky.

806
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:13,750
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what's interesting to me though, Jamie, is that you're a new Mass Effect fan, kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.

807
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:25,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending, so my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first, or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your endings?

808
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,360
[SPEAKER_08]: and see if I'm still pissed off and then go back and watch the other one.

809
00:56:49,461 --> 00:56:51,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I can always just YouTube the other endings.

810
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:58,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently nobody else liked, the one where everyone gets all mixed up.

811
00:57:00,605 --> 00:57:01,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Black Lab is in chat.

812
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:02,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Puppy!

813
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:03,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I saw him earlier.

814
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,287
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.

815
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:05,867
[SPEAKER_20]: We gotta fix that.

816
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:07,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what's up with that, dude?

817
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:09,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Lost Puppy.

818
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:17,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.

819
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:19,212
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

820
00:57:39,617 --> 00:57:40,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Well... But we'll see.

821
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,382
[SPEAKER_08]: To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.

822
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:49,248
[SPEAKER_08]: The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.

823
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:57,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.

824
00:57:57,757 --> 00:58:00,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.

825
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:03,669
[SPEAKER_20]: No, there's no way it's going to be that.

826
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:07,230
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.

827
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:13,892
[SPEAKER_20]: The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.

828
00:58:14,312 --> 00:58:20,613
[SPEAKER_20]: So that means there's like 20% of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.

829
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:24,114
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.

830
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: it kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned and rushed the ending because I've been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing

831
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:51,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody, which I kind of believe... I mean, I don't know what to believe.

832
00:58:51,922 --> 00:58:58,608
[SPEAKER_20]: There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.

833
00:58:59,008 --> 00:58:59,629
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I just...

834
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:01,790
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hopeful for the DLC.

835
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not hate the ending as is.

836
00:59:04,651 --> 00:59:15,656
[SPEAKER_20]: I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole... I mean, the letdown for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.

837
00:59:16,097 --> 00:59:17,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe you get a two second scene.

838
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:21,199
[SPEAKER_20]: A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.

839
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:22,940
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's very little.

840
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,580
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the part that got me.

841
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:27,501
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.

842
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:32,503
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that there's some things they want to close up.

843
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:36,664
[SPEAKER_20]: That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.

844
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:37,745
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that.

845
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,946
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.

846
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think there's some people that are mad about that.

847
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:46,568
[SPEAKER_20]: They want...

848
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:51,751
[SPEAKER_08]: My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.

849
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,033
[SPEAKER_08]: What are all those people going to eat?

850
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:55,954
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't eat Earth food.

851
00:59:56,514 --> 00:59:56,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Each other.

852
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:01,358
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean... Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.

853
01:00:02,178 --> 01:00:02,498
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

854
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:07,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking of all... They're going to have a long road home.

855
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:09,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all the other people who can't get home.

856
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:10,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just very sad.

857
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:15,103
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending, let's move on.

858
01:00:15,123 --> 01:00:16,183
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I left it at, Rob.

859
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.

860
01:00:19,464 --> 01:00:20,465
[SPEAKER_37]: All right.

861
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:23,426
[SPEAKER_37]: So this is... I'm kind of surprised by this.

862
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:38,791
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games, plus they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.

863
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,132
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, interesting enough...

864
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:43,993
[SPEAKER_37]: The game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.

865
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:48,934
[SPEAKER_37]: It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.

866
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:51,435
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.

867
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,876
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.

868
01:00:53,976 --> 01:00:55,796
[SPEAKER_37]: But that would be the case.

869
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,937
[SPEAKER_37]: So I don't know.

870
01:00:58,597 --> 01:00:59,277
[SPEAKER_37]: Very interesting.

871
01:00:59,498 --> 01:01:00,918
[SPEAKER_37]: But that is coming out later on this fall.

872
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,070
[SPEAKER_20]: That is interesting.

873
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially if the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.

874
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:26,615
[SPEAKER_37]: My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii DS and 3DS versions right now, and then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version, and then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.

875
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:28,355
[SPEAKER_20]: That makes way too much sense.

876
01:01:30,802 --> 01:01:32,543
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, they definitely won't be doing that.

877
01:01:33,003 --> 01:01:34,523
[SPEAKER_20]: How dare you bring logic into this show?

878
01:01:34,543 --> 01:01:34,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn it!

879
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:37,864
[SPEAKER_20]: How dare you?

880
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:40,125
[SPEAKER_37]: It's very possible that they may not.

881
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:44,587
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, like Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July, and they cut out the PS3.

882
01:01:45,207 --> 01:01:48,548
[SPEAKER_37]: So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.

883
01:01:49,116 --> 01:02:08,065
[SPEAKER_37]: YYR in chat says Activision would release on every platform if possible there must be some sort of deal well just like I said no I don't think so so because if they think that's only going to reach the you know kind of children demographic then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions all right let's talk about a remake

884
01:02:09,886 --> 01:02:11,769
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.

885
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:15,213
[SPEAKER_20]: This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.

886
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,036
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Okami HD.

887
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:21,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.

888
01:02:21,482 --> 01:02:24,205
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling.

889
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:25,067
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we please them?

890
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:29,070
[SPEAKER_20]: They're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.

891
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,792
[SPEAKER_20]: It's full 1080p HD.

892
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:34,996
[SPEAKER_20]: It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.

893
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:40,861
[SPEAKER_20]: It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced, on Twitter, and of course on YouTube.

894
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:42,703
[SPEAKER_20]: It is going to be launching.

895
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:43,924
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the really interesting part.

896
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,506
[SPEAKER_20]: It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen.

897
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:47,127
[SPEAKER_20]: That's about 50 bucks.

898
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:54,899
[SPEAKER_20]: In the U.S., Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.

899
01:02:57,421 --> 01:02:59,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Ha ha, we get a deal.

900
01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:00,664
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Japan.

901
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:03,647
[SPEAKER_20]: But that is awesome.

902
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.

903
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:08,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you never know.

904
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:18,225
[SPEAKER_20]: The one in Japan might come with, like, I don't know, stickers, box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark, maybe a soundtrack or something extra.

905
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:21,630
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, now, now, it was only... Oh, that was the Wii version.

906
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:30,180
[SPEAKER_37]: I thought it was the... There was something with the DS Okamiden, I think, that had something funky with that, too.

907
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:31,982
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe the box art?

908
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:32,462
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

909
01:03:32,762 --> 01:03:34,084
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30.

910
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,006
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a Bubble Bobble game.

911
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:41,531
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but that, you know what, what's funny, this is one of those games I never really got around to playing.

912
01:03:41,591 --> 01:03:42,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I missed it.

913
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:43,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I, you know, played a demo.

914
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:44,553
[SPEAKER_20]: That was about it.

915
01:03:44,873 --> 01:03:50,617
[SPEAKER_20]: But I really wanted to try this out, and I think the price of $20 download online is a great place to see this.

916
01:03:50,857 --> 01:04:01,144
[SPEAKER_20]: And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer, and it looks great.

917
01:04:01,164 --> 01:04:03,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, when they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.

918
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:07,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, there's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in studio, and then it goes,

919
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:10,490
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color.

920
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:11,630
[SPEAKER_20]: It's great.

921
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:16,033
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.

922
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:19,355
[SPEAKER_20]: And trophies for your EPing.

923
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:27,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates and just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which yes, of course, we have one tonight.

924
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,101
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, first up with some news.

925
01:04:29,653 --> 01:04:30,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo 3 Patch 1.0.3

926
01:04:50,407 --> 01:05:04,677
[SPEAKER_08]: so they're trying to make it more secure and the quote here says for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete before they can access certain game features

927
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:18,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.

928
01:05:18,531 --> 01:05:20,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the official list.

929
01:05:21,374 --> 01:05:24,357
[SPEAKER_08]: No public game access for unverified digital purchasers.

930
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:31,140
[SPEAKER_08]: No auction house access real money or gold for unverified digital purchasers.

931
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.

932
01:05:36,022 --> 01:05:40,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.

933
01:05:40,623 --> 01:05:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests, but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.

934
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:51,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Global Play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.

935
01:05:53,547 --> 01:06:21,369
[SPEAKER_20]: but they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and level 13 so well I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house especially when real money's at stake but that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online and it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way

936
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:22,891
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

937
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:52,760
[SPEAKER_20]: and granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3 and then, you know, they're doing that but I don't know.

938
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,262
[SPEAKER_20]: God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.

939
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.

940
01:06:57,824 --> 01:06:59,205
[SPEAKER_20]: But yet, Diablo 3 is a huge game.

941
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,113
[SPEAKER_20]: Huge, huge game.

942
01:07:01,694 --> 01:07:02,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Go figure.

943
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:09,658
[SPEAKER_20]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.

944
01:07:10,258 --> 01:07:13,520
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming it sounds like.

945
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,120
[SPEAKER_20]: Hmm.

946
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:16,569
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

947
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,873
[SPEAKER_20]: DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.

948
01:07:21,493 --> 01:07:29,199
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.

949
01:07:29,899 --> 01:07:31,821
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it really a damning number or no?

950
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:35,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?

951
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:41,828
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.

952
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:44,142
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

953
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:13,641
[SPEAKER_37]: The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360 And that's it

954
01:08:17,975 --> 01:08:22,797
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope that amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.

955
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:24,058
[SPEAKER_37]: The game looks pretty good though.

956
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:24,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Really?

957
01:08:24,598 --> 01:08:26,699
[SPEAKER_37]: The game is done by, was it Beenox?

958
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:31,501
[SPEAKER_37]: I think they're the guys that did the last two games and it's open world and it looks pretty awesome.

959
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:37,484
[SPEAKER_37]: The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.

960
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:40,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching the YouTube interview with him.

961
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:41,906
[SPEAKER_37]: I was just like, what the fuck is that?

962
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:45,007
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.

963
01:08:45,598 --> 01:08:46,819
[SPEAKER_37]: Hey, you're the creator of the game.

964
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,941
[SPEAKER_37]: Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man.

965
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:49,401
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

966
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,583
[SPEAKER_08]: He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.

967
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:55,086
[SPEAKER_37]: I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.

968
01:08:56,107 --> 01:08:59,329
[SPEAKER_37]: Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.

969
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,631
[SPEAKER_37]: Hurry before he dies.

970
01:09:01,231 --> 01:09:02,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

971
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:03,193
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's be real.

972
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:05,134
[SPEAKER_20]: The celebrities we love, they're getting older.

973
01:09:06,095 --> 01:09:07,436
[SPEAKER_37]: Him and Morgan Freeman, man.

974
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:09,738
[SPEAKER_37]: Keep the old people.

975
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:10,799
[SPEAKER_37]: Get them acting more.

976
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,120
[SPEAKER_37]: They should do a buddy comedy.

977
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:13,561
[SPEAKER_37]: Morgan Freeman?

978
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:14,322
[SPEAKER_20]: And Adam West.

979
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:16,758
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

980
01:09:17,499 --> 01:09:17,819
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe.

981
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,022
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just cool old bastards.

982
01:09:20,383 --> 01:09:21,545
[SPEAKER_37]: Cool old bastards.

983
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:21,945
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

984
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:29,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold, and apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.

985
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:33,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice.

986
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:34,962
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

987
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:38,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.

988
01:09:38,684 --> 01:09:43,627
[SPEAKER_20]: On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners... Cricket, cricket.

989
01:09:44,687 --> 01:09:50,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction, but a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.

990
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:54,553
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never heard of that company, but that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

991
01:09:54,573 --> 01:09:56,033
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.

992
01:09:56,093 --> 01:10:00,536
[SPEAKER_20]: This looks like it's another... I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.

993
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:01,576
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell?

994
01:10:01,717 --> 01:10:02,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait a minute.

995
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:02,457
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like...

996
01:10:02,817 --> 01:10:11,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay, little girls are happy and da-da-da-da-da and she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on and then robots!

997
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:13,719
[SPEAKER_37]: So Neon Genesis?

998
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:15,860
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what the hell that is.

999
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,460
[SPEAKER_20]: What is that that it comes with?

1000
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:18,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at that.

1001
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,101
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that a microphone?

1002
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:21,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Cosplay pieces.

1003
01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:22,441
[SPEAKER_20]: How did partner?

1004
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:28,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together in our school uniforms.

1005
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:29,482
[SPEAKER_20]: What the fuck is this?

1006
01:10:29,662 --> 01:10:30,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Pointing!

1007
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:32,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Giant Mecha Rancher.

1008
01:10:33,373 --> 01:10:33,673
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1009
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:52,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1010
01:10:52,588 --> 01:10:59,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Zether in chat explains Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.

1011
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:01,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well that explains everything.

1012
01:11:01,693 --> 01:11:02,454
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so fucking angry.

1013
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:03,314
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard Steins Gate.

1014
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:04,095
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you have?

1015
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:05,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1016
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:05,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Explain it to me.

1017
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:06,716
[SPEAKER_37]: I just heard of it.

1018
01:11:06,776 --> 01:11:08,017
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know what the hell it is.

1019
01:11:09,118 --> 01:11:10,859
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.

1020
01:11:10,919 --> 01:11:12,880
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a book report due Sunday.

1021
01:11:16,008 --> 01:11:17,449
[SPEAKER_20]: This is why I love having a chat room.

1022
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:19,950
[SPEAKER_20]: They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.

1023
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:40,219
[SPEAKER_20]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection, Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well, Atelier Aisha, Kokan no Daichi no Rikenjutsu in regular and premium flavors, and I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3, but .hack//.

1024
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Sekai no Muko ni vs. Hybrid Pack

1025
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be very meta.

1026
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:08,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2, though.

1027
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Have they done one on PlayStation 3?

1028
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:10,912
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they have.

1029
01:12:11,473 --> 01:12:12,554
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the closest we get.

1030
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:13,575
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a fighting game.

1031
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:14,276
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, well.

1032
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:18,662
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then... I guess anything's possible.

1033
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:19,723
[SPEAKER_20]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1034
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:48,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I love this game.

1035
01:12:49,243 --> 01:12:50,164
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm importing it.

1036
01:12:50,344 --> 01:12:51,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even know it was coming out.

1037
01:12:51,685 --> 01:12:52,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you know they have one on the 360?

1038
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:57,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.

1039
01:12:58,189 --> 01:12:59,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.

1040
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh-oh, Rob's going to get it.

1041
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:10,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the count is a two.

1042
01:13:12,563 --> 01:13:14,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.

1043
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:17,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Two people in the world own Cold Step Saga on the Xbox 360.

1044
01:13:19,325 --> 01:13:19,745
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, there you go.

1045
01:13:19,765 --> 01:13:20,725
[SPEAKER_37]: Now you have a friend to play with.

1046
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:21,346
[SPEAKER_20]: I do!

1047
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:21,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay!

1048
01:13:21,946 --> 01:13:22,726
[SPEAKER_20]: We're friends!

1049
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:23,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay!

1050
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:28,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you my Xbox 360 friend?

1051
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:29,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Friends!

1052
01:13:29,628 --> 01:13:29,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1053
01:13:30,048 --> 01:13:30,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Friends.

1054
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:32,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Aww.

1055
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:33,889
[SPEAKER_20]: That's so sweet.

1056
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:41,992
[SPEAKER_20]: They still haven't removed that 100 person limit even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago so they could do that?

1057
01:13:42,637 --> 01:13:44,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1058
01:13:44,839 --> 01:13:47,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?

1059
01:13:47,521 --> 01:13:48,082
[SPEAKER_20]: How about the Wii?

1060
01:13:48,122 --> 01:13:49,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?

1061
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:50,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1062
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:51,185
[SPEAKER_20]: People still do the Wii.

1063
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:51,845
[SPEAKER_20]: One game.

1064
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:53,607
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's called Zero.

1065
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:56,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Shinku no Chou comes out this week.

1066
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,494
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly.

1067
01:14:02,055 --> 01:14:03,536
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's like a ghost scary game.

1068
01:14:03,576 --> 01:14:04,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, this is a scary game.

1069
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:05,918
[SPEAKER_37]: Wait, crimson butterfly?

1070
01:14:05,938 --> 01:14:06,759
[SPEAKER_37]: That sounds familiar.

1071
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,701
[SPEAKER_37]: Was that a...

1072
01:14:09,758 --> 01:14:11,019
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

1073
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:38,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.

1074
01:14:39,203 --> 01:14:40,983
[SPEAKER_20]: It's part of the Fatal Frame series.

1075
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:44,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.

1076
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:45,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1077
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:49,227
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.

1078
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:50,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that means?

1079
01:14:51,188 --> 01:14:51,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Droh.

1080
01:14:52,949 --> 01:15:18,293
[SPEAKER_08]: 27th we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD collection on PS3 and the Darkside Chronicles HD for PS3 the 29th Harvest Moon the Tale of Two Towns because we can't have enough sheep and cows Mini Ninja I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it when that is totally incorrect so I am not going to say it the way it is on the box it's Mini Ninja Adventures

1081
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:29,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection, Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir, Spec Ops The Line, and The Amazing Spider-Man.

1082
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:31,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Spider-Man!

1083
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:33,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1084
01:15:34,206 --> 01:15:37,427
[SPEAKER_20]: A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

1085
01:15:37,487 --> 01:15:42,448
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've been assured that DarkSakura has picked a special game for the classic game of the week this week.

1086
01:15:42,728 --> 01:15:43,608
[SPEAKER_20]: But first, Loki.

1087
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,009
[SPEAKER_37]: So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.

1088
01:15:48,569 --> 01:15:49,349
[SPEAKER_37]: Good for him.

1089
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,630
[SPEAKER_37]: Get off that sinking ship.

1090
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:56,931
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday.

1091
01:15:57,831 --> 01:16:01,712
[SPEAKER_37]: And basically just, you know,

1092
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:06,442
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know, just moving on to better things.

1093
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:17,425
[SPEAKER_37]: He said, both as individuals and as a group, you've taught me more than I could have ever thought possible, and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.

1094
01:16:18,526 --> 01:16:22,167
[SPEAKER_37]: That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.

1095
01:16:23,827 --> 01:16:25,168
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, maybe I made up that last part.

1096
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:32,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Could this be a very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?

1097
01:16:37,183 --> 01:16:37,704
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1098
01:16:38,606 --> 01:16:39,067
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

1099
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:44,458
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, honestly, I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games, but it's a team that puts that stuff together.

1100
01:16:44,478 --> 01:16:45,640
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not just one dude, so...

1101
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:48,478
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true, and he's not the only guy, too.

1102
01:16:49,599 --> 01:16:53,822
[SPEAKER_20]: We just had a story last week about other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.

1103
01:16:53,862 --> 01:16:57,304
[SPEAKER_37]: I didn't want to be worked to death, so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.

1104
01:16:58,185 --> 01:16:59,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Did he say where he went?

1105
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:00,206
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1106
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:01,907
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be interesting to see where he ends up.

1107
01:17:02,028 --> 01:17:04,069
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the part of the story I want to know.

1108
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:14,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Did he leave for another opportunity, or did he leave because he would rather go work at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?

1109
01:17:15,076 --> 01:17:16,177
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be very curious to know that.

1110
01:17:17,398 --> 01:17:18,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That's at least as old as you are.

1111
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:18,959
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the best...

1112
01:17:49,195 --> 01:17:50,316
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, technically that's true.

1113
01:17:50,336 --> 01:17:51,116
[SPEAKER_08]: It is true.

1114
01:17:51,617 --> 01:17:53,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from the 80s.

1115
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:56,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not... Hi.

1116
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's older than the show.

1117
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:58,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1118
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:00,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.

1119
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, moving on.

1120
01:18:01,924 --> 01:18:02,165
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1121
01:18:02,185 --> 01:18:02,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I got ferreted.

1122
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:11,641
[SPEAKER_20]: I felt good after 10 years.

1123
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:12,101
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1124
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:18,863
[SPEAKER_20]: So the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court against a clone game.

1125
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:33,167
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these, and it's out of control because Apple doesn't – the people that are screening the games don't necessarily know what intellectual property is what, although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out.

1126
01:18:33,267 --> 01:18:36,648
[SPEAKER_37]: Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or –

1127
01:18:37,228 --> 01:18:44,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was like the number one thing and all it was was an app that was like pictures of Pokemon or something?

1128
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:45,190
[SPEAKER_20]: It was bad.

1129
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,211
[SPEAKER_37]: Pokemon and the gold is going in my pocket.

1130
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:47,911
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

1131
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:48,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Pokemon, give me your money.

1132
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:55,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow, Zio Interactive made this game called Mino and they said it was inspired by Tetris.

1133
01:18:56,334 --> 01:19:01,855
[SPEAKER_20]: But when the Tetris company found the game, they sued Zio for copyright infringement in New Jersey.

1134
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:03,656
[SPEAKER_20]: And during the legal fight,

1135
01:19:04,356 --> 01:19:09,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Zio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.

1136
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Rules cannot be covered by copyright.

1137
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:19,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets so this game infringed on the copyrights.

1138
01:19:19,846 --> 01:19:23,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris.

1139
01:19:24,268 --> 01:19:26,710
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs.

1140
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:31,513
[SPEAKER_20]: But the difference is Zio was like a fucking copy, right?

1141
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:39,038
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the ruling, the judge basically says, here's what is and what isn't copyright.

1142
01:19:40,178 --> 01:19:44,501
[SPEAKER_20]: The judge says the basic rule sets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.

1143
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:57,290
[SPEAKER_20]: He says the basic rule set of Tetris is not copyrightable as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board is not an idea you can copyright.

1144
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:58,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Hence, Dr. Mario.

1145
01:20:01,141 --> 01:20:05,905
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier, but I am now since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.

1146
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:13,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?

1147
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:23,378
[SPEAKER_37]: It would be interesting to... Well, according to some law or some court cases against two competing games that are very similar like that... It was settled.

1148
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:24,899
[SPEAKER_20]: It never went to court, did it?

1149
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,600
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it was settled.

1150
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:29,616
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyway, I'm just curious.

1151
01:20:30,037 --> 01:20:33,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I'm just curious.

1152
01:20:34,827 --> 01:20:40,548
[SPEAKER_20]: But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.

1153
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:45,349
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure all of us go, okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously.

1154
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:49,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing.

1155
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:49,810
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's not Tetris.

1156
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but, you know, I digress.

1157
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:55,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?

1158
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's...

1159
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:04,216
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, but Zio, according to the judge, copied more than this.

1160
01:21:04,336 --> 01:21:10,381
[SPEAKER_20]: They copied the exact dimensions of the play area, the shape, the color of the pieces, and other mechanics.

1161
01:21:14,944 --> 01:21:17,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.

1162
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:23,606
[SPEAKER_20]: The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games that showed that they were identical.

1163
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:27,587
[SPEAKER_20]: They said that Zio altered enough of the game... Oh, I'm sorry.

1164
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:36,669
[SPEAKER_20]: The judge said that if Zio had altered enough of the game, like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior, it would have avoided.

1165
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,630
[SPEAKER_20]: So what does this mean?

1166
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,631
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, going off the article at GamePolitics.com, they say not much.

1167
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:50,473
[SPEAKER_20]: The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.

1168
01:21:50,813 --> 01:21:53,354
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.

1169
01:21:53,654 --> 01:21:57,535
[SPEAKER_20]: This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court, which means it could change.

1170
01:21:57,895 --> 01:22:02,937
[SPEAKER_20]: But let's imagine, according to GamePolitics here, that it did have bearing across the U.S.,

1171
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:03,677
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.com

1172
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:20,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope.

1173
01:22:21,111 --> 01:22:22,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Radical Fishing vs. Ninja Fishing?

1174
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:23,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope.

1175
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:29,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though some of us sit here and go, Zynga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to Tiny Tower.

1176
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:36,042
[SPEAKER_20]: But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.

1177
01:22:36,062 --> 01:22:47,150
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, Zynga's smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties, and they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this, and you're gold.

1178
01:22:49,535 --> 01:22:55,999
[SPEAKER_20]: GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.

1179
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,321
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that is a good thing.

1180
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:05,905
[SPEAKER_20]: YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days, including the color of each piece.

1181
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:07,226
[SPEAKER_20]: I never realized that.

1182
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:08,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Crazy.

1183
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:18,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating, especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network, you know, the store and all that.

1184
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:20,432
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, there you go.

1185
01:23:21,273 --> 01:23:22,534
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see what happens in the future.

1186
01:23:22,574 --> 01:23:26,517
[SPEAKER_20]: I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.

1187
01:23:26,838 --> 01:23:31,581
[SPEAKER_20]: But, of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.

1188
01:23:32,802 --> 01:23:35,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking of years and years and years and years...

1189
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:48,834
[SPEAKER_20]: every week here on the show DarkSakura likes to spotlight the classic game of the week all of which I'm older than a game from the archives that DarkSakura says hey

1190
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:53,205
[SPEAKER_20]: You should be respecting this game and you should play this game.

1191
01:23:53,586 --> 01:23:59,971
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the 10th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm sure DarkSakura has picked something very special tonight.

1192
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:02,994
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic game of the week?

1193
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:03,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Pong!

1194
01:24:04,455 --> 01:24:04,655
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1195
01:24:05,976 --> 01:24:06,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Could have been.

1196
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:08,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Pong would have been a good choice.

1197
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:09,079
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wouldn't.

1198
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:09,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Boop.

1199
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,100
Boop.

1200
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:10,820
Boop.

1201
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:11,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Boop.

1202
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:11,921
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1203
01:24:12,562 --> 01:24:13,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatmania 2DX.

1204
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,780
[SPEAKER_20]: A good choice.

1205
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:31,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.

1206
01:24:31,426 --> 01:24:42,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I started with a little game called BM98, which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.

1207
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:46,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.

1208
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:50,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Beatmania 2DX song.

1209
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:51,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck yeah.

1210
01:24:52,224 --> 01:24:52,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck yeah.

1211
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,065
[SPEAKER_08]: This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.

1212
01:24:56,666 --> 01:25:02,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.

1213
01:25:03,347 --> 01:25:09,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.

1214
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.

1215
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:16,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.

1216
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:18,482
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?

1217
01:25:19,763 --> 01:25:32,031
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have two extra keys than the original five-key Beatmania, and your turntable is on the opposite side, depending on what side you're playing on.

1218
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:37,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So this has started Right Side Pride and Left Side Pride, where a lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.

1219
01:25:38,335 --> 01:25:39,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, good for you.

1220
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:40,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I play right side.

1221
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:42,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Left Side Pride, weakling.

1222
01:25:42,518 --> 01:25:42,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1223
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:48,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.

1224
01:25:49,434 --> 01:25:57,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.

1225
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.

1226
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:04,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Or me.

1227
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:07,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Girl.

1228
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:10,708
[SPEAKER_20]: D'Artistio over there says Lisu.

1229
01:26:10,928 --> 01:26:11,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1230
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:11,849
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember him.

1231
01:26:12,009 --> 01:26:12,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1232
01:26:13,652 --> 01:26:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.

1233
01:26:22,604 --> 01:26:26,969
[SPEAKER_08]: There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time, and a backspin scratch.

1234
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:29,493
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to scratch directionally.

1235
01:26:31,215 --> 01:26:33,256
[SPEAKER_08]: For difficulty, you go from 1 to 7.

1236
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:37,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in 5th style, you had a flashing 7 that was the highest difficulty.

1237
01:26:38,558 --> 01:26:41,779
[SPEAKER_08]: With 10th style, you actually had level 8.

1238
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:45,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And then an 8 plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.

1239
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:50,382
[SPEAKER_08]: With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.

1240
01:26:50,783 --> 01:26:53,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's getting way past me.

1241
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:54,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the last one that...

1242
01:26:54,824 --> 01:27:01,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really into was 8th Style, which I think was the last one I bought.

1243
01:27:03,809 --> 01:27:13,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.

1244
01:27:14,015 --> 01:27:15,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

1245
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:15,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

1246
01:27:18,378 --> 01:27:41,552
[SPEAKER_08]: and also 7th style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song and then 13 distorted had multiple extra stage songs gold had two different ones the 1ES and the 1MES so yeah it was really getting crazy there like where else can they go with it

1247
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:46,380
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.

1248
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller.

1249
01:27:56,374 --> 01:28:00,055
[SPEAKER_08]: and the effectors so basically you could control what it sounded like.

1250
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:03,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?

1251
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:05,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, to make it really noisy.

1252
01:28:05,438 --> 01:28:07,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could hear it over every freaking thing else?

1253
01:28:08,299 --> 01:28:09,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I admit something here real quick?

1254
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:11,460
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.

1255
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,261
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to find the song that got me into your beat What song is that?

1256
01:28:14,281 --> 01:28:15,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultra High Heels Oh really?

1257
01:28:15,361 --> 01:28:15,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah I can do that

1258
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:41,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat the hell out of that song because I freaking loved it.

1259
01:28:42,252 --> 01:28:43,792
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.

1260
01:28:45,193 --> 01:28:52,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs so you can see the song information and titles while you played.

1261
01:28:53,937 --> 01:28:54,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, turn this up.

1262
01:29:00,922 --> 01:29:03,203
[SPEAKER_08]: This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.

1263
01:29:05,144 --> 01:29:09,947
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I mean, even if a lot of people are like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they're just songs that were fun.

1264
01:29:11,107 --> 01:29:18,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.

1265
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:26,075
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever.

1266
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:30,177
[SPEAKER_08]: A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.

1267
01:29:31,258 --> 01:29:40,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.

1268
01:29:41,003 --> 01:29:51,950
[SPEAKER_08]: You also had the, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.

1269
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:56,531
[SPEAKER_08]: and all kinds of really, really good artists.

1270
01:29:57,432 --> 01:30:06,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.

1271
01:30:06,896 --> 01:30:14,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.

1272
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:16,419
[SPEAKER_08]: There were the...

1273
01:30:18,941 --> 01:30:25,365
[SPEAKER_08]: They put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.

1274
01:30:26,886 --> 01:30:35,553
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play it.

1275
01:30:36,053 --> 01:30:42,298
[SPEAKER_08]: There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller and it would not work.

1276
01:30:42,338 --> 01:30:43,238
[SPEAKER_08]: They wouldn't take my credit card.

1277
01:30:44,218 --> 01:30:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried.

1278
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan.

1279
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:47,902
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to ship it to me.

1280
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:48,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't work.

1281
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:50,905
[SPEAKER_08]: One time I got Dan to agree to this.

1282
01:30:50,925 --> 01:30:52,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was so pissed.

1283
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:56,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are aftermarket arcade-style controllers that you can get.

1284
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:58,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.

1285
01:31:01,054 --> 01:31:11,597
[SPEAKER_08]: For all the different music, we just heard some Eurobeat, we had different types of dance, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions, I'd like to say.

1286
01:31:12,577 --> 01:31:14,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Some rap songs in the earlier version too.

1287
01:31:17,078 --> 01:31:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced Dingle, I guess?

1288
01:31:22,259 --> 01:31:22,699
[SPEAKER_08]: 600 songs.

1289
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:23,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Dingle.

1290
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:23,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Dingle.

1291
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:28,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Dongle.

1292
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:32,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a 2DX19 Dongle edition.

1293
01:31:32,505 --> 01:31:32,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Awesome.

1294
01:31:33,186 --> 01:31:33,787
[SPEAKER_20]: I support that.

1295
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:37,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD.

1296
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit.

1297
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, hard drive.

1298
01:31:46,897 --> 01:31:56,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tran, who is the little alien chick with white hair.

1299
01:31:57,144 --> 01:32:07,752
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Yamato Tora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.

1300
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:10,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try saying that three times fast.

1301
01:32:10,874 --> 01:32:12,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just basically a lot of cool characters.

1302
01:32:12,915 --> 01:32:20,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like, who did the DJs.

1303
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:26,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Etiquette, Q-Jack, Mix, all of them.

1304
01:32:27,484 --> 01:32:30,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.

1305
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: uh in fact I've actually got a um issue of Cosmode that has it's all 2DX cosplay so uh Celica all of that so anyway there you go Beatmania 2DX if you don't know what it is after listening to this show climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears there it is uh my man I love you Taku

1306

[SPEAKER_20]: This song was so much fun to play.

1307
01:32:57,693 --> 01:33:00,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to have lots of Tran babies with you.

1308
01:33:01,135 --> 01:33:01,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1309
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:04,816
[SPEAKER_20]: A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Lingerie.

1310
01:33:04,856 --> 01:33:09,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Beatmania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.

1311
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:10,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kidding.

01:33:10,998 --> 01:33:11,758
[SPEAKER_20]: Dongle style.

1313
01:33:11,918 --> 01:33:12,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Dongle style.

[SPEAKER_20]: 2DX dongle style.

1315
01:33:14,799 --> 01:33:17,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, that does it for part A of our show.

1316
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,741
[SPEAKER_20]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1317
01:33:18,781 --> 01:33:20,321
[SPEAKER_20]: We have part B coming up.

1318
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:20,982
[SPEAKER_20]: And guess what?

1319
01:33:21,322 --> 01:33:21,842
[SPEAKER_20]: No news.

1320
01:33:22,342 --> 01:33:23,983
[SPEAKER_20]: Part B is all about you guys tonight.

1321
01:33:24,043 --> 01:33:27,945
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundry is with you guys.

1322
01:33:28,085 --> 01:33:28,785
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll friend your butt.

1323
01:33:28,905 --> 01:33:29,205
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course.

1324
01:33:31,386 --> 01:33:31,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1325
01:33:32,687 --> 01:33:35,268
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news.

1326
01:33:35,288 --> 01:33:36,908
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have some news standing by if we need to.

1327
01:33:37,068 --> 01:33:38,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, Loki, you'll just run through it quick.

1328
01:33:38,549 --> 01:33:39,309
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a last minute thing.

1329
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:44,211
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're hoping to get some calls here in Part B. But first, a break.

1330
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:44,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't go anywhere.

1331
01:33:44,972 --> 01:33:49,454
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got to save Part A, you know, in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.

1332
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:54,716
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th Style.

1333
01:33:59,286 --> 01:33:59,747
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1334
01:34:21,748 --> 01:34:23,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, this shit is old.

1335
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:27,192
[SPEAKER_20]: And it starts with a clip from episode number one.

1336
01:34:27,392 --> 01:34:34,597
[SPEAKER_20]: And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed in its entirety on this show.

1337
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:37,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yes, here we go.

1338
01:34:37,419 --> 01:34:38,260
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this.

1339
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:38,800
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate you.

1340
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:41,462
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1341
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:44,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we are live on our very first broadcast.

1342
01:34:44,324 --> 01:34:44,985
[SPEAKER_18]: How's it feel, Jamie?

1343
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like burning.

1344
01:34:48,276 --> 01:34:49,196
[SPEAKER_18]: My thoughts exactly.

1345
01:34:49,837 --> 01:34:52,118
[SPEAKER_18]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1346
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,581
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.

1347
01:34:56,681 --> 01:34:58,562
[SPEAKER_18]: So we thought we'd take the show a little early.

1348
01:34:59,002 --> 01:35:00,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's actually Wednesday night.

1349
01:35:00,383 --> 01:35:01,243
[SPEAKER_18]: We're at Golf Land.

1350
01:35:01,624 --> 01:35:02,744
[SPEAKER_18]: But we are taping live.

1351
01:35:02,824 --> 01:35:03,565
[SPEAKER_18]: No do-overs.

1352
01:35:04,105 --> 01:35:05,626
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like it was a live show.

1353
01:35:05,806 --> 01:35:06,507
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do we want to do?

1354
01:35:06,527 --> 01:35:07,927
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land?

1355
01:35:07,947 --> 01:35:10,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do anybody publicly.

1356
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:12,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding a bench of stuff.

1357
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:13,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to hold my wood?

1358
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for volunteering for that, Ted.

1359
01:35:16,681 --> 01:35:18,122
[SPEAKER_18]: We just got a funny... Hi.

1360
01:35:20,623 --> 01:35:21,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, we're doing a school project.

1361
01:35:23,045 --> 01:35:24,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1362
01:35:24,586 --> 01:35:25,466
[SPEAKER_18]: For Oakmont High.

1363
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:30,950
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we're doing an online radio program.

1364
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an internet radio show.

1365
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:34,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to say some words for our listeners?

1366
01:35:35,766 --> 01:35:42,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.

1367
01:35:43,732 --> 01:35:43,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

1368
01:35:43,892 --> 01:35:44,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just recording ourselves.

1369
01:35:45,113 --> 01:35:48,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddammit, Rob, these things burning a thousand degrees, I feel like burning heat.

1370
01:35:49,075 --> 01:35:51,197
[SPEAKER_18]: While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot.

1371
01:35:51,257 --> 01:35:52,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to do my next shot here.

1372
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:53,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Hot damn.

1373
01:35:53,158 --> 01:35:53,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Some hot damn.

1374
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:54,899
[SPEAKER_18]: So, cheers.

1375
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:56,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to toast Loki's water here.

1376
01:35:57,401 --> 01:35:58,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait.

1377
01:35:58,622 --> 01:35:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Walt Husson.

1378
01:36:05,504 --> 01:36:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.

1379
01:36:08,426 --> 01:36:08,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.

1380
01:36:09,547 --> 01:36:10,427
[SPEAKER_06]: He sounds like a woman.

1381
01:36:10,908 --> 01:36:11,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

1382
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

1383
01:36:16,051 --> 01:36:19,233
[SPEAKER_20]: It tastes like 20 Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.

1384
01:36:19,293 --> 01:36:20,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Cute.

1385
01:36:21,254 --> 01:36:22,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Contestants, here we go.

1386
01:36:22,775 --> 01:36:24,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Snub's got to catch up, and here's his answer.

1387
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:27,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1388
01:36:27,778 --> 01:36:31,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

1389
01:36:32,335 --> 01:36:32,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Good answer.

1390
01:36:34,116 --> 01:36:34,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1391
01:36:34,856 --> 01:36:39,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1392
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:40,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Her secret weapon was her.

1393
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Skyline says... Oh, he changed his answer.

1394
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:46,563
[SPEAKER_18]: I think his first answer was better.

1395
01:36:47,262 --> 01:36:52,383
[SPEAKER_18]: He said Orange Bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it.

1396
01:36:52,463 --> 01:36:54,164
[SPEAKER_18]: His new answer is Boomstick.

1397
01:36:55,924 --> 01:36:58,965
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have Remote, Collar, Exploder, Dealey, and Boomstick.

1398
01:36:59,905 --> 01:37:01,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?

1399
01:37:01,866 --> 01:37:02,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Bat.

1400
01:37:02,486 --> 01:37:03,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Bat!

1401
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:05,767
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew it, too.

1402
01:37:06,627 --> 01:37:09,267
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, you're already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it.

1403
01:37:10,108 --> 01:37:12,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.

1404
01:37:12,788 --> 01:37:15,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team, Magus and Angel.

1405
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:17,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Big Black Cock.

1406
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:18,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Her big black cock!

1407
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Dun dun dun!

1408
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:23,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, that's not a match.

1409
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,091
[SPEAKER_18]: But funny.

1410
01:37:24,731 --> 01:37:25,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Puppy.

1411
01:37:26,572 --> 01:37:27,432
[SPEAKER_18]: The ferret!

1412
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:28,572
[SPEAKER_18]: The ferret!

1413
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:30,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Good answer, but not a match.

1414
01:37:30,793 --> 01:37:35,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Loki.

1415
01:37:35,714 --> 01:37:40,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Her secret weapon was her... Iraqi?

1416
01:37:41,966 --> 01:37:43,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Suicide babies.

1417
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Iraqi suicide babies.

1418
01:37:46,309 --> 01:37:47,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, is this true?

1419
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:49,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I admit it.

1420
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:51,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been exporting them.

1421
01:37:51,253 --> 01:37:52,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep them in my trunk.

1422
01:37:55,296 --> 01:37:56,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, in your trunks.

1423
01:37:56,517 --> 01:37:57,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear God, what about the children?

1424
01:37:57,758 --> 01:37:59,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

1425
01:37:59,339 --> 01:38:01,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

1426
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked ass, kinda.

1427
01:38:03,862 --> 01:38:07,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

1428
01:38:08,906 --> 01:38:10,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Never rent whatever the hell that movie was.

1429
01:38:12,813 --> 01:38:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It was bad.

1430
01:38:16,009 --> 01:38:17,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Envy of the dot dot dot.

1431
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:20,579
[SPEAKER_36]: The film that we watched was called Envy.

1432
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:22,020
[SPEAKER_36]: Actually, it says Envy on the box.

1433
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,101
[SPEAKER_36]: It's actual full title is called Penis Envy.

1434
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:27,063
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a story about these two drifting chicks.

1435
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:28,304
[SPEAKER_36]: They're walking through the desert.

1436
01:38:28,764 --> 01:38:30,905
[SPEAKER_36]: They go to this bar and they get really drunk.

1437
01:38:30,965 --> 01:38:33,486
[SPEAKER_36]: And, I mean, this is talking about, like, white trash America.

1438
01:38:34,047 --> 01:38:35,828
[SPEAKER_36]: They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.

1439
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:39,250
[SPEAKER_36]: And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

1440
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:47,134
[SPEAKER_36]: And so they walk around and, lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen.

1441
01:38:47,774 --> 01:38:48,775
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, Loki?

1442
01:39:02,549 --> 01:39:03,550
[SPEAKER_36]: Was it Mr. Spanky?

1443
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:16,257
[SPEAKER_36]: And then they start, like, you know, screwing this one chick, and then this other thing, they screw this other guy, and then eventually they get tired of having a penis, and so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A.

1444
01:39:16,297 --> 01:39:25,943
[SPEAKER_36]: where she's at a gay bar, and then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis, but the one chick likes the penis so much, and then she ends up getting killed in the end.

1445
01:39:28,864 --> 01:39:30,045
[SPEAKER_18]: That was beautiful, thank you.

1446
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:32,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Xtifer, what were you doing on my computer last night?

1447
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:35,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.

1448
01:39:35,592 --> 01:39:38,312
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago.

1449
01:39:38,332 --> 01:39:41,613
[SPEAKER_20]: You remember how messy my desktop used to be, like it was just icons everywhere, right?

1450
01:39:41,854 --> 01:39:42,834
[SPEAKER_20]: And you couldn't even see my background.

1451
01:39:43,294 --> 01:39:44,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you have balls on it.

1452
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:47,195
[SPEAKER_20]: I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?

1453
01:39:47,615 --> 01:39:58,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, Xtifer went in, and last night, while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop, and now I have folders that say, Big Boobies Number One.

1454
01:39:59,306 --> 01:40:00,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Big Boobies No.

1455
01:40:00,727 --> 01:40:21,618
[SPEAKER_18]: 2, Big Boobies with Cocks in Them, Blood Spattered Boobies, Boobies and Sunflowers, Boobies for Milkin, Boobies in Pee, Mastectomy Leftover Boobies, Hot Hairy Saggy Man Boobies, and then my last, my favorite here, Women in Roller Skates Peeing in Glass Bowls.

1456
01:40:23,259 --> 01:40:24,180
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell?

1457
01:40:25,293 --> 01:40:26,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Why did you do that?

1458
01:40:26,374 --> 01:40:30,756
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not gonna, you know, if you're gonna download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.

1459
01:40:31,256 --> 01:40:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.

1460
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:39,240
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, um... Did they use something other than bleach?

1461
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

1462
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:42,422
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1463
01:40:43,222 --> 01:40:44,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, you know how you have, like...

1464
01:40:47,263 --> 01:40:56,805
[SPEAKER_22]: What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?

1465
01:40:56,825 --> 01:40:58,866
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm disgusted.

1466
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:01,086
[SPEAKER_33]: I am so disgusted.

1467
01:41:01,826 --> 01:41:04,007
[SPEAKER_33]: Girls, just want to have a... Alright, I'm coming out.

1468
01:41:04,127 --> 01:41:04,707
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm coming out.

01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:05,127
[SPEAKER_33]: Here it is.

1470
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:07,048
[SPEAKER_33]: Loki's singing, I'm coming out.

1471
01:41:08,968 --> 01:41:10,409
[SPEAKER_33]: At the county fair with Teninga.

1472
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:11,469
[SPEAKER_33]: Here we go.

1473
01:41:12,432 --> 01:41:14,534
[SPEAKER_33]: Remember, it goes, I'm coming out.

1474
01:41:14,734 --> 01:41:14,954
[SPEAKER_33]: You know?

1475
01:41:15,114 --> 01:41:15,614
[SPEAKER_33]: You know how it goes?

1476
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:16,555
[SPEAKER_33]: You know how this one goes?

1477
01:41:16,595 --> 01:41:18,336
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, here we go.

1478
01:41:18,436 --> 01:41:18,797
Stand in.

1479
01:41:19,177 --> 01:41:20,798
Stand in.

1485
01:43:30,126 --> 01:43:34,688
[SPEAKER_35]: That's pretty amazing, I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

1486
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:40,251
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh yeah, play that instrumental solo.

01:44:31,709 --> 01:44:33,150
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sick of this song.

1496
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:35,331
[SPEAKER_35]: You're gonna really die.

1497
01:44:37,452 --> 01:44:38,853
[SPEAKER_35]: God, this is long.

1498
01:44:39,433 --> 01:44:41,294
[SPEAKER_35]: It just doesn't fucking end.

1499
01:44:41,574 --> 01:44:43,715
[SPEAKER_35]: It just keeps on going on.

1500
01:44:46,356 --> 01:44:48,717
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.

1501
01:44:48,957 --> 01:44:50,018
[SPEAKER_35]: You're gonna so die.

1502
01:44:50,538 --> 01:44:51,579
[SPEAKER_35]: I know where you live.

1503
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:55,701
[SPEAKER_33]: As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

1504
01:44:59,055 --> 01:45:02,196
[SPEAKER_33]: A score of 6,964 points for Loki.

1505
01:45:02,276 --> 01:45:03,456
[SPEAKER_33]: Not even a gold record.

1506
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:05,597
[SPEAKER_33]: There is no justice in this world.

1507
01:45:05,677 --> 01:45:06,077
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

1508
01:45:07,397 --> 01:45:09,418
[SPEAKER_33]: Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.

1509
01:45:09,518 --> 01:45:11,578
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

1510
01:45:11,698 --> 01:45:13,359
[SPEAKER_13]: I laughed so hard my head scared.

1511
01:45:13,379 --> 01:45:15,179
[SPEAKER_33]: I laughed so hard I peed, okay?

1512
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:16,620
[SPEAKER_33]: I peed a little.

1513
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,500
[SPEAKER_33]: I peed a little bit.

1514
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't with my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight, huh Rob?

1515
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that hurt so bad.

1516
01:45:27,774 --> 01:45:28,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1517
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:34,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.

1518
01:45:34,944 --> 01:45:54,439
[SPEAKER_37]: I did want to play something, and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro, because I was actually trying to make a new intro, but then I didn't do that, and then I did something else, and it's cheesy, but it's funny, and it's fun with text-to-speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.

1519
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Here we go.

1520
01:46:02,867 --> 01:46:04,188
[SPEAKER_43]: Well this is a surprise.

1521
01:46:04,948 --> 01:46:09,872
[SPEAKER_43]: I figured after 10 years of constant testing you would quit, or even better, would be dead.

1522
01:46:10,752 --> 01:46:12,974
[SPEAKER_43]: I guess we should celebrate with some cake.

1523
01:46:13,914 --> 01:46:15,275
[SPEAKER_43]: It's right behind that door.

1524
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:17,116
[SPEAKER_43]: Why would I lie to you?

1525
01:46:21,539 --> 01:46:22,740
[SPEAKER_43]: Well here's a fun fact.

1526
01:46:23,501 --> 01:46:24,521
[SPEAKER_43]: Today is cake day.

1527
01:46:25,182 --> 01:46:26,823
[SPEAKER_43]: Do you know how they celebrate it?

1528
01:46:27,523 --> 01:46:29,965
[SPEAKER_43]: If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.

1529
01:46:42,662 --> 01:46:44,583
[SPEAKER_40]: This next test is very dangerous.

1530
01:46:44,983 --> 01:47:05,611
[SPEAKER_40]: To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death, Smooth Jazz will be deployed in 3... 2... 1... Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.

1531
01:47:26,417 --> 01:47:31,779
[SPEAKER_43]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio with your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

1532
01:47:33,759 --> 01:47:34,299
[SPEAKER_20]: That was cute.

1533
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:34,759
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that.

1534
01:47:34,799 --> 01:47:35,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Good job.

1535
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:36,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1536
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:36,660
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1537
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's get back into the show, guys.

1538
01:47:44,642 --> 01:47:45,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome back, everybody.

1539
01:47:49,844 --> 01:47:52,865
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.

1540
01:47:53,665 --> 01:47:54,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1541
01:47:56,263 --> 01:47:56,685
[SPEAKER_19]: You done.

1542
01:47:59,657 --> 01:47:59,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we go.

1543
01:48:06,832 --> 01:48:07,433
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio June 23, 2002

1544
01:48:31,098 --> 01:48:56,287
[SPEAKER_20]: Having live radio fail Mike sneezes And the games we don't love so much sometimes too Alright, anyhow Let's get into part B tonight And here's the thing We didn't really pull any stories for this Because we're going to open up the skyline here real soon We do want to do the mailbag first though We got some emails So while you load that though We do have the Fugle Question of the Week We still did that this week So I'm going to go ahead and load that up Here it is, the Fugle Question of the Week

1545
01:49:04,452 --> 01:49:08,254
[SPEAKER_20]: As a reminder, the Foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.

1546
01:49:08,354 --> 01:49:10,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Put them together and you get Foogle.

1547
01:49:10,955 --> 01:49:17,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+, it really should be like Gacebook or something.

1548
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:22,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Sadly, you're not a lot of Google users, but we do have some.

1549
01:49:22,881 --> 01:49:25,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+.

1550
01:49:26,183 --> 01:49:28,324
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did get some answers to our question of the week.

1551
01:49:28,364 --> 01:49:28,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Here it is.

1552
01:49:29,465 --> 01:49:31,026
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a little self-serving this week.

1553
01:49:31,946 --> 01:49:33,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Considering the occasion, deal with it.

1554
01:49:34,087 --> 01:49:41,351
[SPEAKER_20]: We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts or a friend told you about it.

1555
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:46,313
[SPEAKER_20]: What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?

1556
01:49:46,974 --> 01:49:49,075
[SPEAKER_20]: So going to Google+, here are the answers.

1557
01:49:50,075 --> 01:49:52,017
[SPEAKER_20]: We have 13xForever says, Oh, and Ferret.

1558
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:18,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization, or at least it looks like it.

1559
01:50:20,107 --> 01:50:22,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Tony M replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.

1560
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:33,920
[SPEAKER_20]: The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games, no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase... Oops.

1561
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:34,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, crap.

1562
01:50:34,941 --> 01:50:36,322
[SPEAKER_20]: I almost closed the window on accident.

1563
01:50:37,603 --> 01:50:38,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeez, Rob.

1564
01:50:38,643 --> 01:50:40,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Fail.

1565
01:50:41,084 --> 01:50:45,686
[SPEAKER_20]: It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.

1566
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:47,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Perfect.

1567
01:50:48,387 --> 01:50:52,289
[SPEAKER_20]: I can relate to you all better than them because you're real people who have to purchase your own games.

1568
01:50:52,649 --> 01:50:55,010
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.

1569
01:50:55,290 --> 01:51:02,793
[SPEAKER_20]: The show's coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.

1570
01:51:03,913 --> 01:51:04,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Technist says,

1571
01:51:30,018 --> 01:51:35,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news, but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.

1572
01:51:36,462 --> 01:51:42,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic, us fanboys?

1573
01:51:43,225 --> 01:51:43,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Never.

1574
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:47,468
[SPEAKER_20]: I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.

1575
01:51:47,828 --> 01:51:48,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Finally, I will end with this.

1576
01:51:49,048 --> 01:51:51,950
[SPEAKER_20]: OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.

1577
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:57,193
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think, I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.

1578
01:51:57,853 --> 01:51:58,493
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really nice.

1579
01:51:58,854 --> 01:51:59,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1580
01:52:00,235 --> 01:52:04,218
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.

1581
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:08,742
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, we got 20 answers.

1582
01:52:08,762 --> 01:52:09,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you think I can read them all?

1583
01:52:10,404 --> 01:52:11,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, go for it.

1584
01:52:11,645 --> 01:52:15,549
[SPEAKER_20]: This chick named Nelly replied and said, Spousal pressure.

1585
01:52:16,049 --> 01:52:17,731
[SPEAKER_20]: What's up with that?

1586
01:52:19,753 --> 01:52:20,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, Picaruno said...

1587
01:52:21,696 --> 01:52:29,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining, and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the hosts in such a familiar way is something you don't really get anywhere else.

1588
01:52:31,043 --> 01:52:38,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005, and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.

1589
01:52:38,389 --> 01:52:39,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Stay independent.

1590
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:42,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Ranma says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.

1591
01:52:42,312 --> 01:52:46,556
[SPEAKER_20]: I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.

1592
01:52:46,896 --> 01:52:48,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Who said we were good friends?

1593
01:52:48,417 --> 01:52:49,798
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1594
01:52:49,838 --> 01:52:50,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Girl.

1595
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,322
[SPEAKER_20]: RedTheHaze says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.

1596
01:52:56,303 --> 01:53:04,730
[SPEAKER_20]: A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006 when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.

1597
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:07,792
[SPEAKER_20]: It's okay to say all games interactive, by the way.

1598
01:53:07,812 --> 01:53:08,432
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a great show.

1599
01:53:08,512 --> 01:53:08,813
[SPEAKER_20]: It was.

1600
01:53:09,133 --> 01:53:10,494
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really a bummer it's not on anymore.

1601
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:17,666
[SPEAKER_20]: I then decided to check out the podcast and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast and just how really nice people y'all are.

1602
01:53:17,986 --> 01:53:21,968
[SPEAKER_20]: The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.

1603
01:53:22,308 --> 01:53:25,530
[SPEAKER_20]: More power to you guys and gals and may you have another 10 years of awesome.

1604
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:26,291
[SPEAKER_20]: P.S.

1605
01:53:27,463 --> 01:53:30,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.

1606
01:53:30,606 --> 01:53:32,628
[SPEAKER_20]: The Stupor Bowl?

1607
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head.

1608
01:53:37,092 --> 01:53:39,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the announcer voice says, blah, blah.

1609
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:41,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes me laugh.

1610
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:42,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1611
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:47,973
[SPEAKER_20]: Deakman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lounge Radio to go.

1612
01:53:48,013 --> 01:53:50,855
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.

1613
01:53:51,235 --> 01:53:54,958
[SPEAKER_20]: After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.

1614
01:53:55,879 --> 01:53:58,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Fabrice A says, the chemistry between three good friends.

1615
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:01,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.

1616
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:03,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for noticing that because we really do.

1617
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:07,607
[SPEAKER_20]: Terry J says, I've been listening since late 2005.

1618
01:54:08,207 --> 01:54:12,429
[SPEAKER_20]: I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.

1619
01:54:12,749 --> 01:54:15,950
[SPEAKER_20]: To put it simple, you guys know your shit and your presentation proves it.

1620
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:18,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.

1621
01:54:18,792 --> 01:54:20,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't tell Loki he knows this shit.

1622
01:54:20,172 --> 01:54:21,393
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll only increase his ego.

1623
01:54:21,833 --> 01:54:22,313
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just kidding.

1624
01:54:22,993 --> 01:54:23,914
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why my head hurts.

1625
01:54:24,294 --> 01:54:24,974
[SPEAKER_20]: It can't fit.

1626
01:54:25,374 --> 01:54:27,735
[SPEAKER_20]: Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy.

1627
01:54:29,456 --> 01:54:30,517
[SPEAKER_20]: is why he's listened twice.

1628
01:54:31,318 --> 01:54:36,302
[SPEAKER_20]: Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.

1629
01:54:36,642 --> 01:54:39,785
[SPEAKER_20]: I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.

1630
01:54:41,236 --> 01:54:44,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Benny L says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.

1631
01:54:44,737 --> 01:54:47,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.

1632
01:54:48,498 --> 01:54:50,039
[SPEAKER_20]: A local.

1633
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:53,800
[SPEAKER_20]: Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.

1634
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:56,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Dan M, don't inflate his ego again.

1635
01:54:56,661 --> 01:54:57,221
[SPEAKER_20]: What did I tell you?

1636
01:54:57,581 --> 01:55:00,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Dan M says, I kept listening because it was relatable.

1637
01:55:00,282 --> 01:55:03,063
[SPEAKER_20]: The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.

1638
01:55:03,383 --> 01:55:04,943
[SPEAKER_20]: I was also told there would be cake.

1639
01:55:06,804 --> 01:55:07,324
[SPEAKER_20]: We have cookies.

1640
01:55:07,504 --> 01:55:08,324
[SPEAKER_37]: It's behind the other door.

1641
01:55:09,185 --> 01:55:09,885
[SPEAKER_37]: It's cake day, you know.

1642
01:55:09,905 --> 01:55:10,185
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

1643
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I prefer pie.

1644
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:13,622
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a joke there.

1645
01:55:14,343 --> 01:55:23,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Clover N says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.

1646
01:55:24,669 --> 01:55:29,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.

1647
01:55:29,893 --> 01:55:35,917
[SPEAKER_20]: What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.

1648
01:55:36,317 --> 01:55:40,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.

1649
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:49,414
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.

1650
01:55:50,515 --> 01:55:53,059
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.

1651
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:55,323
[SPEAKER_20]: That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.

1652
01:55:57,265 --> 01:55:59,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.

1653
01:56:00,768 --> 01:56:06,834
[SPEAKER_20]: From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.

1654
01:56:07,054 --> 01:56:12,279
[SPEAKER_20]: 2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.

1655
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:13,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, he had a reputation?

1656
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:16,521
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.

1657
01:56:17,422 --> 01:56:20,603
[SPEAKER_20]: There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.

1658
01:56:20,683 --> 01:56:25,606
[SPEAKER_20]: I really enjoyed the segments such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.

1659
01:56:25,986 --> 01:56:28,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.

1660
01:56:28,547 --> 01:56:32,770
[SPEAKER_20]: This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.

1661
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:37,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Flo Walker, Mel B, says, I was down with OLR since day one.

1662
01:56:37,694 --> 01:56:44,520
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.

1663
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.

1664
01:56:48,363 --> 01:56:48,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that helps.

1665
01:56:49,284 --> 01:56:53,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.

1666
01:56:53,467 --> 01:56:53,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Still do.

1667
01:56:55,589 --> 01:57:00,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Mel B was one of the freestyle kings when the show first started.

1668
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:03,555
[SPEAKER_20]: He brought his cred to OLR very early on.

1669
01:57:03,575 --> 01:57:06,097
[SPEAKER_20]: They were on episode 6 or something like that, Mel and Mel.

1670
01:57:06,878 --> 01:57:09,600
[SPEAKER_20]: We're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.

1671
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,003
[SPEAKER_20]: I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.

1672
01:57:14,584 --> 01:57:16,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Just another good friend I made because of DDR.

1673
01:57:17,646 --> 01:57:18,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Believe it or not.

1674
01:57:19,814 --> 01:57:20,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1675
01:57:20,595 --> 01:57:21,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.

1676
01:57:22,416 --> 01:57:22,836
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

1677
01:57:22,936 --> 01:57:23,657
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a special show.

1678
01:57:23,697 --> 01:57:24,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm reading them all.

1679
01:57:24,377 --> 01:57:24,758
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care.

1680
01:57:25,718 --> 01:57:28,480
[SPEAKER_20]: Chiggers says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.

1681
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,462
[SPEAKER_20]: The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.

1682
01:57:31,842 --> 01:57:37,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Always a witty comment from DarkSakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.

1683
01:57:37,906 --> 01:57:39,547
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you guys so much.

1684
01:57:39,788 --> 01:57:41,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Add the extra O. So much.

1685
01:57:42,069 --> 01:57:47,292
[SPEAKER_20]: I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.

1686
01:57:47,592 --> 01:57:49,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Keep it up and here's to another 10 years.

1687
01:57:50,193 --> 01:57:51,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Dave Falcon says, I was in college.

1688
01:57:52,014 --> 01:57:55,415
[SPEAKER_20]: I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.

1689
01:57:55,856 --> 01:58:01,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints and cheats on the internet.

1690
01:58:02,179 --> 01:58:05,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?

1691
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,601
[SPEAKER_20]: OLR came up in the search.

1692
01:58:07,961 --> 01:58:08,842
[SPEAKER_20]: So I checked it out.

1693
01:58:09,182 --> 01:58:11,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

1694
01:58:11,943 --> 01:58:17,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Gee, however did discussion on the Sims trigger our show, DarkSakura?

1695
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:18,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1696
01:58:20,251 --> 01:58:22,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways.

1697
01:58:22,354 --> 01:58:22,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Hush.

1698
01:58:23,675 --> 01:58:25,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.

1699
01:58:25,577 --> 01:58:25,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Garrus.

1700
01:58:27,859 --> 01:58:28,139
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1701
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:29,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1702
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Oops, I lost my place here.

1703
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:32,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yes.

1704
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:35,321
[SPEAKER_20]: So I checked it out, listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

1705
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:36,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Fast forward to 2012.

1706
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:38,402
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm living in Washington, D.C.

1707
01:58:38,462 --> 01:58:42,223
[SPEAKER_20]: since 2007, working in social media and got engaged in December 2011.

1708
01:58:43,143 --> 01:58:43,523
[SPEAKER_20]: P.S.

1709
01:58:43,603 --> 01:58:45,443
[SPEAKER_20]: My fiance is a huge video game lover.

1710
01:58:46,124 --> 01:58:46,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you lucked out.

1711
01:58:49,045 --> 01:59:08,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw Sky's post on DDRfreak.com back when those forums were still popular I thought I'd check out the show and admittedly I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly Bomani to video games in general but it turned out to be a really entertaining show I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view which are all pretty different and unique I was hooked and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on

1712
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:09,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, last comment.

1713
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:09,540
[SPEAKER_20]: You ready?

1714
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Last one.

1715
01:59:11,521 --> 01:59:15,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Right says, The first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.

1716
01:59:16,243 --> 01:59:18,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.

1717
01:59:20,384 --> 01:59:29,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much, and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.

1718
01:59:30,428 --> 01:59:31,188
[SPEAKER_20]: Stay gold.

1719
01:59:32,881 --> 01:59:41,339
[SPEAKER_20]: great feedback guys thank you I apologize if you thought that went on a little long but you know what I really enjoyed reading all that stuff so I have fuzzies now thank you very much

1720
01:59:42,924 --> 01:59:43,204
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1721
01:59:43,524 --> 01:59:44,345
[SPEAKER_08]: They're kind of warm.

1722
01:59:44,865 --> 01:59:47,687
[SPEAKER_20]: AkumaJP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems.

1723
01:59:47,887 --> 01:59:48,968
[SPEAKER_20]: So he sent me a private message.

1724
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:49,608
[SPEAKER_20]: So why not?

1725
01:59:49,929 --> 01:59:50,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Why not?

1726
01:59:50,189 --> 01:59:50,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

1727
01:59:50,869 --> 01:59:58,914
[SPEAKER_20]: The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.

1728
02:00:00,055 --> 02:00:01,596
[SPEAKER_20]: That's pretty powerful, actually.

1729
02:00:01,876 --> 02:00:02,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1730
02:00:02,777 --> 02:00:06,839
[SPEAKER_20]: And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.

1731
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:12,001
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.

1732
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:16,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now, like, you're working in the game industry.

1733
02:00:16,182 --> 02:00:19,943
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.

1734
02:00:20,043 --> 02:00:26,525
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do Umlaut, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.

1735
02:00:26,545 --> 02:00:28,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to do the design for Umlaut last year.

1736
02:00:28,166 --> 02:00:28,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

1737
02:00:28,526 --> 02:00:29,986
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had a great experience through him.

1738
02:00:30,066 --> 02:00:32,687
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I have other friends that probably would appreciate it.

1739
02:00:32,707 --> 02:00:33,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't name them.

1740
02:00:33,627 --> 02:00:40,252
[SPEAKER_20]: but I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.

1741
02:00:40,352 --> 02:00:41,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Really appreciate it.

1742
02:00:43,634 --> 02:00:44,035
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1743
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,677
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.

1744
02:00:49,078 --> 02:00:49,979
[SPEAKER_20]: What do we do next?

1745
02:00:50,019 --> 02:00:50,700
[SPEAKER_20]: How about the mailbag?

1746
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:51,620
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the mailbag's up next.

1747
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that sound good?

1748
02:00:52,421 --> 02:00:52,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good lord.

1749
02:00:53,462 --> 02:00:53,722
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1750
02:00:53,782 --> 02:00:54,903
[SPEAKER_20]: So we got some emails tonight?

1751
02:00:55,503 --> 02:00:56,044
[SPEAKER_20]: A few.

1752
02:00:56,264 --> 02:00:56,824
[SPEAKER_20]: A few?

1753
02:00:57,084 --> 02:00:57,845
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to read them all.

1754
02:00:58,205 --> 02:00:58,525
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1755
02:00:58,766 --> 02:00:59,306
[SPEAKER_20]: I read them all.

1756
02:01:01,648 --> 02:01:01,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

1757
02:01:02,341 --> 02:01:05,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

1758
02:01:06,542 --> 02:01:10,304
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually from DarkTensia, but there's a lot of pictures.

1759
02:01:11,824 --> 02:01:18,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?

1760
02:01:18,806 --> 02:01:19,647
[SPEAKER_20]: I will see what I can do.

1761
02:01:20,287 --> 02:01:21,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, Joe.

1762
02:01:21,567 --> 02:01:22,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Joe.

1763
02:01:22,948 --> 02:01:25,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.

1764
02:01:26,289 --> 02:01:26,709
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

1765
02:01:27,649 --> 02:01:37,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio battle royale thing, which, interestingly enough, DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day.

1766
02:01:37,534 --> 02:01:38,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that the paper plate battle royale?

1767
02:01:39,955 --> 02:01:40,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, lord.

1768
02:01:40,895 --> 02:01:41,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember because I won.

1769
02:01:44,013 --> 02:01:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.

1770
02:01:45,434 --> 02:01:45,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey.

1771
02:01:46,634 --> 02:01:47,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Here, use this one.

1772
02:01:48,335 --> 02:01:49,255
[SPEAKER_16]: She's in chat right now.

1773
02:01:49,635 --> 02:01:49,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1774
02:01:49,915 --> 02:01:50,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1775
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:53,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, these will have to go on the forum.

1776
02:01:54,617 --> 02:01:55,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1777
02:01:55,997 --> 02:01:56,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so next up.

1778
02:01:57,178 --> 02:01:58,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's from Robert Kidman.

1779
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:00,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me some biscuits.

1780
02:02:07,789 --> 02:02:13,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for 10 wonderful years and your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.

1781
02:02:14,312 --> 02:02:27,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays, finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.

1782
02:02:27,979 --> 02:02:29,921
[SPEAKER_08]: If it weren't for OLR, there would be no Geek Life.

1783
02:02:30,101 --> 02:02:34,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiara and I wouldn't have met and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.

1784
02:02:35,767 --> 02:02:37,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Strange how these things happen.

1785
02:02:37,288 --> 02:02:43,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.

1786
02:02:44,194 --> 02:02:45,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, thank you.

1787
02:02:45,476 --> 02:02:46,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Long may it continue.

1788
02:02:46,637 --> 02:02:49,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.

1789
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:50,981
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Rob from Geek Life.

1790
02:02:52,915 --> 02:03:12,940
[SPEAKER_20]: by the way huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well and I love Geek Life I'm going to be doing a guest column for them Tiara received an opportunity and she didn't think of the other Rob she didn't think of Dan she didn't think of Jamie she thought of me and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed and I'm so excited

1791
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:18,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.

1792
02:03:19,233 --> 02:03:22,235
[SPEAKER_20]: I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.

1793
02:03:23,215 --> 02:03:23,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1794
02:03:24,016 --> 02:03:25,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I make this promise from here out.

1795
02:03:25,437 --> 02:03:30,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week because I still have to finish part two of Tabletop Gaming.

1796
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:31,480
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

1797
02:03:31,961 --> 02:03:32,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1798
02:03:32,381 --> 02:03:32,821
[SPEAKER_20]: Due Monday.

1799
02:03:34,162 --> 02:03:34,542
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding.

1800
02:03:34,722 --> 02:03:35,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesday.

1801
02:03:35,183 --> 02:03:36,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It's due before Wednesday, Rob.

1802
02:03:37,404 --> 02:03:38,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey OLR and OLR me.

1803
02:03:39,426 --> 02:03:45,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to give a shout out and congratulate you on 10 years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.

1804
02:03:45,651 --> 02:03:46,492
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite a feat.

1805
02:03:47,073 --> 02:03:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I first met Rob, it was New Year's 2008 slash 9.

1806
02:03:51,236 --> 02:03:54,059
[SPEAKER_08]: He was sick and quiet on the couch.

1807
02:03:54,099 --> 02:03:56,921
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to chatting and he mentioned he was a gamer, G-A-Y-M-E-R.

1808
02:03:57,902 --> 02:04:01,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew then he'd be a good friend and then he told me about his podcast.

1809
02:04:01,924 --> 02:04:03,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I figured, man, why not?

1810
02:04:03,125 --> 02:04:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll download it.

1811
02:04:03,765 --> 02:04:05,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.

1812
02:04:05,826 --> 02:04:10,929
[SPEAKER_08]: For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.

1813
02:04:11,449 --> 02:04:14,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.

1814
02:04:15,011 --> 02:04:17,152
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.

1815
02:04:18,093 --> 02:04:20,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.

1816
02:04:20,214 --> 02:04:25,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.

1817
02:04:26,818 --> 02:04:30,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen your last two to three studios and I know you're on a shoestring budget.

1818
02:04:30,882 --> 02:04:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So as DarkSakura is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

1819
02:04:38,551 --> 02:04:39,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, what?

1820
02:04:42,762 --> 02:04:45,825
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.

1821
02:04:45,885 --> 02:04:46,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me finish reading it, Rob.

1822
02:04:47,045 --> 02:04:47,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1823
02:04:47,626 --> 02:04:49,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So take note of the time and count them up.

1824
02:04:49,568 --> 02:04:52,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know what the total is and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.

1825
02:04:53,371 --> 02:04:54,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe in the work that you do.

1826
02:04:55,152 --> 02:04:55,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Please keep it up.

1827
02:04:55,973 --> 02:05:03,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.

1828
02:05:03,539 --> 02:05:07,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.

1829
02:05:08,022 --> 02:05:09,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft.

1830
02:05:10,064 --> 02:05:10,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt.

1831
02:05:10,925 --> 02:05:11,025
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

1832
02:05:11,105 --> 02:05:12,006
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are old as fuck.

1833
02:05:14,307 --> 02:05:20,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Did I just hear that somebody is donating $10 for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?

1834
02:05:22,794 --> 02:05:26,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Donate $10 to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

1835
02:05:26,477 --> 02:05:29,239
[SPEAKER_20]: Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?

1836
02:05:29,319 --> 02:05:29,839
[SPEAKER_08]: In the chat room?

1837
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:30,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1838
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:31,301
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people?

1839
02:05:31,521 --> 02:05:33,622
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 79 people in chat right now.

1840
02:05:33,842 --> 02:05:36,124
[SPEAKER_20]: And I got a print screen right there.

1841
02:05:36,304 --> 02:05:37,025
[SPEAKER_20]: 79 people in the chat room.

1842
02:05:39,488 --> 02:05:40,229
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you, Matt!

1843
02:06:00,091 --> 02:06:00,932
[SPEAKER_20]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1844
02:06:24,861 --> 02:06:27,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's super cool.

1845
02:06:28,124 --> 02:06:31,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.

1846
02:06:33,147 --> 02:06:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1847
02:06:33,568 --> 02:06:34,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's three bots, 76.

1848
02:06:34,609 --> 02:06:34,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1849
02:06:35,129 --> 02:06:34,849
76.

1850
02:06:35,769 --> 02:06:45,657
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is from... The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.

1851
02:06:46,298 --> 02:06:51,542
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a link on here about fall unlocking those Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.

1852
02:06:51,622 --> 02:06:54,464
[SPEAKER_37]: God, I hope so, because I'm not buying those things.

1853
02:06:56,500 --> 02:07:02,885
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.

1854
02:07:03,285 --> 02:07:07,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.

1855
02:07:07,968 --> 02:07:08,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember 1 vs. 100?

1856
02:07:09,289 --> 02:07:16,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes so they must have felt it was too much like money.

1857
02:07:17,015 --> 02:07:19,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.

1858
02:07:19,596 --> 02:07:24,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Strangely, we can have a skee-ball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.

1859
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:25,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's from blah blah blah blah blah.

1860
02:07:27,588 --> 02:07:28,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving forward.

1861
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:58,445
[SPEAKER_08]: um hey OLR hi it's the one and only Degenerate Johnny five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program it might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants my personal favorite was the one about the wee peripherals or as Loki put it $20 pieces of awkward shit Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with okay wow

1862
02:07:59,845 --> 02:08:21,071
[SPEAKER_08]: regardless of doing this show for 10 consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of with that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters myself included congratulations for reaching the 10 year mark here's to another 10 years of successful podcasting your faithful listener Degenerate Johnny

1863
02:08:21,471 --> 02:08:21,891
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

1864
02:08:22,552 --> 02:08:27,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.

1865
02:08:27,554 --> 02:08:29,675
[SPEAKER_08]: What selection would you suggest for a first comer?

1866
02:08:29,955 --> 02:08:32,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.

1867
02:08:32,796 --> 02:08:35,117
[SPEAKER_20]: You know who should be giving us money per each listener?

1868
02:08:35,157 --> 02:08:36,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinkberry!

1869
02:08:36,037 --> 02:08:36,818
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Pinkberry.

1870
02:08:39,219 --> 02:08:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: My personal favorite is the chocolate.

1871
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.

1872
02:08:44,361 --> 02:08:46,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.

1873
02:08:48,413 --> 02:08:50,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving forward, thank you, Johnny.

1874
02:08:51,295 --> 02:08:51,856

[SPEAKER_08]: Howdy, partner.

1877
02:08:55,739 --> 02:08:58,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say congrats on 10 years of doing the show.

1878
02:08:58,801 --> 02:09:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.

1879
02:09:06,747 --> 02:09:09,549
[SPEAKER_08]: You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.

1880
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:13,332
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and Gal to look up to.

1881

[SPEAKER_08]: Here is to 10 more years of OLR, Brad.

02:09:31,732 --> 02:09:43,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Dear OLR, I was hoping to write a long rambling email in honor of your 10th birthday on how this show has kept my attention for 7 years, longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.

1894
02:09:44,523 --> 02:09:47,265
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.

1895
02:09:48,446 --> 02:10:09,199
[SPEAKER_08]: use, use an honor I can recognize on how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out and overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show but unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the 20th anniversary instead cheers for everything Sky's Elliot B

1896
02:10:10,099 --> 02:10:37,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Elliot is from the UK he's one of the VOG contributors he is from the UK and thank you I'm just me and I like video games and I have a boyfriend it is what it is and I thank you guys for just you know not giving a shit which people shouldn't be happy that people are in love that's what it's all about and Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection

1897
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:40,962
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but all right.

1898
02:10:41,063 --> 02:10:42,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.

1899
02:10:42,845 --> 02:10:43,105
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1900
02:10:45,108 --> 02:10:45,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1901
02:10:46,249 --> 02:10:51,837
[SPEAKER_08]: This one has a title in Spanish, and he actually corrected me about El Telefonos en Fuego.

1902
02:10:51,877 --> 02:10:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not how it's actually supposed to be said, but I don't know anything about Spanish grammar, so my bad.

1903
02:10:57,983 --> 02:11:06,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo no se So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja Naranja, or is that it?

1904
02:11:07,106 --> 02:11:18,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's orange Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?

[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll see you next time.

02:11:51,311 --> 02:11:51,772
[SPEAKER_20]: So do we.

1908
02:11:53,554 --> 02:11:56,897
[SPEAKER_20]: I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.

1909
02:11:56,917 --> 02:11:57,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I got speakers.

1910
02:11:58,638 --> 02:11:59,019

[SPEAKER_20]: At least we got something.

1913
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:02,302
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't get a trophy, but we got speakers.

1914
02:12:02,322 --> 02:12:04,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I played bingo and won speakers.

1915
02:12:04,924 --> 02:12:05,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1916
02:12:23,533 --> 02:12:31,296
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff, but it also helps to show how great the community can be.

1917
02:12:31,456 --> 02:12:34,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Always supportive to the show in good times and especially bad times.

1918
02:12:36,098 --> 02:12:38,719
[SPEAKER_08]: You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.

1919
02:12:42,449 --> 02:12:44,089
[SPEAKER_08]: We have also learned a lot from you guys.

1920
02:12:44,229 --> 02:12:52,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong, and to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.

1921
02:12:53,193 --> 02:13:00,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad, to not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.

1922
02:13:01,257 --> 02:13:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1923
02:13:02,137 --> 02:13:11,484
[SPEAKER_08]: and Loki have taught us to question everything not to accept anything as it is and that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions

1924
02:13:14,952 --> 02:13:37,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I laughed love it you're an inspiration for all of us listening whether it's been 10 years 5 years or even just a few months we are forever grateful for making every week a blast you may not have many awards or recognition but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet you know the one award we have is sitting on my mantle and it's not moving it was a good award it was the first podcast award for gaming yeah

1925
02:13:39,352 --> 02:13:40,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats, Orange Zones Radio.

1926
02:13:40,533 --> 02:13:42,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats for 10 fabulous years.

1927
02:13:42,375 --> 02:13:49,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and well, anything that OLR has given me all these years.

1928
02:13:49,603 --> 02:13:54,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And while you may act like a 10-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person 100 years old.

1929
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:59,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of 100 years old, however.

1930
02:14:00,414 --> 02:14:04,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.

1931
02:14:04,858 --> 02:14:08,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's for another 10 whole years of Raises Glass Toast.

1932
02:14:08,781 --> 02:14:09,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of toast.

1933
02:14:11,384 --> 02:14:12,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of toast.

1934
02:14:13,626 --> 02:14:14,506
[SPEAKER_08]: French toast.

1935
02:14:15,247 --> 02:14:15,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1936
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:18,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I love French toast.

1937
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:19,991
[SPEAKER_17]: French toast is amazing.

1938
02:14:20,211 --> 02:14:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a place.

1939
02:14:21,252 --> 02:14:22,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm going on the food tangent.

1940
02:14:23,194 --> 02:14:24,635
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a place in Sacramento.

1941
02:14:24,655 --> 02:14:25,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1942
02:14:26,437 --> 02:14:26,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1943
02:14:28,596 --> 02:14:31,377
[SPEAKER_08]: that has French toast made out of challah.

1944
02:14:32,677 --> 02:14:33,238
[SPEAKER_17]: What's challah?

1945
02:14:33,898 --> 02:14:35,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Challah.

1946
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:44,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.

1947
02:14:45,262 --> 02:14:46,362
[SPEAKER_17]: That does sound delicious.

1948
02:14:46,542 --> 02:14:48,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes the best French toast.

1949
02:14:49,283 --> 02:14:50,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Challah French toast.

1950
02:14:51,224 --> 02:14:53,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.

1951
02:14:55,282 --> 02:14:59,665
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.

1952
02:14:59,745 --> 02:15:01,886
[SPEAKER_20]: And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.

1953
02:15:02,326 --> 02:15:05,988
[SPEAKER_20]: So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.

1954
02:15:06,448 --> 02:15:12,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, 10 more years, what do you say?

1955
02:15:13,112 --> 02:15:13,813
[SPEAKER_20]: To our 40s?

1956
02:15:13,913 --> 02:15:14,713
[SPEAKER_08]: To our 40s!

1957
02:15:15,754 --> 02:15:18,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying not to spill.

1958
02:15:19,176 --> 02:15:19,876
[SPEAKER_08]: We had clingies.

1959
02:15:20,557 --> 02:15:21,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Clingies.

1960
02:15:23,044 --> 02:15:24,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1961
02:15:24,945 --> 02:15:25,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, everyone get drunk.

1962
02:15:27,845 --> 02:15:28,846
[SPEAKER_08]: As I spill it on my shirt.

1963
02:15:28,866 --> 02:15:29,686
[SPEAKER_37]: That's some good wine.

1964
02:15:29,886 --> 02:15:31,686
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to get water intoxicated.

1965
02:15:32,287 --> 02:15:33,907
[SPEAKER_37]: It's making my headache feel a lot better.

1966
02:15:34,067 --> 02:15:34,427
[SPEAKER_20]: That's good.

1967
02:15:34,567 --> 02:15:37,008
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake.

1968
02:15:37,468 --> 02:15:42,729
[SPEAKER_37]: It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey, I'm going to do this real quick.

1969
02:15:42,769 --> 02:15:44,330
[SPEAKER_37]: And then my brain's like, no.

1970
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:47,451
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, I have a follow-up.

1971
02:15:49,711 --> 02:15:54,313
[SPEAKER_20]: I kind of didn't react because I kind of did this double take, like, what, what?

1972
02:15:54,373 --> 02:16:03,295
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm text messaging Grandpa right now, and I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said, it says this number, but it's 76 when you subtract the bots.

1973
02:16:03,775 --> 02:16:06,616
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, I won't hold you to that.

1974
02:16:06,676 --> 02:16:07,676
[SPEAKER_20]: You really don't have to.

1975
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:09,737
[SPEAKER_20]: He replied back, I'm of my word.

1976
02:16:09,757 --> 02:16:12,478
[SPEAKER_20]: $760 for VOG right there.

1977
02:16:12,558 --> 02:16:12,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweet.

1978
02:16:13,058 --> 02:16:13,438
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's...

1979
02:16:14,478 --> 02:16:16,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll throw in another 40 just to round it up to 80.

1980
02:16:16,661 --> 02:16:18,062
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell?

1981
02:16:19,143 --> 02:16:19,484
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1982
02:16:20,465 --> 02:16:20,765
[SPEAKER_20]: Really?

1983
02:16:20,945 --> 02:16:22,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1984
02:16:22,587 --> 02:16:25,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I like round numbers.

1985
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:26,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what, Rob?

1986
02:16:26,591 --> 02:16:26,811
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1987
02:16:27,532 --> 02:16:30,175
[SPEAKER_08]: What I will do, because you know I had that account open.

1988
02:16:31,376 --> 02:16:33,879
[SPEAKER_08]: How about we go take it and convert it to a business account?

1989
02:16:34,155 --> 02:16:35,055
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1990
02:16:53,783 --> 02:17:21,498
[SPEAKER_20]: BlackWolf and I have probably paid about that much out of pocket like I can't speak to what BlackWolf has spent but I know I've spent enough let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running and I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much if not about twice as much from his end of the things because he bought software and designs for the site so just to like get that money for the next year is a great great burden off our shoulders actually

1991
02:17:21,809 --> 02:17:29,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working on it.

1992
02:17:30,216 --> 02:17:35,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone who's been listening, too.

1993
02:17:35,261 --> 02:17:39,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But there'll be more coming up about the book because I'm designing it beginning to end.

1994
02:17:39,965 --> 02:17:40,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

1995
02:17:41,753 --> 02:17:44,175
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as people send me old logos.

1996
02:17:44,435 --> 02:17:48,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say how you don't make any money on the show.

1997
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:49,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.

1998
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:54,462
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would be nice.

1999
02:17:55,542 --> 02:17:57,424
[SPEAKER_20]: The money's gonna go right back into the show.

2000
02:17:57,564 --> 02:18:06,690
[SPEAKER_20]: I can tell you, I came this close, this close to dropping $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise for the show.

2001
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:11,313
[SPEAKER_20]: And the only, because I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like, oh my God,

2002
02:18:11,813 --> 02:18:13,955
[SPEAKER_20]: And don't forget my husband works at Radio Shack

2003
02:18:35,268 --> 02:19:01,708
[SPEAKER_20]: so all right um thank you guys so much we will have as soon as good wine as soon as Jamie has the account set up we will tell you guys how you can donate we have to we have to tread carefully here though because I'm really worried about tax stuff I don't know that stuff at all so I need tax help if anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us that's what I could really use well I mean I think it's actually and I'm not gonna say any more about this but maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license

2004
02:19:02,328 --> 02:19:02,829
[SPEAKER_20]: We had one.

2005
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:03,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We did.

2006
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:04,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we let it lapse.

2007
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:05,111
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2008
02:19:05,491 --> 02:19:07,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we won't talk about that on air.

2009
02:19:07,573 --> 02:19:07,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2010
02:19:08,734 --> 02:19:08,934
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2011
02:19:08,974 --> 02:19:10,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We have four emails left.

2012
02:19:10,335 --> 02:19:10,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2013
02:19:11,236 --> 02:19:15,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Orange Launch Radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday.

2014
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,842
[SPEAKER_08]: In an attempt to keep this email short and to the point, let me say thank you.

2015
02:19:19,302 --> 02:19:22,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I started listening to the podcast back on March... What?

2016
02:19:24,066 --> 02:19:24,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard snorting.

2017
02:19:24,947 --> 02:19:25,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Just chat.

2018
02:19:25,948 --> 02:19:26,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2019
02:19:26,768 --> 02:19:30,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I started listening to the podcast back in March 2010 after I bought my first iPod Touch.

2020
02:19:30,991 --> 02:19:31,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2021
02:19:32,011 --> 02:19:35,514
[SPEAKER_08]: From that point on, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki have become an important part of my life.

2022
02:19:36,134 --> 02:19:36,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we touch you?

2023
02:19:37,675 --> 02:19:38,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyway.

2024
02:19:40,757 --> 02:19:49,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life, and I fully agree with the listeners.

2025
02:19:49,339 --> 02:19:55,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Through bad relationships, major family issues, and a brief period of unemployment, OLR has been a constant positive in my life.

2026
02:19:55,982 --> 02:20:02,264
[SPEAKER_08]: With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room and fellow listeners have become my second family.

2027
02:20:03,124 --> 02:20:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, thank you, Orange Lounge Radio, for running strong for 10 years.

2028
02:20:06,827 --> 02:20:12,731
[SPEAKER_08]: You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak, and you have definitely been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.

2029
02:20:13,331 --> 02:20:19,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to be there, just like how OLR has been there for me.

2030
02:20:20,336 --> 02:20:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.

2031
02:20:23,979 --> 02:20:24,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday.

2032
02:20:24,619 --> 02:20:25,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's from Sherzo, a.k.a.

2033
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:26,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Gion.

2034
02:20:27,541 --> 02:20:30,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.

2035
02:20:31,864 --> 02:20:32,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling verklempt.

2036
02:20:33,747 --> 02:20:35,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a topic, talk amongst yourselves.

2037
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:36,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, no.

2038
02:20:37,892 --> 02:20:38,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2039
02:20:39,815 --> 02:20:40,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Three more to go.

2040
02:20:41,036 --> 02:20:41,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Holy moly.

2041
02:20:42,839 --> 02:20:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: To Rob, Loki, and DarkSakura.

2042
02:20:44,921 --> 02:20:51,246
[SPEAKER_08]: As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you have done over the past 10 years in an effort to entertain your listeners.

2043
02:20:51,927 --> 02:20:54,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.

2044
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:57,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, who cares?

2045
02:20:57,552 --> 02:20:58,272
[SPEAKER_20]: They sucked anyway.

2046
02:20:58,672 --> 02:20:59,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite me.

2047
02:20:59,793 --> 02:21:01,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, that was just on behalf of them.

2048
02:21:01,855 --> 02:21:03,135
[SPEAKER_08]: We had good years on Life 365.

2049
02:21:03,175 --> 02:21:04,156
[SPEAKER_08]: They took care of us for a little while.

2050
02:21:04,176 --> 02:21:04,716
[SPEAKER_20]: We did.

2051
02:21:04,776 --> 02:21:05,516
[SPEAKER_20]: We did.

2052
02:21:05,776 --> 02:21:06,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Betty was nice.

2053
02:21:07,137 --> 02:21:07,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Betty was nice.

2054
02:21:08,117 --> 02:21:13,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And then becoming a member of the All Games community and finally joining you on your very own network, VOG.

2055
02:21:13,839 --> 02:21:19,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I have met each of you at least once, although I'm fairly certain it is more than that, whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.

2056
02:21:21,221 --> 02:21:27,304
[SPEAKER_08]: The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meet up at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.

2057
02:21:27,665 --> 02:21:35,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed the whole group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.

2058
02:21:35,649 --> 02:21:41,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.

2059
02:21:42,573 --> 02:21:49,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.

2060
02:21:50,277 --> 02:21:53,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.

2061
02:21:53,798 --> 02:21:58,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations on this incredible milestone, and I look forward to seeing everyone again at future events.

2062
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's from Shadow Next Gen.

2063
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:01,360
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree.

2064
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:13,264
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a great memory, and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that, because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.

2065
02:22:16,649 --> 02:22:19,670
[SPEAKER_08]: This one isn't an anniversary memory, it's actually news.

2066
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:22,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, fair enough.

2067
02:22:23,251 --> 02:22:24,451
[SPEAKER_20]: There's gaming news this week?

2068
02:22:25,391 --> 02:22:37,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic, and this is Turrican, sorry, will be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra November 10th in Cologne, Germany.

2069
02:22:38,154 --> 02:22:38,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, guys.

2070
02:22:38,854 --> 02:22:39,614
[SPEAKER_08]: That comes from RDG.

2071
02:22:40,194 --> 02:22:42,135
[SPEAKER_37]: I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turricans.

2072
02:22:42,195 --> 02:22:43,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a link from Kickstarter.

2073
02:22:43,935 --> 02:22:46,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2074
02:22:46,436 --> 02:22:48,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude, we got another email in, too.

2075
02:22:49,777 --> 02:22:51,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?

2076
02:22:52,178 --> 02:22:53,879
[SPEAKER_08]: This one comes from Dan Shadow.

2077
02:22:54,599 --> 02:22:56,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations on 10 years, guys.

2078
02:22:56,239 --> 02:23:02,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two parts, and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.

2079
02:23:02,602 --> 02:23:04,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.

2080
02:23:04,922 --> 02:23:07,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Since this show, I lost my virginity.

2081
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Me too.

2082
02:23:10,725 --> 02:23:11,325
[SPEAKER_20]: No, just kidding.

2083
02:23:11,385 --> 02:23:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie, ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.

2084
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:18,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel old yet?

2085
02:23:18,751 --> 02:23:20,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Phoenix Force 5 for the win.

2086
02:23:21,253 --> 02:23:21,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, guys.

2087
02:23:21,973 --> 02:23:22,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Batman.

2088
02:23:23,454 --> 02:23:29,799
[SPEAKER_08]: That's... Okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.

2089
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:30,820
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, yeah.

2090
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:33,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.

2091
02:23:33,782 --> 02:23:37,365
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd talk like that, so he's Batman.

2092
02:23:39,019 --> 02:24:02,200
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I am Batman And then this one, okay Dear OLR, I love the podcast, however there is one thing I must say Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having at the moment Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite Okay

2093
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:05,662
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.

2094
02:24:06,003 --> 02:24:08,204
[SPEAKER_37]: We had pizza because we were playing Catan.

2095
02:24:08,224 --> 02:24:11,407
[SPEAKER_37]: What does that have to do with pizza?

2096
02:24:12,116 --> 02:24:14,538
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.

2097
02:24:14,558 --> 02:24:16,060
[SPEAKER_37]: I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.

2098
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:17,301
[SPEAKER_37]: Bacon and garlic pizza.

2099
02:24:17,821 --> 02:24:18,982
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually sounds pretty epic.

2100
02:24:21,204 --> 02:24:24,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have never had Pinkberry and hope to try it someday.

2101
02:24:24,307 --> 02:24:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: What flavor should I get?

2102
02:24:26,089 --> 02:24:26,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Chocolate?

2103
02:24:26,629 --> 02:24:26,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Strawberry?

2104
02:24:27,010 --> 02:24:33,896
[SPEAKER_20]: I seriously want Pinkberry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.

2105
02:24:34,196 --> 02:24:37,780
[SPEAKER_20]: I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.

2106
02:24:39,204 --> 02:24:43,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.

2107
02:24:44,149 --> 02:24:45,971
[SPEAKER_20]: I want blood orange lounge radio.

2108
02:24:46,792 --> 02:24:49,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:24:49,154 --> 02:24:51,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to Keep Up the Great Work, Randy.

[SPEAKER_08]: Randy Peters Are you feeling Randy?

2113
02:25:24,258 --> 02:25:25,619
[SPEAKER_37]: Starring Randy Peters.

2114
02:25:25,719 --> 02:25:26,380
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I could see that.

2115
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:28,982
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the best male porn name ever.

2116
02:25:29,122 --> 02:25:30,743
[SPEAKER_37]: It sounds like a British male porn name.

2117
02:25:32,484 --> 02:25:33,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Sir John Thomas.

2118
02:25:35,546 --> 02:25:37,668
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, is that it for emails?

2119
02:25:38,208 --> 02:25:38,689
[SPEAKER_20]: That is it.

2120
02:25:38,729 --> 02:25:39,349
[SPEAKER_20]: I closed it.

2121
02:25:39,469 --> 02:25:41,210
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what comes after the emails?

2122
02:25:42,131 --> 02:25:44,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Ten years of pent-up angst.

2123
02:25:56,317 --> 02:25:56,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your mama.

2124
02:26:00,498 --> 02:26:04,919
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to me, because I missed Girls Gone Wild today, and I was so excited about it.

2125
02:26:05,379 --> 02:26:07,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was like, I was dreaming about the show.

2126
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:09,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I texted Rob in my sleep.

2127
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:12,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

2128
02:26:12,541 --> 02:26:13,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And Garrus.

2129
02:26:14,421 --> 02:26:16,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I blame Garrus for this, too.

2130
02:26:17,162 --> 02:26:18,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And I blame Shane for me blaming Garrus.

2131
02:26:19,183 --> 02:26:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, fuck Mass Effect.

2132
02:26:22,344 --> 02:26:27,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played over, since yesterday, I've played 20-something hours of Mass Effect.

2133
02:26:28,287 --> 02:26:29,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not know what's wrong with me.

2134
02:26:30,588 --> 02:26:32,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I never even did that on WoW.

2135
02:26:33,089 --> 02:26:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy VI.

2136
02:26:40,052 --> 02:26:41,072
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was in high school.

2137
02:26:41,652 --> 02:26:42,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

2138
02:26:42,393 --> 02:26:42,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

2139
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:44,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

2140
02:26:45,254 --> 02:26:45,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

2141
02:26:45,594 --> 02:26:45,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

2142
02:26:46,414 --> 02:26:53,098
[SPEAKER_37]: I fuck you to my headache because I hate getting these... I think it's a sinus headache because, you know, it's been a little windy today.

2143
02:26:53,858 --> 02:27:00,902
[SPEAKER_37]: And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post, you know, a blog about this show having a 10 year anniversary.

2144
02:27:00,982 --> 02:27:03,723
[SPEAKER_37]: Because, you know, they can have wonderful, you know...

2145
02:27:04,944 --> 02:27:27,149
[SPEAKER_37]: topics like woman hit by ball sues little leaguer or work in progress zombie survival short story or you know hey is this person on the forum gay you know they can have those you know posts on there oh but I post about something and they're just like yeah no we need to remove that post that is kind of stupid

2146
02:27:27,819 --> 02:27:28,499
[SPEAKER_37]: Eh, whatever.

2147
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:29,340
[SPEAKER_37]: They're kids.

2148
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:32,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Why am I on a forum about... Fuck kids!

2149
02:27:32,501 --> 02:27:36,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Why am I on a modding forum with all fucking... Seriously, it's all kids.

2150
02:27:36,303 --> 02:27:37,044
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, not really.

2151
02:27:38,024 --> 02:27:41,126
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean... I'm not like that guy at Penn State.

2152
02:27:41,286 --> 02:27:48,170
[SPEAKER_37]: I talk to these people online, and then I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about modding and stuff, and they're like teenagers.

2153
02:27:48,330 --> 02:27:50,311
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I feel so old.

2154
02:27:50,331 --> 02:27:53,212
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm like, yeah, I'm like 30-something, and you're 16, 17?

2155
02:27:53,272 --> 02:27:54,012
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

2156
02:27:58,152 --> 02:28:00,475
[SPEAKER_20]: BlackWolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.

2157
02:28:00,555 --> 02:28:06,081
[SPEAKER_20]: We never made the front page, but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.

2158
02:28:06,421 --> 02:28:09,565
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably helped that we asked pretty please onto Facebook and so forth.

2159
02:28:09,645 --> 02:28:09,985
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyway.

2160
02:28:11,481 --> 02:28:16,426
[SPEAKER_20]: My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.

2161
02:28:17,987 --> 02:28:18,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving on.

2162
02:28:18,888 --> 02:28:20,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.

2163
02:28:20,370 --> 02:28:21,691
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff that I brought is wheat-free.

2164
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:25,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.

2165
02:28:25,935 --> 02:28:32,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Gamer Girl has this FU to, she has this, what is that, carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.

2166
02:28:33,862 --> 02:28:34,723
[SPEAKER_16]: So FU to that.

2167
02:28:38,198 --> 02:28:56,557
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today and he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza so F you to Loki Misty I will go ahead and second that F you to carpal tunnel I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist

2168
02:28:57,606 --> 02:29:01,131
[SPEAKER_46]: Other than that, yeah, again, not winning the lottery.

2169
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:07,880
[SPEAKER_46]: Because when I win the lottery, once I get all the tech shit dealt with, I will supply money for the fort.

2170
02:29:09,179 --> 02:29:09,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Awesome.

2171
02:29:09,679 --> 02:29:10,740
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to not having a fort.

2172
02:29:12,141 --> 02:29:13,401
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's what it comes down to.

2173
02:29:13,601 --> 02:29:14,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, you guys.

2174
02:29:14,902 --> 02:29:16,763
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, that does it for the FUs of the week.

2188
02:30:33,624 --> 02:30:37,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's not all I have to say, but that was the most important thing in the last five minutes, that's for sure.

2189
02:30:37,991 --> 02:30:41,116
[SPEAKER_20]: It's always important to turn to Loki and say, hey, buddy, F you.

2190
02:30:43,203 --> 02:30:43,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it is.

2191
02:30:43,883 --> 02:30:44,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it is.

2192
02:30:44,884 --> 02:30:45,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Time and time again.

2193
02:30:46,105 --> 02:30:55,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 2002.

2194
02:30:56,911 --> 02:30:59,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I was still in high school, so that puts it in 2003.

2195
02:30:59,613 --> 02:31:07,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember my group of friends that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani discussion that we all know and love.

2196
02:31:08,078 --> 02:31:11,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less than that.

2197
02:31:12,379 --> 02:31:13,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea why I just said that.

2198
02:31:13,901 --> 02:31:18,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.

2199
02:31:21,031 --> 02:31:21,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully, in a good way.

2200
02:31:22,793 --> 02:31:23,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, absolutely.

2201
02:31:23,815 --> 02:31:24,315

2203
02:31:30,572 --> 02:31:32,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.

2204
02:31:57,862 --> 02:31:58,482
[SPEAKER_20]: No shit No shit

2205
02:32:21,004 --> 02:32:30,793
[SPEAKER_10]: July, August, November, January, and then at the very least continuing perpetual August and January after that seems kind of definitive.

[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?

02:33:20,475 --> 02:33:22,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world.

2230
02:33:23,057 --> 02:33:23,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you guess them?

2231
02:33:24,357 --> 02:33:26,218
[SPEAKER_20]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2232
02:33:26,559 --> 02:33:27,819
[SPEAKER_20]: You're talking to me.

2233
02:33:30,721 --> 02:33:32,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about Mass Effect with me.

2234
02:33:33,583 --> 02:33:35,104
[SPEAKER_21]: None of those are the right answer.

2235
02:33:35,384 --> 02:33:36,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I am playing Mass Effect.

2236
02:33:37,005 --> 02:33:39,046
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.

2237
02:33:43,989 --> 02:33:46,952
[SPEAKER_21]: So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.

2238
02:33:47,072 --> 02:33:47,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2239
02:33:47,732 --> 02:33:49,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your paying attention.

2240
02:33:49,594 --> 02:33:49,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2241
02:33:50,935 --> 02:33:57,220
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wanted to say that for me, without this show, I never would have worked at Konami.

2242
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:58,941
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's a major thing for me.

2243
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:01,603
[SPEAKER_21]: So I have to thank the show for that.

2244
02:34:02,944 --> 02:34:04,926
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kind of sorry about that, too, at the same time.

2245
02:34:04,986 --> 02:34:06,327
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

2246
02:34:06,367 --> 02:34:07,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Nowadays, yeah.

2247
02:34:07,208 --> 02:34:09,069
[SPEAKER_20]: You had some great memories at Konami, though, right?

2248
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:09,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2249
02:34:09,890 --> 02:34:12,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.

2250
02:34:15,283 --> 02:34:18,744
[SPEAKER_20]: That was one of my best memories Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?

2251
02:34:19,565 --> 02:34:22,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?

2252
02:34:23,046 --> 02:34:29,569
[SPEAKER_20]: No What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR that you can talk about?

2253
02:34:30,771 --> 02:34:47,146
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR, but I would say one of the more scandalous things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one, we had no females work there anymore, so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.

2254
02:34:51,465 --> 02:34:56,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, he still had underwear on, but he decided that since there were no females, there was no reason for pants.

2255
02:34:56,467 --> 02:34:56,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Shane.

2256
02:34:56,907 --> 02:34:56,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

2257
02:34:57,648 --> 02:34:59,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week I went to work with no pants.

2258
02:35:00,789 --> 02:35:01,229
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that?

2259
02:35:01,550 --> 02:35:02,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week I went to work with no pants.

2260
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:03,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe you were wearing a skirt.

2261
02:35:04,511 --> 02:35:05,711
[SPEAKER_20]: This is true.

2262
02:35:05,731 --> 02:35:06,852
[SPEAKER_21]: He was not wearing a skirt.

2263
02:35:07,092 --> 02:35:09,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, let me... This is really important, Shane.

2264
02:35:09,313 --> 02:35:10,514
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the most important question.

2265
02:35:11,134 --> 02:35:13,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it boxers or briefs?

2266
02:35:13,055 --> 02:35:14,055
[SPEAKER_20]: It was boxers.

2267
02:35:14,215 --> 02:35:15,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, because boxers...

2268
02:35:15,876 --> 02:35:17,217
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of like swimwear.

2269
02:35:17,297 --> 02:35:18,237
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not that bad.

2270
02:35:18,657 --> 02:35:19,037
[SPEAKER_20]: That's exciting.

2271
02:35:19,057 --> 02:35:20,958
[SPEAKER_21]: But still going with no pants.

2272
02:35:21,218 --> 02:35:21,879
[SPEAKER_21]: That is true.

2273
02:35:21,979 --> 02:35:22,379
[SPEAKER_21]: That is true.

2274
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, boxer briefs are fairly exciting.

2275
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:26,020
[SPEAKER_20]: They're kind of in the middle.

2276
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:28,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Because then you get the grippy with the... All right, look.

2277
02:35:30,542 --> 02:35:32,283
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not what we're here to talk about tonight.

2278
02:35:32,323 --> 02:35:33,684
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what show you're listening to.

2279
02:35:33,704 --> 02:35:34,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I could wear lounge or radio.

2280
02:35:35,822 --> 02:35:37,663
[SPEAKER_20]: This sounds about par for the course.

2281
02:35:37,683 --> 02:35:39,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Not what you're talking about.

2282
02:35:39,784 --> 02:35:40,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And Garrus.

2283
02:35:41,004 --> 02:35:43,885
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a great story about Konami.

2284
02:35:43,925 --> 02:35:45,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the games were designed with no pants.

2285
02:35:46,846 --> 02:35:48,007
[SPEAKER_20]: You'd think they would have come out better.

2286
02:35:49,627 --> 02:35:50,027
[SPEAKER_20]: No, just kidding.

2287
02:35:50,047 --> 02:35:51,728
[SPEAKER_20]: The Ultramix games were the best in the series.

2288
02:35:51,768 --> 02:35:53,989
[SPEAKER_20]: You know I've always said that, and it's not just because you guys were working on them.

2289
02:35:54,349 --> 02:36:07,334
[SPEAKER_20]: Pantsless Rage But think about this you guys If it weren't for this show Then Shane would have ended up at Konami In a way, this show impacted the game we made this show about

2290
02:36:08,257 --> 02:36:08,657
[SPEAKER_21]: It's true.

2291
02:36:09,477 --> 02:36:15,920
[SPEAKER_21]: And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusive reveals because I was the one that brought those songs to you.

2292
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:16,520
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

2293
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:18,060
[SPEAKER_20]: You brought the first couple.

2294
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:22,262
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.

2295
02:36:22,362 --> 02:36:26,043
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately, we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.

2296
02:36:26,523 --> 02:36:27,724
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2297
02:36:47,216 --> 02:36:52,960
[SPEAKER_20]: His lack of impact, not being at Konami anymore, has greatly been felt.

2298
02:36:55,822 --> 02:36:56,463
[SPEAKER_21]: This is true.

2299
02:36:57,824 --> 02:37:02,447
[SPEAKER_08]: As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.

2300
02:37:03,928 --> 02:37:11,594
[SPEAKER_21]: That's true, but as I was, I think, talking to him one night about... I go back and look at my old stuff, and some of it's garbage.

2301
02:37:11,614 --> 02:37:11,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2302
02:37:13,926 --> 02:37:17,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Really, really, truly garbage, and I wish I could get a do-over.

2303
02:37:18,107 --> 02:37:26,989
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of funny, too, because you got me into Echo Image, which is one of my favorite bands ever now because of DDR.

2304
02:37:27,569 --> 02:37:31,570
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe I'm not supposed to say this, but oh shit, oh well, it's been seven years.

2305
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:34,911
[SPEAKER_20]: You told me about that song long before the game was out.

2306
02:37:35,411 --> 02:37:36,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it was amazing.

2307
02:37:36,511 --> 02:37:38,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And played the CD for me.

2308
02:37:38,772 --> 02:37:38,932
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

2309
02:37:39,332 --> 02:37:40,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

2310
02:37:57,358 --> 02:37:58,298
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right, it was.

2311
02:37:58,499 --> 02:38:05,241
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, so, God, I've probably known you at least nine years, because I remember you came to the show, like, during its first year and all that.

2312
02:38:05,301 --> 02:38:11,944
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yeah, you told me about Skulk and all that, and then we found the CD somewhere, and I fell in love with that CD.

2313
02:38:12,044 --> 02:38:16,246
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's one of my favorite bands ever now, even though they only ever did one stinking album.

2314
02:38:17,048 --> 02:38:19,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.

2315
02:38:20,789 --> 02:38:21,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is, you know, the same thing.

2316
02:38:21,969 --> 02:38:23,950
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just high.

2317
02:38:24,330 --> 02:38:27,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Shane, I gotta let you go to get more calls.

2318
02:38:27,171 --> 02:38:29,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you want to say, especially about us?

2319
02:38:30,132 --> 02:38:31,392
[SPEAKER_21]: No, why would I want to talk about you?

2320
02:38:31,732 --> 02:38:32,052
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2321
02:38:32,392 --> 02:38:33,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're awesome.

2322
02:38:33,573 --> 02:38:34,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of Garrus.

2323
02:38:35,393 --> 02:38:37,274
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it was but Garrus, not because of Garrus.

2324
02:38:37,374 --> 02:38:38,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is Garrus.

2325
02:38:38,874 --> 02:38:41,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Without us, Shane, you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.

2326
02:38:42,435 --> 02:38:43,096
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a lie.

2327
02:38:43,256 --> 02:38:44,056
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the reverse.

2328
02:38:46,030 --> 02:38:46,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, bye.

2329
02:38:47,111 --> 02:38:47,351
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

2330
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:07,310
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

2331
02:39:07,971 --> 02:39:11,252
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know why I'm hearing myself, but go ahead and say what you want to say.

2332
02:39:11,592 --> 02:39:12,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2333
02:39:12,312 --> 02:39:14,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to... Yeah.

2334
02:39:14,813 --> 02:39:21,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years while off and on, and I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.

2335
02:39:21,836 --> 02:39:22,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay.

2336
02:39:22,176 --> 02:39:23,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a second.

2337
02:39:25,131 --> 02:39:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

2338
02:39:27,572 --> 02:39:33,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to say that I enjoy listening to you guys.

2339
02:39:33,274 --> 02:39:48,961
[SPEAKER_07]: When I came back from Rhode Island and I was starting to get into Dance Dance Revolution, I found you guys on Live 365 and I started listening and I met a lot of good friends like Richie, which is...

2340
02:39:52,332 --> 02:39:53,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget his name on here.

2341
02:39:54,915 --> 02:39:58,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I've met Junami, and I just stayed for a long time.

2342
02:39:59,259 --> 02:40:06,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you guys weren't here, I wouldn't have started, had the inspiration to start Disingenious Radio, which is still going, by the way.

2343
02:40:07,307 --> 02:40:08,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations on that.

2344
02:40:08,948 --> 02:40:13,971
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually was... I mean, this is going to sound terrible, but I knew you guys had started the show, or the station.

2345
02:40:14,031 --> 02:40:22,755
[SPEAKER_20]: I knew it was kind of like a spin-off of what had been going on at OLR, but I actually thought it stopped during the time we were doing all games, but apparently it hadn't.

2346
02:40:22,915 --> 02:40:23,556
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still going.

2347
02:40:24,136 --> 02:40:25,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, we're still doing it.

2348
02:40:44,492 --> 02:40:50,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of like took over from there and created like a solid stream and everything.

2349
02:40:50,657 --> 02:40:56,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask him every now and then if I can start my own stream, you know, stream on the station.

2350
02:40:56,802 --> 02:41:02,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And he lets me every now and then, but I haven't gotten in contact with him for like a few months, but I do.

2351
02:41:02,927 --> 02:41:29,728
[SPEAKER_20]: I think one of the best comments we ever get on the show about doing the show is that you know you guys because of you guys I kind of figured out how to do my own podcast or I learned that any idiot can podcast because you guys do it so I started my own show and believe it or not that's actually like you know what they say imitation is the finest form or is the finest form of flattery not to say that everybody's copying us because I don't think they are but just the fact that we're empowering people to let their own voices be heard

2352
02:41:30,448 --> 02:41:32,329
[SPEAKER_20]: means a lot, and it's a great compliment.

2353
02:41:32,369 --> 02:41:32,849
[SPEAKER_20]: It really is.

2354
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:33,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2355
02:41:35,410 --> 02:41:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being around.

2356
02:41:36,691 --> 02:41:41,733
[SPEAKER_07]: If you weren't around, I would never have any friends from the DDR universe.

2357
02:41:41,773 --> 02:41:44,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been friends with Junami for over seven years.

2358
02:41:44,815 --> 02:41:45,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2359
02:41:45,715 --> 02:41:49,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, congrats, and thank you for listening and being here with the show.

2360
02:41:49,677 --> 02:41:51,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have anything else you want to share tonight?

2361
02:41:51,946 --> 02:41:53,648
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you guys!

2362
02:41:54,089 --> 02:41:55,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Heart, heart, heart, heart.

2363
02:41:55,450 --> 02:41:56,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on, hold on.

2364
02:41:56,191 --> 02:41:57,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody else wants to send kisses.

2365
02:41:57,593 --> 02:41:58,033
[SPEAKER_20]: Here he is.

2366
02:41:59,795 --> 02:42:00,256
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

2367
02:42:01,998 --> 02:42:02,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

2368
02:42:02,518 --> 02:42:03,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a great night, Uni.

2369
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:04,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2370
02:42:04,641 --> 02:42:04,981
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

2371
02:42:07,124 --> 02:42:08,185
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even have to give the number.

2372
02:42:08,245 --> 02:42:09,246
[SPEAKER_20]: The calls just keep coming in.

2373
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:10,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2374
02:42:10,247 --> 02:42:10,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

2375
02:42:11,772 --> 02:42:15,474
[SPEAKER_30]: I was trying to do the math on how long I've been actually listening and I came up with

2376
02:42:43,103 --> 02:42:44,884
[SPEAKER_30]: 2004, I started listening to the show.

2377
02:42:45,465 --> 02:42:46,625
[SPEAKER_30]: Wow, that was a long time ago.

2378
02:42:46,926 --> 02:42:47,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for the holiday news.

2379
02:42:47,826 --> 02:42:53,729
[SPEAKER_30]: And you know, the funny thing is, I didn't start listening to it all at first.

2380
02:42:54,190 --> 02:43:01,754
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I told you this guy several times, that I started listening to a show that you would have on Wednesday nights on Life's 365, Outside the Box.

2381
02:43:07,412 --> 02:43:12,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is kind of the prerequisite to the video game show that this became.

2382
02:43:29,993 --> 02:43:31,094
[SPEAKER_20]: In a way, yeah.

2383
02:43:31,214 --> 02:43:34,456
[SPEAKER_20]: I never really thought about it that way, which I know sounds weird, but you're right.

2384
02:43:34,596 --> 02:43:39,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, we kind of started doing the general gaming chat there.

2385
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:44,883
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I kind of always had the fire in me to do, like, a general gaming show.

2386
02:43:45,103 --> 02:43:49,025
[SPEAKER_20]: And, like, I think maybe subconsciously I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.

2387
02:43:49,446 --> 02:43:51,147
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why we had Outside the Box.

2388
02:43:51,927 --> 02:43:57,251
[SPEAKER_30]: I think, you know, back then it was you, DDR Angel, and Wanky Style.

2389
02:43:57,991 --> 02:43:58,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2390
02:43:58,351 --> 02:43:59,032
[SPEAKER_30]: Kind of thing.

2391
02:43:59,112 --> 02:43:59,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2392
02:44:01,575 --> 02:44:02,556
[SPEAKER_30]: That's when I started listening.

2393
02:44:02,636 --> 02:44:17,112
[SPEAKER_30]: I was originally introduced to the show by Sephora 1216, who caught on to it from DDR Freak rebroadcasting the show.

2394
02:44:18,374 --> 02:44:26,100
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh yeah, DDR4 Yeah, they rebroadcast us And then I caught on to the other shows With that So

2395
02:44:39,514 --> 02:44:40,756
[SPEAKER_24]: It is Wednesday night.

2396
02:44:41,176 --> 02:44:46,082
[SPEAKER_24]: You are tuned in to Outside the Box, live on Orange Lounge Radio.

2397
02:44:46,523 --> 02:44:55,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Outside the Box is a show dedicated to video game news, reviews, and all the other randomness you might discover outside the box.

2398
02:44:55,994 --> 02:45:06,724
[SPEAKER_24]: To interact live with our show, check out our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com Check out the chat room and interact with us links.

2399
02:45:07,225 --> 02:45:12,249
[SPEAKER_24]: And now, here are your hosts, Sky, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style.

2400
02:45:13,809 --> 02:45:19,934
[SPEAKER_37]: I remember one of the ones, because I used to play Final Fantasy XI right next to you guys when you were doing that.

2401
02:45:20,134 --> 02:45:21,775
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2402
02:45:21,955 --> 02:45:27,019
[SPEAKER_37]: And it was Final Fantasy VII where you guys were playing One Winged Angel or whatever.

2403
02:45:27,499 --> 02:45:28,560
[SPEAKER_37]: Murder!

2404
02:45:31,422 --> 02:45:33,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that was a good murder.

2405
02:45:33,624 --> 02:45:34,845
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, you bring up a good point.

2406
02:45:34,945 --> 02:45:36,166
[SPEAKER_20]: That really was.

2407
02:45:37,026 --> 02:45:39,088
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, especially as you listen to the intro.

2408
02:45:39,248 --> 02:45:42,911
[SPEAKER_20]: It's about video games and all the randomness outside the box.

2409
02:45:43,351 --> 02:45:45,432
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of this fucking show now.

2410
02:45:46,472 --> 02:45:46,732
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2411
02:45:47,113 --> 02:45:49,113
[SPEAKER_20]: So, in a way, Outside the Box took over.

2412
02:45:49,614 --> 02:45:50,594
[SPEAKER_20]: You make a damn good point.

2413
02:45:51,534 --> 02:45:51,795
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

2414
02:45:52,495 --> 02:45:57,717
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, most of all, you know, all of that has always been about the community, the fans and everything.

2415
02:45:57,797 --> 02:46:03,019
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think over the past 10 years, we've kind of grown to a really nice community.

2416
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:07,441
[SPEAKER_30]: We've gotten friends involved in the show.

2417
02:46:07,541 --> 02:46:11,703
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, I've got high... I've told a couple people, and now you guys...

2418
02:46:12,591 --> 02:46:17,655
[SPEAKER_30]: with Wally R. You guys are going to have a dream game about you guys coming out.

2419
02:46:17,775 --> 02:46:22,559
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know, Rob always says, you know, tell a friend.

2420
02:46:22,959 --> 02:46:23,460
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's true.

2421
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:28,384
[SPEAKER_30]: You tell a friend and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.

2422
02:46:28,704 --> 02:46:29,204
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

2423
02:46:29,304 --> 02:46:32,667
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it funds my future trips to New York, which I'm trying to get back to.

2424
02:46:32,747 --> 02:46:35,509
[SPEAKER_20]: But $800 will go a long way and get me back to New York.

2425
02:46:35,549 --> 02:46:36,250
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

2426
02:46:36,290 --> 02:46:36,670
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding.

2427
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:36,971
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding.

2428
02:46:37,291 --> 02:46:40,113
[SPEAKER_20]: But I will be trying to get back to New York with my own money very soon.

2429
02:46:40,193 --> 02:46:40,954
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would be awesome.

2430
02:46:42,043 --> 02:47:02,767
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations and next time I see any of you guys I buy you a beer or probably in your case Red Mango or Pinkberry I'll take free beer and free yogurt and I will always exchange holiday cards with you

2431
02:47:04,042 --> 02:47:04,522
[SPEAKER_30]: That's true.

2432
02:47:04,802 --> 02:47:05,263
[SPEAKER_30]: That's true.

2433
02:47:05,703 --> 02:47:05,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

2434
02:47:06,203 --> 02:47:06,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

2435
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:43,595
[SPEAKER_20]: I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show and I see YYR's in chat so he can confirm or deny this YYR of course is making the first OLR dream game a reality Bunget Ferret Tossing which I guess he's in like push push push mode with it right now and it sounds like it's gonna be a big game like it's gonna be one that people are talking about outside this show that is awesome it's gonna be awesome

2436
02:47:44,235 --> 02:47:46,777
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to do all we can to make Bungie Ferret Tossing a success.

2437
02:47:47,998 --> 02:47:48,379
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2438
02:47:48,519 --> 02:47:53,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have to thank SSJ100Matt for having a hand in helping me with my conversion.

2439
02:47:54,544 --> 02:47:55,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's true.

2440
02:47:56,826 --> 02:47:57,286
[SPEAKER_20]: There we go.

2441
02:47:57,526 --> 02:48:00,369
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the big thing you went through personally on this show.

2442
02:48:01,130 --> 02:48:02,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I did get married.

2443
02:48:02,711 --> 02:48:03,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, there's that too.

2444
02:48:04,552 --> 02:48:05,433
[SPEAKER_20]: Eh, that's no big deal.

2445
02:48:05,593 --> 02:48:06,054
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just kidding.

2446
02:48:08,357 --> 02:48:10,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, um... I mean, I got married too.

2447
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:12,281
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not making a big deal out of it.

2448
02:48:12,481 --> 02:48:15,184
[SPEAKER_20]: I got... I had like four boyfriends.

2449
02:48:15,244 --> 02:48:19,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's... But this one's the best one, obviously.

2450
02:48:20,329 --> 02:48:20,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

2451
02:48:21,430 --> 02:48:21,710
[SPEAKER_20]: Me too.

2452
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:22,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's move on.

2453
02:48:23,492 --> 02:48:24,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2454
02:48:24,553 --> 02:48:24,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

2455
02:48:26,795 --> 02:48:27,095
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello?

2456
02:48:27,456 --> 02:48:28,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2457
02:48:28,997 --> 02:48:29,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

2458
02:48:29,758 --> 02:48:29,798
Hi.

2459
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:31,600
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Rama from Indonesia.

2460
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:34,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Whoa, we got a call from Indonesia tonight?

2461
02:48:35,822 --> 02:48:36,062
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2462
02:48:36,803 --> 02:48:38,384
[SPEAKER_20]: I recognize your name from Twitter.

2463
02:48:38,684 --> 02:48:40,445
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy you're listening live.

2464
02:48:40,525 --> 02:48:41,225
[SPEAKER_20]: What's up, buddy?

2465
02:48:42,526 --> 02:48:43,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's fun.

2466
02:48:43,947 --> 02:48:50,151
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to talk to you finally because I've been here since 2006, I guess.

2467
02:48:51,131 --> 02:48:52,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my gosh.

2468
02:48:52,352 --> 02:48:54,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

2469
02:48:55,354 --> 02:48:59,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I just want to say that maybe I'm the father's caller.

2470
02:49:01,211 --> 02:49:04,055
[SPEAKER_15]: I did enjoy everything.

2471
02:49:04,215 --> 02:49:07,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I'm a blind person, I can enjoy everything that you've done.

2472
02:49:08,381 --> 02:49:09,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially Loki and

2473
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:12,621
[SPEAKER_15]: All of that kind of jokes.

2474
02:49:12,962 --> 02:49:13,482
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice.

2475
02:49:14,303 --> 02:49:18,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, because of the distance, you're breaking up really bad, and we're having a hard time hearing you.

2476
02:49:18,826 --> 02:49:24,730
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think I heard something about, and I know this is true about you from Twitter and everything, that you are a blind gamer.

2477
02:49:24,890 --> 02:49:26,851
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know what's funny is that we've had a couple.

2478
02:49:26,871 --> 02:49:28,932
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not the only one, which is funny.

2479
02:49:28,972 --> 02:49:33,235
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had a couple blind gamers that I've heard from from Twitter, and we've gotten emails as well.

2480
02:49:33,776 --> 02:49:34,997
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really...

2481
02:49:36,457 --> 02:49:45,061
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really humbling in a way because sometimes we take things for granted, like sight, that not everybody has.

2482
02:49:45,742 --> 02:49:53,425
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm so happy that we get to kind of deliver something that you don't need that for to be able to participate in this program.

2483
02:49:55,206 --> 02:49:55,627
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a...

2484
02:49:57,007 --> 02:50:01,229
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a really humbling how big am I in this universe type of feeling.

2485
02:50:01,289 --> 02:50:03,731
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't explain it, but it's amazing.

2486
02:50:03,991 --> 02:50:06,892
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you for that and for sharing that with us.

2487
02:50:08,153 --> 02:50:08,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

2488
02:50:08,713 --> 02:50:12,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Just would like to say happy birthday and enjoy the life.

2489
02:50:13,315 --> 02:50:13,675
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2490
02:50:13,735 --> 02:50:14,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2491
02:50:14,416 --> 02:50:15,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

2492
02:50:15,316 --> 02:50:15,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, my gosh.

2493
02:50:16,377 --> 02:50:20,439
[SPEAKER_20]: And please keep sending us more videos of you playing Chrono Trigger songs because that was great.

2494
02:50:20,599 --> 02:50:21,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

2495
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:21,559
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2496
02:50:21,879 --> 02:50:22,560
[SPEAKER_20]: Take care, buddy.

2497
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:22,880
[SPEAKER_20]: See you, guys.

2498
02:50:24,346 --> 02:50:26,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Give everyone in Indonesia hugs for us.

2499
02:50:26,387 --> 02:50:27,008
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole country.

2500
02:50:27,808 --> 02:50:28,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Get started.

2501
02:50:29,109 --> 02:50:30,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what time is it over there right now?

2502
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:31,010
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I'd like to know.

2503
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:32,151
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we got another call coming in.

2504
02:50:32,411 --> 02:50:33,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2505
02:50:33,271 --> 02:50:33,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

2506
02:50:35,032 --> 02:50:35,393
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello, guys.

2507
02:50:35,413 --> 02:50:35,833
[SPEAKER_34]: Can you hear me?

2508
02:50:36,253 --> 02:50:37,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, we can hear you.

2509
02:50:37,194 --> 02:50:37,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, who's this?

2510
02:50:38,615 --> 02:50:40,316
[SPEAKER_34]: Wow, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2511
02:50:40,516 --> 02:50:41,877
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Dollar Bill.

2512
02:50:42,217 --> 02:50:43,137
[SPEAKER_20]: What is up, buddy?

2513
02:50:43,377 --> 02:50:45,579
[SPEAKER_34]: Hey, not much.

2514
02:50:45,999 --> 02:50:53,904
[SPEAKER_34]: Just first off, I want to wish you guys a happy 10-year anniversary since you're one of the few podcasts I know has been around for 10 years.

2515
02:50:54,881 --> 02:51:00,024
[SPEAKER_20]: We are finally snatching the crown of we are the longest running video game podcast on the internet.

2516
02:51:00,064 --> 02:51:08,048
[SPEAKER_20]: We've done some heavy research and we don't think anybody has been around right now anyway as long as we have.

2517
02:51:09,068 --> 02:51:14,751
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's a nice feather to put in our hat but what we don't want to do is we don't want to be all like

2518
02:51:15,331 --> 02:51:20,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we're the best because we've been around that long because that's not the impression we want to give.

2519
02:51:20,393 --> 02:51:23,254
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of great, great shows out there.

2520
02:51:23,615 --> 02:51:27,816
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, just the other day I was kind of talking on Twitter with Video Game Outsiders.

2521
02:51:27,836 --> 02:51:29,397
[SPEAKER_20]: I brought them up on the show plenty of times.

2522
02:51:29,497 --> 02:51:30,437
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they're a great show.

2523
02:51:30,738 --> 02:51:41,382
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a very similar chemistry to what we have here except they kind of like whereas our foundation is DDR, they were an adult gaming community that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter games.

2524
02:51:41,402 --> 02:51:43,423
[SPEAKER_20]: So obviously a very different type of thing.

2525
02:51:43,803 --> 02:52:12,002
[SPEAKER_20]: But they were talking about like, wow, we've been around for seven years But I guess they had to correct somebody like, oh yeah, OLR's been around longer But I'm like, dude, don't sell yourself short What you guys have accomplished in seven years is amazing Most shows don't get to six months or one year True And, you know, to have your own community and all that It's just, it's an amazing feeling, it really is So, anyway That's exactly the reason why I try to listen to you guys as much as I can

2526
02:52:12,574 --> 02:52:16,076
[SPEAKER_34]: because it's mostly the community that actually has me hooked on it.

2527
02:52:16,557 --> 02:52:22,440
[SPEAKER_34]: I've met a lot of great people on there, some in real life and some I wish I could meet in real life one day.

2528
02:52:22,841 --> 02:52:27,884
[SPEAKER_34]: You know, I've met some, I know I knew DJ Ranma from a while back from some of the conventions.

2529
02:52:28,504 --> 02:52:33,427
[SPEAKER_34]: I finally got to meet, you know, I actually got to hang out with Misty a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic.

2530
02:52:35,089 --> 02:52:41,933
[SPEAKER_34]: I got to meet some of the other people like the Effective Candy way back in the day and Gamer Girl is one of my closest friends now and

2531
02:52:42,679 --> 02:52:43,359
[SPEAKER_34]: and even Jamie.

2532
02:52:43,419 --> 02:52:48,461
[SPEAKER_34]: As much as I don't talk to her, I still consider her really cool and one of the people I admire the most.

2533
02:52:49,501 --> 02:52:49,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Aww.

2534
02:52:51,381 --> 02:52:52,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm gonna cry.

2535
02:52:52,482 --> 02:52:55,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh-oh, someone's chopping onions in the OLR studios.

2536
02:52:55,863 --> 02:52:56,543
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, shut up.

2537
02:52:56,683 --> 02:52:58,063
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, just wait till October, dude.

2538
02:52:58,724 --> 02:52:59,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, what's in October?

2539
02:53:01,756 --> 02:53:04,077
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh yeah, there's a train gathering.

2540
02:53:04,437 --> 02:53:06,538
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm hanging out with Misty for that one in Philly.

2541
02:53:06,999 --> 02:53:07,899
[SPEAKER_20]: That's awesome.

2542
02:53:07,939 --> 02:53:12,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to know that this show made people want to hang out is so cool.

2543
02:53:13,822 --> 02:53:20,465
[SPEAKER_20]: We really need to make an effort to get to more conventions and do these, especially PAX, because that's one that all the fans want to get to.

2544
02:53:20,845 --> 02:53:27,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And just try to get people together and just like, hey, let's go do what this show was.

2545
02:53:28,089 --> 02:53:28,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Think about it.

2546
02:53:28,910 --> 02:53:33,032
[SPEAKER_20]: This show is because we used to go to the arcades and play video games and talk shit.

2547
02:53:33,473 --> 02:53:36,575
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's get together, IRL, play video games and talk shit.

2548
02:53:37,976 --> 02:53:38,696
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2549
02:53:39,857 --> 02:53:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, did you see that guy Rob holding onto the bar?

2550
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:53,627
[SPEAKER_37]: What you did this week, I forgot, I mentioned, well, I didn't play it, but I installed Step Mania on my laptop, mainly because I was looking for sound files from Fourth Mix, but I couldn't find them.

2551
02:53:54,387 --> 02:53:56,529
[SPEAKER_37]: But, uh, yeah.

2552
02:53:56,549 --> 02:53:56,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

2553
02:53:57,634 --> 02:54:12,451
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to admit, when I was playing DDR this week, because I did play Max 2 and I played Disney Rave once each, and I have to admit, there was a part of me that even though that dance pad was ass, because it was from a golf land, and one of the buttons didn't even work, there was a part of me that went, I kind of miss this.

2554
02:54:12,611 --> 02:54:17,413
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, well, I was watching, was it 4th Mix Plus and 4th Mix videos and stuff like that?

2555
02:54:17,433 --> 02:54:18,873
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm like, damn, I miss them.

2556
02:54:18,993 --> 02:54:20,454
[SPEAKER_37]: That machine was awesome.

2557
02:54:20,854 --> 02:54:25,375
[SPEAKER_37]: Even just 4th Mix and stuff, and Max and Max 2 were pretty sweet.

2558
02:54:25,895 --> 02:54:35,178
[SPEAKER_37]: And I kind of wish we had, like, some of the... Because, like, I was even looking at some of the... Because I never really got into Supernova and Supernova 2, and, like, I don't even know what the hell they have now.

2559
02:54:35,238 --> 02:54:38,739
[SPEAKER_37]: It's, like, that versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff.

2560
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:40,360
[SPEAKER_37]: And there's, like, you know...

2561
02:54:41,923 --> 02:54:42,143
[SPEAKER_37]: Fuck em!

2562
02:54:42,163 --> 02:54:42,263
[SPEAKER_37]: Amen.

2563
02:55:11,010 --> 02:55:12,171
[SPEAKER_34]: I did the same exact thing.

2564
02:55:12,611 --> 02:55:16,574
[SPEAKER_34]: When I was at Anime Central this year, they had a 4th Mix Plus machine.

2565
02:55:17,975 --> 02:55:26,281
[SPEAKER_34]: And I got on and I started doing tech and then I think through the second song I said, ah, fuck this, I'm not a techie.

2566
02:55:26,782 --> 02:55:29,484
[SPEAKER_34]: So I freestyled the rest of the damn stages.

2567
02:55:31,325 --> 02:55:31,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice.

2568
02:55:32,066 --> 02:55:32,826
[SPEAKER_20]: That is awesome.

2569
02:55:33,547 --> 02:55:39,391
[SPEAKER_34]: And also, in over New Jersey, down the Jersey Shore, there is an older but still workable

2570
02:55:40,118 --> 02:55:40,759
[SPEAKER_34]: and 7th Mix.

2571
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:24,982
[SPEAKER_20]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome We would love that It's finally starting to quiet down a little bit on Skype I think a lot of the people that were wanting to get through Oh shit, there it goes again Spoke too soon Let's pick up the phone Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2572
02:56:26,107 --> 02:56:27,067
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, it's Blender.

2573
02:56:27,348 --> 02:56:28,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Blender!

2574
02:56:28,148 --> 02:56:29,248
[SPEAKER_20]: What is on your mind, my friend?

2575
02:56:29,429 --> 02:56:30,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you making a smoothie?

2576
02:56:30,329 --> 02:56:30,649
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing.

2577
02:56:32,310 --> 02:56:33,510
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think he's a blender.

2578
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:34,391
[SPEAKER_20]: He's a blender.

2579
02:56:36,232 --> 02:56:37,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations, you guys.

2580
02:56:38,052 --> 02:56:38,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2581
02:56:39,733 --> 02:56:46,056
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, the only reason I found you guys was through Bobby Blackwolf's show because I was a big fan of his on Friday Night Gaming.

2582
02:56:46,596 --> 02:56:54,900
[SPEAKER_29]: And I believe that the partnership that you guys have got together now is going to bring you to a much better future.

2583
02:56:55,874 --> 02:57:00,371
[SPEAKER_29]: and I'm so glad to be around seeing this, you know?

2584
02:57:01,092 --> 02:57:05,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, Bobby and us, you know, are very kind of like-minded.

2585
02:57:05,694 --> 02:57:08,195
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, Bobby was a big music game fan as well.

2586
02:57:08,355 --> 02:57:13,637
[SPEAKER_20]: If you kind of look at our classic game of the week, Beatmania 2DX, Bobby will admit that's one of his favorite games.

2587
02:57:13,657 --> 02:57:16,078
[SPEAKER_20]: He even said in chat he would have that game in his basement.

2588
02:57:16,398 --> 02:57:21,300
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a lot that Bobby and us have in common, yet we're different enough where that our shows kind of are different.

2589
02:57:21,320 --> 02:57:22,900
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, he's the very NPR show.

2590
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:26,582
[SPEAKER_20]: We're the very Morning Room, Waka Waka Waka type of show.

2591
02:57:26,602 --> 02:57:26,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2592
02:57:28,763 --> 02:57:30,683
[SPEAKER_20]: We do need a Waka Waka Waka soundboard.

2593
02:57:31,884 --> 02:57:34,485
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, the two of us actually complement each other very well.

2594
02:57:34,525 --> 02:57:37,726
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think kind of professionally, there's a lot we look at too.

2595
02:57:37,906 --> 02:57:42,227
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, especially, you know, obviously it's no secret there's been some big changes in the past year.

2596
02:57:42,647 --> 02:57:46,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And there was a lot that we were looking at going, what could we be doing better?

2597
02:57:46,529 --> 02:57:51,651
[SPEAKER_20]: We kind of feel like right now we're kind of riding a stationary bike right now.

2598
02:57:52,071 --> 02:57:52,971
[SPEAKER_20]: We're doing our things.

2599
02:57:53,011 --> 02:57:54,092
[SPEAKER_20]: We're burning calories.

2600
02:57:54,112 --> 02:57:54,912
[SPEAKER_20]: We ain't going anywhere.

2601
02:57:54,932 --> 02:57:55,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2602
02:57:55,492 --> 02:57:55,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2603
02:57:55,772 --> 02:57:55,992
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-hmm.

2604
02:57:56,112 --> 02:58:00,534
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wouldn't have been listening to your show without him, and I'm so glad that I stumbled upon it.

2605
02:58:00,614 --> 02:58:02,935
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, due to my current situation at the time,

2606
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:27,162
[SPEAKER_29]: I still have an open invitation for you guys if you ever pass through Napa I have a wine

2607
02:58:45,418 --> 02:58:52,141
[SPEAKER_29]: a tour for you set up to where I'm going to point out the places for you guys to go and you guys are all going to have a good time.

2608
02:58:52,321 --> 02:58:57,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I bet JV Mon wishes he'd known that the other day when he went out there testing.

2609
02:58:57,664 --> 02:59:01,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be down for that as long as someone will carry me by the time we're done.

2610
02:59:01,225 --> 02:59:04,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I would have to get a DD, but if we can figure that out.

2611
02:59:04,227 --> 02:59:05,347
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not a fan of wine.

2612
02:59:05,588 --> 02:59:08,489
[SPEAKER_29]: Jamie, trust me, I know the bus schedule, so you'll be all right.

2613
02:59:09,900 --> 02:59:13,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we might have to take you up on that someday because you know what I love more than video games?

2614
02:59:14,686 --> 02:59:15,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Booze!

2615
02:59:16,448 --> 02:59:17,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Drink responsibly.

2616
02:59:18,430 --> 02:59:20,312
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, well, congratulations.

2617
02:59:20,653 --> 02:59:21,794
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's to another 10 years.

2618
02:59:21,814 --> 02:59:22,735
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys take care.

2619
02:59:23,616 --> 02:59:24,617
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, and game good.

2620
02:59:24,818 --> 02:59:26,159
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we're going to do our best, buddy.

2621
02:59:26,179 --> 02:59:26,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks so much.

2622
02:59:28,499 --> 02:59:30,560
[SPEAKER_20]: And thanks again for the VOG Network Clubhouse.

2623
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:32,380
[SPEAKER_20]: That shit is epic.

2624
02:59:32,840 --> 02:59:33,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, Rob?

2625
02:59:34,601 --> 02:59:35,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead, DarkSakura first.

2626
02:59:35,981 --> 02:59:46,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, in the article that Tara wrote on Geek Life, there's actually a link to the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio back in the day that talked about our first few shows.

2627
02:59:47,405 --> 02:59:48,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So I relinked that in the chat room.

2628
02:59:48,745 --> 02:59:49,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2629
02:59:49,426 --> 02:59:49,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Very cool.

2630
02:59:49,966 --> 02:59:50,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, where were you?

2631
02:59:50,566 --> 02:59:53,727
[SPEAKER_37]: Speaking of the Clubhouse, I was trying to visit the Clubhouse yesterday.

2632
02:59:55,294 --> 03:00:08,057
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm so glad I've never come back to home because I downloaded the new client, which I'm pissed off because it didn't fucking save my crazy hobo Santa, which is weird.

2633
03:00:08,878 --> 03:00:10,338
[SPEAKER_37]: So I had a new character.

2634
03:00:10,598 --> 03:00:12,418
[SPEAKER_37]: So I was like, okay, I'm going to check out the clothes in there.

2635
03:00:13,039 --> 03:00:13,499
[SPEAKER_37]: Crash.

2636
03:00:14,039 --> 03:00:14,839
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, fine.

2637
03:00:15,019 --> 03:00:15,939
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not going to check out the clothes.

2638
03:00:16,079 --> 03:00:17,180
[SPEAKER_37]: Relaunch the whole thing again.

2639
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:18,940
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to try altering my appearance.

2640
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:20,000
[SPEAKER_37]: Crash again.

2641
03:00:20,220 --> 03:00:21,141
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm like, fuck this.

2642
03:00:21,281 --> 03:00:22,241
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not coming back to home.

2643
03:00:22,441 --> 03:00:24,584
[SPEAKER_20]: We got another call coming in I want to get to, but let me just say this.

2644
03:00:24,604 --> 03:00:29,570
[SPEAKER_20]: I think home would benefit greatly if they would just force you to do a 2 gig download up front.

2645
03:00:29,650 --> 03:00:32,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, there's just so much buffering and loading.

2646
03:00:33,835 --> 03:00:35,618
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the one drawback.

2647
03:00:35,678 --> 03:00:36,439
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not as...

2648
03:00:37,640 --> 03:00:38,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

2649
03:00:58,407 --> 03:01:01,970
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2650
03:01:23,459 --> 03:01:24,100
[SPEAKER_20]: Friends rock.

2651
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:25,441
[SPEAKER_20]: Friends give you money when you're poor.

2652
03:01:25,461 --> 03:01:25,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Friendship is magic.

2653
03:01:26,062 --> 03:01:26,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget.

2654
03:01:28,625 --> 03:01:29,086
[SPEAKER_20]: Die.

2655
03:01:31,689 --> 03:01:34,112
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have here three drinks.

2656
03:01:34,272 --> 03:01:37,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a Loki, I have a Jamie, and I have a Rob.

2657
03:01:37,996 --> 03:01:38,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Now...

2658
03:01:39,110 --> 03:01:44,773
[SPEAKER_14]: The first drink I dedicate to Loki is a shot of very strong honey mead.

2659
03:01:45,333 --> 03:01:47,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he is straightforward to the point.

2660
03:01:48,235 --> 03:01:49,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Will say what he has to say.

2661
03:01:50,156 --> 03:01:52,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the end, honey badger doesn't give a fuck.

2662
03:01:53,138 --> 03:01:57,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And it burns a little going down, doesn't it?

2663
03:01:57,320 --> 03:01:59,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just walk away from that comment.

2664
03:01:59,841 --> 03:02:02,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew, he's eating that snake.

2665
03:02:02,303 --> 03:02:03,123
[SPEAKER_14]: That's disgusting.

2666
03:02:04,604 --> 03:02:04,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Ow.

2667
03:02:06,212 --> 03:02:08,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up I have for Jamie.

2668
03:02:09,314 --> 03:02:12,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Now for Christmas I got this nice bottle of rum.

2669
03:02:13,037 --> 03:02:18,821
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very potent, very powerful, and I only open it for special occasions and close friends.

2670
03:02:19,302 --> 03:02:24,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jamie is my darling Oog-Chan, so I toast this glass to her.

2671
03:02:25,326 --> 03:02:26,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ran-Chan.

2672
03:02:27,048 --> 03:02:28,188
[SPEAKER_20]: Think it might have onions in it.

2673
03:02:28,509 --> 03:02:29,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Think it might have a little onion in it.

2674
03:02:30,350 --> 03:02:31,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have a beer for you when I get home.

2675
03:02:32,732 --> 03:02:33,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure it's a Guinness.

2676
03:02:34,053 --> 03:02:35,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a Guinness, but it's a Killian's.

2677
03:02:36,613 --> 03:02:39,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember Captain Fabulous.

2678
03:02:58,628 --> 03:03:00,469
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is fabulous!

2679
03:03:01,189 --> 03:03:01,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, definitely.

2680
03:03:01,789 --> 03:03:04,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember the drink we invented at Faname?

2681
03:03:04,450 --> 03:03:05,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2682
03:03:05,791 --> 03:03:12,133
[SPEAKER_08]: When all we had was a bottle of Pineapple Malibu, so we paid five bucks for a 20-ounce of 7-Up.

2683
03:03:12,173 --> 03:03:12,733
[SPEAKER_08]: That was epic.

2684
03:03:12,753 --> 03:03:13,793
[SPEAKER_14]: That was so epic.

2685
03:03:15,014 --> 03:03:17,935
[SPEAKER_08]: We made that 7-Up last, and we were playing Apples to Apples.

2686
03:03:18,835 --> 03:03:19,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hell yes.

2687
03:03:20,055 --> 03:03:21,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Drunk on Pineapple Malibu and 7-Up.

2688
03:03:21,976 --> 03:03:24,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh, Sean, you are the party girl.

2689
03:03:26,273 --> 03:03:28,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And you saw me through my horrible cosplay.

2690
03:03:29,536 --> 03:03:31,098
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no such thing as horrible cosplay.

2691
03:03:31,118 --> 03:03:31,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Get over that.

2692
03:03:31,679 --> 03:03:32,019
[SPEAKER_37]: Come on now.

2693
03:03:32,059 --> 03:03:40,208
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm kind of disappointed that we didn't get to go to, uh, you know, Fanime to do, like, because that was one of the plans was, well, we're gonna do something at Fanime for our 10 year anniversary or whatever.

2694
03:03:41,229 --> 03:03:43,612
[SPEAKER_37]: I still have my costume from Halloween in my car.

2695
03:03:44,493 --> 03:03:44,593
[SPEAKER_37]: Hmm.

2696
03:03:44,773 --> 03:03:54,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I was waiting to use that again Oh my god, that's awesome Alright, well, Ranma, I gotta let you go to try and squeeze in a few more calls I didn't even take the drink yet Oh, drink it!

[SPEAKER_14]: Drink it!

[SPEAKER_14]: Chug, chug, chug, chug Here's to you, here's to me The best of friends we'll ever be If we should ever happen to disagree Well, fuck you, and here's to me And it's going down So I have to show you the other toast Here's to us Who's like us?

[SPEAKER_14]: Work's gonna be fun tomorrow.

[SPEAKER_20]: 1877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio it was gay pride this weekend by the way in San Francisco and that brought up the conversation in the chat room what if OLR had a pride parade what would be the first float and I said of course the opening float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float followed immediately by dykes on bikes because you can't have a parade without dykes on bikes I'm sorry that's what the people are coming out to see

2711
03:05:04,773 --> 03:05:05,113
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you?

2712
03:05:05,553 --> 03:05:06,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2713
03:05:07,534 --> 03:05:10,176
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a few naked dykes on bikes at the parade today, too.

2714
03:05:10,476 --> 03:05:13,718
[SPEAKER_20]: That's because you're in San Francisco, home of the finest.

2715
03:05:14,099 --> 03:05:15,279
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's take some more calls.

2724
03:05:41,376 --> 03:05:47,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Estas son las mañanitas que cantaba el rey David.

2725

[SPEAKER_03]: A los muchachos y las muchachas bonitas que las cantaban así.

2753
03:08:21,330 --> 03:08:23,131
[SPEAKER_31]: I know, I'm looking forward to it.

2754
03:08:23,571 --> 03:08:23,771
[SPEAKER_31]: Haha.

2755
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:29,264
[SPEAKER_20]: George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?

03:08:29,284 --> 03:08:35,331
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want to know Oh, I don't know, I guess it's just my natural charm

2757
03:08:37,063 --> 03:08:37,924
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's Sterlok.

2758
03:08:37,944 --> 03:08:38,664
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, how's it going?

2759
03:08:39,105 --> 03:08:40,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's good, it's good.

2760
03:08:40,085 --> 03:08:41,886
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that was a good impression, I gotta say.

2761
03:08:42,187 --> 03:08:42,867
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my.

2762
03:08:43,748 --> 03:08:44,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my.

2763
03:08:44,908 --> 03:08:46,269
[SPEAKER_20]: What's on your mind, Sterlok?

2764
03:08:46,469 --> 03:08:48,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Besides apparently George Takei.

2765
03:08:51,853 --> 03:08:52,453
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I don't know.

2766
03:08:53,254 --> 03:08:59,438
[SPEAKER_32]: I've always wanted to do that, just, I don't know, a long time ago, like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned...

2767
03:09:01,181 --> 03:09:05,062
[SPEAKER_32]: Something about George Takei and... He needs to be my gay daddy.

2768
03:09:07,904 --> 03:09:17,427
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I thought about calling in to the voicemail or something and just leaving a message as George Takei, saying like, oh, I heard your comments and I just wanted to say thank you.

2769
03:09:19,028 --> 03:09:19,888
[SPEAKER_32]: But anyway...

2770
03:09:21,295 --> 03:09:22,116
[SPEAKER_17]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2771
03:09:38,892 --> 03:09:44,775
[SPEAKER_20]: You forget, when you hear George Takei's voice, you kind of forget that he's 78 and you still want to sleep with it, you know?

2772
03:09:44,896 --> 03:09:46,837
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, you cannot tell by his voice that he's that old.

2773
03:09:46,857 --> 03:09:50,159
[SPEAKER_08]: He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know?

2774
03:09:51,079 --> 03:09:56,182
[SPEAKER_08]: He just always had that deep and melodious theatrical voice.

2775
03:09:56,242 --> 03:09:59,384
[SPEAKER_20]: Fifth dream in our chatroom says, I'm having Seaman flashbacks.

2776
03:09:59,824 --> 03:10:01,286
[SPEAKER_20]: NBA star Tim Hardaway is having a very rough week.

2777
03:10:01,306 --> 03:10:07,452
[SPEAKER_20]: He put out a statement apologizing for saying he hates gay people today, or at least his lawyer put it out.

2778
03:10:17,222 --> 03:10:33,087
[SPEAKER_00]: and needless to say this rant, this crazy rant has upset a lot of people including the NBA which banned him from all future league related events and there was also reaction today from a prominent member of the gay community including this celebrity who went so far as to tape a PSA.

2779
03:10:35,167 --> 03:10:36,688
[SPEAKER_41]: Hello, I'm George Takei.

2780
03:10:37,908 --> 03:10:44,810
[SPEAKER_41]: Recently I've been troubled to hear comments made by former NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway who said

2781
03:10:45,988 --> 03:10:47,129
[SPEAKER_41]: I hate gay people.

2782
03:10:47,549 --> 03:10:50,210
[SPEAKER_41]: Let it be known, I don't like gay people.

2783
03:10:50,710 --> 03:10:51,731
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm homophobic.

2784
03:10:53,492 --> 03:10:56,873
[SPEAKER_41]: As a gay man and a human being, I was shocked and saddened.

2785
03:10:57,874 --> 03:11:06,538
[SPEAKER_41]: But I want you to know, Tim, on behalf of gay people everywhere, that despite your ugly words, we don't hate you.

2786
03:11:07,419 --> 03:11:09,880
[SPEAKER_41]: As a matter of fact, we like you.

2787
03:11:11,877 --> 03:11:13,398
[SPEAKER_41]: We like you very much.

2788
03:11:13,798 --> 03:11:23,381
[SPEAKER_41]: We particularly like your large, powerful hands.

2789
03:11:23,481 --> 03:11:30,823
[SPEAKER_41]: Your smooth, chocolatey head.

2790
03:11:32,224 --> 03:11:34,084
[SPEAKER_41]: Raged in man sweat.

2791
03:11:35,485 --> 03:11:39,986
[SPEAKER_41]: I'll keep my eyes on you and let it be known, one day,

2792
03:11:40,748 --> 03:11:51,839
[SPEAKER_41]: When you least expect it, I will have sex with you I love sweaty basketball players

2793
03:11:53,809 --> 03:12:00,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I'm sorry that was quiet, but unfortunately that was at max volume, because YouTubes aren't standardized, unfortunately.

2794
03:12:00,533 --> 03:12:01,574
[SPEAKER_20]: I hadn't heard that, actually.

2795
03:12:01,594 --> 03:12:02,054
[SPEAKER_20]: That was awesome.

2796
03:12:02,154 --> 03:12:03,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's freaking amazing.

2797
03:12:03,755 --> 03:12:04,616
[SPEAKER_20]: I love George Takei.

2798
03:12:04,676 --> 03:12:04,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

2799
03:12:05,497 --> 03:12:09,759
[SPEAKER_32]: But anyway, I wanted to talk about how I discovered OLR.

2800
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:10,800
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, please!

2801
03:12:11,380 --> 03:12:14,262
[SPEAKER_32]: Kind of an interesting... I came in at a weird time.

2802
03:12:15,143 --> 03:12:22,708
[SPEAKER_32]: I came in sometime in 07, back when... It was in that weird point where...

2803
03:12:23,956 --> 03:12:28,279
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys were being syndicated on All Games but not broadcasting from there.

2804
03:12:28,860 --> 03:12:29,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, right.

2805
03:12:29,240 --> 03:12:32,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we were the first affiliate show on All Games Radio.

2806
03:12:32,483 --> 03:12:36,446
[SPEAKER_20]: And, yeah, again, Bobby was the station manager at All Games at the time.

2807
03:12:36,506 --> 03:12:44,372
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, because he liked OLR and he knew we were doing the syndication with DDR Freak Radio for a time, he offered it up to us.

2808
03:12:44,432 --> 03:12:46,653
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were like, heck, yeah, more people to hear our show?

2809
03:12:46,693 --> 03:12:47,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course.

2810
03:12:47,254 --> 03:12:47,654
[SPEAKER_20]: Why not?

2811
03:12:47,754 --> 03:12:47,934
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2812
03:12:48,114 --> 03:12:49,936
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, that was a great thing for us.

2813
03:12:50,441 --> 03:13:00,066
[SPEAKER_32]: So I remember when the whole Live 365 crap went down when they were raising their prices and you guys weren't sure what you were going to do for a while.

2814
03:13:00,527 --> 03:13:01,327
[SPEAKER_20]: That's very true.

2815
03:13:02,948 --> 03:13:10,272
[SPEAKER_32]: But yeah, I've been, I don't know, I forget what my first exact episode was.

2816
03:13:10,452 --> 03:13:14,594
[SPEAKER_32]: It was like, I don't know, in the 150s I want to say, or maybe 250s.

2817
03:13:14,634 --> 03:13:14,734
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2818
03:13:19,562 --> 03:13:31,475
[SPEAKER_32]: But I don't know, there was just something about the chemistry there with the three guys and it was just a lot of fun to listen to and very funny and entertaining and I was just kind of hooked.

2819
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:39,243
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, thank you for getting hooked on whatever crack cocaine we must be offering because people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough.

2820
03:13:39,303 --> 03:13:41,043
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got to go back and get another hit.

2821
03:13:42,584 --> 03:13:47,146
[SPEAKER_32]: Now it's just like I can't imagine not listening to it on Sunday nights.

2822
03:13:47,246 --> 03:13:50,407
[SPEAKER_32]: It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like, well, shit, what am I going to do for three hours?

2823
03:13:51,307 --> 03:13:54,531
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a nice sentiment, but it's also a little bit scary, I gotta admit.

2824
03:13:54,571 --> 03:13:57,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, you know, as they say, all good things must come to an end.

2825
03:13:57,855 --> 03:14:00,018
[SPEAKER_20]: There will be a time when OLR will end.

2826
03:14:00,058 --> 03:14:02,541
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not saying it's happening now, or that it's even planned.

2827
03:14:03,101 --> 03:14:05,064
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, shit happens.

2828
03:14:05,845 --> 03:14:06,946
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've had our scares.

2829
03:14:07,286 --> 03:14:09,930
[SPEAKER_20]: We have had many scares here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2830
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:13,271
[SPEAKER_20]: Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still here.

2831
03:14:13,371 --> 03:14:16,993
[SPEAKER_20]: But there is going to come a time where we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending.

2832
03:14:17,734 --> 03:14:21,415
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the impact that's going to have on some people.

2833
03:14:21,776 --> 03:14:27,918
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm always like, well, thank God we have an archive of 400 plus episodes that people could always go back and listen to.

2834
03:14:27,938 --> 03:14:32,621
[SPEAKER_32]: When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode that I have and just marathon it.

2835
03:14:33,361 --> 03:14:34,382
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a new friend.

2836
03:14:34,882 --> 03:14:37,223
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well.

2837
03:14:38,427 --> 03:14:39,368
[SPEAKER_20]: You know this girl, right?

2838
03:14:40,088 --> 03:14:41,750
[SPEAKER_20]: And she loves Beverly Hills 90210.

2839
03:14:42,851 --> 03:14:44,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended.

2840
03:14:44,812 --> 03:14:45,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Not the new one.

2841
03:14:45,413 --> 03:14:45,873
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't count it.

2842
03:14:46,213 --> 03:14:47,694
[SPEAKER_20]: She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended.

2843
03:14:47,775 --> 03:14:50,377
[SPEAKER_20]: So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD.

2844
03:14:50,877 --> 03:14:50,997
[SPEAKER_32]: Aww.

2845
03:14:53,840 --> 03:15:22,661
[SPEAKER_32]: it's just like with the new Thundercats where it's just I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon but it's like like most things that are remade it's just pales in comparison to the classic 80s cartoon the same mutual friend introduced me to a site a while back that's actually gone now that's called Elijah Wood is very very very very very very gay and it was all kind of fuchsia colored

2846
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:23,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice.

2847
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:25,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw her the other day.

2848
03:15:25,661 --> 03:15:25,901
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

2849
03:15:25,961 --> 03:15:26,761
[SPEAKER_20]: She told me about it.

2850
03:15:26,841 --> 03:15:33,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that because there's something else involving her that's happening next week that I want you to be a part of.

2851
03:15:33,644 --> 03:15:33,944
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2852
03:15:34,265 --> 03:15:35,165
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're going to tell me no.

2853
03:15:35,945 --> 03:15:38,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, Osfer in chat says, don't ever end.

2854
03:15:39,047 --> 03:15:40,087
[SPEAKER_20]: I will cry so hard.

2855
03:15:40,507 --> 03:15:42,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Not half as hard as we probably will.

2856
03:15:42,108 --> 03:15:42,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Except for Loki.

2857
03:15:42,708 --> 03:15:43,148
[SPEAKER_20]: He doesn't cry.

2858
03:15:43,828 --> 03:15:44,089
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2859
03:15:46,149 --> 03:15:47,510
[SPEAKER_20]: He'll cry a single man tear.

2860
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:49,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not talk about that.

2861
03:15:49,911 --> 03:15:51,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Ten more years, right, kids?

2862
03:15:51,872 --> 03:15:52,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2863
03:15:52,572 --> 03:15:53,572
[SPEAKER_32]: is that DDR Angel?

2864
03:16:19,542 --> 03:16:20,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi!

2865
03:16:20,703 --> 03:16:22,444
[SPEAKER_20]: It is so good to hear from you.

2866
03:16:23,044 --> 03:16:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: The brain's behind the EcoMaker.

2867
03:16:25,646 --> 03:16:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2868
03:16:27,086 --> 03:16:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it great?

2869
03:16:28,087 --> 03:16:28,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2870
03:16:29,108 --> 03:16:29,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay.

2871
03:16:29,948 --> 03:16:30,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Website.

2872
03:16:30,448 --> 03:16:31,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, only brain.

2873
03:16:31,289 --> 03:16:32,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, website.

2874
03:16:32,330 --> 03:16:33,250
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not plugging it.

2875
03:16:33,290 --> 03:16:35,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your job, because you're going to bring back the other thing.

2876
03:16:35,912 --> 03:16:39,894
[SPEAKER_20]: You can plug the website all you want, but I'm... I can't do that.

2877
03:16:40,134 --> 03:16:41,535
[SPEAKER_20]: It has nothing to do with gaming.

2878
03:16:42,015 --> 03:16:42,676
[SPEAKER_20]: You're done.

2879
03:16:43,176 --> 03:16:44,096
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the future.

2880
03:16:44,136 --> 03:16:45,117
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to talk about the past.

2881
03:16:45,137 --> 03:16:46,838
[SPEAKER_20]: But, Garrus... Okay, look, shut up.

2882
03:16:46,918 --> 03:16:47,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2883
03:16:49,219 --> 03:16:53,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, DDR Angel, you were here for many of the early episodes.

2884
03:16:53,363 --> 03:16:56,586
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning, but pretty fucking- No, I wasn't.

2885
03:16:56,606 --> 03:16:58,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty fucking close, all things considered.

2886
03:16:58,127 --> 03:16:59,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39.

2887
03:16:59,828 --> 03:17:00,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2888
03:17:00,149 --> 03:17:01,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Or episode 39, rather.

2889
03:17:01,190 --> 03:17:02,831
[SPEAKER_20]: In the scope of 462 episodes, 39 is pretty much the beginning.

2890
03:17:02,851 --> 03:17:03,351
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, well.

2891
03:17:03,411 --> 03:17:03,892
[SPEAKER_20]: But, uh, Angel, I-

2892
03:17:12,379 --> 03:17:13,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit, I don't even know what to say.

2893
03:17:14,481 --> 03:17:17,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for being a big part of those first few episodes.

2894
03:17:17,703 --> 03:17:25,589
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I think of you in many ways as one of the first really hardcore, passionate people about this show.

2895
03:17:26,750 --> 03:17:27,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I still love it.

2896
03:17:27,791 --> 03:17:29,072
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every Sunday.

2897
03:17:30,133 --> 03:17:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I might not be in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always paying attention to tweets and everything else too.

2898
03:17:37,378 --> 03:17:40,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty much just like Joe sitting on the couch over there.

2899
03:17:42,280 --> 03:17:56,230
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want you to know we really appreciate it, because that type of enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like Joe, Misty, JV, you know, we have lots of people that are so enthusiastic and everything, and I just remember you were one of the first, and I always thank you for that.

2900
03:17:56,450 --> 03:18:07,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to personally thank you guys also, because not only for 10 years of friendship, thank you, but if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have met and married my husband and all that other stuff, and...

2901
03:18:08,839 --> 03:18:12,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a crazy 10 years, and I'm just looking forward to 10 more plus.

2902
03:18:13,183 --> 03:18:28,676
[SPEAKER_20]: The crazy thing about what you just said is that you're the second person to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle your story because it's amazing, but Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook, that inadvertently, because of OLR, there was Geek Life, and because of Geek Life, there was Dan.

2903
03:18:29,177 --> 03:18:31,899
[SPEAKER_20]: So kind of the same thing happened for her, in a way.

2904
03:18:32,079 --> 03:18:32,740
[SPEAKER_08]: She has a Dan.

2905
03:18:32,960 --> 03:18:33,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Dan.

2906
03:18:33,981 --> 03:18:34,561
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so...

2907
03:18:35,422 --> 03:18:37,343
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way.

2908
03:18:37,383 --> 03:18:38,404
[SPEAKER_20]: It blows my mind.

2909
03:18:38,584 --> 03:18:44,927
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some ways, I mean, I didn't meet Alan through OLR, but Alan and I probably got a lot closer because of it.

2910
03:18:44,947 --> 03:18:48,748
[SPEAKER_20]: So even my own life, this show has had an impact on in that kind of way.

2911
03:18:49,249 --> 03:18:49,729
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crazy.

2912
03:18:50,149 --> 03:18:50,990
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very crazy.

2913
03:18:52,310 --> 03:18:53,451
[SPEAKER_20]: But great and humbling.

2914
03:18:53,831 --> 03:18:59,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe we can get together and see if you guys can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show.

2915
03:18:59,794 --> 03:19:01,034
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure we can arrange that.

2916
03:19:01,114 --> 03:19:01,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's work out the beats.

2917
03:19:02,950 --> 03:19:03,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be great.

2918
03:19:04,271 --> 03:19:09,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier.

2919
03:19:09,516 --> 03:19:11,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be very interesting tonight.

2920
03:19:11,598 --> 03:19:14,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Big hugs for you and the hubby and thanks for being a part of OLR's history.

2921
03:19:15,161 --> 03:19:16,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Hugs to you guys too.

2922
03:19:16,302 --> 03:19:16,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Take care.

2923
03:19:16,682 --> 03:19:17,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy 10 years again.

2924
03:19:17,583 --> 03:19:17,983
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2925
03:19:18,504 --> 03:19:19,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2926
03:19:19,084 --> 03:19:19,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2927
03:19:19,785 --> 03:19:21,907
[SPEAKER_20]: I should have asked her when the last time she played DDR was.

2928
03:19:24,031 --> 03:19:25,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe she's just Angel now.

2929
03:19:25,311 --> 03:19:27,152
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what.

2930
03:19:27,772 --> 03:19:30,532
[SPEAKER_20]: Ranma wants to know where is Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up.

2931
03:19:30,692 --> 03:19:31,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Alan is working tonight.

2932
03:19:32,073 --> 03:19:33,893
[SPEAKER_20]: He couldn't make the show because he's working.

2933
03:19:34,333 --> 03:19:35,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what?

2934
03:19:35,513 --> 03:19:37,714
[SPEAKER_20]: In this economy, I am fucking thrilled.

2935
03:19:37,774 --> 03:19:38,714
[SPEAKER_20]: He's working tonight.

2936
03:19:38,754 --> 03:19:39,434
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't get me wrong.

2937
03:19:40,614 --> 03:19:44,555
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm sure he would be here to say hello and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight.

2938
03:19:47,055 --> 03:19:50,076
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in because I saw a couple.

2939
03:19:51,909 --> 03:19:53,691
[SPEAKER_20]: But we are getting towards the end of the show, I think.

2940
03:19:53,891 --> 03:19:54,631
[SPEAKER_20]: How's your headache doing?

2941
03:19:54,651 --> 03:19:55,232
[SPEAKER_20]: You feeling better?

2942
03:19:55,732 --> 03:19:56,153
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel bad.

2943
03:19:56,173 --> 03:19:56,934
[SPEAKER_37]: I still got pressure in my head.

2944
03:19:57,434 --> 03:20:03,419
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to say thanks as well to JV Mon, because I didn't get to say this on air because you did it during break, but you got us presents.

2945
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:06,842
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's nothing I love more in the world than presents.

2946
03:20:07,763 --> 03:20:12,525
[SPEAKER_20]: and I got brought Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, which you can't buy in California.

2947
03:20:12,665 --> 03:20:13,025
[SPEAKER_20]: That's awesome.

2948
03:20:13,045 --> 03:20:14,625
[SPEAKER_20]: The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines.

2949
03:20:14,645 --> 03:20:15,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know.

2950
03:20:16,186 --> 03:20:20,807
[SPEAKER_37]: And I love... We have the old school Keurig machine, which we don't use anymore because it sucks.

2951
03:20:22,067 --> 03:20:23,248
[SPEAKER_37]: But the new one's pretty awesome.

2952
03:20:23,268 --> 03:20:23,668
[SPEAKER_37]: But yeah.

2953
03:20:25,253 --> 03:20:30,377
[SPEAKER_37]: They need to bring a Dunkin' Donuts over here because we don't have a fucking... Well, we have a Krispy Kreme, but it's all in Roseville.

2954
03:20:32,258 --> 03:20:38,162
[SPEAKER_37]: I did drive there one time when I woke up for work at 5 in the morning because I'm like, I can't go back to sleep.

2955
03:20:38,242 --> 03:20:40,484
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville or wherever.

2956
03:20:40,644 --> 03:20:41,365
[SPEAKER_20]: I want a donut.

2957
03:20:41,405 --> 03:20:43,946
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's go back to the phones.

2958
03:20:45,648 --> 03:20:46,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2959
03:20:46,608 --> 03:20:46,949
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

2960
03:20:47,549 --> 03:20:53,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, choo-choo, it's Jim Sally.

2961
03:20:54,115 --> 03:20:55,737
[SPEAKER_20]: What is up, Jim Sally?

2962
03:20:56,237 --> 03:20:57,979
[SPEAKER_42]: Not much, everybody.

2963
03:20:58,019 --> 03:21:00,422
[SPEAKER_42]: Happy anniversary, everybody, on the show.

2964
03:21:00,502 --> 03:21:00,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2965
03:21:00,842 --> 03:21:01,382
[SPEAKER_20]: What'd you buy me?

2966
03:21:03,184 --> 03:21:03,985
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, I'll tell you what.

2967
03:21:04,145 --> 03:21:06,187
[SPEAKER_42]: In honor of the donations, I will donate $1...

2968
03:21:07,512 --> 03:21:09,553
[SPEAKER_42]: for every minute that this call goes on for.

2969
03:21:09,593 --> 03:21:10,234
[SPEAKER_42]: How's that sound?

2970
03:21:10,254 --> 03:21:12,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Pay my hold!

2971
03:21:13,516 --> 03:21:14,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Please hold.

2972
03:21:17,238 --> 03:21:20,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, seriously, I'm not going to be looking at the time, but that's hilarious.

2973
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:22,221
[SPEAKER_20]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2974
03:21:23,561 --> 03:21:24,442
[SPEAKER_42]: Not much, man.

2975
03:21:24,702 --> 03:21:29,064
[SPEAKER_42]: I wanted to call in and share some of my Orange Lounge radio stories.

2976
03:21:29,525 --> 03:21:30,085
[SPEAKER_42]: Please.

2977
03:21:31,046 --> 03:21:32,587
[SPEAKER_42]: I used to always listen to you guys.

2978
03:21:32,667 --> 03:21:33,767
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll listen to The Bobby Show.

2979
03:21:34,328 --> 03:21:35,628
[SPEAKER_42]: Everyone knows about The Bobby Show.

2980
03:21:35,668 --> 03:21:36,269
[SPEAKER_42]: It's a great show.

2981
03:21:36,369 --> 03:21:36,769
[SPEAKER_42]: He's the man.

2982
03:21:37,529 --> 03:21:38,770
[SPEAKER_42]: He is the man.

2983
03:21:38,790 --> 03:21:39,990
[SPEAKER_42]: I wish Bobby lived close to me.

2984
03:21:40,050 --> 03:21:41,671
[SPEAKER_42]: I would just idolize him all day long.

2985
03:21:41,711 --> 03:21:43,792
[SPEAKER_42]: But anyway, I listen to the Bobby show.

2986
03:21:43,832 --> 03:21:47,054
[SPEAKER_42]: Then I would listen to a little OLR on live, right?

2987
03:21:47,514 --> 03:21:53,217
[SPEAKER_42]: Because I have to always work early in the morning and maybe get like an hour into it.

2988
03:21:53,697 --> 03:21:54,297
[SPEAKER_42]: This sounds bad.

2989
03:21:54,337 --> 03:21:55,478
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't take this the wrong way, guys.

2990
03:21:55,518 --> 03:21:56,038
[SPEAKER_42]: I love you guys.

2991
03:21:56,058 --> 03:21:57,158
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't take this the wrong way, okay?

2992
03:21:57,599 --> 03:21:57,879
[SPEAKER_42]: Listen.

2993
03:21:59,039 --> 03:22:02,541
[SPEAKER_42]: I would go to bed listening to you and I'd fall asleep listening to you every night.

2994
03:22:03,041 --> 03:22:04,082
[SPEAKER_42]: I know that sounds horrible.

2995
03:22:04,122 --> 03:22:06,583
[SPEAKER_42]: It's just because I was really tired and I had to go to bed.

2996
03:22:06,903 --> 03:22:08,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I listen to you while I sleep.

2997
03:22:08,403 --> 03:22:11,984
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear at night is my voice.

2998
03:22:12,865 --> 03:22:14,865
[SPEAKER_42]: I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes.

2999
03:22:14,905 --> 03:22:15,725
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want to say it.

3000
03:22:16,165 --> 03:22:19,266
[SPEAKER_37]: And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like, God damn it!

3001
03:22:19,306 --> 03:22:19,786
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah.

3002
03:22:19,806 --> 03:22:24,167
[SPEAKER_42]: I was a champion wrestler in high school, man.

3003
03:22:24,227 --> 03:22:25,928
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen, buddy.

3004
03:22:26,408 --> 03:22:27,348
[SPEAKER_42]: Come on, have a snuggle.

3005
03:22:27,608 --> 03:22:31,429
[SPEAKER_20]: As a caller three calls or so ago would say, oh my.

3006
03:22:32,710 --> 03:22:33,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that guy was awesome, man.

3007
03:22:35,615 --> 03:22:36,115
[SPEAKER_42]: But you know what?

3008
03:22:36,155 --> 03:22:36,876
[SPEAKER_42]: No, wait a minute, guys.

3009
03:22:36,896 --> 03:22:37,817
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what's nice, though?

3010
03:22:38,277 --> 03:22:39,698
[SPEAKER_42]: I had a baby about a year ago.

3011
03:22:39,718 --> 03:22:40,939
[SPEAKER_42]: Mm-hmm.

3012
03:22:40,959 --> 03:22:43,821
[SPEAKER_42]: So I've been having to stay home, so my baby would always be, like, shitty at nighttime.

3013
03:22:43,961 --> 03:22:44,802
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd you accomplish that?

3014
03:22:44,842 --> 03:22:45,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were ill-equipped.

3015
03:22:47,124 --> 03:22:47,484
[SPEAKER_42]: No!

3016
03:22:47,624 --> 03:22:48,245
[SPEAKER_42]: No, yeah, yeah.

3017
03:22:48,265 --> 03:22:49,626
[SPEAKER_42]: Jim Sally can do anything, baby.

3018
03:22:51,673 --> 03:22:53,033
[SPEAKER_42]: This train is fully equipped.

3019
03:22:53,053 --> 03:22:53,854
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what I'm saying?

3020
03:22:53,894 --> 03:22:55,354
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what I'm saying?

3021
03:22:55,394 --> 03:22:56,854
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's not go into details.

3022
03:22:56,974 --> 03:22:57,774
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what I'm saying?

3023
03:22:58,175 --> 03:23:00,635
[SPEAKER_42]: But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you guys.

3024
03:23:00,675 --> 03:23:01,775
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I'd listen until midnight.

3025
03:23:01,815 --> 03:23:06,116
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd sit in the rocking chair with my baby beside me and the iPod on the table and me and my baby.

3026
03:23:06,497 --> 03:23:09,797
[SPEAKER_42]: For the last ten and a half months that she's been on, we listen every week.

3027
03:23:10,077 --> 03:23:12,798
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if I want to influence a baby because that could be bad.

3028
03:23:12,858 --> 03:23:14,338
[SPEAKER_20]: I totally want to influence a baby.

3029
03:23:14,358 --> 03:23:16,479
[SPEAKER_42]: I already know how that turns out.

3030
03:23:17,239 --> 03:23:18,339
[SPEAKER_42]: It's nice having a baby.

3031
03:23:18,359 --> 03:23:21,180
[SPEAKER_42]: It's like a little Padawan learner teaching her so much shit.

3032
03:23:21,852 --> 03:23:23,874
[SPEAKER_42]: She chokes the shit out of the cat right now, man.

3033
03:23:23,894 --> 03:23:27,098
[SPEAKER_42]: She's gonna be ready when she gets... Fuck that dark side, man, all the way.

3034
03:23:27,238 --> 03:23:28,940
[SPEAKER_42]: Fuck them light side bitches, man.

3035
03:23:29,240 --> 03:23:30,502
[SPEAKER_42]: That's what I tell my baby every night.

3036
03:23:30,902 --> 03:23:34,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god, your baby is gonna grow up to be an ultimate fighter.

3037
03:23:35,988 --> 03:23:36,689
[SPEAKER_42]: I hope so.

3038
03:23:36,709 --> 03:23:39,752
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh my god, if my little girl was an ultimate fighter, I would... Oh my Jesus.

3039
03:23:40,313 --> 03:23:41,054
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you imagine?

3040
03:23:41,274 --> 03:23:41,374
[SPEAKER_42]: She's

3041
03:23:41,514 --> 03:23:42,775
[SPEAKER_20]: There's only two things now.

3042
03:23:42,795 --> 03:23:44,637
[SPEAKER_42]: There used to be one thing I wanted from my little girl.

3043
03:23:44,937 --> 03:23:46,639
[SPEAKER_42]: But now there's two things I want from my little girl.

3044
03:23:46,679 --> 03:23:48,840
[SPEAKER_42]: Number one, please become an MMA fighter.

3045
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:50,142
[SPEAKER_42]: The best MMA fighter in the world.

3046
03:23:50,462 --> 03:23:52,003
[SPEAKER_42]: Pencil hold motherfuckers to death.

3047
03:23:52,103 --> 03:23:52,744
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, I'd love her.

3048
03:23:53,144 --> 03:23:55,907
[SPEAKER_42]: Number two, I pray to Jesus every day she's a lesbian.

3049
03:23:56,347 --> 03:23:57,388
[SPEAKER_42]: Every day I pray.

3050
03:23:58,909 --> 03:24:00,070
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh my god, I say Jesus.

3051
03:24:00,090 --> 03:24:01,771
[SPEAKER_42]: I think of myself when I was a little boy.

3052
03:24:02,031 --> 03:24:04,392
[SPEAKER_42]: When I was like a 15-year-old kid, I was a pig.

3053
03:24:04,432 --> 03:24:06,793
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want no pig boys hanging around my girl.

3054
03:24:07,074 --> 03:24:07,754
[SPEAKER_42]: Fuck that shit.

3055
03:24:07,794 --> 03:24:15,278
[SPEAKER_42]: I want her to just be a nice lesbian, find a nice girl, get married, and then when they want to have kids, I got two ovens to be baking babies in.

3056
03:24:15,638 --> 03:24:17,779
[SPEAKER_42]: Double that bacon up, baby bacon ovens, baby.

3057
03:24:19,340 --> 03:24:19,840
[SPEAKER_42]: Double them up.

3058
03:24:20,382 --> 03:24:25,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear you've given this some detailed thought.

3059
03:24:25,867 --> 03:24:33,613
[SPEAKER_42]: Rob, I'm telling you right now, if there was, like, you know how you can pay for procedures and stuff, like do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever?

3060
03:24:33,793 --> 03:24:37,036
[SPEAKER_42]: If you could pay to turn the gay switch on, I would turn it on.

3061
03:24:37,276 --> 03:24:39,158
[SPEAKER_42]: That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy.

3062
03:24:39,198 --> 03:24:42,161
[SPEAKER_42]: That's when you've got to sync those genetics in there.

3063
03:24:42,201 --> 03:24:43,722
[SPEAKER_42]: I would have done it a long time ago, man.

3064
03:24:43,862 --> 03:24:48,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I've thought about this myself, because, you know, Dan and I were trying, and I wanted to have a lesbian.

3065
03:24:49,366 --> 03:25:04,387
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll tell you why I'll tell you why okay I don't have to pay for a bris and number two I think of all the money I would save if I had a really dykey baby

3066
03:25:05,205 --> 03:25:07,467
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, you also gotta think about this, too, because you're a chick, right?

3067
03:25:07,487 --> 03:25:11,509
[SPEAKER_42]: If you had a ducky baby and she was more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe.

3068
03:25:11,789 --> 03:25:13,891
[SPEAKER_42]: All of a sudden, you're wearing the best clothes ever, right?

3069
03:25:13,911 --> 03:25:14,651
[SPEAKER_42]: Your kids buy them.

3070
03:25:14,792 --> 03:25:16,433
[SPEAKER_42]: You just steal her from her closet.

3071
03:25:16,513 --> 03:25:17,053
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, man.

3072
03:25:17,313 --> 03:25:22,437
[SPEAKER_20]: I gotta say, one of the perks about being gay is that, like, if I have no clean shirts... Oh, Alan has a clean shirt.

3073
03:25:22,457 --> 03:25:22,997
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll steal that.

3074
03:25:23,057 --> 03:25:23,878
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, it works out really well.

3075
03:25:23,898 --> 03:25:25,619
[SPEAKER_42]: You know you have to take Alan's shirts, man.

3076
03:25:26,471 --> 03:25:29,212
[SPEAKER_42]: Jeez, did you go to any Pride weekend this weekend, guy?

3077
03:25:29,693 --> 03:25:32,954
[SPEAKER_20]: No, because, you know, I usually don't because Sundays are the show.

3078
03:25:33,134 --> 03:25:34,135
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know this.

3079
03:25:34,895 --> 03:25:36,236
[SPEAKER_20]: I swear I'm not saying this to get pity.

3080
03:25:36,356 --> 03:25:36,936
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really not.

3081
03:25:37,357 --> 03:25:40,158
[SPEAKER_20]: The show kind of comes first before that.

3082
03:25:40,278 --> 03:25:40,798
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't gone.

3083
03:25:41,519 --> 03:25:44,921
[SPEAKER_20]: I've gone to some Prides, but I usually have to, like, run home in time for the show.

3084
03:25:45,301 --> 03:25:51,224
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to say once or twice in the 10 years I did cancel out on the show that week so I could, you know, do stuff in the city.

3085
03:25:51,284 --> 03:25:51,424
[SPEAKER_20]: But...

3086
03:25:52,163 --> 03:25:52,523
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

3087
03:25:52,603 --> 03:25:56,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't get us all... It's too many people for me.

3088
03:25:56,866 --> 03:25:59,547
[SPEAKER_20]: I get gay pride.

3089
03:25:59,867 --> 03:26:11,193
[SPEAKER_20]: In the 60s when it was not okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk about and you had to hide it from the world and cops tried to arrest you because...

3090
03:26:11,713 --> 03:26:12,854
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3091
03:26:30,485 --> 03:26:31,185
[SPEAKER_20]: and deal with it.

3092
03:26:59,341 --> 03:27:00,843
[SPEAKER_42]: What can you expect sometimes, right?

3093
03:27:00,863 --> 03:27:04,188
[SPEAKER_42]: They're pretty old school over there, I guess.

3094
03:27:04,288 --> 03:27:05,149
[SPEAKER_42]: It's dumb though, right?

3095
03:27:05,489 --> 03:27:06,230
[SPEAKER_42]: It's totally dumb.

3096
03:27:06,251 --> 03:27:09,916
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm straight, but I go to Pride every year and I make a t-shirt every year.

3097
03:27:10,356 --> 03:27:15,724
[SPEAKER_42]: Last year I had, I'm straight 364 days a year and on the back it said, today's your lucky day.

3098
03:27:17,423 --> 03:27:18,644
[SPEAKER_42]: That was a funny shirt, right?

3099
03:27:18,664 --> 03:27:19,264
[SPEAKER_42]: Like, why not?

3100
03:27:19,645 --> 03:27:22,126
[SPEAKER_42]: This year I had, can a straight guy get some lovin'?

3101
03:27:22,166 --> 03:27:24,748
[SPEAKER_42]: And I just walked around with my arms out and I just got hugs from dudes, right?

3102
03:27:25,168 --> 03:27:25,949
[SPEAKER_42]: Just get some hugs.

3103
03:27:26,529 --> 03:27:30,432
[SPEAKER_42]: He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens to our brothers, man.

3104
03:27:31,628 --> 03:27:34,669
[SPEAKER_42]: Gentlemen, straight boys, I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again.

3105
03:27:34,949 --> 03:27:37,810
[SPEAKER_42]: The more gay dudes there are in the world, the more boobies there are for us.

3106
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:38,310
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay?

3107
03:27:38,871 --> 03:27:39,711
[SPEAKER_42]: So help them out.

3108
03:27:40,051 --> 03:27:41,171
[SPEAKER_42]: Let them have the pride.

3109
03:27:41,211 --> 03:27:42,152
[SPEAKER_42]: Give them the pride week.

3110
03:27:42,172 --> 03:27:42,812
[SPEAKER_42]: You know what I mean?

3111
03:27:43,372 --> 03:27:45,773
[SPEAKER_42]: Put on this shirt and just go out and have a good time.

3112
03:27:46,273 --> 03:27:47,153
[SPEAKER_42]: You can bring your girl.

3113
03:27:47,213 --> 03:27:48,114
[SPEAKER_42]: No one's going to hit on her.

3114
03:27:48,394 --> 03:27:50,014
[SPEAKER_42]: So why wouldn't you bring your girl with you?

3115
03:27:50,875 --> 03:27:51,655
[SPEAKER_42]: It's the best.

3116
03:27:51,755 --> 03:27:54,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the first time I went to gay days at Disneyland.

3117
03:27:55,496 --> 03:27:58,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were two brothers and one of them says, I'm not, but he is on his shirt.

3118
03:27:58,517 --> 03:28:00,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other one says, I am, but he's not.

3119
03:28:01,570 --> 03:28:02,531
[SPEAKER_42]: I've been to Disneyland.

3120
03:28:02,551 --> 03:28:04,834
[SPEAKER_42]: I think every day might be gays day at Disneyland.

3121
03:28:04,874 --> 03:28:05,234
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know.

3122
03:28:05,995 --> 03:28:08,738
[SPEAKER_42]: This is when everybody's walking around in red shirts.

3123
03:28:09,118 --> 03:28:12,482
[SPEAKER_08]: You either think it's a bunch of death waiting to happen if you're a Star Trek fan.

3124
03:28:15,944 --> 03:28:18,385
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks guys, I'm just going to go to bed now

3125
03:28:38,814 --> 03:28:41,956
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to try to snuggle with Loki and go to sleep.

3126
03:28:42,256 --> 03:28:42,837
[SPEAKER_42]: Good night.

3127
03:28:43,017 --> 03:28:44,118
[SPEAKER_42]: Good night, Jim.

3128
03:28:44,818 --> 03:28:46,299
[SPEAKER_42]: No, I wonder, can Loki say it?

3129
03:28:46,339 --> 03:28:47,820
[SPEAKER_20]: He went to the bathroom.

3130
03:28:47,840 --> 03:28:48,781
[SPEAKER_20]: He went to pee.

3131
03:28:48,841 --> 03:28:49,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Your call made him pee.

3132
03:28:51,383 --> 03:28:53,024
[SPEAKER_42]: I scared the piss out of him, eh?

3133
03:28:53,144 --> 03:28:54,445
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, Jim.

3134
03:28:54,725 --> 03:28:55,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Take care, buddy.

3135
03:28:56,066 --> 03:28:56,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Take care.

3136
03:28:56,546 --> 03:28:56,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

3137
03:28:57,127 --> 03:28:57,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

3138
03:28:58,988 --> 03:28:59,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, my gosh.

3139
03:28:59,929 --> 03:29:00,189
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3140
03:29:00,249 --> 03:29:02,571
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to try one more call, maybe.

3141
03:29:03,811 --> 03:29:05,433
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have to say no more at some point.

3142
03:29:05,713 --> 03:29:06,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3143
03:29:06,593 --> 03:29:06,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

3144
03:29:08,083 --> 03:29:08,723
[SPEAKER_20]: Did I hit the call?

3145
03:29:08,883 --> 03:29:09,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I missed it.

3146
03:29:09,384 --> 03:29:10,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3147
03:29:10,304 --> 03:29:10,664
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

3148
03:29:13,566 --> 03:29:15,707
[SPEAKER_20]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawns Radio.

3149
03:29:16,627 --> 03:29:17,788
[SPEAKER_20]: Caller, we can't hear you.

3150
03:29:19,728 --> 03:29:20,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Caller, we can't hear you.

3151
03:29:21,189 --> 03:29:21,909
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you hear us?

3152
03:29:23,450 --> 03:29:25,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Could I just make up whatever you're saying right now?

3153
03:29:26,412 --> 03:29:26,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Try again later.

3154
03:29:28,272 --> 03:29:30,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Echo 1-2-3, kids.

3155
03:29:30,193 --> 03:29:31,334
[SPEAKER_20]: Echo 1-2-3.

3156
03:29:31,894 --> 03:29:32,254
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3157
03:29:33,835 --> 03:29:35,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3158
03:29:35,176 --> 03:29:35,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's this?

3159
03:29:37,032 --> 03:29:39,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Legend of Zaku.

3160
03:29:41,854 --> 03:29:44,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing much, just having some internet issues at home, trying to put out fires.

3161
03:29:45,155 --> 03:29:45,655
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, happy 10th.

3162
03:29:45,675 --> 03:29:45,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

3163
03:29:45,815 --> 03:29:46,595
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing much.

3164
03:29:46,615 --> 03:29:48,036
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, well, aside from you celebrating 10 years,

3165
03:30:01,297 --> 03:30:09,221
[SPEAKER_28]: Kind of a milestone in the sense that you walk from one niche genre of video games to encompass just about every genre.

3166
03:30:10,101 --> 03:30:12,182
[SPEAKER_28]: And I guess part of it was also evolving.

3167
03:30:12,862 --> 03:30:19,465
[SPEAKER_28]: You had to adapt to the fact that you couldn't just keep shoveling Vamadi for affinity.

3168
03:30:19,805 --> 03:30:23,767
[SPEAKER_28]: And at some point you had to become a bit more mainstream.

3169
03:30:24,428 --> 03:30:28,329
[SPEAKER_20]: At some point we had to go from Charmander to Charizard.

3170
03:30:28,529 --> 03:30:29,410
[SPEAKER_20]: That had to happen.

3171
03:30:30,814 --> 03:30:32,835
[SPEAKER_28]: That is true, that is true.

3172
03:30:32,855 --> 03:30:40,678
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the whole point of evolving and the fact that you adapted, you won podcast awards left and right, or you were at least nominated for them.

3173
03:30:41,058 --> 03:30:44,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Zaku, we just wanted to be the very best that no one ever was.

3174
03:30:45,180 --> 03:30:48,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, everyone thinks you should be pounding on your keyboard while you're talking.

3175
03:30:49,522 --> 03:30:50,022
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not.

3176
03:30:50,042 --> 03:30:51,522
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm on my phone right now.

3177
03:30:52,183 --> 03:30:55,524
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm still trying to set up a new router that I had to put out fires with.

3178
03:30:55,884 --> 03:30:56,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't pound the phone.

3179
03:30:59,386 --> 03:31:00,506
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, I mean, that's

3180
03:31:00,854 --> 03:31:03,916
[SPEAKER_28]: You were pretty much my routine for the past eight years.

3181
03:31:04,136 --> 03:31:06,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, almost on a consecutive basis.

3182
03:31:07,437 --> 03:31:08,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Except for the night that you were off.

3183
03:31:08,758 --> 03:31:11,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, that breaks the streak, but you get the idea.

3184
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:13,661
[SPEAKER_28]: It was pretty much consistent.

3185
03:31:14,141 --> 03:31:18,943
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, almost Sunday night, starting from 2004 onwards, was just listening to you guys.

3186
03:31:20,904 --> 03:31:22,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty much, that was it.

3187
03:31:22,605 --> 03:31:27,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Just going there, listening to all our... And that's become almost a routine.

3188
03:31:29,389 --> 03:31:29,789
[SPEAKER_28]: It is like

3189
03:31:30,763 --> 03:31:31,063
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead.

3190
03:31:31,283 --> 03:31:31,804
[SPEAKER_28]: As you were saying.

3191
03:31:32,524 --> 03:31:32,944
[SPEAKER_20]: No, go ahead.

3192
03:31:33,404 --> 03:31:47,172
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it is kind of life-changing that, you know, you have something that you, you know, that you just listen to that you try to, like, you know, out of curiosity and all of a sudden it just, like, sticks to you in a good way.

3193
03:31:47,981 --> 03:31:54,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Zaku, after all these years, what would you say would be your favorite memory involving you and OLR?

3194
03:31:54,064 --> 03:31:58,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I know that I have my favorite memory involving you and OLR.

3195
03:31:59,447 --> 03:31:59,607
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

3196
03:32:01,268 --> 03:32:01,928
[SPEAKER_28]: Me and Kat?

3197
03:32:01,948 --> 03:32:03,309
[SPEAKER_28]: Really?

3198
03:32:05,710 --> 03:32:06,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

3199
03:32:07,491 --> 03:32:12,474
[SPEAKER_28]: Well... It's got an in and out, but yeah, I get the whole point.

3200
03:32:12,654 --> 03:32:14,655
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm trying to remember right now.

3201
03:32:15,315 --> 03:32:16,196
[SPEAKER_28]: Jeez, um...

3202
03:32:17,998 --> 03:32:19,878
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Zaku.

3203
03:32:19,898 --> 03:32:23,159
[SPEAKER_28]: No matter what I tell the other callers, you're my favorite.

3204
03:32:23,199 --> 03:32:27,620
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'm right.

3205
03:32:27,640 --> 03:32:28,580
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, take care, Zaku.

3206
03:32:28,740 --> 03:32:29,500
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good night.

3207
03:32:48,737 --> 03:33:16,894

[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody has to work tomorrow, right?

3209
03:33:20,044 --> 03:33:20,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, hola.

3210
03:33:21,044 --> 03:33:22,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's the intern.

3211
03:33:22,104 --> 03:33:23,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Who let you on?

3212
03:33:23,385 --> 03:33:23,985
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Drew.

3213
03:33:24,125 --> 03:33:27,046
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the one who forgets to choose his audio input before calling.

3214
03:33:27,406 --> 03:33:30,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Echo123 intern, after all these years.

3215
03:33:30,447 --> 03:33:30,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Fired!

3216
03:33:31,368 --> 03:33:32,168
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been a while.

3217
03:33:32,268 --> 03:33:32,808
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been a while.

3218
03:33:32,848 --> 03:33:33,849
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I be unfired yet?

3219
03:33:35,669 --> 03:33:37,970
[SPEAKER_25]: If you write on the blackboard 100 times.

3220
03:33:38,170 --> 03:33:41,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Nogahide.

3221
03:33:41,931 --> 03:33:42,352
[SPEAKER_25]: I burned it.

3222
03:33:43,032 --> 03:33:43,752
[SPEAKER_25]: I burned all of them.

3223
03:33:44,532 --> 03:33:45,112
[SPEAKER_25]: All of the books.

3224
03:33:45,333 --> 03:33:46,293
[SPEAKER_25]: So what is on your mind, Drew?

3225
03:33:47,231 --> 03:33:49,011
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to congratulate you guys.

3226
03:33:49,051 --> 03:33:54,553
[SPEAKER_25]: I know I've been with you guys since episode two, and it's been a long, crazy-ass ride.

3227
03:33:54,593 --> 03:33:55,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't even there.

3228
03:33:56,173 --> 03:33:58,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Joe has you beat by one show.

3229
03:33:58,193 --> 03:33:59,514
[SPEAKER_25]: How does that make you feel?

3230
03:34:00,494 --> 03:34:00,874
[SPEAKER_25]: I know.

3231
03:34:01,374 --> 03:34:05,015
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there can be only one, so I'm going to have to take his head off one of these days.

3232
03:34:07,075 --> 03:34:08,976
[SPEAKER_20]: What was your favorite memory of OLR?

3233
03:34:09,016 --> 03:34:12,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I know I have mine involving you, and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table.

3234
03:34:13,377 --> 03:34:14,677
[SPEAKER_25]: God damn it, man.

3235
03:34:15,257 --> 03:34:15,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

3236
03:34:17,549 --> 03:34:19,170
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just, I'm just giving you shit, Drew.

3237
03:34:19,270 --> 03:34:23,952
[SPEAKER_25]: Karaoke Revolution, anything involving Karaoke Revolution, especially, uh, god, what was it?

3238
03:34:24,012 --> 03:34:27,354
[SPEAKER_25]: Episode 69, we decided to prank you with jelly beans and the milkshakes.

3239
03:34:29,475 --> 03:34:30,915
[SPEAKER_25]: And you took a sip on air.

3240
03:34:31,416 --> 03:34:31,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

3241
03:34:32,636 --> 03:34:33,937
[SPEAKER_25]: The reaction was golden.

3242
03:34:35,476 --> 03:34:36,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely priceless.

3243
03:34:36,676 --> 03:34:38,517
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll have to go find that in the OL archive.

3244
03:34:41,878 --> 03:34:43,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeez, Drew, it's been 10 years.

3245
03:34:43,639 --> 03:34:45,379
[SPEAKER_20]: You've been listening to this show for 10 years.

3246
03:34:47,300 --> 03:34:48,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, on and off, I imagine.

3247
03:34:48,640 --> 03:34:50,261
[SPEAKER_20]: What kind of impact has this show had for you?

3248
03:34:51,261 --> 03:34:58,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, for one, it gives me something interesting to talk about at conventions, but aside from that, you know, because I'm a really boring guy otherwise.

3249
03:34:59,226 --> 03:35:04,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And you did transform from being our young Republican to being a long-haired hippie.

3250
03:35:04,949 --> 03:35:05,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, I'm recovering.

3251
03:35:05,970 --> 03:35:06,790
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

3252
03:35:06,930 --> 03:35:11,193
[SPEAKER_20]: He really did go through a very psychological shift at one point, too.

3253
03:35:11,273 --> 03:35:11,353
[SPEAKER_20]: It's...

3254
03:35:13,134 --> 03:35:13,754
[SPEAKER_20]: We all grow up.

3255
03:35:13,854 --> 03:35:18,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Y'all do whatever politics you want.

3256
03:35:18,416 --> 03:35:19,336
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care.

3257
03:35:19,416 --> 03:35:20,876
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a diverse place.

3258
03:35:21,016 --> 03:35:22,497
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360.

3259
03:35:23,077 --> 03:35:26,278
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person go through that type of change, for sure.

3260
03:35:27,779 --> 03:35:26,278
360?

3261
03:35:27,919 --> 03:35:30,560
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't own one of those.

3262
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:32,601
[SPEAKER_20]: Better than the Xbox Lube.

3263
03:35:33,201 --> 03:35:35,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, Drew, any final thoughts before we let you go?

3264
03:35:36,469 --> 03:35:47,397
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm hoping for many more years to come, and I'm really appreciating the way Orange Launch Radio is going with Voice of Geeks, and hopefully everything turns out well.

3265
03:35:48,057 --> 03:35:53,000
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll still keep listening, I'll still keep phoning in, and I'll be a big part of the community.

3266
03:35:54,842 --> 03:35:56,082
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, come on, it's been 10 years.

3267
03:35:56,142 --> 03:35:57,183
[SPEAKER_25]: I grew up with you guys.

3268
03:35:58,344 --> 03:35:59,264
[SPEAKER_08]: You did, quite literally.

3269
03:35:59,304 --> 03:36:01,846
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a powerful thing to say, but yeah, in a way.

3270
03:36:01,966 --> 03:36:03,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And you went to school with me.

3271
03:36:03,727 --> 03:36:04,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I did.

3272
03:36:04,827 --> 03:36:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We would often run into each other on the lawn at ARC.

3273
03:36:09,371 --> 03:36:11,813
[SPEAKER_25]: The grassy knoll, which no shots were fired at.

3274
03:36:12,193 --> 03:36:17,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is actually now sort of off-limits since they're building the new student center.

3275
03:36:17,618 --> 03:36:19,059
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, which I will never get to see.

3276
03:36:20,120 --> 03:36:20,260
[SPEAKER_25]: Aww.

3277
03:36:20,821 --> 03:36:21,642
[SPEAKER_25]: You can always go back and visit.

3278
03:36:21,662 --> 03:36:22,302
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wait, I graduated.

3279
03:36:22,342 --> 03:36:22,642
[SPEAKER_25]: Never mind.

3280
03:36:23,343 --> 03:36:28,447
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Drew, thank you so much for being a part of the show for ten years, and we'll see you next week.

3281
03:36:29,088 --> 03:36:29,508
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely.

3282
03:36:29,769 --> 03:36:30,569
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, take care, buddy.

3283
03:36:30,589 --> 03:36:31,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one.

3284
03:36:31,790 --> 03:36:32,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

3285
03:36:33,111 --> 03:36:36,552
[SPEAKER_20]: I think with that, I'm going to finally close the Skype line.

3286
03:36:36,672 --> 03:36:44,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I am so sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B in addition to an hour and a half for Part A. Guys, it's okay because of Garrus.

3287
03:36:44,714 --> 03:36:48,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and the fact that DarkSakura and Loki do have to work tomorrow.

3288
03:36:48,795 --> 03:36:50,975
[SPEAKER_20]: I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV.

3289
03:36:51,856 --> 03:36:52,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay.

3290
03:36:52,736 --> 03:36:53,696
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is even worse.

3291
03:36:54,116 --> 03:36:54,737
[SPEAKER_20]: For a month

3292
03:37:09,136 --> 03:37:11,857
[SPEAKER_20]: with episode 463.

3293
03:37:12,917 --> 03:37:13,237
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3294
03:37:13,977 --> 03:37:16,238
[SPEAKER_20]: We got to go around and wrap up the show tonight.

3295
03:37:16,338 --> 03:37:18,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Quickly, last-minute stories.

3296
03:37:19,579 --> 03:37:22,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list, and then you can add whatever you want to it.

3297
03:37:23,140 --> 03:37:25,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Just real quickly, some last-minute stories that we didn't get to tonight.

3298
03:37:26,501 --> 03:37:27,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Super Mario Bros.

3299
03:37:27,341 --> 03:37:29,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it.

3300
03:37:29,342 --> 03:37:30,902
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a Kickstarter going on about that.

3301
03:37:31,162 --> 03:37:31,722
[SPEAKER_37]: And he's local.

3302
03:37:31,742 --> 03:37:32,302
[SPEAKER_37]: That's kind of funny.

3303
03:37:32,362 --> 03:37:36,244
[SPEAKER_20]: And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him and see if he wants to come on to OLR to promote that.

3304
03:37:36,664 --> 03:37:37,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't done that yet, but we will.

3305
03:37:38,024 --> 03:37:39,726
[SPEAKER_20]: or being violated by the copyright holders.

3306
03:38:02,259 --> 03:38:05,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Valve and Adult Swim for Team Fortress.

3307
03:38:05,164 --> 03:38:06,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie, this was one of your stories.

3308
03:38:06,646 --> 03:38:07,688
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember what this was about.

3309
03:38:07,708 --> 03:38:08,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I already forgot what it was about.

3310
03:38:09,210 --> 03:38:11,974
[SPEAKER_37]: They're doing some sort of crossover content thing or something.

3311
03:38:12,075 --> 03:38:13,277
[SPEAKER_37]: They didn't really say what yet.

3312
03:38:14,098 --> 03:38:15,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was like a quickie.

3313
03:38:16,246 --> 03:38:21,908
[SPEAKER_37]: I can only hope it's a TV series because that would be awesome based on like, you know, the meet the whomever.

3314
03:38:23,108 --> 03:38:28,750
[SPEAKER_20]: Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on Xbox.com so that's likely to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon.

3315
03:38:29,010 --> 03:38:30,770
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?

3316
03:38:30,990 --> 03:38:31,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

3317
03:38:31,670 --> 03:38:32,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing was as good as the first one.

3318
03:38:32,871 --> 03:38:33,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm serious.

3319
03:38:33,991 --> 03:38:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: We tried Sonic Adventure 2, was not as good as the first one.

3320
03:38:36,632 --> 03:38:39,253
[SPEAKER_20]: But there are some fans that will be very happy about that, I'm sure.

3321
03:38:39,313 --> 03:38:39,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're wrong.

3322
03:38:40,233 --> 03:38:42,434
[SPEAKER_20]: Jay's raising his hand over there.

3323
03:38:42,474 --> 03:38:43,614
[SPEAKER_20]: Jay, you a big Sonic Adventure 2 fan?

3324
03:38:44,235 --> 03:38:48,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if Xbox Live could take pre-orders, I'd pre-order it right now.

3325
03:38:49,800 --> 03:38:50,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Awesome.

3326
03:38:51,202 --> 03:38:54,145
[SPEAKER_20]: DreamWorks and EA are going to make a Need for Speed movie.

3327
03:38:55,776 --> 03:38:57,737
[SPEAKER_20]: because Fast and the Furious just wasn't enough.

3328
03:38:57,937 --> 03:38:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be hiding in a cave.

3329
03:38:59,819 --> 03:39:00,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Very interesting.

3330
03:39:00,619 --> 03:39:06,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Capcom plans to make some Mega Man 25th anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath over Mega Man Universe or whatever.

3331
03:39:07,004 --> 03:39:08,665
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe announce the soundtrack that's in it.

3332
03:39:08,845 --> 03:39:09,465
[SPEAKER_37]: Exactly.

3333
03:39:09,986 --> 03:39:14,589
[SPEAKER_20]: More downloads of the old stuff will be coming to your way.

3334
03:39:15,789 --> 03:39:19,111
[SPEAKER_20]: Looking quickly at the Twitter real quick, TigerClaw had sent us a couple stories.

3335
03:39:19,752 --> 03:39:24,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Marvel vs. Capcom, The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming history, coming soon.

3336
03:39:24,835 --> 03:39:26,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix.

3337
03:39:27,837 --> 03:39:29,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Yikes.

3338
03:39:29,878 --> 03:39:32,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Actdeft says, OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio.

3339
03:39:34,660 --> 03:39:42,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Virtual Phil, who was on Horde House this week, says, if you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?

3340
03:39:42,324 --> 03:39:44,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Pro tip, not Silent Hill.

3341
03:39:44,905 --> 03:39:46,526
[SPEAKER_20]: If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life.

3342
03:39:46,906 --> 03:39:53,910
[SPEAKER_20]: I would live in the Pokemon universe, because let's be real, Pokemon are adorable, and you could teach them to do your killing.

3343
03:39:54,870 --> 03:40:00,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet where that is like low on the list of harvesting.

3344
03:40:00,953 --> 03:40:02,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Where you could cuddle with Garrus?

3345
03:40:02,653 --> 03:40:04,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would live on Palavan.

3346
03:40:04,474 --> 03:40:04,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

3347
03:40:05,115 --> 03:40:10,677
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third, but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.

3348
03:40:11,057 --> 03:40:11,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Good answer.

3349
03:40:12,098 --> 03:40:12,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Anybody on the couch?

3350
03:40:12,938 --> 03:40:14,719
[SPEAKER_20]: What game world would you want to live in most of all?

3351
03:40:15,785 --> 03:40:19,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Animal Crossing Animal Crossing says Dark Tetsuya Jay?

3352
03:40:20,067 --> 03:40:27,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Infamous because coal's kind of hot Good answers, good answers Misty, did you have one?

3353
03:40:28,870 --> 03:40:37,854
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, I agree with Pokemans because, fuck, I picked my nickname from it Ah, there you go, that's true, Misty You know what just occurred to me that would actually be really good?

3354
03:40:40,935 --> 03:40:42,036
[SPEAKER_08]: The Doctor Who games

3355
03:40:44,059 --> 03:40:49,703
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

3356
03:41:09,525 --> 03:41:10,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I bug you for a minute?

3357
03:41:32,483 --> 03:41:32,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

3358
03:41:34,406 --> 03:41:39,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, well, if Alan is home from work, that means we really gotta wrap it up and get on out of here.

3359
03:41:39,452 --> 03:41:41,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, any last-minute stories you wanted to add?

3360
03:41:41,395 --> 03:41:43,698
[SPEAKER_37]: Final Fantasy XI is getting another expansion.

3361
03:41:44,399 --> 03:41:44,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

3362
03:41:45,100 --> 03:41:48,645
[SPEAKER_37]: Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting a new class Geomancer.

3363
03:41:49,181 --> 03:42:18,094
[SPEAKER_37]: Geomancer's are cool I said a long time ago it should have got Geomancer so I'm excited they're actually getting it so they're doing that and that's just kind of crazy because I guess it's also been around for a long time and then Skylanders are getting some sidekick characters and exclusive Frito-Lay things yay so you're gonna get those in bags of Frito-Lays and you get little characters that I think are compatible with the game maybe

3364
03:42:23,365 --> 03:42:36,833
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know if it's a hint or if it's sort of a tease or something, but apparently there was an image tweeted by the creator of Seaman that is a Santa Seaman.

3365
03:42:38,394 --> 03:42:44,098
[SPEAKER_37]: Perhaps hinting that there may be an announcement or a game release regarding Seaman?

3366
03:42:45,410 --> 03:42:45,690
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe?

3367
03:42:46,531 --> 03:42:49,472
[SPEAKER_20]: That's been teased for a while, I think, so that could be very interesting.

3368
03:42:50,413 --> 03:42:51,793
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

3369
03:42:53,074 --> 03:42:58,617
[SPEAKER_37]: And I guess a guy, Kim.com's launching a new Mega Upload site called Megabox.

3370
03:42:59,757 --> 03:43:01,678
[SPEAKER_37]: So it'll be interesting to see what happens there.

3371
03:43:02,579 --> 03:43:03,199
[SPEAKER_37]: Megabox.

3372
03:43:04,020 --> 03:43:07,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy XI again, to play Geomancer with him.

3373
03:43:07,962 --> 03:43:10,383
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know Shane is really good at peer pressure, right, Jamie?

3374
03:43:10,403 --> 03:43:10,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

3375
03:43:12,446 --> 03:43:14,687
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm telling you, free to play and my life is over.

3376
03:43:15,508 --> 03:43:16,028
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know.

3377
03:43:16,048 --> 03:43:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going free to play?

3378
03:43:17,149 --> 03:43:17,749
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish.

3379
03:43:18,309 --> 03:43:18,689
[SPEAKER_20]: It should.

3380
03:43:19,370 --> 03:43:26,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, man, I already started playing Lord of the Rings and then... I think by the time Final Fantasy XIV comes out, it probably would.

3381
03:43:27,478 --> 03:43:27,798
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3382
03:43:28,299 --> 03:43:31,121
[SPEAKER_20]: We really have to bring this show to a close and say goodnight.

3383
03:43:31,921 --> 03:43:37,625
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, over the past 10 years, you guys have tuned in and supported our show, and we just want to say thank you.

3384
03:43:37,846 --> 03:43:44,931
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know we never ask for your money, although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts want to help pay to keep it going.

3385
03:43:44,971 --> 03:43:47,232
[SPEAKER_20]: And trust me, we really, really appreciate it.

3386
03:43:47,292 --> 03:43:49,114
[SPEAKER_20]: But all we ask most of all...

3387
03:43:49,874 --> 03:43:53,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Tell a friend or 20 about the show and help spread the word.

3388
03:43:53,698 --> 03:43:57,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Give us a nice five-star review on iTunes or whatever pod-catching site you use.

3389
03:43:57,561 --> 03:44:00,023
[SPEAKER_20]: Stitcher Radio, you can give us thumbs-ups and stars on.

3390
03:44:00,063 --> 03:44:00,823
[SPEAKER_20]: We appreciate that.

3391
03:44:01,624 --> 03:44:03,385
[SPEAKER_20]: And just whatever to help spread the word of our show.

3392
03:44:04,326 --> 03:44:07,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Before we go, though, of course, we have to get everybody's final thought.

3393
03:44:07,909 --> 03:44:09,951
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank everybody for being here in studio tonight.

3394
03:44:10,852 --> 03:44:12,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight.

3395
03:44:13,153 --> 03:44:14,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, man, I don't even know.

3396
03:44:14,675 --> 03:44:17,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Speak up.

3397
03:44:18,772 --> 03:44:20,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, I don't even know.

3398
03:44:20,493 --> 03:44:21,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Ten years, you know?

3399
03:44:23,356 --> 03:44:24,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have a request, though.

3400
03:44:24,897 --> 03:44:25,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure!

3401
03:44:26,078 --> 03:44:29,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you find the DJ Melvis' promo?

3402
03:44:30,954 --> 03:44:31,854
[SPEAKER_20]: I think so.

3403
03:44:32,555 --> 03:44:33,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I can do that.

3404
03:44:33,735 --> 03:44:36,737
[SPEAKER_16]: I did an interview with him and he mentioned it.

3405
03:44:37,137 --> 03:44:41,039
[SPEAKER_20]: On OrangeLaunchRadio.com you can see Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now.

3406
03:44:42,339 --> 03:44:44,340
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will play that by request.

3407
03:44:44,400 --> 03:44:46,541
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long.

3408
03:44:46,561 --> 03:44:49,803
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking about Seaman in chat and Alpha Cananagram said Searyman.

3409
03:44:51,905 --> 03:44:52,785
[SPEAKER_20]: That might almost work.

3410
03:44:52,805 --> 03:44:54,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles.

3411
03:44:55,007 --> 03:44:58,090
[SPEAKER_08]: There's people requesting a Siri versus GLaDOS.

3412
03:44:58,731 --> 03:45:00,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guys there are seriously considering it.

3413
03:45:00,993 --> 03:45:01,353
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3414
03:45:02,274 --> 03:45:06,798
[SPEAKER_20]: To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, here's his final thought.

3415
03:45:07,178 --> 03:45:08,819
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

3416
03:45:09,160 --> 03:45:14,024
[SPEAKER_38]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

3417
03:45:14,910 --> 03:45:20,872
[SPEAKER_38]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

3418
03:45:21,213 --> 03:45:23,113
[SPEAKER_38]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

3419
03:45:23,694 --> 03:45:29,476
[SPEAKER_38]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

3420
03:45:29,516 --> 03:45:30,836
[SPEAKER_20]: The best things in life are free.

3421
03:45:30,856 --> 03:45:31,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, anytime, buddy.

3422
03:45:34,011 --> 03:45:37,273
[SPEAKER_20]: JV Mon, thank you so much for coming out here all the way from the Bronx.

3423
03:45:37,574 --> 03:45:38,834
[SPEAKER_20]: You're very welcome.

3424
03:45:38,854 --> 03:45:40,656

03:45:49,662 --> 03:45:50,523
[SPEAKER_17]: I did, in my pants.

3432
03:45:50,563 --> 03:45:53,645

[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

3437
03:46:03,452 --> 03:46:04,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't.

3438
03:46:04,993 --> 03:46:06,433
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to have to come back to me on that one.

3439
03:46:07,254 --> 03:46:10,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show to give that final thought later on.

3507
03:50:36,611 --> 03:50:38,493
