00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
You're listening to The Bog Network. Up next, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio, live.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Good evening, everyone. Pekaruno here from the UK.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
I just wanted to congratulate all of you at Orange Lounge Radio for your tin jubilee.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
Over the past ten years, you have provided top-notch video game news in a passionate, entertaining, but most of all, refined way.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
Even though I have not been the most regular of listeners, it is obvious to me just how much you care about both your hobby and your dedicated fans.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
To Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki, and all of your guests and listeners, congratulations once again, and long may you broadcast over us.

01:04.000 --> 01:17.000
Hi guys, it's your friendly Jessica Harper from Under Station Wives, just wishing you guys a happy ten years, and looking forward to many more with you guys.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Love the connection that we have between the shows, and definitely looking forward to sharing more in the future.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Happy anniversary. Bye.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Hey, what's up? This is Tigerclaw. I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy tenth anniversary.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
I've been listening to the radio show for many, many years now, and I really hope you guys continue doing this for ten more years.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Have a great show, and take care.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
Hey, it's Oscar calling in to wish you guys a happy ten year anniversary, and why stop there?

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Just continue for like another hundred years, because you guys are going to live forever, right? Right? Right?

01:52.000 --> 02:02.000
I want you old and wrinkly in wheelchairs and doing this show while playing DDR with your wheels or something. Okay, I'm done. Bye.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
Hey guys, it's Sturlok here, and I can't believe you guys have been doing this thing for ten years. That is awesome.

02:11.000 --> 02:23.000
And I think I've been listening for about five of those years, and I keep listening to OLR because you guys are just so much fun to hang out with and listen to.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
And you guys are pretty much how I get most of my gaming news nowadays, you and Black Wolf.

02:30.000 --> 02:47.000
And my favorite memory of the show is that I was a part of was when I managed to trick Rob with the vuvuzela on the marathon show a couple years ago, and that was a lot of fun.

02:47.000 --> 02:57.000
So have an awesome teniversary, and hey, maybe you guys will make it to another ten years. That would be awesome.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Anyway, stay black.

02:59.000 --> 03:13.000
Hey OLR, it's Aaron Toplitsky, aka YYR. Thanks so much for continuing to provide a place where all gamers truly have a voice, even somewhat demented developers of niche arcade-style games.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
I'm looking forward to giving birth to OLR dream game Bungie Farah Tossing very soon, so please look forward to playing it. I'm hoping it will be out by the end of next month, actually.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm also hoping that BFT introduces a new generation of gamers to the great thing that is OLR.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm not going to say something like, I hope you guys do this your whole lives, thank you slaves, but I hope OLR goes on as long as you guys enjoy bringing it to us.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
Once again, we all appreciate your dedication, efforts, and entertainment over the last ten years, so Jamie, Matt, Rob, thank you very much.

03:48.000 --> 04:07.000
What's up, OLR? It's Zether. I've only listened to you guys for about a year, but I have to say they're probably one of my favorite gaming podcasts to ever listen to, because if you're talking about various titles that may or may not be discussed on other gaming podcasts, I like that.

04:07.000 --> 04:23.000
I love the Classic Game of the Week segment. It's a pretty good podcast overall, and I'm really happy that you guys have been able to do it for ten years, starting out from your humble beginnings as a Bimani podcast, which I have listened to some past shows, and they were pretty entertaining, too.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
So, yeah, congrats, guys. Congrats on the ten years. Hopefully, you can do ten more of this, maybe. I don't know. Congrats.

04:32.000 --> 04:51.000
Hey, Orange Balance Radio. This is Bletch N'Zoth. We're wishing you the best. Ten years. Ten years. That's pretty long for a radio that started off as doing D.J. Armbarmani and then morphing into video games, but still, that's pretty good, and you've managed to last a decade.

04:51.000 --> 05:05.000
Whereas these guys, these other ones come and go, you have actually stayed, you know, pretty much as my Sunday night routine for the past eight years, and for that, I tip my hat to you, and no, I'm not drunk or hot. Have a good one.

05:05.000 --> 05:26.000
Hey, D.J. Armbarmanis here from Anime Jam Session. I've been a listener of Orange Balance Radio since 2005, 2006, and it's been complete and total downhill from there.

05:26.000 --> 05:51.000
The OLR community is not just friends. It's become a massive, wonderful family, and as you listen to the episodes, you understand and see that. They all talk about video games, a game of culture, and a game of lifestyle, but there are those times they have to stop and talk about other things in their life that will also affect us, and we have to sit and discuss, which I think is great.

05:51.000 --> 06:05.000
OLR has become like an outlet of where we can talk about various things that we can not really talk with our normal friends and family, I suppose, but when you think about it, you got your friends, you got your family, then you got other people.

06:05.000 --> 06:16.000
It's like you got different rankings of it, and that's what OLR has given us over the last 10 years. As for me, I admire them, and I totally respect them for what they do,

06:16.000 --> 06:31.000
and my nerdgasm came true when I was actually on an episode of OLR a few years ago where we broke the cage match, and from that point on, I said, you know, I want to do something like this,

06:31.000 --> 06:52.000
and because of what they do, and what I do with Anime Jam Session, with me, Mako, Ari, Kuro, Flair, we get together and we're starting our own family thing, and if it wasn't for three great friends playing a video game and bringing what they thought about it to the home, I wouldn't have this.

06:52.000 --> 07:13.000
So I am eternally thankful for their contribution, and in turn, I'm hopefully hoping that I can do the same thing for other people, so to Rob Roberts, Matt Loki, Jamie Summers, I thank you, congratulations on 10 years, and I will be around for another 10 more. Take care.

07:22.000 --> 07:32.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki!

07:32.000 --> 07:45.000
Tonight, June 24th, 2012, the 3DS XL is announced, will Wreck-It Ralph get a Nintendo exclusive game, and some no-name video game podcast done in some dude's spare bedroom turns 10 years old.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Orange Lounge Radio

07:50.000 --> 08:04.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back once again to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. Established 2002.

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next 10 years with my co-hosts. Say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Hi, I'm glad that after 10 years you can say Sakura right.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
It took me about 7 to get it right.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Sakura!

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Oh no, that's not the worst I've ever done.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Sakura!

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
There's been some bad ones in the past.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
There have been.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Are you gonna make me go back into the archive?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No I'm not, no I'm not.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Do I have to go back into the archive?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I think you're making me go back into the archive.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
But Rob, my answer to everything by the way now is, but Garris.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
You've become quite the little Mass Effect fangirl, haven't you? It's disturbing me a little bit.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
But Garris.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Alright, hold on, hold on. What do I have here? We have, uh.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I was still tempted to go after Thame, but Garris.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
But Garris, let's see.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
That's the answer to everything from here out, but Garris.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Let me dip back into the archives here since DarkSakura made me do it.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Make you do shit.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Let's see how I pronounce her name.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Any arcade.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Because Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
And so many different arcades.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
She gets around.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yes, I will spank your child.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
If you're not gonna do your job, god damn it, I will.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
There you go.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
In the meantime, enjoy.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
That was episode one right there. Episode one.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That was the little promo cut from episode one.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
By the way, it's not my job to parent anybody else's child.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
It's my job to mock you for not doing your job right.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Has your opinion changed after ten years?

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
Well, I will remember I was very anti-child for a long time and then I decided I wanted one.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And now I'm happy being the aunt.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Because then that means that I can go over to Becky's house and play with Julian whenever I want to and then give him back.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That's a great arrangement.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Yes, it's perfect.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
Let me go also, of course, to the man who wasn't even supposed to be here today in the beginning.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
But we just, he loved the show so much we made him a third co-host.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
And it's honestly, he retroactively is a host from episode zero through twenty.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Because how could he not be a full-time host orange entree.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
The show would not be the same without him.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Techmaster Loki.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Hi.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
How are you, Loki?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I have a headache.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Aww.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
All this time later and now you have a headache.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm sorry.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I'm sorry.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I wish I could like, I don't know, give you Tylenol or something to help you fix it.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But caffeine will work.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Nah, probably not. But we'll try.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And of course the chat room is dying to know what celebratory food for the tenth anniversary of OLR.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Um, McDonald's because it was very late.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And that's really the only reason why.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
It's because I had to get some, I was like, sitting on my couch with my laptop trying to finish something.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And I was like, ah crap, I need to leave now.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I need to just stop what I'm doing.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I need to leave now.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And the only thing that's on the way that's quick is McDonald's.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Anyhow, the always present fourth guest in our show is the chat room.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
If you guys are participating with Orange Lounge Radio live at the VoG Network.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
The Voice of Geeks Network where we tape live six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
www.vognetwork.com

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I hope you guys are participating with us at live.vognetwork.com

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And we have some folks in chat room starting off with WhatUpG tonight saying,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
OLR was two hours?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
It kind of outgrew that time frame.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
If you can believe it, the original podcast, the way we envisioned the podcast,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
the To Go Edition podcast, was supposed to be 20 minutes.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The OLR To Go Edition was supposed to be a 20 minute show.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah, that didn't work out so well.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
SSG100Matt says, Rob got better in Japanese pronunciations by reading Japanese game release dates.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Arigato.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
All right.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You actually did say that fairly decently, Rob.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm getting better.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
You're getting better.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
A little better, a little bit.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It's only taken me 10 years.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
All right.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Let's say hello over on the couch in our little cramped apartment.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We've filled things up here in the OLR studio tonight.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
We have some special guests joining us for this very special 10th anniversary show.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
And I want to say hello to them for a little bit.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Up first.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Rob, is your guy doing the Cabbage Patch?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yes, I am in the-

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Lord.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
On a DDR machine nonetheless.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
Dark Soccer is referencing the VOG Network Sony PlayStation Home Clubhouse,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
which I think I'm the only one in right now.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And he's doing the freaking Cabbage Patch.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
On a DDR machine.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
How the fuck else are we going to celebrate 10 years of this show?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
By doing a dance from the 80s.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm going to do the Cabbage Patch right now.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
We turning 10.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
We turning 10.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Thank God this is radio.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Damn it, I couldn't get my camera up in time.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Huh.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And it's radio.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You'll never get to see it.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
But these guys just saw that.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Say hello.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Joining us all the way from St. Louis, Missouri.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Say hello to Misty.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Because I know you're wondering, between delays, layovers, and actual travel time,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
it took about three days to get here.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Now that's because you don't fly.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Exactly.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
But you took the train.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
But you're like a huge train fan.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
You're a train fanatic.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
You've been places I've never been thanks to your love of trains.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
Which is ironic because my dad, for 35 years plus, probably was a train conductor.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Yet I never rode on trains.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It was this really weird thing.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You are so fired.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I guess not.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
So.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Alright, anyhow.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, hello to you.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
How are you today, I guess?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Very good.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
What made you want to be here for tonight's show?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Gee, I wonder.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Gee.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It is kind of a big deal.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Alright, say hello as well.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Joining us from, I don't remember exactly what suburb.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I just say New York City.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
It's kind of like, we're in the Bay Area, although not really.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
This next guest is from New York City.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Say hello to JV Mon.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Hello, everybody.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
How are you doing?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Good, and you?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Good.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Your first time on OLR.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
First time in person, yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Well, it's kind of hard to be on the show when you're 3,000 miles away.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Where in the city are you exactly?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm from Riverdale in the Bronx.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Okay.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh, so you're in, okay.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I can never remember.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
It's a big city.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It's a big place.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
And it's far away.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
I went once.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Once.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Once?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
What did you do in New York City?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, nothing.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Just played at Carnegie Hall.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Just a little something something.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Band trip.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What brings you to California?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
You came all the way for the 10th anniversary show, right?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
That and my sister also, yes, just for that.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Nothing else, no.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
My sister actually lives in the Bay Area, so I came to visit her.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And I've just been here for like the past week.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
And I was like, oh, my vacation comes inside with the 10th anniversary.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Might as well make a visit.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
What a nice convenience.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm sorry that the drive was all trafficy.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
You're trying to get here today.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
No, yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Well, that just gives you the full experience of living here.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Well, Pecorino says, my fellow, you're a beat nerd.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yes.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
And then Vince Raven asks if you're a Digimon.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Am I?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
My name does come from Digimon, yes.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Bimon was my favorite Digimon growing up.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yes.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Growing up.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I watched a lot of Zero Two in Japanese.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Boy, that's going to be kind of the theme of tonight, isn't it?

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
I think Dar Sakura said before the show, we're officially the podcast for middle-aged gamers.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Thank you very much.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Thank you very much.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
The show we started in our...

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That's in another 10 years.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
The show we started in our 20s is now 10 years old.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
You do the math.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's okay.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
We feel young, and that's the important thing.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Now get off my lawn.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
What kind of awesome Bay Area things have you done while you're here?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Did you go to the Metreon and have a cry?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
No.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Is the Metreon even still open?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
It's a movie theater and big empty spaces.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I haven't been to the Metreon since like 2004.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Metreon was like home of the most awesome DDR tournaments 10 years ago.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Like there was an epic, you know, one where they gave away a DDR machine,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
and then they had that epic arcade, and they had all the crane machines,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and they had the oops cat.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
What the hell?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Oops, I went to hell store.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
What was her name?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
That mascot.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I used to love those shirts.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Somebody in chow will think of it.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
And then there's the official Sony store was there as well.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
And now they're talking about putting a Target in there.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
The fuck?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And look, I love Target, but...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
You know they have like the gamer walk of fame?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
That little catwalk thing?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
They do. That's right. That is there.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
But I always remembered the half-faded DDR machine where they never moved it,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
and so half of it was like white, and the other half of it was like DDR machine,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and even the screen was faded.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
It was awful to play on.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But Garris.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
So what cool Bay Area things have you done while you've been here?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Since it's my first vacation in like four years, and my first time out here in like eight,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I've just been doing a lot of touristy stuff.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Touristy stuff?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I've been pretty much at all the tourist tracks.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
You went to Pier 39, and Alcatraz, and Napa.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I went to Sonoma, not Napa.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh, excuse me, princess!

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
It's all booze.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
I got myself lots and lots of wine. I was very happy.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Good times.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
But I went to Pier 39 and saw what it became. I saw the Riptire arcade was gone.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yep, that we...

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I cried a little bit. I was like, oh, that hurts my soul.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
We broadcast live from that sports bar that used to be an arcade in the back there.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
That was actually, I gotta say, that was one of our earliest achievements really as a station,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
was that we did, we used to do broadcasts from DDR tournaments,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
and we did the Sacramento ones, of course, we broadcast.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Not that very first one in Folsom, because we didn't really have the ability to do it,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
but I know we did a couple from Scandia,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
and then we took our rig all the way to the Bay Area and broadcast live from that.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I think the tournament was called B3, and it was a great time.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Because that was when me and Megumi decided we were going to just leave the second day.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Awesome. So, yeah, good times.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay, and when do you leave?

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
I leave Tuesday, which I'm kind of sad I don't get to go to your birthday celebration.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Let's not talk about that on air. Maybe after the show.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Whoops.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
All right.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
You heard nothing.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
I like the listeners to know me, but there's some things they don't need to know about me.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
And what we're doing to celebrate my birthday, not everybody needs to know.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Maybe later, if you're good.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Reading a good book with a cup of coffee.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That's right. Of course.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
We're going to have a poetry slam.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
In case you don't know, my birthday is the same week as OLR, like by pure coincidence.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
We implanted that way, but my birthday is Tuesday, so, you know, yay, I'm old.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
All right.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
Also joining us tonight, now, he didn't travel a great distance, but his journey has been especially long.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
He's the one person I know was here for episode one that has been here for pretty much every single episode since.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I mean, give or take a couple.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
He probably tuned into it on the podcast at some point.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen, here in the studio tonight, OLR's oldest listener.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
You know, not like actual age, but like how long he's been listening.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Say hello to Dark Tetsuya.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Hey, guys.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
How you doing, Dark Tetsuya? You might want to talk to this mic.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh, good, good.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
So, what's new?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Oh, not too much, you know, just hanging in there.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Not us.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Since you've been listening to OLR for such a long time, you were here for episode one,

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
and now here you are for episode number 462, which is the 10-year celebration.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
What's changed in 10 years?

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
Well, well, DDR kind of died.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
If you were in PlayStation Home right now, it would look like it's still – look at that.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Tiger Claw got up on the machine with me, and now we're both dancing.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
You would think DDR is all the rage if you were in the VOG Clubhouse right now on Home.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So, it's still the rage.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
What has kept you motivated to listen to this show over the past 10 years?

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't know, just, you know, being able to hang out with you guys all this time.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Did you hear that, Dark Sakura? We're awesome.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I know, and old.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Dark Tetsuya, if this happens to be somebody's first week listening to OLR,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
what piece of advice would you give them about the show?

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
Oh, man, I – put me on the spot here.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know, man, just –

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Be prepared for anything.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Be prepared to freeze up because it's live radio and anything can happen.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Absolutely. It's live and uncensored.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
And we do have one more guest here in studio tonight that is dying to say hello.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Say hello, final guest tonight.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
That's right, the OLR ferret is in the house.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Actually, this is the OLR ferret's cousin because we don't know where the original OLR ferret is,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
but this is an imposter that's here on the show tonight.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
Thanks to the magic of radio, you guys won't know the difference anyway.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
There you go, OLR ferret there in the house.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, there we are.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
Thank you guys so much to all you guys in our chat room and podcast feed and so much for tuning into the show.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
You know, we did start the show 10 years ago.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
We were three friends who all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
And, you know, the scene was really hopping then.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
There was tournaments and, you know, all these things that would go on, a huge website, DDR Freak, that everybody posted on.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It was a really big community.

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
And because I was co-participating in a show about another community, a Rocky Horror Picture Show show called Under Sedation Live,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
that was born of that community, I kind of had that seed planted in my head.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
And Dark Sakura did as well, having guessed it on that show so many times.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Hey, why couldn't we do something like this for the DDR community?

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Let's take a show and then have it just be all about tangents and say it's about the community.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
And that's kind of what happened.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Oh, by the way, this is really good coffee, Rob. Thank you.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
You're welcome. Anytime.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
So, and here we are 10 years later.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And granted, the shows had to evolve a few times.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
We went from being two hours to three hours.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
Then we started doing this little thing called a podcast that who knew that Apple was going to latch onto it and it was going to take off.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
And then, you know, we've been on three different networks now.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
And it's just it's been a crazy ride.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But here we are. Some things stay the same.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And here we are after 10 years.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And I really want to just thank you guys for being a part of it.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
Whether you started listening last week or this week or your dark Tetsuya who's been listening for the past 10 years or anywhere in between.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
I just really want to thank you guys for your support because I can't speak for Dark Soccer and Loki.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I'll let them speak in a minute here.

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
But if you ask me what kind of motivates me over the past 10 years to continue to do this show and I get asked this quite often by other podcasters.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
You know, there's a lot of great people that have achieved a lot of great things out in podcasting.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
But occasionally I get asked from a podcaster who's been doing it for six months.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
This is a lot of work. How have you done this for the past 10 years?

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And for me, it's honestly the fact that somebody is listening.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
And by somebody, I mean one person listening is is an amazing accomplishment.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
I mean, it really is. And just the fact that now you guys show up and it's like the thing we all do on Sunday.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
It is it is a true community that we've built here.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I mean, it's a small community. We're not IGN.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
We're not one of the top shit. We're not one of the top 100 podcasts and video games on iTunes.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
We're not really a top thing, but we like what we've built and we like this community that we have.

23:38.000 --> 23:46.000
And, you know, it's it's such a huge motivator to have you guys turn up and just enjoy listening to our random rants on gaming.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
You know, because obviously we don't have the resources to break gaming news.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Once in a while, we might then get in big trouble for it.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
But it's it's awesome that, you know, you guys turn it tune in to hear our opinions.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
And we're so thankful. Dark Soccer, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
Oh, my God. Actually, I just got a link from one of our listeners who wrote us,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
who played a happy birthday song for us on Ukulele on YouTube.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm going to send this to you. Really? He used to work with Dan.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, yeah. Well, is it safe to play on air?

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I can't hear it on here. So I guess that's the only way we'll find out.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
All right. I'll cue it up. But in the meantime.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
But my motivation is Rob making me a cup of coffee every week.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
And Garris.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Garris is the reason for life.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
No, it's pretty much what you said. That and, you know, needing my ego.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
To be petted like it's a fine Persian cat.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
You want your E-peen to be huge.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
No, I want my E-vage to be tight.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Wow.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I've been waiting to say that for a while.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Wow. That's one to send to Travis. All right.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Loki, what's kept you motivated for 10 years?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
I'm motivated. It's news to me.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Bacon. Bacon has kept you motivated.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't know. I just come here every week.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Well, you know, I you and I personally went through some really big changes.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I'm sure Dark Sakura too. But I'm thinking of, you know,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
you had a big personal life thing happen during the show.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I had a big personal life thing happen during the show where I was very sick and I damn near died.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And I think you heard Rama say it there in the little piece of the opening there.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Like sometimes we kind of get into these things about our lives that really have nothing to do with gaming.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
But the fact that you guys still like care like means a lot.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And, you know, I know there was a lot of people thinking of me when that was going on,

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
thinking of you when you had your crisis going on, thinking of Dark Sakura.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
I don't know when she gets sick every week. No, I'm sure Dark Sakura had something.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I don't get sick every week.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Every other week.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I started a job.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Actually, you did. Well, you. Well, OK.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
The chatters thinking of you when you were going through two years almost of unemployment, right?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah. And I actually I was doing the show when I had the plague.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
That's true.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
I remember when I was doing the show for three months with pneumonia.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
So. But the fact that you guys, you know, kind of care means an awful lot anyway.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
By the way, chat room, no one wants a huge vag.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Just saying. All right. That's not good for anybody involved.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Look, I just want to plug this to as well.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Vogue network dot com. The voice of Geeks Network.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
As you know, our third network where we've done O.L.R., it's new.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's still kind of got the new paint smell.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
There's lots of exciting things that are happening at Vogue Network.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Our forums just got a facelift this week. They look great.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I do want to plug as well. Make sure you check into tonight's show.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
If you're listening live, you get a special piece of one time loop for listening.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Podcast listeners, I'm so sorry we don't have anything for you yet in that regard.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
But I do want you to know we are working on podcast listeners being rewarded as well.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
Keep in mind the site is only a month old and we have one guy, Bobby Black Wolf.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
He's the man building it all.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
So do you know, we want to be fair for everybody and let the podcast folks have their say too.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
But we just need a little more time to get all that program.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
So bear with us.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So am I going to play this? Am I going to play the birthday song here?

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
This is a birthday song from, what's the name he goes by now?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Shezro? Is his name online I think?

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Here we go. I'm going to play this YouTube here.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Hey, what's up guys? It's your boy, Scarzo.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Just want to give a quick birthday shout out to the one and only OLR aka Orange Lounge Radio.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
Man, ten freaking years. Ten years running strong, making a kick ass live show and a wonderful podcast.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my fart, I mean heart, yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So anyway, before this video gets...

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Did he say the bottom of his fart?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Maybe he was going to say his fucking heart.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
His fucking heart.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
But he censored himself and then it made it sound like he said fart.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Camp, I don't wanna, we love you in our hearts.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
And when I think about you, you make me wanna...

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Too long, I take too much of your time.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm just going to play a song for you real quick. Check it out.

28:35.000 --> 28:53.000
Anyway, happy 10th birthday Orange Lounge Radio and thank you so much for being a great part of my life.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
The show rocks. Like who else is going to get serenaded by a ukulele?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
That's awesome.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That's so awesome. Thank you so much for that.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
I'm dying to know what this related video here is on the side that says Asian Giggles.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
But I guess I'll have to find out another time.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
Because we have to get into our gaming weeks and the type of stuff that you have been playing this week, your gaming week.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
How was it? Dark Soccer, starting us off tonight.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Garris.

29:22.000 --> 29:36.000
Okay, I beat Mass Effect on Friday and promptly installed Mass Effect 2 because I, when I found out that the digital deluxe version was on sale for 11 bucks with the first one, thank you Shane.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
I bought it, which my husband congratulated me on buying two copies of the same game.

29:43.000 --> 29:55.000
And then I spent the money that I would have spent for the Steam version, that extra 10 bucks, and bought the Kasumi download content so I could have Badass Ninja Chick.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
She is amazing. I love her so much. You'll love her.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
But it came with the, whatever. Dan Shadow has been congratulating us and he wants to send us an email.

30:07.000 --> 30:17.000
So anyway, but it also came with the Cerberus Network pack and Zaid, who I actually really dig because he makes me think of Jane from Firefly.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I think he's kind of a dick, but whatever.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Well that's why he makes me think of Jane from Firefly because Jane's a lot of a dick.

30:24.000 --> 30:37.000
And Grunt kind of is weird but yeah, so I've gotten like a bunch of the other characters and I had myself like a little girlgasm when I found Garris again because I was happy.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
And I've, so I've actually been playing Mass Effect 2 for 14 hours to the point that I, and I was already a little sick.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
And I got so motion sick playing it doing the Normandy crash which actually made me cry a little bit because Presley's dead.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
OMG spoilers in those first five minutes. Whatever.

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
So anyway, I actually got so motion sick I threw up and had to stop playing for about 10 minutes until I turned it back on and played until 5am.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Overslept and missed my spot on Girls Gone Wow this morning.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.000
How is Sil gonna feel that too much Mass Effect made you miss Girls Gone Wow Wednesdays on VOG?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
That I was also like really not feeling well. Oh I'm sorry.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I missed seeing Brave this morning too because Dan was going to take me to see Brave and I was like I didn't sleep.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And then I apparently texted you in my sleep.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
Well you're not alone in your love for Garris by the way we have Fifth Dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I have girlgasms for Garris and I'm a boy.

31:34.000 --> 31:51.000
Okay see see. Anyway so I did actually play some World of Warcraft like for because we have the Druid Guild, Druidia. So if you're playing Alliance on Blade's Edge we are called Druidia and you have to be a druid to be in it.

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
Because I actually think it would be hilarious to be a raiding guild with nothing but druids. Don't you think so?

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
And Rob's got one in there. Miss Nomi Malone. I do I have Nomi Malone. I'm a dancer not a stripper. Yeah.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
So I did a little bit of that and I'm still playing the Mass Effect 3 data pad on my phone.

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
Which I mean because like six hours I check it do more missions turn it off check it another six hours you know because that's how long it takes.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Because my galactic will be readiness by the time I play Mass Effect 3.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
Awesome. I fucking love Mass Effect 2 so much more than the first one. Right?

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
Garris. Like it's not that the first one's a bad game. Bitch needs to give me his mission.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
He will soon. He needs to give you more than that I imagine. Some bird love.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Alright anyhow anything else in your gaming week DarkSira? Mario Marathon.

32:45.000 --> 32:55.000
Oh yes this is the weekend for them. That was sort of part of my gaming week because we watched people in odd Mario costumes with a neat looking game room play Mario.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
They were on 64 when I stopped watching.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
I almost feel bad because we have some people that have been tweeting us and so forth saying that they stopped watching Mario Marathon to come you know to our 10th anniversary show.

33:04.000 --> 33:14.000
Which I deeply appreciate I almost feel bad because that's a charity event but I'm sure y'all are watching and donating and I figure you know if you're watching them for 72 hours you can spare one for us.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
And since we aren't asking for donations tonight we will say go donate to a great charity child's play through Mario Marathon.

33:20.000 --> 33:30.000
Well Dan and I donated and if you look at when they hit level 72 you will see Dan and Jamie parentheses OLR.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Oh nice.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
So that's our donation put them to level 72.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Very cool.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
So go look at their page and give them some money after the show.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Awesome. Let's move on and Tech Master Loki how was your gaming week?

33:46.000 --> 33:57.000
I played Minecraft. More Minecraft. I've been working on the mine cart track entrance to my giant volcano thing.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
How are you dealing with Friday's patch?

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh it's just fine. There's still way to do pin it so it doesn't matter.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Of course. Of course where there's a will there's a way.

34:05.000 --> 34:14.000
And then what else. Oh I played Lollipop Chainsaw and I'm disappointed.

34:14.000 --> 34:30.000
I mean how do you take a game that has a scantily clad cheerleader fighting zombies with the music by Akira Yamaoka and you know over the top madness that you would see in Suda51 and make it completely boring.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
How is that possible?

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
I mean you just can't but yet they found a way to do it.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
And yes it is an incredibly boring game that I literally said I'm not playing the same word.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
That's really disappointing.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I want to play it.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
I know I still want to play it.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
It's my friend's copy.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Oh.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Don't.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Anything else?

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
A little bit Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3 and yeah that was it.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
So I didn't play a lot of new games this week but I think I might have a problem.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Because here's the thing.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
So I have Mass Effect on Xbox right?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
And Dark Soccer.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Oh shoot.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
I know right. I had Mass Effect on Xbox until a certain co-host of mine took the copy.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
That's all right. No because wait till what I'm going to say next.

35:18.000 --> 35:26.000
But Shane's been bugging me to play it on PC and then Alan plays it on PC as well and he's like oh the graphics are better and da da da da da.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Which is true.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Your video card will look so nice.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Da da da.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
And then I saw that Amazon sale where I could get the first two games for $11.99.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So I was like ah all right I'll buy it.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
I'll buy it.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
So I started playing Mass Effect 1 again and this time I'm playing as her Renegade and da da da.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
And then somebody told me that Mass Effect 3 was on sale at Best Buy for $39.99.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
So I bought Mass Effect 3 again on PC.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
That's right.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
I own the entire Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360 and PC now.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
And I've been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer almost all weekend long when I haven't been doing stuff for the show.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
I don't feel bad anymore.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Like it is addicting.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
And I got to say you know I'm not trying to start an Xbox versus PC war.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
There's advantages to both.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
There really are.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
I do miss playing on my TV.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I like that and you know there are some advantages to the controller.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
But I got to say I am so much better with the keyboard and mouse.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
And that surprised me because I remembered in the past games like Halo and things like that I was way better with the controller.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
But Mass Effect my headshot count like tripled with keyboard and mouse.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm so much better with it.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
And like I am kicking ass with my engineers which is the class I love to play in multiplayer.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
My little combat drones and setting people on fire.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
It's amazing.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
I'm playing in Adept.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
So but I have literally bought the same game.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Same three games.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Twice.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
On two different systems.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I have a problem.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Loki do I have a problem?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
He's nodding yes I have a problem.

36:58.000 --> 37:04.000
You know what Rob don't feel bad about that because anyone who is a Street Fighter fan feels your pain.

37:04.000 --> 37:11.000
Just look at how many different copies and different consoles worth of Street Fighter 3 I have.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Alright.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Otherwise that was pretty much it as far as like making.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I played some World of Warcraft and some of the other stuff too that I've kind of been playing things on the iPhone and so forth.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
But not a lot of new stuff.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
So that's really it for my gaming week.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Let's all and yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
This is the really sad part.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
You ready?

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
Shane is in our chat room who goes by Shane Olenko says Rob now has more Mass Effect than I do.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Jim Sally in our chat says that's a little too much Mass Effect hoarding sky.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
But I agree mouse and keyboard equals sexy headshots.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Actually Jim Sally let me talk about this since I did have a short gaming week.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
This whole Mass Effect 3 thing where I'm better with the keyboard and mouse actually has me thinking.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
Oh my God maybe I should like get into first person shooters.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
What is happening to me?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Well you know how I got into PC gaming right?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
What?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
My hand.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Oh yeah because when your hand was was not as well.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And I'm doing all this with a trackball.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
So.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
But like I literally sat there today like seriously you guys have listened to the show a long time.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Many of you.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
You guys on the couch you've all been listening for a long time.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I sat there looking at the PC going.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
Maybe I should give battlefield a try.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Something's happening to me and I don't like it.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Suddenly I want to play first person shooter.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Are you feeling not so fresh?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
This is so weird.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Like am I going to want Madden next?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Rob needs a gaming douche.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Oh my God.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Anyhow.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I think I may have to try.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I think I'm going to try a first person shooter.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Chat.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I'm going to ask chat.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Chatters.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
What first person shooter should I play next?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
If I enjoy Mass Effect multiplayer.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
What first person shooter should I play next?

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
I'm going to ask the chatters that while we go around to the folks on the couch.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Guesting here tonight and ask about your gaming week.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Misty how was your gaming week?

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
More than, it was actually more existent than I anticipated.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
And even for being on a train.

39:10.000 --> 39:19.000
StepMania oddly works better than you might think at 79 miles per hour.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
Played some other casual PC games considering I generally didn't have an internet connection.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
Dabbled at Pocket Planes a bit.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
That seems to be it.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Alright.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Playing games on the train.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Going faster than the speed of light.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Not really but.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Going to our chat room.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I want to see some of the comments here.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Let's see.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Jim Sally says Battlefield on PC.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Nietzsche says Battlefield 3.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Act Def says screw that get Team Fortress 2.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I do like Team Fortress.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
I have played a little Team Fortress.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
That is kind of fun actually.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Because I like playing a healer in that and using the little like bandaging gun.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
That's actually kind of fun.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
It's like the opposite of other first person shooters where you're not shooting things.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
You're like shooting them with life.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Dark Knight says Monday Night Combat.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I've heard that one's pretty good.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Drunami says Gears of War.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I see a lot of people seeing Halo.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
See I loved Halo 1 and Halo 2.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
You guys keep shouting Halo 4.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I can't play a game that's not out yet.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
I was not in love with Halo 3 I got to say.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Borderlands says Degenerate Johnny.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I do have that on Steam.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And I tried to play that for a little bit.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
So maybe I should go back and do that.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Zether says Quake Live.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I do love Quake.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Quake is real good.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So thank you for the suggestion.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I second Borderlands because you like loot right?

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
You like loot in Diablo and stuff like that?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I like loot at vognetwork.com.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Well I'm just saying that you can also.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
That's basically a first person shooter with a lot of loot.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
That's cool.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
You like tons of weapons.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I like shinies.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
It's funny.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Alright I think Borderlands might be a winner.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
I'll have to check that out.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Is there multiplayer in Borderlands?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
4 player co-op.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh sweet.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Kind of like Mass Effect.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I like co-op shooters because people are nicer on that.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Like I have yet to meet jerks on Mass Effect.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
One thing that really annoyed me about Mass Effect though.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
I forgot to say this.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Okay buying it on Best Buy.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Fuck that Best Buy front end program that I had to use to download it.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Because once I downloaded it.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Origin wouldn't even recognize the download.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Thank God it took my key.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I had to re-download.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I had to download 10 gigs twice.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Because that stupid Best Buy front end program can't talk to Origin.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
And I'm still not Origin's biggest fan.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
I will say it is integrated very well and it has a nice interface.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
I mean it's fucking better when it's all your games right?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
But.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah I was really pissed at having to download 10 gigs of stuff twice.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Anyway.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Hi JV Mon.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Sorry.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Hello.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
How was your gaming week?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Pretty good.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I've been playing Vita and 3DS.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Luminous Electronic Symphony.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Pokemon Black.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
And at my sister's place I've been playing Hexic.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Nice.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
I think Luminous is the only Vita game people are still playing actually.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
It's kind of the one that has the most replayability out of the launch lineup.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Well I reserved a copy of Gravity Rush at work.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
But the shipment never came in before I left for work the day before I flew out here.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
So I'm kind of sad I didn't get to play that because the demo was so good.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
You know what I need to get the demo for since you brought up 3DS.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
That Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance demo.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Yes.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah I want to check that out.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Bobby's talking about tonight.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
I just played that too.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
That was pretty good.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Nice.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Nice.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
And what else have I been playing?

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Civilization III even though you'd think it's terrible.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Worst one in the series but okay whatever.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Don't worry Rob everyone's allowed to be wrong.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
That's right you are allowed to be wrong.

42:58.000 --> 43:05.000
I'm just saying Civ V is like 11 billion times better and just had an expansion this week.

43:05.000 --> 43:11.000
Which I have yet to check out because I know when I start playing it I will come out like 3 days later.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
I'll probably check out Civ V once my boyfriend gets a better PC.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Because we play together so that's the main reason why we play Civilization.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Okay that's cool.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah I think Civilization III is like the most recent one he can run on his computer.

43:25.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh I see it's one of those situations where somebody's using a computer that's old for lack of a better term.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Yeah.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Alright.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Dark Tetsuya what have you been playing this week in gaming?

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Not too much I mean a little dusted off the 2DS controller played a little bit of that.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
We can barely hear you so I'm going to have you switch mics.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Dusted off the 2DS controller.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
I've been playing a little bit of that on PlayStation 2.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Let's see a little bit of StepMania.

43:56.000 --> 44:04.000
I've been doing this weekly thing where I bust it out every Saturday and just play till I drop.

44:04.000 --> 44:13.000
That and probably a little bit of New Super Mario Brothers Wii trying to get all the World 9 coins and levels done.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And a little bit of Mario Kart.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
I was thinking about Mario Kart today because I wanted to throw a red shell at the car in front of me but hey that's whatever.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
You reminded me of something that I did in my gaming week though that I wanted to talk about.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Is that Misty and I went on an adventure yesterday.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
We went on an adventure to break the law.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
No we thought about it but we went to Roseville Golf Land.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
Which you know we have a long history with Golf Land here on this program.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
It is the place we all met right?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Milpitas.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
Every year we go to Roseville Golf Land it gets sadder and sadder.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
So Misty and I went this weekend.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It's the first time I've been there in a year and a half.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Easy.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And let me put it this way.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
The game I got the most excited about was when I went in the back corner and I was like.

45:02.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh my God they have a working Soul Calibur 2 machine here.

45:10.000 --> 45:17.000
I was just glad that there was a Guitar Freaks machine there because I was actually in the mood to play it.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
So I ended up doing like two credits in that and one credit in the next two.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Didn't even touch the Disney Mix.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I played doubles on Disney Mix.

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
I actually got my butt up on a DDR machine for the first time in a couple years and I played doubles on Disney Mix.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Because I'm hardcore.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Anyhow.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Alright.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
That's enough for our gaming weeks.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Let's move on folks.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
We got to get into the news tonight.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
A little bit of housekeeping.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
We're going to open up the show for extended calls a little later on.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Part B. There's not going to be much news in Part B tonight.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Just you guys.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Emails, tweets and phone calls.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
So get us added to Skype if we're not already on there.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Or get the phone number down.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
We'll be taking those calls in the second half of our show.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
But for now let's get to tonight's news.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And Loki's going to start us off with gaming news.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Yes.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Let's talk about...

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
It's kind of a duh.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Because we knew that there was a new system coming.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Just...

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
We thought that would be a little something something extra on there.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
But it's not.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So apparently there is a new 3DS coming.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
The 3DS XL is a larger version of the 3DS.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
No duh.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
And it doesn't have another circle pad.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It only has one circle pad.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
What are they doing?

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
So it's a giant 3DS that now doesn't work with the circle pad pro and other accessories.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Like the...

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
I don't think it works with the...

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Circle pad pro attachment?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Like the circle pad pro attachment.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Yeah.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So Nintendo really just fucked that thing didn't they?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Yeah.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
It's hilarious too because there's a nice blank spot where there could have been the circle pad.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Except um...

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
I'm assuming that that's where the battery is now.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Well...

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
No there probably was supposed to be a circle pad there but they didn't want to like...

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Admit failure so they just said...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
We'll just put it out larger.

47:10.000 --> 47:17.000
Is it possible that they might release a circle pad pro XL and in a smart move this time not make it exclusive to one store?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
So that maybe I'll get one?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
So how wide is this thing gonna be?

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
I mean seriously if it's larger as it is I gotta add something on top of that?

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
It's gonna be like 4 feet long.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
I mean...

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
It's ridiculous.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Why would we...

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm just glad I don't have a 3DS anymore.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
Well not that I would necessarily have to buy the circle pad pro because I'm not playing any games that would...

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Utilize it like Resident Evil which was apparently not very great.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
The new Kingdom Hearts supposedly uses it.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
If you're a lefty you get a lot of use out of it especially in like Kid Icarus and some of that.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Um...

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Well...

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
You would if you know...

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
You can hold on to...

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah if you can actually hold the thing yeah.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
I...

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
There's a lot I like about the XL.

48:02.000 --> 48:09.000
I mean obviously if you've played a DSi XL those screens are gorgeous and it's nice to have like that huge screen.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
You know it's really cool.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
So I like the idea that there's gonna be a 3DS that's huge like that.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
I'm hoping that you don't have to hold it further away from your face to get it to work right.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
I'm imagining they calibrated it a little differently so it'll be okay.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Um...

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
But yeah I mean the bigness is gonna be nice it's gonna make the games look even better.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Which is exciting but then I...

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
The realist in me is like dude you already have a 3DS you don't need another one.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I mean yeah it has better battery life.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Whatever there's no...

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
There's really no must have thing.

48:40.000 --> 48:47.000
If you need more battery life you can buy an extra battery for like another 30 bucks instead of buying a new system for another $200.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
If I...

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah if I didn't have a 3DS I'd buy this.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
But now I'm worried because Alan doesn't have a 3DS.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
He's gonna be like Rob I want that for Christmas.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
Anyways yeah the new top screen is almost 5 inches up from 3.5 inches.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
And also the bottom screen is 3 inches as opposed to...

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Or it's from 3 to 4.18 inches.

49:12.000 --> 49:20.000
And apparently I guess if you do 1 to 1 mode on it for the DS stuff it's actual size for you know the regular DS.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Which would be nice because I think it's pretty tiny on the original 3DS.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Although I didn't play that many DS games so who knows.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
And of course yeah price $1.99.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
So August 19th.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Alrighty and that's the same day that that...

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
I know this isn't coming up on our show roll so we can mention here that Mario...

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
New Super Mario Brothers 2 with Coin Orgy or whatever is the subtitle of that game.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
With the whole DLC.

49:48.000 --> 49:55.000
Now Nintendo is like alright I guess we'll do DLC even though we used to put out quotes against DLC.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I guess that's kind of where things are going.

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
But you notice that Reggie stressed in that video this is a full featured game out of the box.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
The DLC is just something extra for this whole like coin rush thing or whatever.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
And why should I buy the DLC?

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
I mean I don't know they're just experimenting.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Because this whole online stuff is very new for them.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
They have never been online before.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
What a decade into the internet or two decades into the internet.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
And this is their first time getting online.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
It's like an elderly person getting a computer for this decade.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
You know some things never change.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Why is it talking to me?

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
It's nice to have that consistency that 10 years ago Nintendo didn't get online and they still don't.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Some things have to stay the same.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
They need to grow up though.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Going to some comments in our chat room.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I almost said the old one there.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Live.vognetwork.com for the people participating.

50:53.000 --> 51:00.000
Shimapanic says the only thing I don't like about it same resolution but bigger screen.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
So it's less pixel depth.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I'm still getting one.

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
YYR says I mean it should be more than $30 cheaper considering the difference in screen size.

51:10.000 --> 51:17.000
And I guess that's oh the whole fact about the DSi XL. What the hell is going to happen to that?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
That's a good question.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Will that go down in price?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I imagine they've got to phase out the old DS.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
They already dropped the DSi XL price back in May.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Might have to drop it again.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
He makes a point there.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Only $30 difference.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
That's going to really kill the DSi XL.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
They need to put that out for $99.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
Tigerclaw in chat asks a Nintendo related question.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
Says Rob, since you own the entire Mass Effect collection on the 360 and PC,

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
are you going to get Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U to complete it?

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
It depends what new awesome thing they're going to put on it.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
You're also assuming I'm going to buy a Wii U.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I may not at this point.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
It really depends on how great those games are.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So we'll see.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Let's move on to some more news. This is Nintendo related.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
It's about a highly anticipated Nintendo game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
We knew that Nintendo was working on this game,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
but what we didn't know that was announced this past week,

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
Namco Bandai is involved, and Bandai Namco both ways.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Both those studios are helping on the game.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Two folks at Namco were singled out to be working on this.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
Kobayashi and Yoshihito Higuchi are both working on this game.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
That's interesting.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Not the first time Nintendo and Namco have worked together.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
And for the haters, I just want to remind you,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
the last time Nintendo and Namco worked together in part with Sega,

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
we got the greatest fucking GameCube game we ever had, which was F-Zero GX.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
So, but then I think, all right,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
but Nintendo doesn't let third parties really do their games very often.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
The last time they did, we got Metroid Other M.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
I didn't dislike it as much as other people did,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
but I understand why some people were really turned off by Other M.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
So what do you guys think? Namco Bandai is involved now.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I think that means it's pretty obvious.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
We're going to see some Namco characters show up now

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
as kind of those extra characters where we had Sonic and Snake

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
and all those characters before.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
We're going to get what? We'll have Pac-Man.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
What's really exciting, maybe we'll get the Prince from Katamari to Mashi,

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
although he's never been on a Nintendo product, has he?

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Or was there a DS version of Katamari that I'm not thinking of?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
There was supposed to be a DS version, but I don't think they ever made it.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So maybe the Prince couldn't be there.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
What? Maybe from the Tales games? I don't know.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I might be stretching here, but what?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
They could still do the Prince.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Pac-Man's going to eat him up, yum, yum.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
That's true.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Just because, you know, they could do this stuff from the old school Namco games.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Mm-hmm. Like really old school games?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Like Dig Dug.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, Dig Dug. The Digger? Actually, that could be really bad

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
if they have a character in the game called Digger.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That could be very bad.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Mr. Driller.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Oh, Mr. Driller. That's even better.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Mm-hmm.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Or maybe Mitsurugi.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Vandy in our chat room suggests his pole position.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
LocoPoco suggests Klonoa.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Yes!

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
That was a huge PlayStation thing, wasn't it?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
And they'll have Hupal.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Oh, they did have Klonoa on GameCube.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Or, excuse me, Game Boy Advance, I'm pretty sure, at least, had one game.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
And the Wii.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
And the Wii?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Yeah.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I guess that could happen. There you go.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
But, I mean, what about the Valkyrie?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Mm.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
From that game that never came out in the U.S.

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
What do you guys on the couch think about Super Smash Brothers being developed by Namco, in part?

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
JVMon, aren't you a Smash Brothers fan?

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
Yeah, but it's not gonna come out for, like, another five years,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
so it's no point getting excited for it now.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Good point. Let's move on.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Darth Zakra.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Garris. I mean, sorry, Mass Effect 3.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
The Extended Cut DLC will be out for the PC, Xbox 360, on June 26th,

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
and on the 4th of July, which means it's already out for those two platforms,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
and it'll be out on the 4th of July on the PS3.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
By the way, just tangent.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Actually, it's not already out, because that's my birthday.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
My birthday's Tuesday.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Sorry, brain. I'm a week ahead, Rob. I'm a week ahead.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
That's all right.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
But, by the time some of these people download it, you know.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
That's true.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
But, by the way, what the hell, 4th of July on a Wednesday, anyway.

55:26.000 --> 55:34.000
So, it's going to expand on the events at the end of Mass Effect 3 through, quote,

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
additional cinematic sequences and epilogue scenes.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
And there's another quote on here on how to access it.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
To experience the Extended Cut, load a save game from before the attack on the Cerberus base,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
and play through to the end of the game.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
I had to do my, uh, sorry.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Welcome to, no.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Welcome to the Citadel.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Stop.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Sorry.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
No, I actually laugh at the chick that worked for the Consort.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
She just sounded so perky.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
You know what's interesting to me, though, Jamie, is that, you know,

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
you're a new Mass Effect fan.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Kind of similar to me, but I luckily got on board just early enough

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
where now I've seen this original ending to Mass Effect 3 that a lot of people hate.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Unless you've YouTubed it, you haven't watched the original ending.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
So, my question to you is, are you going to watch the original ending first,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
or are you going to dive into Extended Cut as your ending?

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
I think I want to go into the Extended Cut just because of how much of the original was spoiled for me.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
And it's partly my fault because I watched the damn video, you know, the music video,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
which I don't even remember which one it was now.

56:37.000 --> 56:43.000
But I think that I would like to go through and see it, have that be my experience,

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
and see if I'm still pissed off, and then go back and watch the other one.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Because I can always YouTube the other endings.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
And I know that there's one that I liked that apparently like nobody else,

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
like the one where everyone gets all mixed up.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Black Lab is in chat. Puppy.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Puppy.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah, I saw him earlier.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah, he hasn't been here at the show in a while.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
We got to fix that.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah, what's up with that, dude?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Lost Puppy.

57:10.000 --> 57:18.000
Puppy says in chat, oh wait, Mass Effect 3 DLC, Skyrim DLC, and SWTOR Patch 1.3 all hit Tuesday.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Well, didn't you hear? It's my birthday.

57:20.000 --> 57:26.000
And it's all the game companies rewarding me for talking grand about all three of these games on Orange Laundry.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
No, I don't know what it is. It is a crazy day for DLC.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
I know Alan is really torn because he's both a Skyrim and a Mass Effect 3 fan.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
I think he'll go for Mass Effect 3 first because that's the one he doesn't have to pay for.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Well.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
We'll see.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
To continue, and I'll go ahead and just read this quote too.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
The extended cut endings will differ depending on choices made through the Mass Effect series.

57:49.000 --> 57:57.000
So multiple playthroughs with a variety of different decisions will be required to experience the variety of possibilities offered by the new content.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
Hopefully it will be different enough instead of palette swap endings.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
No. There's no way it's going to be that.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I mean, the download is 1.9 gigabytes.

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
The game itself, and I can tell you this because I downloaded it twice this week, is 10 gigabytes on PC.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
So that means there's like 20% what of the game is now, I mean, that's a lot of cinematics.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
So I think there's a substantial amount of stuff here.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
It kind of lends itself to the theory though that maybe they had had all of this content planned.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
And rushed the ending.

58:33.000 --> 58:42.000
Because I had been hearing from a number of people that the ending didn't make sense as far as it seeming to be just a quick band-aid over the whole thing.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
I had heard that the original ending had leaked out to the internet, the script or something, and they changed it to kind of fuck with everybody.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Which I kind of believe, I mean, I don't know what to believe.

58:52.000 --> 58:59.000
There's so much fan wank out there, especially in the Mass Effect universe, and very, very passionate people, you know, when you invest all this time into Mass Effect.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
You know, I just, I'm hopeful for the DLC.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
I did not hate the ending as is.

59:05.000 --> 59:16.000
I can see why people were let down, especially when this whole, I mean, the let down for me is that you collect all these war assets and it has very little impact on the end.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Maybe you get a two second scene.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
A five second cinematic is swapped out for another one.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I mean, it's very little.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That's the part that got me.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
I didn't care about where they went with it story-wise.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
I understand that there's some things they want to close up.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
That if they do a Mass Effect 4, they want to do a new trilogy.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
I understand that.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
I don't blame them for making some final things happen to set that in motion.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
I just, you know, and I think there's some people that are mad about that.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
They want the same universe to continue and so forth.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
My poor brain is just thinking on logistics.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
What are all those people going to eat?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
You can't eat Earth food.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Each other.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
I mean.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Surely you saw the documentary on the Donner Party.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
No.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I'm just thinking of all, they're going to have a long road home.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And then all the other people who can't get home.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
That's just very sad.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
All right, anyhow, before Jamie spoils anything inadvertently about the ending.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
That's all I left it at, Rob.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Let's move on with more gaming news, Loki.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
All right.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So this is, I'm kind of surprised by this.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You know, of course, there's the wonderful video game-esque movie coming out from Disney.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Later this year, Wreck-It Ralph, that's kind of a throwback to a bunch of old video games.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Plus, they've got a bunch of video game characters in there, including some from Nintendo.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Well, interesting enough, the game is only set to come out on Nintendo platforms this time around.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It's only going to be coming out on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And it's actually a game that's being published by Activision.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So I'm kind of surprised that they didn't bring it out on the other systems.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But that would be the case, so I don't know.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Very interesting. But that is coming out later on this fall.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
That is interesting.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Especially if, you know, the whole deal about the fact that Nintendo characters are in the movie or because they're in the game and so forth.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
My thought is this, is that they're putting out the Wii, like, DS and 3DS versions right now.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And then when it comes out on video, they'll put out a Wii U version, which will be the HD version.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Then they'll put out the PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That makes way too much sense.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Well, they definitely won't be doing that.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
How dare you bring logic into this show!

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
How dare you.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It's very possible that they may not.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I mean, like, Ice Age, they have a game coming out for that in July and they cut out the PS3.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
So if they cut out the 360 in this one as well, it makes sense.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
YYR in chat says, Activision would release on every platform if possible. There must be some sort of deal.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Well, just like I said, no. I don't think so.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Because if they think that it's only going to reach the kind of children demographic, then they're not going to get many sales from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Alright, let's talk about a remake.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
There's been remakes, remakes, and more remakes.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This is one, though, that might actually really deserve a remake.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's Okami HD.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Okami HD was announced this week by Capcom.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I guess Capcom's like, oh shit, the fans are rebelling. How do we please them?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So they're putting out Okami in HD on the PlayStation 3.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's full 1080p HD.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It will also add PlayStation Move support if you're into that sort of thing.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It is also in Famitsu Magazine where this was announced on Twitter and of course on YouTube.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It is going to be launching. This is the really interesting part.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's launching in Japan for 3,990 yen. That's about 50 bucks.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
In the US, Okami HD is going to be on PlayStation Network 1999.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Haha, we get a deal. Sorry, Japan.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But that is awesome.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah, but I bet it's going to come out with other neat stuff.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah, you never know. The one in Japan might come with like, I don't know, stickers.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Box art that doesn't have an IGN watermark.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Maybe a soundtrack or something extra.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Now, now, now. It was only...

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Oh, that was the Wii version.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I thought it was the...

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
There was something with the DS Okami-din, I think, that had some funky with that too.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Maybe the box art. I don't know.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It wasn't the game with the boss at level 30. That was a Bubble Bobble game.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
You know what's funny? This is one of those games I never really got around to playing.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I missed it. I played a demo. That was about it.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But I really wanted to try this out.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And I think the price of 20 bucks, download online, is a great place to see this.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And just kind of looking at the trailer here, I know they do some comparisons

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
between the PlayStation 2 version and the PlayStation 3 version in the trailer.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And it looks great. When they put it side by side, it looks really, really good.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
There's the PlayStation 2 version here we're looking at in the studio.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And then it goes, oh, look at that in HD, widescreen, color. It's great.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So, yeah, that's going to be a fun playthrough, I think.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And trophies for your E-peen.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Moving on, one more story and then we'll get to release dates.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And just a little ways away from the classic game of the week, which, yes, of course, we have one tonight.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Dark Sakura, first up with some news.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
How about some Blizzard stuff?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
This actually, they're clarifying the restrictions on the Diablo 3 players.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Basically, patch 1.0.3 has new measures in it to make sure that players have to wait up to 72 hours

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
before they can access the whole game.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So they're trying to make it more secure.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And the quote here says, for security reasons and to help ensure the integrity of the game and auction house service,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
players who purchase the digital version of Diablo 3 may have to wait until payment verification is complete

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
before they can access certain game features.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So basically, it's kind of like what they were doing with WoW,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
where they need to make sure that there's no credit card fraud and cutting down on gold farming and that type of thing.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So here's the official list.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
No public game access for unverified digiter, digital purchasers.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
No auction house access, real money, or gold for unverified digital purchasers.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Unverified digital purchasers cannot trade items or drop items for other players to receive.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Unverified are not able to chat in public or game channels.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Unverified cannot attach a custom message to friend requests,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
but they can send and accept friend requests and play with their friends.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Global play is not available for unverified digital purchasers.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:02.000
But they said that they added the inability to progress past Act 1 and Level 13.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Well, I understand the need to protect the integrity of the auction house, especially when real money's at stake.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
But that's kind of a shitty bargain for the legit people who are trying to buy the game online.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And it's a real concern for digital distribution in a way.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
But my god, this real money auction house is really a lot of hassle.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know, that auction house has really fucked this game up.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I mean, it's the reason why we have to be connected all the time, even in single player,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and why all those launch problems happen,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and now it's the reason why you can't even truly buy the game online unless there's a wait period.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And granted, you know, there's a part of me that's happy they do it,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
because, you know, I don't want the credit card theft or whatever being used to buy copies of Diablo 3,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and then, you know, they're doing that.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But I don't know. God, this real money auction house is such a pain in the ass.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I'm just not even bothering with it, you know.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
But yet Diablo 3 is a huge game. Huge, huge game. Go figure.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
SHJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Blizzard also got rid of some gold hotspots in Diablo 3, which sucks.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So they're trying to tone down the amount of gold farming, it sounds like.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Hmm. Interesting.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
DDRDollarBill says, this is why I am not jumping on Diablo 3.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'd be curious to know exactly how many people were Diablo 2 fans and Diablo 1 fans,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and didn't make the jump because of red tape like this.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Is it really a damning number or no?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Because, you know, reality is it's still the number one selling game the past couple months, right?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So, you can want them to fail all you want, but, you know, money is what ultimately talks.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and some things that are coming to a game store near you.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
This week we've got a few things.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Starting off with Spec Ops The Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
London 2012 Olympics on PS3 and 360.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Also, Dead Island Game of the Year edition on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
The Amazing Spider-Man on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Just Dance Greatest Hits on the Wii and 360.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And... that's it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I hope that Amazing Spider-Man movie is amazing and not amazingly horrible.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The game looks pretty good though.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Really?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The game is done by, was it Benox? I think they're the guys that did the last two games.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
It's open world and it looks pretty awesome.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The DLC where you can play as Stan Lee looks fucking weird.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I was watching the YouTube interview with him.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I was just like, what the fuck is that?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
It's kind of awesome in a creepy way.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, you're the creator of the game.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Hey, we want to make you fly around like Spider-Man. Okay.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
He has to have a cameo in everything Marvel does.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I just hope that Adam West gets that kind of treatment someday.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Batman Arkham City 2 or whatever, you know, have Adam West.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Hurry before he dies.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Seriously?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Let's be real, the celebrities we love, they're getting older.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Him and Morgan Freeman, man. They just keep the old people and get them acting more.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
They should do a buddy comedy.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Morgan Freeman.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And Adam West.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't know. Maybe.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
It's just cool old bastards.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Cool old bastards.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You know what? Dan was going through this thing about watching the Batman, the Brave and the Bold.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And apparently there was an episode with a bat robot that was voiced by Adam West.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Nice.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates and check out what's coming out in Japan near you.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
On the Xbox 360, for all you Japanese 360 owners.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Cricket, cricket.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Gundam Musou 3 gets a price reduction.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But a new game called Robotics Notes comes out from 5PB.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I've never heard of that company.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But that is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
This looks like it's another, I don't know if it's like dating sim in the school type of thing.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
What the hell? Wait a minute. It's like, yay, little girls are happy and dah dah dah dah dah.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And she's like pushing this guy that she probably secretly has a crush on.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And then, robots!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So Neon Genesis.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I don't know what the hell that is.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
What is that that it comes with? Look at that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It's a microphone.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Cosplay pieces.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Howdy partner.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Why don't you get up in my saddle and we'll raise robots together.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
In our school uniforms.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
What the fuck is this?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Pointing!

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Giant mecha rancher.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Look at my finger.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I don't understand.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
That one she's pointing and the look on everybody's face is like, oh my god.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It's like she's saying, who wants to smell my finger?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Are you sure that's a chick?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Yes, but if she had yellow ribbon in her hair I'd be like, is Haruhi?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I don't know.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Let's see.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Zether in chat explains, Robotics Notes is a sequel to a visual novel called Steins Gate.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Oh, well that explains everything. I'm so fucking angry.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Have you ever heard of Steins Gate?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Oh, you have?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Explain it to me.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I just heard of it. I don't know what the hell it is.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'm aware of the title Steins Gate.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
There is a book report due Sunday.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
This is why I love having a chat room.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
They can always be there to correct us when we're wrong.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard Chronicles HD Selection.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Robotics Notes on the PlayStation 3 as well.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Atlier Aisha.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Kokon no Daichi no Rekonjutsu in regular and premium flavors.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And I did not know there was something in this series coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But Dot Hack.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Sekai no Mukoni plus versus hybrid pack.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
What is this?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Is this like the whole... Oh, it's a movie.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Oh, okay. I get it.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
It's the movie and the fighting game.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
That's what this is.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It's a bundle pack there.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Wouldn't it be weird if they did Dot Hack MMO?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That would be very good.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Dot Hack was a pretty cool series on PlayStation 2 though.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Have they done one on PlayStation 3?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I don't think they have.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
This is the closest we get is a fighting game.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Alright, well.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Well, if the Persona 4 fighting game does well, then...

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I guess anything's possible.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Taking a look quickly at the PlayStation Vita,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Metal Gear Solid HD Edition comes out in Japan this week.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I know that's one people will be looking forward to.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And there will be a crystal white PlayStation Vita.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Because, you know, who doesn't love more colors for their handhelds?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Speaking of companies that love colors for their handhelds,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
on the Nintendo 3DS this week,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Cult Sept comes out in Japan.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I love this series.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And it's like a cult series.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
A lot of people don't play it here, but Cult Sept is like,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
it's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, you know this series?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Yes, I love this game. I'm importing it.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I didn't even know it was coming out.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Did you know they have one on the 360?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Yes, I think I'm the only person that still plays it on the Xbox 360.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Hold on, hold on, hold the mic.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Uh oh, Rob's going to get it.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Uh oh.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Two people own this game on the Xbox 360.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Two people in the world, old Cult Sept saga on the Xbox 360.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Well, they're you and I have a friend to play with.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I do, yay, we're friends, yay.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Are you my Xbox 360 friend?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Friends.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Friends.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Aww, that's so sweet.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
They still haven't removed that 100 person limit,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
even though they shut down Xbox Live on regular Xbox about two years ago,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
so they could do that. Yeah.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Anyhow, lastly, did I leave out any systems?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
How about the Wii? Is there anything coming out on the Wii this week?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yes.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
People still do the Wii.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
One game, and it's called Zero.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Shinku no Chul comes out this week,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
and it's about tormented spirits and a crimson butterfly,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
and it's like a ghost scary game.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Oh, this is a scary game.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Wait, crimson butterfly, that sounds familiar.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Was that a...

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
That's a Wii game?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Those graphics are pretty good for a Wii game,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
unless that's a cutscene.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Crimson butterfly, that sounds awfully familiar.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Yeah, it does.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Fatal frame? Oh, is this a fatal...

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Oh.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
No, there was one, it was a PS...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I'm thinking maybe it was a PS3 game,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
it was a PlayStation Network download thing, I don't know.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Well, regardless, that is out on the Wii this week, so there you go.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But I want biscuits.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Okay, everybody in chat says it is Fatal Frame.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It's part of the Fatal Frame series.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Hold on, I need tea and biscuits so that I can do this segment.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Okay.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
On the 25th, we have Dungeons & Dragons Online Menace of the Underdark.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You know, that means dro.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
27th, we have Resident Evil Chronicles HD Collection on PS3,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and the Dark Side Chronicles HD for PS3.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The 29th, Harvest Moon, The Tale of Two Towns,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
because we can't have enough sheep and cows.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Mini Ninja...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I hate when people put an S at the end of a Japanese word to pluralize it

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
when that is totally incorrect.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So I am not going to say it the way it is on the box,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
it's Mini Ninja Adventures.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Project Zero 2 Wii Edition, Ratchet & Clank HD Collection,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Spirit Camera The Cursed Memoir,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Spec Ops The Line,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
and The Amazing Spider-Man.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Spider-Man!

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Alright.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
A few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and I've been assured that Dark Sakura has picked a special game

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
for the classic game of the week this week.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
But first, Loki!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So, Seth Killian has left Capcom.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Good for him!

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Get off that sinking ship.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Yeah, so he's left the company as of Friday,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and basically just, you know,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I don't know, just moving on to better things.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And, you know, he said,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
both as individuals and as a group,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
you know, you have taught me more than I could have ever thought possible,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and I've chosen a new path that will let me embrace a new dream.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That dream being a game that does not have the DLC on disc.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Okay, maybe I made it up to the last part.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Could this be the very bad sign for future Capcom fighting games?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I don't know.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yes!

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I don't know. I mean, honestly,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I'm sure he has a lot to do with the fighting games,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
but it's a team that puts that stuff together.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It's not just one dude, so...

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
He's not the only guy, too.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We just had a story last week about, you know,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
other folks that were involved with that that were very stressed out.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Yeah, I probably saw that and didn't want to be worked to death,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
so he said, fuck this, I'm out of here.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Did he say where he went?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
No.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
It could be interesting to see where he ends up.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
That's the part of the story I want to know.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
What did he leave for another opportunity,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
or did he leave because he would rather go work,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
like, at a law firm or something where he doesn't ever touch video games again?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I'd be very curious to know that.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
He's going to work on the Phantom where he never has to touch video games again.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
All right.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
This is one of those stories that I think slipped under the radar

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
for a lot of people, but I think this is actually a huge deal.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So I want to talk about this a little bit,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and this is a story that was on Game Politics,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
but, you know, it probably was on some other websites, too,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and it's about Tetris.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
That's right, a game that is...

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
How many years old is Tetris now? It was done in the 80s or so,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
so it's a very old game, but...

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
At least as old as you are.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
One of the best...

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Well, technically, that's true.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
This is true.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's not...

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Hi!

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It's older than the show.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Hi!

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Nah, it only works when Jessica does it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
All right, moving on.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I got ferreted.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
That felt good after ten years.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
All right, so the Tetris company has actually won a battle in court

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
against a clone game,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and, you know, the iPhone app store has tons of these,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and it's out of control,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
because Apple doesn't...

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
The people that are screening the games don't necessarily know

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
what intellectual property is what,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
although I would think Tetris is a pretty easy one to pick out,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
but, you know, what stuff...

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Or Mario or Pokemon or Zelda or...

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Remember when Pokemon Gold or whatever was, like, the number one thing,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and all it was was an app that was, like, pictures of Pokemon or something?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Pokemon, and the gold is going in my pocket.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
That's right. Pokemon, give me your money.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Anyhow, Xio Interactive made this game called Mino,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
and they said it was inspired by Tetris,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
but when the Tetris company found the game,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
they sued Xio for copyright infringement in New Jersey,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
and during the legal fight...

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Xio, Xio? I don't know. I'll say Xio.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Xio said that the rules and mechanics are fair use as ideas.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Rules cannot be covered by copyright.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Now Tetris said, no, you took all the Tetris assets,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
so this game infringed on the copyrights,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
which, you know, we have seen a lot of games that were heavily inspired by Tetris,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and we've seen a lot of things that are damn near rip-offs,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
but the difference is Xio was, like, a fucking copy, right?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So in the ruling, the judge basically says,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
here's what is and what isn't copyright.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
The judge says the basic rulesets and gameplay cannot be covered by copyright.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
He says the basic ruleset of Tetris is not copyrightable,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
as the idea of a game in which shapes fall from the top of the screen

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
and have to line up with other shapes to clear the board

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
is not an idea you can copyright, hence Dr. Mario.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You know, Tangent I wasn't thinking of earlier,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
but I am now, since I'm surrounded with like-minded people here.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Would that mean that a game with arrows scrolling up to the top of the screen

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that you step on in time is also an idea that can't be copyrighted?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It would be interesting to te- I mean, now-

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Well, according to some court cases against two competing games,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
they were very similar like that.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
It was settled. It never went to court, did it?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I believe it was settled.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So anyway, I'm just curious.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
The world will never know.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Not to bring up news that's so fucking old, but I-

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Does that mean it's old?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But the judge actually cited Dr. Mario,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
as this game doesn't infringe Tetris copyright.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And I'm sure all of us go,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
okay, Dr. Mario, heavily inspired by Tetris, obviously,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Nintendo trying to strike gold twice with the whole Tetris thing,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
but it's not Tetris.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Dr. Mario is more of a Columns ripoff, but you know, I digress.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Well, but isn't Columns kind of a Tetris ripoff?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
It's actually sort of Puyo Puyo, like if you want to pick something that's-

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Yeah, anyway, but Xayo, according to the judge, copied more than this.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
They copied the exact dimensions of the play area,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
the shape, the color of the pieces,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I didn't even know that was a thing that was consistent in Tetris,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
and other mechanics.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Because of this, that violates the Tetris copyrights.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
The judge included side-by-side comparisons of the two games

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
that showed that they were identical.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They said that Xayo altered enough of the game,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
oh, I'm sorry, the judge said that if Xayo had altered enough of the game,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
like the play area, the shape, the look of the game pieces, their behavior,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
it would have avoided this whole mess in the first place.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So what does this mean?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And again, going off the article at gamepolitics.com,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
they say, not much.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The ruling was made in a district court with jurisdiction only over New Jersey.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So there's no precedence outside that jurisdiction.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
This will certainly be appealed to the Third Circuit Court,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
which means it could change.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But let's imagine, according to game politics here,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
that it did have varying across the U.S.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Would it help people against the fight for other clone games?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It says not likely because the ruling is narrow in scope.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It's a win for Tetris, but it's a win for outright clones

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
as opposed to heavy inspiration clones.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And they go on to say, tiny tower versus dream heights? Nope.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Radical fishing versus ninja fishing? Nope.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Even though some of us sit here and go,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Zinga should be taken to the cleaners over what they did to tiny tower.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:36.000
But this does not, apparently in this judge's ruling, wouldn't go far enough to do that.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Well, Zinga is smart enough to hire lawyers that probably specialize in intellectual properties.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And they tell them, okay, you need to change this, this, this, and this.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And you're gold.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
And Game Guru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
it means don't make your Tetris clones look like Tetris.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
No, that is a good thing.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
YYR in chat, I didn't realize this, says,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
the Tetris company actually mandates all of those things these days,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
including the color of each piece.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I never realized that. Crazy.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Anyhow, I just thought that story was fascinating,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000
especially with the copyright rampant infringement that we see in the iOS network,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
you know, the store and all that.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
So, yeah, there you go. We'll see what happens in the future.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I would be curious to see if there ends up being a ruling or if this gets appealed or what have you.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
But of course, with our wonderful legal system, it will take years and years and years and years.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Speaking of years and years and years and years,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
every week here on the show, Dark Soccer likes to spotlight the classic game of the week.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
All of which I'm older than.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
A game from the archives that Dark Soccer says,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
hey, you should be respecting this game and you should play this game.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And for the tenth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I'm sure Dark Soccer has picked something very special tonight.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Dark Soccer, what is tonight's classic game of the week?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Pong. No.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Could have been. Pong would have been a good choice.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
No, it wouldn't.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
All right.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Boop. No. Beatmania 2DX.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
A good choice.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Because with as crazy about DDR as we were, Beatmania was really our thing, don't you think?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Beatmania 2DX was the one that would give you a boner, yeah.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And I have to say that I didn't start with DDR myself.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I started with a little game called BM98,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:43.000
which was a PC emulator of Beatmania 2DX that you could do, not 2DX, but of Beatmania that you could do custom music to.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So 2DX is really just, I think, the very natural one to pick.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Pollock.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
It's a Beatmania 2DX song.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Heck yeah. Heck yeah.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
This started my obsession with Taku on top of that.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.000
So anyway, it first came out on February 26, 1999 in Japan.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And it's had 19 arcade releases and over 13 console releases on the PS2.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And it is the direct sequel to Beatmania.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So basically, I already explained how to play Beatmania.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
If you don't know how to play by now, then what planet have you been living on?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
But you have two extra keys than the original five key Beatmania.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And your turntable is on the opposite side depending on what side you're playing on.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So this has started right side pride and left side pride.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
A lot of people thought that they were going to be badass and play on the left side.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Ooh, good for you. I play right side.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Left side pride, weakling.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And actually, it's a good thing I play right side because of my freaking messed up hand.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000
But honestly, we've seen people who are just absolutely amazing at this.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Like the dude who plays all of these anothers with one hand.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Or me.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Lisa.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
You're a girl.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
D'Artessio over there says Lisu.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I don't remember him. Yeah.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:22.000
So anyway, we also had two different types of notes added with 2DX17 Sirius.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
There's charge notes that you can hold and then release at the right time and a backspin scratch.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So you have to scratch directionally.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
For difficulty, you go from one to seven.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And then in fifth style, you had a flashing seven that was the highest difficulty.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
With 10 style, you actually had level eight.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And then an eight plus with 11, which was 2DX Red.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
With Happy Sky, 12 is now the highest difficulty.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
So it's getting way past me.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I think the last one that I was really into was eight style.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Which I think was the last one I bought.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Which we're looking at right now.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Yeah.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Then there was the extra stage system where basically you could, if you did very, very well, you could pick another song.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Ooh.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And also seventh style was the first one to bring in one more extra stage.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Which is an extra extra stage after meeting the requirements of playing the extra stage song.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And then 13 Distorted had multiple extra stage songs.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Gold had two different ones. The 1ES and the 1OMES.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So yeah, it was really getting crazy there.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Like where else can I go with it?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
As far as the hardware goes, it actually had a full effector.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It had a bass platform transducer, the marquee, the DJ controller, and the effector.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
So basically you could control what it sounded like.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Wouldn't we always pick the third one and then turn it up really loud?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah, to make it really noisy.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So you could hear it over every freaking thing else.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Can I admit something here real quick? Not to interrupt you or whatever, but I do that.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Watching this video is making me very nostalgic, I have to admit.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
No, it really does. I really miss playing this game, especially in the arcades and stuff.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I mean, yeah, I could try to go dig up my own version, but shit, my controller probably wouldn't even work anymore.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I don't even know if my Japanese PlayStation 2 works.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
You have problems trying to hook them up to newer HDTVs anyway.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
You have to find the song that got me into your beat.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
What song is that?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Ultra High Heels.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh really?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I can do that.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I beat the hell out of that song, because I freaking loved it.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But yeah, I'm feeling very nostalgic right now.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Also the marquee is 16-segment display LEDs, so you could see the song information and titles while you played.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Yeah, turn this up.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
This song is freaking awesome and so much fun to play.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's just for me, I mean, even if...

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
A lot of people were like, oh, I have to play all the hard songs, but they were just songs that were fun.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So, like I said about the controller, you had your turntable on the left or right side, depending on where you were.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:31.000
As far as the keys go, it mimicked the F, F sharp, G, G sharp, whatever, A, A sharp, B keys on a musical keyboard.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Also, it basically was connected with the EMU's platform, so you could use a card that would save your stats and your scores.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:53.000
You also had, for a long time there wasn't there like the leaderboard or the scoreboard on the Konami website where you got a code and you could enter in everything like it was with DVR.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:07.000
All kinds of really, really good artists, not just the musical artists, but they had their in-house artist designers with Konami who put out some fantastic digital work.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Especially the stuff that went along with all of the Tran designs.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:26.000
There were, they put out like a bajillion different wallpapers every time a new game would come out that were amazing.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:36.000
As far as the home versions go, you could flip out the controller, so you could play lefty or righty, however you want to play.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:44.000
There were also, and I tried my hardest to buy the arcade style controller, and it would not work. They wouldn't take my credit card.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I tried. I was even going to have it shipped to a friend in Japan who was going to ship it to me. It didn't work.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
One time I got Dan to agree to this. Oh, I was so pissed.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:59.000
But there are aftermarket arcade style controllers that you can get, and tons of schematics out there to build it yourself.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:12.000
For all the different music, I mean you had it from, we just heard some Eurobeat, we have different types of dance, we had, there was even quite a bit of R&B in the earlier versions I'd like to say.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Some crap songs in the earlier version too.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:26.000
As far as the current one, which is 19, is it pronounced lingle? I guess. 600 songs.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Dingle.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Dingle.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Dongle. Maybe a 2DX19 dongle edition.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Awesome. I support that.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Basically the arcade versions run from a hard drive instead of a DVD, so for anyone who's actually ever downloaded the earlier versions, it's quite a bit. Like I said, hard drive.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So yeah, as far as characters that are related to the series, we have Tram, who is the little alien chick with white hair, we have Yamatotora, Mika Tsukuba, Yuri Aida, Akane Sugo, Emi Motegi, Azusa Suzuka.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Try saying that a few times fast.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I mean, there's basically a lot of cool characters, and you have the goalie characters, which is another one of the artists I really like who did the DJs.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Like Eriki, QJack, Nix, all of them. I freaking...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And I've seen some really freaking good cosplay, I just have to say.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.000
In fact, I've actually got an issue of Cosmode that has its all 2DX cosplay. So Celica, all of that.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So anyway, there you go. You may need a 2DX. If you don't know what it is after listening to this show, climb out from under a freaking rock and clean out your ears.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
There it is.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
My man. I love you, Taku.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
This song was so much fun to play.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I want to have lots of Tran babies with you.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That is a...

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Not really.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:09.000
A very good pick for the 10 year anniversary of Orange Laundrio. BeatMania, 2DX, all styles up to about 10th.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Yeah.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Just kidding.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Dongle style.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Dongle style. 2DX dongle style.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Alright, that does it for part A of our show. But don't go anywhere, guys. We have part B coming up.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And guess what? No news. Part B is all about you guys tonight.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
That's how we want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Orange Laundrio is with you guys.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We'll friend your butt.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Alright.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But if you don't call in, then we will do some more news. We do have some news standing by if we need to.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Otherwise, Loke, you'll just run through it quick. It's a last minute thing.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
But we're hoping to get some calls here in part B.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But first, a break. Don't go anywhere. We got to save part A in case there's a power outage with six people here with all their computers and stuff.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio 10th style.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, I'm very sorry we don't have a music break tonight.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.000
But we do have clip show. That's right. Ten minutes worth of clips here during our break tonight.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And I want to thank Dark Tetsuya for scouring the internet and finding some of these clips from the OLR archive.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I want to tell you guys, a lot of this shit is fucking old.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Like most of this, I think the newest clip in here is from episode 148.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Otherwise, this shit is old. And it starts with a clip from episode number one.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And it ends with a moment that has been requested over and over and over again to be replayed.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And it's a parody on this show.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Oh, yes. Here we go. We'll be back after this.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I hate you.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That's right. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are live on our very first broadcast.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
How's it feel, Jamie?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
It feels like burning.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
My thoughts exactly.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:56.000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. This is a special edition because we decided to take Labor Day weekend off.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
So we thought we'd tape the show a little early. So it's actually Wednesday night. We're at Golf Land.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
But we are taping live. No do-overs. It's just like it was a live show.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So what do we want to do? We want to walk around and give a little tour of Golf Land.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I don't want to do anybody publicly.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Do you want to?

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I'm holding adventure stuff. Who wants to hold my wood?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Thank you for volunteering for that. We just got a funny. Hi.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Oh, we're doing a school project. Yeah.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
For.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
No, we're doing an online radio program. So we have an Internet radio show.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Would you like to say some words for our listeners?

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Actually, I need to tell you that you need to talk to the manager before you guys can go walking around recording stuff.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Oh, we're just recording ourselves.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
God damn it, Rob. These things burn at a thousand degrees. I feel like burning heat.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot. I'm going to do my next shot here. This is some hot damn.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
So cheers. I'm going to toast Loki's water here.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Well. Oh, wait. It looks like a wall tussin.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Oh, wow. He sounds like a woman. Shut up.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Oh, God.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
It tastes like it tastes like 20 like Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Contestants, here we go. Snubs got to catch up. And here's his answer.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Good answer. Okay.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night. Her secret weapon was her.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Skyline says, oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:56.000
He said orange bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So we have remote collar exploder dealie and boom stick.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Alright. Jamie, what's your answer?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Orange bat.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Orange bat. I knew it, too. That's right. You're already in the lead, Skyline. You don't need it.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Alright. As Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Okay. Our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Big black cock.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Her big black cock.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Sorry, that's not a match. But funny. Puppy.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
The ferret.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000
The ferret. Good answer, but not a match.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Loki. Her secret weapon was her Iraqi suicide babies. Iraqi suicide babies.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Jamie, is this true?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I admit it. I've been exporting them. I keep them in my trunk.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It sucked ass, kinda. It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Never read whatever the hell that movie was. It was bad.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Envy of the dot dot dot.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The film that we watched was called Envy. Actually, it says Envy on the box. It's actual full title. It's called Penis Envy.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It's a story about these two drifting chicks. They're walking through the desert and they go to this bar and they get really drunk.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And I mean, this is talking about like white trash America. They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And so they walk around and lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen guy.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And then they go and ask the penis fairy for a penis and they get a penis and with the penis comes great responsibility.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And they have, you know, mustaches and body hair and tattoos and they start acting like guys.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Hey, Loki? Was it Mr. Spanky?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And then they start like, you know, screwing this one chick and then this other guy.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And then eventually they get tired of having a penis. And so they go and find the penis fairy in L.A. where she's at a gay bar.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:29.000
But the one chick likes the penis so much and then she ends up getting killed in the end.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
That was beautiful. Thank you.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Extrovert, what were you doing on my computer last night? Suddenly I have all these folders on my desktop.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I actually went through and cleaned my desktop a couple weeks ago. You remember how messy my desktop used to be?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Like it was just icons everywhere, right? And you couldn't even see my background.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Now you have balls on it.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I cleaned the shit out of the desktop, right?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Okay. Now, Extrovert went in and last night while he was drunk or something, he made all these new folders on my desktop.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And now I have folders that say big boobies number one, big boobies number two, big boobies with cocks in them, blood spattered boobies,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:16.000
boobies and sunflowers, boobies for milking, boobies in pee, mastectomy leftover boobies, hot hairy saggy man boobies.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And then my last, my favorite here, women in roller skates peeing in glass bowls.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
What the hell? Why did you do that?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I'm not going to, you know, if you're going to download that shit, I mean, don't blame it on me.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Okay, this is from the person that left us with the bleached asshole joke.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
By the way...

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Did they use something other than bleach?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Did I talk about the asshole strips yet?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
No.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Oh, well, you know how you have like...

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Crest white strips?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Yes, it's like crest white strips only put on your asshole.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
You leave it for, you leave them for like a few minutes and then you just strip them off and hey...

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
What about the kind that are supposed to dissolve when you go?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I'm disgusted. I am so disgusted.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Girls just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out, I'm coming out, here it is.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Loki singing I'm coming out at the county fair with Teninga.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Here we go.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Remember, he goes, I'm coming out, you know, you know how it goes, you know how this one goes?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Okay, here we go.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:33.000
JNN.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I'm singing and I'm okay.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I'm singing, I'm happy with women.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I'm singing, I want the world to know, I'm happy with pussies.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I'm singing, I want the world to know, got them ready to show.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
There's a new me singing and I'm just happy.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
He's laughing.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I'm gonna be happy, I'll be happy.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Stop making me laugh, damn it.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Like you never knew it, I'll make it through.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I have to shout that I'm staying in, I'm staying in.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I want the world to know, I'm happy with the pussy.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I'm staying in, I want the world to know, I shop on the same sad street.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I got to show the world, yeah, I wanna see.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
All my abilities, there's so much for me.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Somehow I have to make them, just understand.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I've got it all in hand, oh how I've got it planned.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I'm spreading the love, there's more for me to fear.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And I just feel so good every time I hear, I'm staying in.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I'm happy with the females, gotta let it show.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I'm actually passing this song, that's pretty amazing I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Yeah, work in the crowd.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Yeah, yeah, there's my pictures in the crowd, fuck yeah.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I'm coming in, I want the world to know, let it show.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I'm staying in, I'm happy with hetero, just want everyone to know.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I'm staying in, I want the world to know, women are my thing.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I'm staying in, I'm sick of this song, you're gonna really die.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:46.000
God, this is long, it just doesn't fucking end, just keeps on going on.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm gonna kill anyone in the chatroom that has a recording of this, you're gonna so die.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I know where you live.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:07.000
A score of 6,964 points for Loki, not even a gold record, there is no justice in this world, okay.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now, oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I laughed so hard, I peed, okay, I peed a little, I peed a little bit.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I can't lose my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight huh Rob?

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Oh, that hurt so bad, oh my god.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Alright, before we come back with the show here, Loki wanted to play something for us here real quick.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
I did want to play something and it's something that, I don't know, was supposed to be kind of before the show intro

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000
because I was actually trying to make a new intro but then I didn't do that and then I did something else and

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:55.000
it's cheesy but it's funny and it's fun with text to speech programs and a certain somebody from a certain game.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Here we go.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Do you know how they celebrate it? If you guessed deadly lasers, you'd be correct.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.000
This next test is very dangerous. To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.000
smooth jazz will be deployed in 3, 2, 1.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Hey, that is not approved aperture testing equipment, that's just a ferret strapped to a bungee cord.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
That was cute, I like that, good job.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Thank you.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Alright, let's get back into the show guys.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Welcome back everybody to-

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Technical failure. You know, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't technical failure.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
You done. Here we go.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June 24th of 2012 with the 462nd episode of our show,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:23.000
the 10th anniversary special. That's right, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:32.000
And here we are 10 years later, getting older, but still talking about the games we love, having live radio fail,

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Mike sneezes, and the games we don't love so much sometimes too.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into part B tonight, and here's the thing, we didn't really pull any stories for this,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000
because we're going to open up the Skype line here real soon. We do want to do the mailbag first though,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
we got some emails.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Yeah, I gotta load that.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
While you load that though, we do have the foogle question of the week. We still did that this week,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
so I'm going to go ahead and load that up. Here it is, the foogle question of the week.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
As a reminder, the foogle question of the week is Facebook and Google+.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Put them together and you get foogle. Although really, with the proportion of people we get on Facebook versus Google+,

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000
it really should be like Gacebook or something, because sadly you're not a lot of Google Plus users.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But we do have some, and we want to say hello to those of you joining us on Google+,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
and we did get some answers to our question of the week. Here it is.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000
It is a little self-serving this week. Considering the occasion, deal with it.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
We figure the first time you downloaded or listened to Orange Lounge Radio was because you were searching for video game podcasts,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
or a friend told you about it. What made you stay and listen a second, third, fourth, and so on consecutive times?

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So going to Google+, here are the answers.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000
We have 13xforever says, personally, I've tried a lot of other shows at the time,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
but yours has a strong personality to which makes it rather enjoyable to listen to every week.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Besides, your general views on gaming as a whole are quite close to mine,

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and it's useful to have a second opinion on some games that I plan to buy and whatnot.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Oh, and Ferret, even though it has gone a long journey of self-rediscovery far, far away from human civilization,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
or at least it looks like it.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Tony M. replied and said, honestly, it was a couple of things.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
The banter that you guys have together, the no-nonsense approach you take to talking about video games,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000
no offense to games journalists, but I can relate to you all better than them,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000
because you're real people who have to purchase, oops, oh, crap, I almost closed the window on accident.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Jeez, Rob.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Fail.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It's so funny that this is during a comment about why we're not real games journalists.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Perfect. I can relate to you all better than them, because you're real people who have to purchase your own games,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
and this is one of the best video game podcasts out there.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
The shows coming in at close to three hours doesn't hurt much either,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000
as it helps to make a slow, boring day at work go by that much faster.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Technist says, at the beginning, when OLR was a Bamani-focused show,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:12.000
it was due to that you were really one of the few shows that actually talked about the games and the culture around them.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
As I listen more and more to later episodes in the early years,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
you all have just a great chemistry that's just infectious.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I've been kicking myself because I missed a great chunk of your episodes before coming back

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
just right around when you started the To Go podcast.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Even when the format changes, station changes, site changes, I still have stuck with you for gaming news.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Sure, anybody can make a blog or a podcast reading news,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
but it is your opinions that make them more interesting to listen to every week.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Even when I have disagreed to one of your opinions, rants, or blind fanboyism on a certain topic,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I still value what you three have to say because I know it's yours and yours alone.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Finally, I will end with this.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
OLR is one of the few places the gamers still have a voice that matters.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
As long as you guys let us have an outlet to voice what we have to think,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I will always be a loyal listener and supporter.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
That's really nice. Thank you.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000
All right, we're going to go on over to Facebook and read some of the answers over there.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Let's see, we've got 20 answers. Do you think I can read them all?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Oh, go for it.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.000
This chick named Nelly replied and said, spousal pressure.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
What's up with that?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Let's see, Picaruno said, seriously, you guys are funny and entertaining,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
and back when I used to live in Japan, interacting with the chat room and the host

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
in such a familiar way as something you don't really get anywhere else.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Katsuhiko Junai says, I've been listening since 2005,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
and I guess the reason why I kept on listening was because it's gaming news by real gamers.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Stay independent.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Rama says, I've been listening since 2005 or so.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I just love the camaraderie amongst three good friends that's been keeping it going for so long.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Who said we were good friends? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Girl.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Red The Hayes says, the first time was probably in late 2006, early 2007.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
A friend had just introduced me to a certain interactive weekday show in the summer of 2006

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
when I heard Sky call in a couple times during the shows to advertise OLR.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It's okay to say All Games Interactive, by the way. It was a great show. It was.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
It's really a bummer. It's not on anymore.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I then decided to check out the podcast, and I've been hooked ever since with the antics of the cast

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
and just how really nice people y'all are.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000
The start of my week just doesn't feel right when I don't get to hear from the cool people of OLR.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000
More power to you guys and gals, and may you have another ten years of awesome.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000
P.S., again, I apologize for bringing up the Super Bowl in your 400th episode.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000
The Super Bowl? Every time I hear antics, it also makes the word hijinks pop into my head,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
and then the announcer voice says, blah, blah. Makes me laugh.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Let's see. Dekeman says, your first E3 podcast mini shows for Orange Lawns Radio to go.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
You guys were the only ones covering the games I cared about that year.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000
After three mini shows, I got to know your personalities and loved what you guys were talking about.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Fabrice A. says, the chemistry between three good friends. Also, you genuinely care about your listeners.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Thank you for noticing that, because we really do.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Terry J. says, I've been listening since late 2005.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I kept listening because of the personalities of each of you as well as the great flow of the program.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
To put it simple, you guys know your shit, and your presentation proves it.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Thanks for the many years of content, my friends.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Don't tell Loki he knows this shit. It only increases ego. I'm just kidding.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
It's why my head hurts. It can't fit.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, professional courtesy is why he's listened twice.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Zether says, the discussions about games that I honestly never expected a podcast to bring up.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I forgot what it was, but it must have been a game I liked because it kept me listening.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Benny L. says, you guys bring me to tears with laughter at times.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Also, I have to support my fellow peeps from Sacramento.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:54.000
A Local Ryan says, Loki ranting because when he does, it's always the truth.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Dan M. says, I kept listening because it was relatable.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
The conversations are a lot like the ones I have with friends of mine.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I was also told there would be cake.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
We have cookies.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
It's behind the other door. It's cake day, you know.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I prefer pie. There's a joke there.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Clover N. says, I stayed and listened to OLR since 2006 because not only do I get the whole

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000
three friends sitting around talking video games feel, but I just love the honesty and the lifestyle that the show promotes.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Blue 2 says, I started listening to mid to late 2008 after hearing the final talks with Bobby Blackwolf.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.000
What made me continue was the diversity, different point of views, and acceptance to everything from gaming to politics.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Also, if they disagree or hate something, they would give a logical and reasonable reason why.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Actually, OLR was my favorite and highly respected that I joined the home clubhouse and bought Namco

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Museum Essentials because it has your names on it, not lying.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
That was a great achievement, though, to get in a video game.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That was pretty awesome, even if it's a small cameo.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Surezo says, my first taste of OLR was back in March 2010.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
From the first second, I was excited to be listening to a well-known video game podcast

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
that all of my Bomani friends were telling me about.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
2010 may not have been the strongest time for the Bomani area, but still, OLR had a reputation that I had to be a part of.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Wow, he had a reputation? I hope it was a good thing and not like written in a bathroom stall at Miggle.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
There were so many factors that led me to keep listening after the first time.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I really enjoyed the segments, such as How Was Your Video Gaming Week, Classic Game of the Week, Release Dates, and the FUs of the Week.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I also appreciate the different personalities that are on air.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000
This diversity really helps me form an opinion when trying out or buying a new video game or console.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Flow Walker, Mel B says, I was down with OLR since day one.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:44.000
It was the height of the Bomani craze, and OLR was the first online radio show dedicated to the cool kids who played music rhythm games.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Plus, I actually liked you guys in real life, regardless of OLR.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Well, that helps.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I stuck around, listened live, and then I did the podcast thing when my Sundays got tied up.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Still do.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And you know, Mel B was like one of the freestyle kings when the show first started, and he brought his cred to OLR very early on.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
They were on like episode six or something like that, Mel and Mel.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
And you know, we're really thankful to him for his support over all these years, certainly.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And I do consider Mel a great friend outside of this show and all that.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Just another good friend I made because of DDR, believe it or not.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Let's see.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Yes, I'm reading them all tonight.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
You know what? It's a special show.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I'm reading them all.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I don't care.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Chigger says, I think I started listening to you guys around March of 2006.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
The chemistry you guys have is where the real magic is.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Always a witty comment from Dark Sakura or a rambling rant about Nintendo from Loki, and just Sky's humor is what keeps me coming back.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I love you guys so much.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Add the extra O.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
So much.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I would be kind of lost if I didn't have you to listen to via podcast at my work or an occasional live stream when I'm home.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Keep it up, and here's to another 10 years.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Dave Falcon says, I was in college.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I was working in a student computer lab at University of South Florida in Tampa.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Early in 2002, I was playing The Sims for PC, and I was searching for some add-ons, expansions, hints, and cheats on the internet.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Somehow, when I was searching on WebCrawler, remember that search engine?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
OLR came up in the search, so I checked it out.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Gee, however did discussion on The Sims trigger our show, Dark Sakura?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Shut up.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I didn't mod my Sims in dirty ways. Hush.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Oh, you would never do anything like that, I'm sure.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Garris.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Alright, let's see.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Oops, I lost my place here.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Oh yes, so I checked it out.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Listened to the show for about a year until I left school.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Fast forward to 2012.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I'm living in Washington, D.C. since 2007, working in social media, and got engaged in December 2011.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
P.S., my fiancé is a huge video game lover.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Well, you lucked out.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Ospher says, I saw Sky's post on ddrfreak.com back when those forums were still popular.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I thought I'd check out the show, and admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that the show switched from strictly bimani to video games in general,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
but it turned out to be a really entertaining show.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I love all the hosts and hearing their points of view, which are all pretty different and unique.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I was hooked, and I will be listening for as long as the show goes on.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Alright, last comment. You ready? Last one.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Dun-dun-dun.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Orange Right says, the first time I listened to OLR was way back in 2002.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I think someone in DDR Freak had it in his signature.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I kept listening because it was the only live show I could think of that talked about these weird Japan-only rhythm games I've enjoyed so much,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
and I stuck to it even after the show moved on to a general video game focus.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Stay gold.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Great feedback, guys. Thank you.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I apologize if you thought that went on a little long, but you know what?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I really enjoyed reading all that stuff, so thank you very much.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I have fuzzies now.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Alright.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
They're kind of warm.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Tuma JP wants me to read his because he's having Google Plus problems, so he sent me a private message, so why not?

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Do it.

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:00.000
The truth for me is to see what real gamer wants, and to steal me as a developer to stay in focus to create games for real gamers.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
That's pretty powerful, actually.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:08.000
And fucking scary that we're having influence on developers.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
But you know, we have made industry friends, especially because the show has been on so long.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Some of y'all started listening to us when you were in school, and now you're working in the game industry.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I've made some great connections for people that are in the industry, and it's great.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I'm really honored to know people like Seg, who I've been able to do UmLoud, which has been an amazing, amazing charity experience.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I got to do the design for UmLoud last year.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Exactly. We've had a great experience through him.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I have other friends that probably would appreciate it. I don't name them.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:40.000
But I'm thinking of all you guys who work very, very hard and many overtime hours to bring the video games to us.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Really appreciate it. All right. That's it for the FUGL Question of the Week.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.000
What do we do next? How about the mailbag? I think the mailbag's up next. Does that sound good?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Oh, good Lord.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
All right. So we got some emails tonight?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
A few.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
A few.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I'm going to read them all.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.000
All right. I read them all. Go ahead.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
All right. This is actually from Darktensia. But there's, like, a lot of pictures.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.000
So, uh, I actually, um, this, why don't you repost all this on the VOG forum?

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I will see what I can do. Oh, oh, Joe. Oh, yeah, Joseph here. Hi, Joe.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
So that we can have more listeners go to the VOG forums and look at the pictures.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That's right.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:35.000
But, um, this is, uh, I'd have to go with episode 39 and the whole in-studio Battle Royale thing, which, interestingly enough,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
DDR Angel was kind enough to send me a bunch of photos from that day. Was that the Paper Plate Battle Royale?

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Oh, Lord. I remember because I won.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Um, they can't hear you when you don't have a microphone.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Oh, hey.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Oh, here. Use this one.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
She's in chat right now.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Yeah.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Sorry.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
So, yeah, these will have to go on, uh, on the forum.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Okay. Um, okay, so next up, oh, it's from Robert Kidman.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Send me some biscuits.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Um, evening all and happy birth-a-versary.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I just wanted to say quite simply thank you.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Thank you for 10 wonderful years in your dedication, your passion, and for making the world just that little bit smaller.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Many of us are indebted to OLR, be it for entertaining us on Sunday evenings, getting us through the tedium of Mondays,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:27.000
finding like minds and a place to get our fan on, making friends the world over, or even starting something off the back of the show.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
If it weren't for OLR, there would be no geek life.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Tiara and I wouldn't have met, and Tiara wouldn't have found her soon-to-be husband, Dan, through me.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Strange how these things happen.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Personally, I wouldn't have met some fantastic people that I can safely say are friends for life if it weren't for you guys.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
So, yeah, thank you. Long may it continue.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And in the words of my old drama teacher, well done, good show, carry on.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
That's Rob from Geek Life.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
By the way, huge thanks to Geek Life for the article they wrote this week as well.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
And I love Geek Life. I'm going to be doing a guest column for them.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Tiara received an opportunity, and she didn't think of the other Rob.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
She didn't think of Dan. She didn't think of Jamie.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:13.000
She thought of me, and so I'm going to be doing a guest column on something that she's been proposed, and I'm so excited.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Cool. Maybe I'll actually find time to start writing Geeks on a Budget again.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I got two websites to write for now between VOG and all that.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Okay. I make this promise from here out. I will go back to writing my Geeks on a Budget every week.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Because I still have to finish part two of TableTop Gaming.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
There you go.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Okay.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Due Monday. Just kidding. I'm kidding.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Wednesday. It's due before Wednesday, Rob.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Hey, OLR and OLR me. I wanted to give a shout-out and congratulate you on ten years of success in the internet radio slash podcasting slash video gaming world.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
It's quite a feat.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I remember when I first met Rob. It was New Year's 2008 slash 9.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
He was sick and quiet on the couch.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
We got to chatting, and he mentioned he was a gamer.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
G-A-Y-M-E-R.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I knew then he'd be a good friend, and then he told me about his podcast.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I figured, man, why not? I'll download it.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I've been listening since then and have been hooked since.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000
For the past year, your voice has been rattling in my head on public transit commutes to work in San Francisco.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Then I met Jamie and Loki when Rob asked me to hang out during one of their recordings.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
It was in a garage with no heat in the winter.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Cords and wires everywhere from the equipment.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Seeing you three live was a thrill as I quickly learned your video game knowledge and history is truly unparalleled.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I've seen your last two to three studios, and I know you're on a shoestring budget.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:38.000
So as Dark Soccer is reading this, she's about to tell everyone listening that I will donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Wait, what?

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
This is Grandpa from Horde House emailing us right now.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Let me finish reading it, Rob.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Okay.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.000
So take note of the time and count them up. Let me know what the total is, and I'll send it to you via check or PayPal.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I believe in the work that you do. Please keep it up.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Despite the long nights, fights about the future of gaming, or if another gaming network gets hacked, OLR will always be there.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I encourage everyone listening tonight to tell a friend, share a link via Facebook, or whatever floats your boat.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Keep up the great work, Grandpa Warcraft Matt.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
DS, you guys are old as fuck.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Did I just hear that somebody is donating ten dollars for each live person that's tuned in right now and in the chat room?

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
So our chat-

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000
For every- donate ten dollars to VOG Network for every live chatter in the chat room right now.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Does he know how many people that might actually end up being?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
In the chat room?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Yeah.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
How many people?

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's seventy-nine people in chat right now, and I got a print screen right there. Seventy-nine people in the chat room.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
We love you Matt!

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Honestly, that's a huge gesture. I'm not gonna hold him to it if he didn't realize what a big commitment he's making.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
He's allowed to put a cap on that for sure, even if that cap is ten dollars, it's fine.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:07.000
But I will say this, that would go a long way in funding this station for a year because the money so far has come out of our pockets.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Especially mine, especially Bobby's in getting this station running, so I would say that would be a hugely appreciated gesture, and thank you.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Well two of them are bots according to Bobby.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Oh, so I'm sorry, seventy-seven.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Seventy-seven real people in chat.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
There you go.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Wow, that's super full.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I'm making you a guild officer in the Druid Guild, just so you know.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Okay.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Well it's three bots, seventy-six.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Okay.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Alright, this is from Robobobobobobob.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:45.000
The possibility of Microsoft rewarding your regular points for achievements is probably not for me.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:51.000
It's a link on here about fall unlocking this Xbox 360 achievements will earn you Microsoft points.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
God, I hope so because I'm not buying those things.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:02.000
You see, if skill-based games result in a monetary payoff, it is illegal in Maryland and some other states.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000
But MS points are not money as they are non-transferable and cannot be cashed in.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Remember one versus one hundred Microsoft legal restricted people in states that don't allow skill-based cash prizes, so they must have felt it was too much like money.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
So I'm not certain this will be the case, but I'm expecting it.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Strangely, we can have a skeeball award tickets which are cashed in for crappy prizes.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
And that's from Robobobobob.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Okay.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Moving forward.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Hey, OLR.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Hi.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Five years ago I came across your podcast and was hooked ever since.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
I can't pinpoint what exactly attracted me to the program.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
It might have been the combination of Loki's outrageously entertaining rants.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
My personal favorite was the one about the Wii peripherals.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Or, as Loki put it, $20 pieces of awkward shit.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Rob's friendly personality and Jamie practically the mental and emotional clone of my best friend who I grew up with.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Okay, wow.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Regardless, doing this show for ten consecutive years without getting paid is truly a remarkable accomplishment that I'm sure you're all proud of.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:14.000
With that and your undying support of independent podcasting is an inspiration to future podcasters, myself included.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Congratulations for reaching the ten-year mark.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Here's to another ten years of successful podcasting.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Your faithful listener, Degenerate Johnny.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.000
P.S. I currently reside in Michigan and recently found out that a Pinkberry just opened last year in Ann Arbor.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
What selection would you suggest for a first comer?

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Get your minds out of the gutter, you bowling players such as myself.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
You know who should be giving us money per each listener?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Pinkberry!

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
It's Pinkberry.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Um, my personal favorite is the chocolate.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
However, the strawberry right now is absolutely delicious.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Just don't get that balsamic vinegar crap on it.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Moving forward.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Thank you, Johnny.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Thank you, Johnny.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Howdy, O.L.R.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Howdy, partner.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I just wanted to say congrats on ten years of doing the show.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It is one heck of an accomplishment that you have been doing the show for so long and still put on a great, entertaining, and informative show each week.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
You were all an inspiration to us here at our show.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
We wouldn't be the show we are without you guys and gal to look up to.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Here is to ten more years of O.L.R., Brad.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
It's from Brad at Pod Culture.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
We love Pod Culture. Mondays on vlog.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I still need to get you your missing stuff. Sorry.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Is it premiering this week?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Uh, a premier episode of Pod Culture?

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Yeah.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I believe it is this week, yes.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Okay.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Yay!

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Alright.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Dear O.L.R., I was hoping to write a long, rambling email in honor of your tenth birthday on how this show has kept my attention for seven years.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Longer than any TV show or radio show or indeed any video game.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.000
By the way, this person is either British or Canadian.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Use. Use an honor.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I can recognize it.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
On how finding out that Sky was gay when I was listening in my early teens affected the way I reacted when some of my friends came out.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
And overall how great a job you guys all do and how much I love this show.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
But unfortunately I've left it too late so I guess I'll have to save it for the twentieth anniversary instead.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Cheers for everything, guys. Elliot B.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Elliot is from the UK. He's one of the vlog contributors.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
He is from the UK.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Yep.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And thank you. I, you know, I'm just me.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
And I like video games.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
And...

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
And I have a boyfriend.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
It is what it is.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And I thank you guys for just, you know, not giving a shit.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Which people shouldn't.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Be happy that people are in love.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
That's what it's all about.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
And Rob does have an impressive John Waters collection.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I don't know what the fuck that has to do with anything, but alright.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I was just looking at your DVDs a minute ago.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Oh, okay.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Okay. This one has a title in Spanish and he actually corrected me about el telefono es en fuego.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
That's not how it's actually supposed to be said.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
But I don't know anything about Spanish grammar so my bad.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Yo no se.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
So I'm gonna try to pronounce this right.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Felicidades Radio Sala Naranja.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Naranja. Or is that it?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I guess that's orange.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act Deaf.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
It's been a while since I've written an email to the OLR mailbag.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000
But what better occasion than your 10th anniversary?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I've been listening to you guys since around 2005-2006, right after I graduated from university.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I discovered you guys from the old DDR Freak forums back when Bimani and DDR were still relevant to our lives.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And it still kinda is, just not as important as it was before.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I didn't start to listen religiously until late 2006 when you got some Bimani exclusive for a DDR game back then, probably UltraMix 4.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And while I came in for DDR, I stayed for the show.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I wasn't a fan of internet radio talk shows or podcasting back then, but you guys really got me into it.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I still remember the live 365 days, so do we.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I will never forget that award ceremony where they forgot to call our name.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Hey, I got speakers.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
You did.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I did.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
At least we got something. We didn't get a trophy but we got speakers.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I played bingo and won speakers.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Though it was unexpected to hear that you were leaving them, but not surprising after hearing the reasons why you left that service.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
But then came the All Games era.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
The show didn't change that much, it was pretty much the same.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:22.000
And so I discovered the Bobby Black Wolf show, met really great people over at the All Games chat room, and made some new friends over the years.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:28.000
There have been some bumps on the road like Rob getting sick, the studio's PC breaking and other real life stuff.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
But it also helps to show how great the community can be.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Always supportive to the show, in good times and especially bad times.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000
You have also inspired lots of people to do their own things.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I'm scrolling up.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
We have also learned a lot from you guys.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Rob, you have taught us to be ourselves, to respect others and their opinions, even if they're wrong.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000
And to be confident and achieve our goals, even if they seem silly or downright outreachable.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Jamie, you have taught us to be assertive, to be critical of everything, whether it's good or bad.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
To not give a damn about what people think of us and enjoy our lives.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Okay.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
And Loki, you've taught us to question everything, not to accept anything as it is.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:14.000
And that being a snark doesn't always mean you have to be a douche a-hole to be vocal about our opinions.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I laughed.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Love it.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000
You're an inspiration for all of us listening, whether it's been ten years, five years, or even just a few months.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
We are forever grateful for making every week a blast.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.000
You may not have many awards or recognition, but in our hearts you are and will be the best show on the internet.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
You know, the one award we have is Sitting on My Mantle.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
And it's not moving.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
It was a good award. It was the first podcast award for gaming.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Yeah.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Congrats Orange Lounge Radio. Congrats for ten fabulous years.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:49.000
I seriously couldn't imagine my life without you guys, without chat, without I love that song, and while anything the OLR has given me all these years.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000
And while you may act like a ten-year-old sometimes, you have the maturity and wisdom of a person a hundred years old.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I hope we don't have the bathroom problems of people of a hundred years old, however.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Hopefully the stream won't end anytime soon.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
So here's for another ten whole years.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Raises glass.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Toast!

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Thanks for everything.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Speaking of toast.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Speaking of toast.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Yay!

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
French toast!

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Wait, what?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Ew, hello not French toast.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I love French toast!

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
French toast is amazing.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
There is a place, okay, I'm going on the food tangent.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:32.000
There's a place in Sacramento that has French toast made out of challah.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
What's challah?

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Challah!

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Challah?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:45.000
It's basically a Jewish bread that's braided and very delicious, kind of eggy.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
That does sound delicious.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
This is the best French toast.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Challah French toast.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Oh, I get the glowing cup from electronica.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
So we have wine and soda for those not drinking.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
And Misty, thank you for providing the wine tonight.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000
So because the emailer said so, here it is, a toast.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And if there was one common theme between all those emails, guys, ten more years.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
What do you say?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
To our 40s?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I'm trying not to spill.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
We had clingies.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Cling.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Okay.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Misty, Misty, Misty.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
And now everyone get drunk.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
As I spill it on my shirt.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
That's some good wine.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I'm gonna get water intoxicated.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
It's making my headache feel a lot better, so.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
That's good.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I'm sorry to hear you have a headache and can't partake, but.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
It was probably the stress of coming up with an idea last minute and then deciding, hey,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I'm gonna do this real quick.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
And then my brain's like, no.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
By the way, I have a follow up.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And I kind of didn't react because I kind of did like this double take, like what, what?

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
But I'm text messaging grandpa right now.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.000
And I sent him the screenshot of IRC and said it says this number, but it's 76 when you

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
subtract the bots.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.000
And I said, I won't hold you to that.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
You really don't have to.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
He replied back, I'm of my word.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
760 bucks for VOG right there.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Sweet.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.000
So that's, um, I'll throw in another 40 just around that up to 80.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
What?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Really?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Yeah.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And then there's listening.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
I like round numbers.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Well there.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And you know what, Rob?

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
What?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000
What I will do, cause you know, I had that account open.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Um, how about we go take it and convert it to a business account.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Sounds great.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
We'll get started on that.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
We have plenty.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
We have at least two or three people in chat.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
They want to donate.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.000
There's like five bucks left in it right now because I started putting my design money

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
in it.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Um, it may not be much in the scope of things.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I mean, let's be real, you know, for a business, but I, uh, you considering black Wolf and

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
I have probably paid about that much out of pocket.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Like I can't speak to a black Wolf has spent, but I know I've spent enough.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Let's just leave it at that on getting the feed up and running.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
And I'm sure Bobby spent at least that much.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
If not about twice as much from his end of the things, cause he bought software and designs

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
for the site.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:18.000
So just to like get that money to for the next year is, is a great, great burden off

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
our shoulders actually.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Well, and here's the other thing that we kind of talked about it before, but I'm going to

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
have that book up probably in the next three months because I've already started working

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
on it.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And, um, you know, it's kind of like my thank you to everyone here.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Who's been listening to, but, um, you know, there'll be more coming up about the book

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
cause I'm, I'm designing it beginning to end.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So, um, as soon as people send me old logos, Frisbee says, now you won't be able to say

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
how you don't make any money on the show.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Well, something to think about though, Frisbee.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
We don't plan on using the money to buy ourselves a vacation to Tahiti, although that would

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
be nice.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Uh, the money's going to go right back into the show.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I can tell you, I came this close, this close to drop in threes.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
This close to drop in $300 on new microphones for all of us as a 10th anniversary surprise

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
for the show.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
And the only, cause I want to upgrade to condenser mics because the sound quality would be like,

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Oh my God.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000
But the only thing that stopped me is that we would have to have three mic stands.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
And in my little bitty apartment that ain't going to fly.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Unless we get rock bandstands.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Maybe.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
We'll see.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
We'll see.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
You can also get the ones that are there on the swing arm things.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Like they have the little, they look like, yeah, so desk lamps or you can use a desk

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
lamp.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
So all the money is going right back into the show.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And don't forget my husband works at radio shack.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
So, all right.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Um, thank you guys so much.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000
We will have, as soon as, as soon as Jamie has the account set up, we will tell you guys

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000
how you can donate.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
We have to, we have to tread carefully here though, because I'm really worried about tax

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
stuff.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I don't know that stuff at all.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000
So I need tax help.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
If anybody out there knows how to do taxes for a small thing like us, I, that's what

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I could really use.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Well, I mean, I think it's actually, and I'm not going to say any more about this, but

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
maybe it is time to start looking into an actual business license.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
We had one.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
We did.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Yeah, we let it lapse.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Yeah.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Anyway, we won't talk about that on there.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Okay.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
All right.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
We have four emails left.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Yes.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Dear orange launch radio, I would like to wish everyone at OLR a happy 10th birthday

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
and an attempt to keep this email short and to the point.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Let me say thank you.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I started listening to the podcast back on March.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
What?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I heard snorting.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Just chat.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Okay.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
I started listening to the podcast back in March, 2010 after I bought my first iPod touch.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Wow.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
From that point on, sky, dark soccer and lucky have become an important part of my life.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Do we touch you?

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Okay.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Anyway.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Sundays became orange launch radio nights instead of moaning and groaning for the upcoming

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
workweek.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I know that many listeners say that OLR has been a positive aspect in their life and I

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
fully agree with the listeners.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Through bad relationships, major family issues and a brief period of unemployment.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000
OLR has been a constant positive in my life.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
With a show slash podcast to listen to every week, I truly feel that the host chat room

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
and fellow listeners have become my second family.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Once again, thank you orange launch radio for running strong for 10 years.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
You have been there for me through my worst case of heartbreak and you have definitely

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.000
been there for me when my days have been full of smiles and fun.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Whatever the future may bring to the show and the listeners, I am definitely going to

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
be there just like how OLR has been there for me.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Apologies in advance for any grammatical or sentence structure errors.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Happy birthday.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
And that's from Sherzo, AKA Gion.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000
And you're, I didn't even care about grammar because I'm so verklempt.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I'm feeling verklempt.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Here's a topic.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Talk amongst yourselves.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Sorry.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
No.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Okay.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Three more to go.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Holy moly.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
To Rob, Loki and Dark Sakura.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, allow me to quickly thank you for all the work you

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
have done over the past 10 years in that effort to entertain your listeners.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I'm an older listener in that I remember your days on Live 365.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Live 365.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Ah, who cares?

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
They sucked anyway.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Bite me.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
And then that was just on behalf of them.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
We had good years on Live 365.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
They took care of us for a little while.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
We did.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
We did.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Betty was nice.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Betty was nice.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And then becoming a member of the all games community and finally joining you on your

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
very own network vlog.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I have met each of you at least once, although I am fairly certain it is more than that.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Whether it be at E3 or up at PAX in Seattle.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.000
The memory that jumps to the forefront of my mind is when we had the community meetup

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
at the 2008 PAX in Seattle.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000
I remembered listening to you broadcast live and then once the show floor closed, the whole

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.000
group would walk around downtown Seattle in search of food and fun.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I remember that everyone finally settled on Wild Ginger and how we initially had trouble

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
finding a restaurant due to the large size of our group.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Everyone settled in and it was a lot of fun visiting with everyone, talking face to face

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
with people we normally only get to speak to in a chat room.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I'm sure you received lots of emails this week, so I won't take up your time any further.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Congratulations on this incredible milestone and I look forward to seeing everyone again

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
at future events.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
And that's from ShadowNextGen.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I agree.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:08.000
That was a great memory and I hope with VOG we can accomplish once again things like that

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
because I think that sort of event was what we really missed doing.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Yeah.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Well, this one isn't an anniversary memory.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It's actually news.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
The next one.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
What do you mean?

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
There's gaming news this week?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Chris Hilsbeck, the guy who did the music for the Amiga Classic.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
And this is Turrican, sorry.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
We'll be doing a soundtrack concert for all three Turrican games with a live orchestra

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
November 10th in Cologne, Germany.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Have a good one, guys.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Wow.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
That comes from RDG.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I think they had a Kickstarter for some Turrican soundtrack.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
It's a link from Kickstarter.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Very cool.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Okay.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Oh, dude, we got another email in too.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Well, I said I was going to read them, so why not?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
This one comes from Dan Shadow.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Congratulations on 10 years, guys.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I remember when I first started listening to you guys, the podcast was split into two

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
parts and DC vs. Mortal Kombat was just announced.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I found you from a Yahoo widget, by the way.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Since the show, I, uh oh, lost my virginity.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Me too.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000
No, just kidding.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000
He graduated high school, got like six jobs, got married, started a podcast with Jamie,

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000
ended a podcast with Jamie, made a baby.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Feel old yet?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Phoenix Force 5 for the win.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Thanks, guys.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
I'm Batman.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:30.000
That's, okay, the I'm Batman thing came from when we were doing Monday Comic Mania.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Alright, yeah.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And he'd do his Christian Bale Batman.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
He didn't talk like that, so he's Batman.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
No, I am Batman.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And then this one, okay.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Dear OLR, I love the podcast.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
However, there is one thing I must say.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Every time the show starts, Loki always discusses what epic or not so epic meal he is having

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
at the moment.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Tuning in on the following day, it always makes me super hungry.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
So now I just make it a point to have an epic meal on Mondays while listening.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Just thought I'd let you guys know your influence on my appetite.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:05.000
You know, I made an epic meal yesterday.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
We had pizza because we were playing Catan.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
What does that have to do with pizza?

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Well, I was talking about the epic meal they had yesterday.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I had a bacon pizza that I made myself.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Bacon and garlic pizza.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
That actually sounds pretty epic.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I also have never had Pink Berry and hope to try it someday.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
What flavor should I get?

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Chocolate? Strawberry?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I seriously want Pink Berry to call this show and thank us for the free advertising.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I deserve a small peanut butter with mochi.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.000
We deserve our own dispenser of blood orange in each of our kitchens.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I want blood orange lounge radio.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Yes.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Thanks and keep up the great work, Randy.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
You know what?

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.000
That is two emails on our 10th anniversary going, congrats, tell me more about Pink Berry.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000
You know what, Rob?

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.000
The name Randy always makes me laugh because of a catering place that's near my house called Randy Peters.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And that really makes me laugh because Randy.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.000
And the name Peter is also a nickname for certain parts of the male genitalia.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
The penis.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Yes, Loki. The penis.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.000
So Randy Peters.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Are you feeling Randy?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Starring Randy Peters. Yeah, I can see that.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
That would be the best male porn name ever.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000
That sounds like a British male porn name.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Or Sir John Thomas.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
All right. Is that it for emails?

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
That is it. I closed it.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Well, you know what comes after the emails.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Ten years of pent up angst.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Here's your mama.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.000
F you to me because I missed Girls Gone Wild today and I was so excited about it.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
But I was like I was dreaming about the show.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I texted Rob in my sleep.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Okay. And and Garris.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
I blame Garris for this, too.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:22.000
And I blame Shane for me blaming Garris because about Mass Effect.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I have played over since yesterday.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I played 20 something hours of Mass Effect.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I do not know what's wrong with me.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I never even did that on WoW. So the last game that I played like that was Final Fantasy 6 when I was in high school.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Just saying. Just saying.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I'm done.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Fuck you to my headache because I hate games.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I think it's a sinus headache because it's been a little windy today.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And fuck you to certain websites for not allowing me to post a vlog about this show having a ten year anniversary.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Because they can have wonderful topics like,

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Woman hit by balls sues little leaguer.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Or work in progress zombie survival short story.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Or hey is this person on the forum gay?

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:23.000
You know they can have those posts on there. Oh but I post about something and they're just like eh no.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
We need to remove that post.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
That is kind of stupid.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Eh whatever. They're kids.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Why am I on a forum about.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Fuck kids.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Why am I a modding forum with all fuck me. Seriously it's all kids.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I mean not really.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I mean.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I'm not like that guy at Penn State.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I talk to these people online and then like I talk to them over Xbox Live because they want to talk to me about like modding and stuff and they're like teenagers.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I mean I feel so old.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I'm like yeah I'm like thirty something and you're sixteen seventeen.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I don't know.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Black Wolf does point out we did get some upvotes on Reddit.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000
We never made the front page but the press release did get on Reddit and some folks actually upvoted it.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Probably helped that we asked pretty please on Facebook and so forth but anyway.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:17.000
My FU of the week goes to all this sugary food I'm eating that's making me fat.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Moving on.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Let's go to the folks that are on the couch.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
The stuff that I brought is wheat free.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Just a kind of a sort of a proxy FU.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Gamer girl has this FU too.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:33.000
She has this what is that carpal tunnel in her hand really bad.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000
So FU to that.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.000
FU to traffic because I almost didn't make it here on time today.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:47.000
And he mentioned bacon pizza and now I really want bacon pizza.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
So FU to Loki.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Misty.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I will go ahead and second that FU to carpal tunnel.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I would not be surprised if I were getting it in my right wrist.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Other than that.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Yeah again not winning the lottery.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Because when I win the lottery once I get all the tech shit dealt with I will supply money for the fort.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Awesome FU to not having a fort.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I think that's what it comes down to.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Thanks you guys.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Alright that does it for the FUs of the week.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Let's see.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000
So we did FUs.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Check.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000
We did mailbag.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Check.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Fugal.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Check.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Hey I think it's time to open up the Skype line and see what you guys have to say.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
The Skype line is now open for your calls on this very special 10th anniversary.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Whatever you want to talk about.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
If you want to talk about you know the 10th anniversary.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Cool.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
You want to talk about something going on in gaming.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Awesome.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
They're taking bets on who the first person is that's going to be through right now.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
We'll see what happens.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Meanwhile I could go to Twitter.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I want to read some of the comments from Twitter actually.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Because we got some really nice 10th anniversary.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I guess not because the Skype line is fired up.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
So let's go to the Skype line and take some calls.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Who's this?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Hola.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Bienvenidos.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Hello.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Hello?

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Caller we can't hear you.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Hi.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Who's this?

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000
This would be wonderful if Skype would actually decide to work with me tonight.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Who is this?

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000
This is Jason.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Hi Jason.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.000
What's on your mind buddy?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Jason of the awesome.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.000
F you to Loki because I'm really hungry.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
So I'll second JV Mon.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Well that's not all I have to say but that was the most important thing in the last five

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.000
minutes that's for sure.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.000
It's always important to turn to Loki and say hey buddy F you.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Oh it is.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Oh it is.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Time and time again.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Oh I didn't really have anything specific other than to carry on the torch of the show

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:56.000
that I don't recall if I actually started listening in 02.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I know I was still in high school so that puts it in 03 I remember my group of friends

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:06.000
that we would kind of crowd around and listen when it was still all the wonderful Bimani

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.000
discussion that we all know and love and obviously it's turned into a lot more and a lot less

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.000
than that.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
A lot less.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I have no idea why I just said that.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Obviously it's turned into a hell of a lot more a number of times since then.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Hopefully in a good way.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Oh absolutely.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Well thank you.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Numerous events of live coverage and yeah definitely hopefully that all starts coming back.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:34.000
And thank you it's very important to also say thank you as well to Jason because Jason

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:40.000
if people don't know this Jason pretty much is the guy behind the website and the fact

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:46.000
that we have a space to post or to post our podcast is thanks to Jason without him we

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
may not have a place or we would have to dip into having ads in order to be able to host

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
it or something but Jason made that happen for us so we really appreciate that.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yeah and no expectation of changing that anytime soon.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Thank you so much.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Unless you guys want to that's all your choice of course.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Outside of the vlog stuff no not really.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
We still have a place to host our show so.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Shit anything else you want to say?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I want to be back on the show but that's for the future.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Come visit get on a train you might cross paths with Misty.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:28.000
July, August, November, January and then at the very least continuing perpetual August

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:31.000
and January after that seems kind of definitive.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Let me whenever you want Jason just let us know when because you know we'll have your

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
sexy radio voice on anytime.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Hell yeah my microphone and tone.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
If you're needing these suggestions if you go after some more microphones let's talk

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:47.000
because you know I brought mine and we're kind of I'm kind of up on the lingo of microphones

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
lately.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Yes I would love I want my voice to be sexy like yours how do I make that happen?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Pay way too much money unfortunately is the answer to that question.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Hooray.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
And next time warn me so we can crash it together.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Yeah yeah absolutely.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Amtrak buddies for life.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Who needs planes?

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Who needs planes?

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
All right Jason I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls but thanks again for

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
all you do.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Good night guys congratulations.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Take care thanks.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Couldn't have done it without you.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Later.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:15.000
1877 game OLR or the calls keep on coming in.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
It's Shane.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
It's Shane what's up?

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Well I'm doing my three favorite things right now in the world can you guess them?

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:32.000
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio you're talking to me and talking about Mass Effect

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
with me.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Talking about none of those are the right answer.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I am playing Mass Effect I'm playing Pokemon and watching Law and Order.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:47.000
So I wanted to say happy 20th anniversary or whatever it is.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Thank you appreciate your paying attention yes.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000
And I wanted to say that for me without this show I never would have worked at Konami and

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
that's a major thing for me so I have to thank the show for that.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I'm kind of sorry about that too at the same time.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
No I'm kidding.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
You had some great memories at Konami though right?

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Yes like the time I passed out drunk under my desk.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000
That was one of my best memories.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Are you supposed to be telling these stories on the show?

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Is that the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work while making DDR?

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
No.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.000
What is the most scandalous thing that ever happened at work during the making of DDR

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
that you can talk about?

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:35.000
I wouldn't say it's during the making of DDR but I would say one of the more scandalous

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.000
things was towards the end of our office closing because they opened the LA one.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:51.000
We had no females work there anymore so one of the guys wore no pants while he worked.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
I mean he still had underwear on but he decided that since there were no females there was

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
no reason for pants.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Hey Shane last week I went to work with no pants.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
What was that?

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Last week I went to work with no pants.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Maybe you were wearing a skirt.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
This is true.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000
He was not wearing a skirt.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
This is really important Shane this is the most important question.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000
You tell a kilt.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Was it boxers or briefs?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
It was boxers.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Okay because boxers that's kind of like swimwear.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
That's not that bad.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.000
That's still going with no pants.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000
That is true.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Now boxer briefs are fairly exciting.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
They're kind of in the middle.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Because then you get the grippy with the.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Alright look that's not what we're here to talk about tonight.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
I don't know what show you're listening to.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Underwear lounge radio.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
This sounds about par for the course.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
That's what you're talking about.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
And Garris.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
That's a great story about Konami.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Some of the games were designed with no pants.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
You think they would have come out better.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
No just kidding the Ultra Mix games were the best in the series.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
You know I've always said that and it's not just because you guys were working on them.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Pantsless rage.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
But think about this you guys.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.000
If it weren't for this show then Shane would have ended up at Konami.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:08.000
In a way this show impacted the game we made this show about.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
It's true.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.000
And you guys wouldn't have had those exclusives reveals.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Because I was the one that brought those songs to you.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
That's true you brought the first couple.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.000
And then we were able to hook up with Stillwind later on.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000
And you know unfortunately we had the news a few years ago that he passed away.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:30.000
But he was a big part when Ultra Mix 4 was coming out.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:33.000
He let our show straight up have the exclusives on everything.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And that was a wonderful honor.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
And you know he is greatly missed.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:41.000
As is well Jason didn't pass away.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000
But Jason you know moved on from Konami.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Or had to move on from Konami.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000
And obviously his lack of impact.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
You know not being at Konami anymore has greatly been felt.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
You know so.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
This is true.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000
As for saying in chat that you're kind of a big deal.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Because you made a lot of the step charts to the songs we love.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
That's true.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.000
But as I was I think talking to him one night about.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Like I go back and look at my old stuff.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
And some of it's garbage.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Like really really truly garbage.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
And I wish I could get a do over.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
It's kind of funny too.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Because someone like you know you got me into Echo Image.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Which is like one of my favorite bands ever now.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Because of DDR.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
And maybe I'm not supposed to say this.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
But oh shit oh well it's been seven years.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.000
You told me about that song long before the game was out.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Because it was amazing.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
And played the CD for me. What?

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
It's been seven years?

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
It's been a long time hasn't it?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
How long has it been since Ultra Mix was out?

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
A million years I don't know.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Like 2005?

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I've known Shane for.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000
You and I met because of this show obviously.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Yeah it was because of Animal Crossing.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
That's right it was.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
And then so god I've probably known you at least nine years.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Because I remember you came to this show like during its first year.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
And all that.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
But yeah you told me about Skulk and all that.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
And then we found the CD somewhere.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And I fell in love with that CD.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
And that's one of my favorite bands ever now.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Even though they only ever did one stinking album.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yes because they're lazy and Norwegian or whatever.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Which is you know the same thing.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
They're just high.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Alright Shane I gotta let you go to get more calls.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
They're busy wrestling me.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Anything else you want to say especially about us?

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
No why would I want to talk about you?

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I don't know. Because we're awesome.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Because of Garris.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
I thought it's but Garris not because of Garris.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Because without us Shane you wouldn't be playing Mass Effect.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
That's a lie. It's reverse.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Alright bye.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Bye.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000
1877 game OLR. Our username on skype is orange launch radio.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Or the phone is already ringing so you can just go to another phone.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Oh hi.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:01.000
I wasn't expecting to be next but hi.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Hi.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Shut off your radio stream because I'm hearing myself.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Oh okay.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
I don't know why I'm hearing myself.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Go ahead and say what you want to say.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Oh I'm sorry.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I wanted to say that I've been here for a whole seven years.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Well off and on.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
And I'm putting in my headphones so you don't hear yourself.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Yay.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Give me a second.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Dang it.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Alright.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I wanted to say that

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I enjoy listening to you guys.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
When I came back from

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Rhode Island and I was starting to get into

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Dance Dance Revolution

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I found you guys on

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Live 365 and

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I started listening

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
and I met a lot of good friends like

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Richie which is

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
you know

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
I forget his name

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
while here.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
I've met Junami and

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
I just stayed for a long time.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
And if you guys weren't here

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I wouldn't have started, had the

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
inspiration to start this ingenious radio.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
We're just still going by the way.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Congratulations on that.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I actually was, I mean this is going to sound terrible

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
but I knew you guys had started the show

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
or the station. I knew it was kind of like

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
you know a spin off of what had

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
been going on at OLR but I actually thought

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
it stopped during the time

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
we were doing all games but apparently it hadn't.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
It's still going.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Yep. We're still doing. Congrats on that.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
You guys have got to be getting up to like

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
eight or nine years yourselves.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
No. Really?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Probably about four or five maybe.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I thought it was more than that. Alright.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
We've been around for a while. I started on Live 365

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
back in the day

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
and like I was just starting it

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
and I was like huh.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Maybe if I, and then Jaded kind of

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
like took over from there and

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
created like a solid stream and everything.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
I ask him every now and then if I can

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
start my own stream you know

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
stream on the station

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
and he lets me every now and then

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
but I haven't gotten contact with him

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
for like a few months but I do too.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I think one of the best comments we ever

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
get on the show about

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
doing the show is that you know you guys

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
because of you guys I kind of

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
figured out how to do my own podcast or

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I learned that any idiot can podcast

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
because you guys do it so I started

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
my own show and believe it or not that's actually

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
like you know what they say imitation

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
is the finest form of flattery.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Not to say that everybody's copying us because

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I don't think they are but just the fact that

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
we're empowering people to let their own voices

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
be heard means a lot

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
and it's a great compliment. It really is.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Yeah.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Thank you for being around. If you

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
weren't around I would never

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
have any friends from the DDR

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
universe. I've been friends with

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Junami for over seven years.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Wow. Well congrats and

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
thank you for listening and being here

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
with the show. Do you have anything else you want to share

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
tonight? I love you guys.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Mwah. Heart heart heart heart.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Hold on hold on somebody else wants to send

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
kisses. Here he is.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
There you go.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Alright. Have a great night

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:07.000
uni. Bye. Bye.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I don't even have to give the number. The calls just keep coming in.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio. Who's this?

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Hello.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Hello and let me just say

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
if you're not getting through

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
on Skype it's never

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
been this busy on the phone so just keep

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
trying. We'll get to you eventually. We have

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
a good 30 minutes still to take calls.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
What's on your mind SSJ100 map?

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Not much. Just want to

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
congratulate you guys on ten years

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
of amazing work in our radio.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Thank you very much.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Well you know I was

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
trying to do the map and how long

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
I've been actually listening and I came up

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
with 2004

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I started listening to the show.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Wow that was a long time ago.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
And thank you for the holiday news.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
The funny thing is

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I didn't start listening to

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
all our posts. I think

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
I told you this several times that

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
I started listening to

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
a show that you would have on Wednesday nights

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
on lives 365.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Outside the Box.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Oh yes. Outside

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
the Box. Oh god. The spinoff

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
shows. Before there

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
was Horde House

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
there were shows, spinoff shows

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
on the Orange Tons

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Radio network. Yes I

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
remember Outside the Box very well.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Which is kind of you know the prerequisite

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
to the video game show

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
that this became.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
In a way yeah.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I never really thought about it that way

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
which I know sounds weird but you're right.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
We kind of

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
started doing the general gaming

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
chat there. I think I kind of always

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
had the fire in me

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
to do like a general gaming show

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
and like I think maybe subconsciously

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
I kind of knew that's where this show was headed.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
So that's why we had Outside the Box.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I think you know back then

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
it was you

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
DDR Angel and Wanky Style

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
kind of thing.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
So

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
yeah now that's what I started with.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
I was originally

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
introduced to the show by Sephora 12

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
16

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
who

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
you know

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
who caught on to it from

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
DDR Freak re-broadcasting

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
the show.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Oh yeah DDR Freak.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Yeah they re-broadcast it.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
They re-broadcast it.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Like that.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
SSJ 100 Matt I have something special

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
just for you.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Since you brought up old memories

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
here's a really old memory.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
You ready?

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
It is Wednesday night.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
You are tuned in to Outside the Box

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
live on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Outside the Box

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
is a show dedicated to

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
video game news, reviews

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
and all the other randomness

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
you might discover

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Outside the Box.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000

Sky, Rice Princess

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
and Wanky Style.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
I remember the one

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
cause I used to play

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Final Fantasy 11 right next to you guys

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
on that.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
It was

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Final Fantasy 7

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
where you guys were playing One Winged Angel

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
or whatever.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
MURDER!

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Yeah that was a good memory.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
You know you bring up a good point

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
that really was

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I mean especially as you listen to the intro

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
it's about video games

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
and all the randomness outside the box.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
That's kind of this fucking show

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
now.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
So in a way Outside the Box took over

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
you make a damn good point.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Yeah.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Well most of all you know

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
all of that has always been about the community

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
the fans and everything

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
and I think over the past ten years

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
we've kind of grown to a really nice community.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
We've

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
gotten friends involved in the show

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
I mean I've got

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
I've told a couple of people

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
and now you guys

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
while we are

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
going to have a dream game about you

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
guys coming out.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
So you know

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
I've always said tell a friend

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
and it's true

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
tell a friend

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
and the show keeps getting bigger and bigger.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
That's right and then it funds my future trips

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
to New York which I'm trying to get back to

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
but $800 will go a long way

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
and get me back to New York. No I'm kidding

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
but I will be trying to get back to New York

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
with my own money very soon so that will be awesome.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
It's true you know

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
I want to jump on the bandwagon of donations

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
and

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
next time I see

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
any of you guys

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
I'll buy you a beer or

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
probably in your case red mango

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
or pinkberry.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
I'll take free beer

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
and free yogurt.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
And I will always exchange holiday cards with you.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
That's true.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Alright well thank you so much for your

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
support SSG100M. It was a pleasure

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
meeting you a couple times and

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
I'm sure I'll see you guys again

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
up in New York. Absolutely.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Alright take care buddy.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
You know without SSG100M

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
I want to say without him

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
I think he's the one that got YYR to listen to this show

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
and I see YYR is in chat so he can confirm

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
or deny this. YYR of course

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
is making the first

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
OLR dream game a reality

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
budget ferret tossing which I guess he's in like

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
push push push mode with it right now and it sounds

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
like it's gonna be

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
a big game. Like it's gonna be

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
one that people are talking about outside this show.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
That is awesome. Cause it's

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
gonna be awesome. We're gonna do all we

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
can to make bungee ferret tossing a success.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
You know what I actually have

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
to thank SSG100M for having

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
a hand in helping me with my

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
conversion. Oh

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
that's true. That is that's there

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
we go. That's the big thing you went through personally.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Yeah. On this show.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Well I did get married. Oh yeah

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
there's that too. Eh that's no

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
big deal. I'm just kidding.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Alright um

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
I mean I got married too.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
I'm not making a big deal out of it. I got

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I had like four boyfriends

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
alright listen

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
but this one's the best one

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
obviously. I agree.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Me too. Alright let's move on.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Hello.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
this? This is Rama from

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Indonesia. Whoa

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
we got a call from Indonesia tonight?

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Yes. I

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
recognize your name from Twitter. I'm

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
happy you're listening live. What's up

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
buddy? Yeah

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
it's fun. It's nice to talk to

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
you finally because I've been here

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
for you know like um

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
since 06 I guess.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Oh my gosh. Well to what do

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
we owe this phone call tonight?

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Yeah so I just want to say

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
that you know maybe I'm the

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
father's caller.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
I did enjoy everything

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
that you know even though I'm blind

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
personally I can enjoy everything

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
that you've done. I'm

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
especially lucky and all

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
of that kind of joke

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
it's nice. Unfortunately

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
because of the distance you're breaking up really

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
bad and we're having a hard time hearing you but

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
I think I heard something about and I

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
know this is true about you from Twitter and everything

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
that you are a blind gamer and

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
you know what's funny is that we've had a couple

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
you're not the only one which is funny

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
we've had a couple blind gamers that I've

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
heard from from Twitter and we've gotten emails as

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
well and um it's really

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
it's really

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
humbling in a way because you know

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
sometimes we take things for granted

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
like you know sight

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
you know that not everybody has

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
and I

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
I'm so happy that we get to kind of deliver

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
something that you don't need that

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
for to be able to participate in this

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
program. I

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
it's just a

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
it's a really humbling

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
how big am I in this universe type of feeling

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
I can't explain it but it's

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
DDR Dollar Bill what is up buddy

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
hello hey

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
not much uh just first off

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
I want to wish you guys a happy

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
10 year anniversary since

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
you're wondering if your podcast I know has been around

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
for 10 years

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
we are finally snatching the crown

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
of we are the longest running video game

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
podcast on the internet we've done some heavy

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
research and we don't

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
think anybody has been around

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
right now anyway as long

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
as we have

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
you know it's a nice feather to put in our hat

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
um but what we don't want

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
to do is we don't want to be all like

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
well we're the best

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
cause we've been around that long cause that's

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
not the impression we want to give there's a lot

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
of great great shows out

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
there and you know just the other day I was

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
kind of talking on twitter with uh

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
video game outsiders you know I brought them up on the show plenty

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
of times I think they're a great show they have a

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
very similar chemistry to what we have here

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
except they kind of like whereas

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
our foundation is DDR

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
they were an adult gaming community

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
that played like the Tom Clancy games and some shooter

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
games so obviously a very different type

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
of thing but they were talking about like wow

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
we've been around for 7 years but

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I guess they had to correct somebody like oh yeah

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
OLR's been around longer but I'm like dude don't

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
sell yourselves short what you guys have accomplished

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
in 7 years is amazing

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
most shows don't get to

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
6 months or 1 year

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
and you know to have your

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
own community and all that is just

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
it's an amazing

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
feeling it really is so anyway

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
that's exactly the reason why

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
I try to listen to you guys

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
as much as I can because

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
it's mostly the community that actually has

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
me hooked on it I've met

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
a lot of great people on there

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
some in real life and some I wish

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
I could meet in real life one day

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
you know I've met some

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
I knew DJ Ramus from a while back

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
from some of the conventions I finally

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
got to meet actually I got to hang out with Misty

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
a little bit longer and take a train ride with her which was fantastic

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
I got to meet

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
some of the other people like the

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Effective Candy way back in the day

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
and Gamer Girl is one of my closest

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
friends now and even

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Jamie it's like so I don't talk to her

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
I still consider her really cool and

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
one of the people I admire the most

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
aww

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
now I'm gonna cry

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
oh someone's chopping onions in the

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
OLR studios oh shut up

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
oh just wait till October dude

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
what's in October

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
oh yeah there's a

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
train gathering I'm hanging out

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
with Misty for that one in Philly

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
that's awesome just to know that like this

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
show made people like want to hang out

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
is so cool

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
and just we really need to make

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
an effort to get to more conventions and

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
do these like especially packs because that's

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
you know that's the one that all the fans want to get to

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
and just like try to get people together and just like

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
hey let's let's go do

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
what this show

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
was think about it

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
this show is because we used to go to the

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
arcades and play video games and talk shit

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
so let's get together IRL

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
play video games and talk shit

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
exactly

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
oh my god did you see that guy

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Rob holding onto the bar

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
what you did this week

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
I forgot I mentioned um

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
well I didn't play it but I installed Step

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
maybe on my laptop mainly because

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
I was looking for sound files from 4th Mix

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
but I couldn't find them but uh

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
yeah

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
I have to admit when I was playing

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
DDR this week cause I did play Max 2

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
and I played Disney Rave once each

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
and I have to admit there was a part of me

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
that even though that dance pad was ass

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
cause it was from a golf land and one of the buttons

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
didn't even work there was a part of me that went

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
I kind of missed this

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
yeah well I was watching was it 4th

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Mix Plus and 4th Mix

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
videos and stuff like that I'm like damn

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I missed that machine was awesome

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
even just 4th Mix and stuff

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Max and Max 2 were

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
pretty sweet and

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
I kind of wish we had like something cause like I was even

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
looking at some of the uh cause I never really

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
got into Supernova and Supernova 2

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
and like I don't even know what the hell they have

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
now it's like uh that

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
versus 2nd Mix thing and stuff

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
and there's like you know

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I don't even know what

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
half of these songs are anymore

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
because I haven't played any of the

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
you know Bomani games in a while but it's like

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
that'd be kind of fun to go back

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
I have to admit there was a part of me that didn't want

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
to get up on the machine because I was like here I am

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
there's all these teenagers running around

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
all these people at the water park

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
here I am 34 years old

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
and I want to get up on that machine

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
and play DDR and make a fool of myself

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
but there really came a point where I said you know what

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
fuck em

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
hey man

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
I did the same exact thing um

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
when I was at Anime Central this uh this year

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
they had a 4th Mix Plus machine

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
and I got on

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
and I started

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I started doing tech and then

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
I think through the 2nd song I said ah

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
fuck this I'm not a techie

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
so I freestyled the rest of the damn

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
damn stages

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
nice that is awesome

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
and also there in over

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
New Jersey down to Jersey Shore

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
there is an older but still

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
workable 7th Mix

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
wow

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
that's pretty cool

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
that's awesome that there's still lots of DDR machines

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
that are working everywhere you know I should make it a goal

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
to go play DDR as many places as possible

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
before it's a thing of the past for real

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
for real so

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000

you know the only reason

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
I found you guys was through Bobby Black Wolf

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
show because I was a big fan of

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Friday Night Gaming and I believe

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
that the partnership that you guys

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
have got

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
together now is going to

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
bring you to a much better future

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
and I'm so

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
glad to be around

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
seeing this you know

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
well you know Bobby and

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
us you know are very kind of like

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
minded I mean Bobby was a big music

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
game fan as well if you

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
kind of look at our classic game of the week BeatMania

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
2DX Bobby will admit that's one of his

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
favorite games he even said in chat he would have

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
that game in his basement so there's a lot

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
that Bobby and us have in common yet we're

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
different enough where that our shows kind of

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
are different you know he's the very NPR show

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
we're the very morning room

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
waka waka waka type of show

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
and uh you know

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
we need a waka waka waka soundboard

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
but you know the two of us

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
actually compliment each other very well and I think

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
kind of professionally there's a lot we

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
look at too and you know especially

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
you know obviously it's no secret there's been some

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
big changes in the past year and there was

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
a lot that we were looking at going

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
what could we be doing better we kind of

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
feel like right now we're kind of

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
we're kind of riding a stationary bike

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
right now we're doing our things

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
we're burning calories we ain't going anywhere

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
so how can we take

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
this to the next level and you know that's

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Bobby's a great business partner

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
in that regard and shit I mean

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
look at what he has done with vog network

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
dot com look at that website

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
that is in a month

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
I mean it's amazing

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
so and you

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
know and I wouldn't have been listening to your show

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
without him and I'm so

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
glad that I stumbled upon it unfortunately

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
during my

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
my current situation at the time

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
when I first started listening to

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Bobby I wasn't able to hear your

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
show but now that I'm more involved with it I'm

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
just like so glad to be

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
a part well thank you

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
we're happy to have you here

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
the vog network clubhouse and all that

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
and I still have an open

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
invitation for you guys if you ever pass

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
through Napa I have

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
a wine

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
tour for you set up

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000

all going to have a good time well I went

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
I bet JV Mon wishes he'd known that

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
the other day when he went out there testing

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I'd be down for that as long as someone

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
you know carrying me by the time we're

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
done yeah I would have to get a DD

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
but if we could figure that out I'm not a fan

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
of wine. Jamie trust me I know the bus

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
schedule so you'll be alright

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
well we might have to take you up

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
on that Sunday because you know what I love

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
more than video games

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
booze drink responsibly

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
and thanks again

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
for the vog network clubhouse

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
you know that shit is epic

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
you know what Rob?

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
go ahead Dark Soccer first

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
in the article that

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Tara wrote on Geek Life there's actually a link

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
to

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
the one I wrote for Orange Downs Radio

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
back in the day that talked about our first few shows

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
so I relinked that in the chatroom

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
yes very cool

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
speaking of the clubhouse I was trying to visit the clubhouse

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
yesterday

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
I'm so glad I've never come back

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
to home because I tried

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
you know I downloaded the new client

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
and which I'm pissed off

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
because it didn't fucking save my crazy

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
hobo Santa

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
which is weird

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
so I had a new character so I was like

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
okay I'm going to check out the clothes in there

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
crash okay fine

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
I'm not going to check out the clothes relaunch the whole thing again

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
I'm going to try altering my appearance

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
crash again so I'm like fuck this

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
I'm not coming back to home

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
we got another call coming in I want to get to but let me just say this

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
I think home would benefit greatly if they would just

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
force you to do a 2 gig download

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
up front I mean there's just so much

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
buffering and loading

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
and you know it's just that's the one

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
drawback it's not as

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
smooth it's not

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
as seamless that's what I'm looking for of an experience

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
as it ought to be and if it was

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
that seamless experience I think home would

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
be the thing everybody's talking

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
about but certainly it has its fans

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
you know and I think because of

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
the environment that it does provide it's

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
kind of similar to Second Life but for gamers anyway

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
I won't get too far into that let me go to the phones

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
It's the one and only Ranma

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
Hey Ranma what's up you finally got through

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Yes cause you know you can't have an anniversary show

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
without me doing the toast

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Oh you missed us with

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
the wine already but I guess

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
I have some grapefruit soda

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
for you buddy

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Of course you know cause this year

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
it's ten years

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
ten great years of friendship which is

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
an awesome thing cause you know why?

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
Friends rock? Friends give you money when you're

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
poor? Yes my friendship is magic don't forget

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Ugh die

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Hehehe

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
But I have here

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
three drinks I have a Loki

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
I have a Jamie

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
and I have a Rob

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Now the first drink I dedicate to Loki

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
is a shot of very

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
strong honey mead

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
because he is straight forward

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
to the point we'll say what he

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
has to say and in the end

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Honey Badger doesn't give a fuck

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
And it burns a little going down does it?

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Ah yes

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Let's just walk away from that comment

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
On the bottle

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Ew he's eating that snake that's disgusting

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Now

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Next up I

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
have for Jamie

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Now for Christmas I got this nice

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
bottle of rum

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
It's very potent, very powerful

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
and I only open it for

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
special occasions and close friends

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
and Jamie is my darling Oogchon

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
so I toast

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
this glass to her

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
Thank you Ronchon

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
I think it might have onions in it

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
I think it might have a little onion in it

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
I'm gonna have a beer for you when I get home

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Make sure it's a Guinness

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
I'm not a Guinness but it's a Killians

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Now

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
I have here a drink

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
that Ron would probably enjoy

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
because we made this at a con a couple

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
of years ago, it's called

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Captain Fabulous

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
It's one part Captain

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
Morgan and two parts

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Fruit Punch, thus the name Captain

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
Fabulous

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
I remember Captain Fabulous

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
and it is Fabulous

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
Oh definitely, oh girl

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
Do you remember the drink we invented at Fanime?

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
When all we had was the

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
bottle of pineapple Malibu so we

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
paid five bucks for twenty ounce

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
of 7-Up

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
That was so epic

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
We made that 7-Up last and we're

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
playing apples to apples

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
Oh hell yes

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Drunk on pineapple Malibu and 7-Up

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
Oh Oogchon you are the party girl

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
And you saw me through

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
my horrible cosplay

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
There's no such thing as horrible cosplay

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
get over that, come on now

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
We didn't get to go to

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Fanime to do like, because that was one of the plans

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
was well we're gonna do something at Fanime for our

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
ten year anniversary or whatever

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
I still have my costume from Halloween

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
in my car

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
I was waiting to use that again

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Alright well Ron I gotta let you

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
go to try and squeeze in a few more calls

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
I didn't even do it, I didn't even take the drink yet

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
Drink it! Drink it!

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
What are you waiting for? Chug chug chug

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
Here's to you, here's to me

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
the best our friends will ever be

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
If we should ever happen to disagree, well

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
fuck you and here's to me, and it's going down

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
So I have to show you the other

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
toast

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
Here's to us, who's like us?

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Damn few, and they're all dead

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
Woo!

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Work's gonna be fun tomorrow

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Have a DD

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
if you need it, alright Rama

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
You better sleep fabulous homegirl

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
I will

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
Happy Pride Rama

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
Right back at you

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
Okay, stay Luigi

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Will do

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
1877 game OLR

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
username on skype is orange

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
lounge radio, it was gay pride this weekend

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
by the way, in San Francisco

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
and that brought up the conversation in the chat room

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
what if OLR had a pride parade

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
what would be the first float

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
and I said of course the opening

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
float would be the Bobby Blackwolf float

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
followed immediately

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
by Dykes on Bikes, because you

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
can't have a parade without

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
Dykes on Bikes, I'm sorry

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
That's what the people are coming out to see

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
I totally saw Dykes on Bikes

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
today at the parade

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Did you?

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
Yes, there was a few naked

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
Dykes on Bikes at the parade today too

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
That's cause you're in San Francisco

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
home of the finest, alright let's take some more

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
calls, hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Hey this is Acteft

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Hey Acteft, what's up?

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
Well, first of all

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
I want to again

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
thank you for 10 years of

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
magnificent online radio

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
Thank you very much

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
and thank you for being a part of it

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
I actually say

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
my words in Spanish, even though

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
you probably won't understand it, but

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
you know the message, you know the feeling

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
So

03:05:43.000 --> 03:06:05.000
...

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
There it is

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
That was very nice, thank you

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
I wanna make a joke about how

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
we know that's a song you sing at funerals

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
but I'm gonna stay away from doing that joke

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
cause it'd be disrespectful and I think

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
that was

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
very lovely, no really, thank you

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
It's humbling

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
to know that it's a worldwide

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
show and we've even been complimented before

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
and I take great pride

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
in this, speaking of OLR Pride

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
I take great pride in the fact that we do try to

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
remember that we do have a worldwide audience out there

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
that we're not, you know, the show from the Americas

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
you know, there

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
there is a whole world out there

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
And thank you for doing a bumper for us

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
Yeah, for VOG, yeah

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
Yeah, no problem, and again, thanks

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
for being, well, who you are

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
and bringing us every week

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
a very good show, even though we have

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
we have had some problems

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
from their side and even on my side

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
it's still a pleasure

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
and still pretty

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
enjoying to listen to you

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
well, listen to you every week

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
Damn, I'm

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
kinda nervous because I'm excited

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Let me put it this way, if friends

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
agreed on every single solitary thing

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
they'd be really boring

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
That's true

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
So we'll end on that note

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
Act Def, thank you so much, and enjoy

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
that Kirby collection coming out later this year

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Yeah, I will. I thought of you when I saw that

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
Alright, later buddy

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Later

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
We have one or two more calls

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
coming in. I hope we get through them all

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
it's already after 9

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
That's alright, we can go a little long tonight

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
We can go a little long tonight

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
I gotta let the rest of that wine burn

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
off so I can take

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
It's already gone

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
I had to put mine in the fridge, I didn't want to finish it off

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
because I don't want to drive drunk, that's irresponsible

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
so

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
Alright, oh

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
there it goes, lighting up again, hi, you're on

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
Hello, this is George Takei

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
Oh my

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
Oh my

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
What's up Georgie?

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
on your teniversary

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
Pretty soon this show will be older than you, George

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
I know, I'm looking forward to it

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
George, how do you stay so popular on Facebook?

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
That's what I want to know

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
Oh, I don't know

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
I guess it's just my natural charm

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
No, it's

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
Sturlock, hi, how's it going?

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
It's good, no, that was a good impression

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
I gotta say

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
Oh my

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
What's on your mind, Sturlock?

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Besides, apparently, George Takei

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
No, I don't know

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
I've always wanted to do that

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
I don't know, a long time ago

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
like a few years ago, you guys had mentioned

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
something about George Takei

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
and um

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
He needs to be my gay daddy

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
Well, I thought about calling in

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
to the voicemail or something

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
and just leaving a message as George Takei

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
saying like, oh, I heard your comments

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
and I just wanted to say thank you

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
but uh, anyway

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
It's that George Takei

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
has a really sexy voice

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
That's just all it is

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
It's a sexy, sexy voice

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
It is

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
Ever since that one commercial he did

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
about the basketball player

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
you know, running his hand along the guy's thigh

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
I was like, that is a porn voice

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
You

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
You forget, when you hear George Takei's

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
voice, you kind of forget that he's 78

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
and you still want to sleep with it, you know?

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
I know, he doesn't, you cannot tell

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
by his voice that he's that old

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
He even sounded like that in his 20s, you know

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
He just always had that deep and

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
melodious theatrical voice

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
Oh my

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
and there was also reaction today

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
from a prominent member of the gay community

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
including this celebrity

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:57.000
who went so far as to tape a PSA

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:11.000
Heh

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:17.000
Heh

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:25.000
Heh

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:35.000
Heh

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Heh

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:53.000
Heh

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
Alright, I'm sorry, that was quiet

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
but unfortunately that was at max

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
volume because YouTube's aren't

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
standardized, unfortunately

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
I hadn't heard that, actually, that was awesome

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
Oh, it's frickin' amazing, I love George Takei

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
But anyway, I wanted to

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
talk about how I discovered

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
O.L.R. Oh, please

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
Kind of an interesting

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
I came in at a weird time

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
I came in

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
sometime in 2007

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
back when

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
It was in that weird point where

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
you guys were being syndicated

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
on All Games but not

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
broadcasting from there

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
Oh right, yeah, we were the first affiliate show

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
on All Games Radio and

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
yeah, and again, Bobby was the station

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
manager at All Games at the time and you know

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
because he liked O.L.R.

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
and he knew we were doing the syndication

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
with DDR Freak Radio for a time

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
he'd offered it up to us and we were like

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
heck yeah, more people to hear our show? Of course

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
Why not? So yeah, that was

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
a great thing for us

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
So I remember when the whole

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
live 365 crap went down

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
when they were raising their prices

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
and you guys weren't sure what

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
you were going to do for a while

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
That is very true

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
But yeah

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
I've been, I don't know

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
I forget what my first

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
exact episode was

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
It was like

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
I don't know, in the 150's I want to say

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
or maybe 250's

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
But

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
I don't know, there was just something

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
about the chemistry

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
there with the three guys

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
and it was just a lot of fun to listen

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
to and very funny

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
and entertaining and I was just

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
kind of hooked

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
Well thank you for getting hooked on whatever

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
crack cocaine we must be offering because

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
people are just kind of like, I don't know, I just can't get enough

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
I just gotta go back and get another hit

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
I don't know

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
Now it's just like, I can't imagine

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
not listening to it on Sunday nights

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
It's just like when you guys aren't on, it's just like

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
well shit, what am I going to do for three hours?

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
It's a nice sentiment but it's also

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
a little bit scary I got to admit because you know

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
as they say, all good things

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
must come to an end. There will be a time when

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
OLR will end. I'm not saying it's happening now

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
or that it's even planned

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
but you know, shit happens

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
Yeah And we've had our scares

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
We have had many scares here

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
on Orange Lawns Radio

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
Somehow it always manages to pull through and we're still

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
here but you know, there is going to come a time where

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
we're going to have to come out here and say, sorry guys, it's ending

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
and that's

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
the impact that's going to have on some

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
people, I'm always like

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
well thank god we have an archive of

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
400 plus episodes that people

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
could always go back and listen to

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
When that happens, I'll probably just go back through every episode

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
that I have and just marathon it

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
I have a new friend

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
I have a new friend and it's somebody that Jamie knows as well

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
You know this girl, right?

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
And she loves

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
Beverly Hills 90210

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
And she doesn't want to admit that it ever ended

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
Not the new one, we don't count it

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
She doesn't ever want to admit that it ended

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
So she always likes to watch the old ones on DVD

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Aww

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000
We hope

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
It's just like with the new

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
Thundercats where

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
I don't know if you've seen the new Thundercats cartoon

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
but it's like

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
like most things

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
that are remade, it just

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
pales in comparison to the classic

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
80's cartoon

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
The same mutual friend introduced

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
me to a side a while back that's actually gone now

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000
that's called Elijah Wood is very

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000
very very very very very gay

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
It was all

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
kind of fuchsia colored

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
Nice

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
I saw her the other day!

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
I know, she told me about it. Anyway, we'll have to talk off air about that

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
because there's something else involving her that's happening

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000
next week that I want you to be a part of

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000
Alright, and you're going to tell me no

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000
Anyway,

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
the philosopher in chat says

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
Don't ever end, I will cry so hard

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Not half as hard as we probably will

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
Except for Loki, he doesn't cry

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
He'll cry a single man tear

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Let's not talk about that

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
10 more years, right kids?

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
Yes

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
Oh, and I didn't have it ready

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
but I was going to get you with the vuvuzela again

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
I didn't think of it until like 10 seconds ago

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000
Oh, darn, I'm so upset

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000
that you weren't able to find that

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000
What am I going to do?

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
You can try and squeeze in at least one or two more calls, okay buddy?

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
Alright, take care

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
Let's go to the phones

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
Hey guys

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
Is that DDR Angel?

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000
It is so good to hear from you

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000
The brain's behind the EcoMaker

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
I know

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000
Isn't he great?

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
Well, okay, only brain

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000
Exactly, website

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
That's your job because you're going to bring back the other thing

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000
You can plug the website all you want

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000
I can't do that

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000
I plugged it

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000
Plug's done

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
That's the future, I want to talk about the past

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
But Garris

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
Okay, shut up

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
DDR Angel, you were here

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
for many of the early episodes

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000
I don't think you were here in the very, very beginning

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
No, I wasn't

03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
Pretty fucking close, all things considered

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
I believe you kidnapped me in episode 39

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
In the scope of

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
462 episodes

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
39 is pretty much the beginning

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
Yeah, well

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
But Angel

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000
Shit, I don't even know what to say

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000
Thank you

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000
for being a big part of those first few episodes

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000
I know, I think of you

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000
in many ways as one of the

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000
first really

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000
hardcore passionate people about

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000
this show

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000
I still love it, you know, every Sunday

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000
So, even though I might not be

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000
in the chat room one Sunday or whatever, I'm still always

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000
paying attention to tweets and everything else

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000
too, so

03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000
I'm pretty much just like

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.000
Joe sitting on the couch over there

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000
I just want you to know

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000
we really appreciate it, because that type of

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000
enthusiasm, which obviously we also have people like

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000
Joe, Misty, JV

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000
You know, we have lots of people that are

03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000
so enthusiastic and everything

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000
I just remember you were one of the first

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000
I always thank you for that

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000
And I personally thank you guys also

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000
because, not only for ten years of friendship

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000
Thank you

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000
But if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000
met and married my husband and all that other stuff

03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000
It's just, you know, it's been a

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
crazy ten years, and I'm just looking forward

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000
to ten more plus

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
The crazy thing about what you just said

03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000
is that you're the second person

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
to tell me that this week, and I don't mean to belittle

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
your story because it's amazing, but

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000
Tiara was telling me the same thing on Facebook

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000
that inadvertently, you know, because of

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000
OLR, there was Geek Life

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000
and because of Geek Life, there was Dan

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
So, kind of the same thing happened for her

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
in a way, and it's... She has a Dan

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000
I have a Dan It's so

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
Yeah, and that in itself is cute, by the way

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000
It blows my mind, and in some ways

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000
I mean, I didn't meet

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000
Alan through OLR, but Alan

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000
and I probably got a lot closer because of it

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
So even my own life, this show has had

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
an impact on in that kind of way

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
It's crazy, it's very crazy

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000
But great

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000
And humbling

03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000
But maybe we can get together and see if you guys

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
can kidnap me again and I'll come on for a Sunday show

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
I'm sure we can arrange that

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
Let's work out the beats

03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000
Yeah, that'd be great

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000
Anyway, I don't really have much to say aside from

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000
all the thank yous and stuff I said earlier

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000
I'm not going to be very interesting tonight

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
Big hugs for you and the hubby

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000
and thanks for being a part of OLR's history

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
Hugs to you guys too

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000
Happy ten years again

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000
Bye!

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000
That's the time she played DDR was

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
Maybe she's just Angel now

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000
I don't know if she's still a DDR player or what

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000
Rama wants to know where is

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000
Salacious Pop since I brought Alan up

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000
Alan is working tonight, he couldn't make the show

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000
because he's working

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
Well, you know what, in this economy

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
I am fucking thrilled, he's working tonight

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
don't get me wrong, so

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
But I'm sure he would be here to say hello

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
and thanks for destroying the house while I'm not there tonight

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000
I'm going to give just a couple more minutes to see if any other calls come in

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
because I saw a couple

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
But we are getting towards the end of the show

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
How's your headache doing? Are you feeling better?

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
I feel bad

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000
I want to say thanks as well to

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000
JV Mon because I didn't get to say this on air

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000
because you did it during break, but you got us presents

03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:07.000
and there's nothing I love more in the world than presents

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000
and I got brought

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000
Dunkin Donuts K-Cups which you can't

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000
buy in California

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000
The K-Cups are the little Keurig machines

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000
We have the old school

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000
Keurig machine which we don't use anymore

03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000
because it sucks

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
but the new one is pretty awesome

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
They need to bring a Dunkin Donuts over here

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000
because we don't have a

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000
well we have a Krispy Kreme but it's all in Roseville

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000
I did drive there one time when I woke up

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000
for work at 5 in the morning

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000
because I'm like

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
I can't go back to sleep

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000
I'm driving to Rockland or Roseville

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
I want a donut

03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000
Let's go back to the phones

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
Who's this?

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000
Chugga Chugga

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000
Chugga Chugga

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
Choo Choo

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000
It's Jim Sally

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000
What is up Jim Sally?

03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000
Not much everybody

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
Happy anniversary everybody

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000
Thank you, would you buy me?

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000
Well I'll tell you what

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000
In honor of the donations I will donate

03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000
one dollar for every minute

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000
that this call goes on for

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000
How's that sound?

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000
Please hold

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000
Alright I seriously I'm not going to be

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
looking at the time but that's hilarious

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
What's on your mind buddy?

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
Not much man, I wanted

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
to call in and share some of my

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
Orange Launch Radio stories

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000
Please

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000
I used to always listen to you guys

03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000
I'll listen to the Bobby Show

03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
Everyone knows about the Bobby Show, it's a great show

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000
He's the man

03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000
He is the man, I wish Bobby lived close to me

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000
But anyway I listened to the Bobby Show

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000
Then I would listen

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000
to a little OLR on live

03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000
Because I have to always

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000
work early in the morning

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000
and maybe get like an hour into it

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000
This sounds bad, don't take this the wrong way

03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000
Guys I love you guys, don't take this the wrong way

03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000
Listen, I would

03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000
go to bed listening to you and I'd fall

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000
asleep listening to you every night

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000
I know that sounds horrible, it's just because I was really

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000
tired and I had to go to bed

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000
I listen to you while I sleep

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000
It sounds kind of kinky that the last thing you hear

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000
at night is my voice

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000
I do have fucking dreams about Loki sometimes

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000
I don't want to say that

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000
And then he's like, he's about to fall asleep and I'm like

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000
God damn it!

03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000
Yeah

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000
I was the champion wrestler in high school man

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000
I'll snuggle you in ways you've never seen buddy

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
I would snuggle

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000
As a caller three calls or so ago would say

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000
Oh my

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000
Oh that guy was awesome

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000
But you know what, no wait guys

03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000
You know what's nice though, I had a baby

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000
about a year ago

03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000
So I've been having to stay home so my baby would always be

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000
shitty at nighttime

03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000
How'd you accomplish that? I thought you were ill equipped

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
No, I'm Jim Salley

03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000
I can do anything baby

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000
This train is fully equipped

03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000
You know what I'm saying?

03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000
Let's not go into details

03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000
You know what I'm saying?

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
But when my baby would get shitty at night, I would turn you

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000
and then I'd listen until midnight, I'd sit in the rocking chair

03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000
with my baby beside me and the iPod on the

03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000
table and me and my baby

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000
for the last ten and a half months that she's been on

03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000
we listen every week

03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000
I don't know if I want to influence a baby

03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000
because that could be bad

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000
I totally want to influence a baby

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000
I already know how that turns out

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000
It's nice having a baby, it's like a little padawan learner

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000
teaching her soul and shit

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000
She chokes the shit out of the cat right now

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000
She's going to be ready when she gets

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.000
Fuck that dark side man, all the way

03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000
Fuck them light side bitches man

03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000
That's what I tell my baby every night

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000
You grow up to be an ultimate fighter

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000
I hope so, oh my god

03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000
My little girl is an ultimate fighter

03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000
Oh my Jesus

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000
Can you imagine?

03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000
There's only two things I want from my little girl

03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000
But now there's two things I want from my little girl

03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000
Number one, please become an MMA fighter

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000
The best MMA fighter in the world

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000
Pencil hold motherfuckers to death, oh I love her

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000
Number two, I pray to Jesus every day

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000
She's a lesbian

03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000
Every day I pray

03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000
Oh my god, I say Jesus, I think of myself

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.000
When I was a little boy, when I was like a 15 year old kid

03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000
I was a pig, I don't want no pig boys

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000
hanging around my girl

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000
Fuck that shit, I want her to just be a nice lesbian

03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.000
Find a nice girl

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000
Get them married, and then when they want to have kids

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000
I got two ovens to be baking babies in

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
Double that bacon up baby, bacon ovens baby

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000
Double them up

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000
The most interesting thing about what you've just said is it's clear

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000
you've given this some detailed thought

03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000
I'm telling you right now

03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000
If there was like, you know you can

03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000
pay for procedures and stuff

03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000
Do your baby in vitro and shit or whatever

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000
If you could pay to turn the gay switch on

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000
I would turn it on

03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000
That's when it gets turned on, when the baby's in the tummy

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000
That's when you gotta

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000
sink those genetics in there, I would have done it a long time ago

03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000
I've thought about this myself

03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000
cause you know, Dan and I were trying

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000
And I wanted to have a lesbian

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
And I'll tell you why

03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000
I'll tell you why, okay

03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000
I don't have to

03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000
pay for a bris

03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000
And number two

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000
I

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000
I think of all the money I would save

03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000
if I had a really dykey baby

03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000
Well you also gotta think about this too

03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000
cause you're a chick right, if you had a dykey baby and she was

03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000
more or less your size, boom, double your wardrobe

03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000
All of a sudden you're wearing the best

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000
clothes ever, right, your kids buy them

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
You just steal her from her closet, aw man

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000
I gotta say, one of the perks about

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000
being gay is that like if I have no clean

03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000
shirts, oh Alan has a clean shirt, I'll steal that

03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000
Like it works out really well

03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000
Clean shirts man

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000
Geez, did you really go for pride weekend this weekend guy?

03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000
No because you know I

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000
usually don't because Sundays are the show

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000
And I know this

03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000
I swear I'm not saying this to get pity, I'm really not

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000
The show kinda comes

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000
first before that, I haven't gone

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000
I've gone to some prides

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000
but I usually have to like run home in time for the show

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000
And I wanna say once or twice

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
in the ten years I did cancel out

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
on the show that week so I could you know do stuff in the city

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000
But you know I don't know, I don't get

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000
it's all, it's

03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000
too many people for me

03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000
I get gay pride

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000
like you know in the

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000
60's when it was not

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
okay to be gay and it was something you don't talk

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000
about and you had to hide it from the

03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000
world you know and

03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000
cops tried to arrest you because

03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000
you know you were gay

03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000
there was a point where we said

03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000
you know a bunch of gay people in a bar

03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000
in New York City said fuck you

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000
fuck the police, we are not gonna take this

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000
shit anymore and that's what pride

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000
is really about celebrating is it's

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000
like you know what we're gonna be

03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000
whoever the fuck we wanna be

03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000
and deal with it

03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.000
Well can I share a story

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.000
not to be a complete downer?

03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000
Well you know what last week was

03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000
Alan Turing's 100th birthday

03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000
Oh right yes of course

03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000
Basically because of him we have computers

03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000
pretty much and

03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000
you know at the end of his life

03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000
it came out that he was gay

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000
and his choices were either go to jail or go through

03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000
hormonal treatment so he killed himself

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000
Go to jail? That's so

03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000
stupid what they would do you know

03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000
This was in England

03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000
Well what can you expect sometimes right?

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000
They're pretty

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000
old school over there I guess. It's dumb though right?

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000
It's totally dumb like I'm straight

03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000
but I go to pride every year and I make a t-shirt

03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000
every year. Last year I had

03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000
I'm straight

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
364 days a year and on the back it said

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000
today's your lucky day

03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000
That was a funny shirt right?

03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000
Like why not? This year I had

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000
can a straight guy get some lovin'

03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000
and I just walked around my arms and I just got hugs from dudes right?

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000
Just get some hugs

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000
He's gotta go out because it's disgusting that this stuff happens

03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000
to our brothers man

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000
and gentlemen, straight boys

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000
I've said this a thousand times and I'll say it again

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000
the more gay dudes there are in the world

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000
the more boobies there are for us okay?

03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000
So help them out

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000
Give them the pride week you know what I mean?

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000
Put on this shirt and just go out

03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000
and have a good time. You can bring your girl

03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000
no one's gonna hit on her. So why wouldn't you

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000
bring your girl with you?

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000
It's the best. I remember the first time I went to

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000
Gay Days at Disneyland

03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000
and there were two brothers and one of them says

03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000
I'm not but he is on his shirt and the other one says

03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000
I am but he's not

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000
I've been to Disneyland. I think every day

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000
might be Gay's Day at Disneyland. I don't know

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000
This is when everybody's

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000
walking around in red shirts

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000
You either think it's a bunch of death waiting

03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000
to happen if you're a Star Trek fan

03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000
but anyway

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000
Alright Jim Sally

03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000
I gotta let you go but I have loved

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000
this call and I've loved talking to you tonight

03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000
and thank you for your support over the years

03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000
and whether your daughter

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000
grows up to be an

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000
MMA fighting champion or she

03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000
grows up to be Miss Canada

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000
I know she's gonna be great

03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000
Thanks guys. I'm just gonna

03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000
go to bed now and I'm gonna

03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000
try to smuggle with Loki

03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000
and go to sleep

03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000
Goodnight. Goodnight Jim

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000
Can Loki say it?

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000
He went to the bathroom

03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000
Your call made him pee

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000
I scared the piss out of him

03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
Alright Jim

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000
Take care buddy

03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000
Bye

03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000
Oh my gosh. Alright. I gotta try

03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000
One more call maybe?

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000
We're gonna have to say no more

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000
at some point. Hi you're on Orange Noms Radio

03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000
Who's this?

03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000
Hola bienvenidos a Orange Noms Radio

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000
Caller we can't hear you

03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000
Caller we can't hear you

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000
Can you hear us?

03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000
Could I just make up whatever you're saying right now?

03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000
Try again later

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000
Echo one two three

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000
kids. Echo one two three

03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000
Alright

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000
Hi you're on Orange Noms Radio

03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000
Who's this?

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000
Legend Zaku

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000
Zaku

03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000
Hi

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000
Legend Zaku

03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000
What is up?

03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000
Nothing much just having some

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000
internet issues at home trying to

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000
put out fires

03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000
You're the first one that got

03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000
cheers from the whole studio

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000
just so you know

03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000
What's up buddy?

03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.000
Really? Ah nothing much

03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:59.000
I mean well aside from you

03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:01.000
celebrating 10 years

03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.000
it's kind of a milestone in the sense

03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.000
that you can walk from one niche

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.000
genre of video games to encompass

03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.000
just about every genre

03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:11.000
and I guess part of it

03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:13.000
was also evolving

03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:15.000
you had to adapt to the fact

03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:17.000
that you couldn't just keep

03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:19.000
shoveling the money for

03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:21.000
affinity and at some point you had to

03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:23.000
become a bit more mainstream

03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:25.000
and so far

03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000
At some point we had to go from

03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:29.000
Charmander to Charizard

03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000
that had to happen

03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.000
That is true

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000
That's the whole point of evolving

03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:37.000
and the fact that you adapted

03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.000
you won podcast awards left and right

03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:41.000
or you were at least nominated for them

03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.000
Zaku we just wanted to be the very best

03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:45.000
that no one ever was

03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:47.000
And also everyone thinks you should be pounding

03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:49.000
on your keyboard while you're talking

03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.000
I'm not. I'm on my phone

03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:53.000
right now. I'm still trying to

03:30:53.000 --> 03:30:55.000
set up a new router that I had to put out

03:30:55.000 --> 03:30:57.000
fires with. Don't pound the phone

03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:01.000
So yeah I mean

03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:03.000
we're pretty much my routine for the past

03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:05.000
eight years

03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:07.000
almost on a consecutive basis

03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:09.000
except for the night that you were off

03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:11.000
obviously that breaks the streak but

03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.000
you get the idea. It was pretty much consistent

03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:15.000
Like almost Sunday night

03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:17.000
starting from like 2004 onwards

03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:19.000
we're just like listening to you guys

03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:23.000
pretty much that was it

03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:25.000
just like going there, listening to all our

03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000
and that's become almost

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:29.000
a routine

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000
It is like

03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:33.000
as you were saying

03:31:33.000 --> 03:31:35.000
It is kind of life changing

03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:37.000
that you have something

03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:39.000
that you

03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:41.000
just listen to that you try to

03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:43.000
out of curiosity

03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:45.000
all of a sudden

03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:47.000
it just sticks

03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:49.000
in a good way

03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:51.000
Well Zaku after all these years what would you say

03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:53.000
would be your favorite memory involving

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000
you and OLR because I know

03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:57.000
that I have my favorite memory

03:31:57.000 --> 03:31:59.000
involving you and OLR

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.000
Oh

03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:03.000
Me and Kat?

03:32:03.000 --> 03:32:05.000
Really?

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:07.000
You know what I mean?

03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:09.000
Well

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:11.000
It's been in and out

03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:13.000
but yeah I get the whole point

03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:15.000
I'm trying to remember right now

03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:17.000
Geez

03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:19.000
I think

03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:21.000
getting like interrupted

03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:23.000
during a Skype call

03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:27.000
a few years ago

03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:29.000
man there's so many

03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:31.000
it's really really hard to actually

03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:33.000
nail down on like

03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:35.000
something

03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:37.000
and it's just me and Kat

03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:39.000
and the whole thing else

03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:41.000
Alright Zaku

03:32:41.000 --> 03:32:43.000
no matter what I tell the other callers

03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:45.000
you're my favorite

03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:47.000
Yeah I'm right

03:32:47.000 --> 03:32:49.000
Alright take care of Zaku have a good night

03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:51.000
Yeah definitely

03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:53.000
and maybe 10 more years

03:32:53.000 --> 03:32:55.000
left upon you

03:32:55.000 --> 03:32:57.000
We will try our best

03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:59.000
We'll need lots of booze to get there

03:32:59.000 --> 03:33:01.000
Hope to see you when I come to New York next

03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:03.000
Thank you

03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:05.000
Hopefully you make it out there

03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:07.000
like soon

03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:09.000
Date TBD

03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:11.000
Alright later buddy

03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:13.000
Alright

03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:15.000
Alright

03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:17.000
Let's go to more calls

03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:19.000
Nobody asked for it tomorrow

03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:21.000
Hello

03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:23.000
Oh it's the intern

03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:25.000
Hi Drew

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:27.000
It's the one who forgets to choose his audio input before calling

03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:29.000
Yes echo 123 intern

03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:31.000
after all these years

03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:33.000
It's been a while

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:35.000
Can I be unfired yet?

03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:37.000
If you write on the blackboard

03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:39.000
100 times

03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:41.000
I heard that your joke book got upgraded to the back of Naugahyde

03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.000
I burned it

03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:45.000
I burned all of them

03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:47.000
All of the books

03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:49.000
I just want to congratulate you guys

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.000
I know I've been with you guys since

03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:53.000
episode 2

03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:55.000
and it's been a long crazy ass ride

03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.000
I wasn't even there

03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:59.000
Joe has you beat by one show

03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000
How does that make you feel?

03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:03.000
I know there can be only one

03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:05.000
so I'm going to have to take his head off one these days

03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.000
What was your favorite memory of OLR

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.000
because I know I have mine involving you

03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:13.000
and that's when you broke the fucking soundboard table

03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:17.000
God dammit man

03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.000
I'm just giving you shit, Drew

03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:21.000
Karyuki Revolution

03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000
anything involving Karyuki Revolution

03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:25.000
God what was it

03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:27.000
Episode 69 we decided to prank you with jelly beans and milkshakes

03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:31.000
and you took a sip on air

03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:33.000
the reaction was golden

03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:37.000
Absolutely priceless

03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.000
You'll have to go find that in the OLR archive

03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:41.000
Geez, Drew

03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:43.000
it's been ten years

03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:45.000
you've been listening to this show for ten years

03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:47.000
well on and off

03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000
I imagine

03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:51.000
what kind of impact has this show had for you?

03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:53.000
Well, for one it gives me something interesting to talk about

03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:55.000
at conventions

03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:57.000
but for that

03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:59.000
you know, I'm not a really boring guy otherwise

03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:01.000
And you did transform from being our young Republican

03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.000
to being a long haired hippie

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:05.000
Sorry, I'm recovering

03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:07.000
That's true

03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:09.000
We really did go through a very

03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:11.000
psychological shift at one point

03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:13.000
too, it's kind of neat

03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:15.000
We all grow up, most of us

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:17.000
Y'all do whatever politics you want

03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:19.000
I don't care

03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000
this is a diverse place

03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:23.000
I'm just saying that was a pretty big 360

03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:25.000
Yeah, I think it's interesting to watch a person

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:27.000
go through that type of change, for sure

03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:29.000
360?

03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:31.000
I don't own one of those

03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:33.000
Better than the Xbox lube

03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.000
Alright, Drew, any final thoughts

03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:37.000
before we let you go?

03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000
Hoping for many more years to come

03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:41.000
and I'm really appreciating

03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:43.000
the way Orange Launch Radio

03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:45.000
is going with Voice of Geeks

03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:47.000
and hopefully everything turns out

03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:49.000
well, I'll still keep listening

03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000
I'll still keep phoning in

03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:53.000
and I'll be a big part of the community

03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:55.000
that

03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:57.000
I mean, come on, it's been ten years, I grew up with you guys

03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:59.000
You did, quite literally

03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:01.000
Powerful thing to say

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.000
And you went to school with me

03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:05.000
Yes, I did

03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000
We would often run into each other on the lawn

03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.000
at ARC

03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.000
The grassy knoll, which no shots

03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:13.000
were fired at

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:15.000
Which is actually now sort of off limits

03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:17.000
since they're building the new student center

03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:19.000
Yeah, which I will never get to see

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:21.000
Aww

03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:23.000
You can always go back and forth

03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:25.000
Well Drew, thank you so much

03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:27.000
for being a part of the show for ten years

03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:29.000
and we'll see you next week

03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000
Definitely!

03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:33.000
Bye

03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:35.000
I think with that I'm gonna finally

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.000
close the Skype line

03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:39.000
I am so sorry to those that didn't get through

03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:41.000
but we're already coming up to two hours on Part B

03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:43.000
in addition to an hour and a half for Part A

03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:45.000
Guys, it's okay because of Garris

03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:47.000
Yeah, and the fact that

03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.000
Dark Soccer and Loki do have to work tomorrow

03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:51.000
I took tomorrow off, but I have to go to the DMV

03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:53.000
Yay

03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:55.000
Which is even worse

03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.000
I am so sorry to those of you that didn't get through

03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000
If you still want to leave some messages, you can certainly leave those on the Skype line

03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:01.000
Emails would be great too

03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:03.000
Mailbag at orangeonshooter.com

03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:05.000
We will get back to them next week because I think it's important to say

03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:07.000
Same shit, new week

03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:09.000
next week

03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:11.000
with episode

03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:13.000
463

03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:15.000
Alright, we gotta go around

03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:17.000
and wrap up the show tonight

03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:19.000
quickly, last minute stories

03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:21.000
Loki, let me cover these ones that are on the list

03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:23.000
and then you can add whatever you want to it

03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:25.000
Just real quickly, some last minute stories

03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:27.000
that we didn't get to tonight

03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000
Iron Brothers crossover, they're trying to make a real game out of it

03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000
There's a Kickstarter going on about that

03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000
And he's local, that's kind of funny

03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:35.000
And he is local, so we kind of want to reach out to him

03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:37.000
and see if he wants to come on OLR to promote that

03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000
Haven't done that yet, but we will

03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:41.000
Apparently reskinning the characters, but saying

03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:43.000
it's not just a reskinning, they want to do

03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:45.000
vertical levels as well as horizontal

03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:47.000
It makes sense because you put all this

03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:49.000
time into a game and then it's like

03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:51.000
well, I can't really do anything with it because it has all these licensed characters

03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:53.000
so they're changing it enough to where

03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.000
they can, like we talked about earlier

03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:57.000
changing it enough to where you can release it without

03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.000
violating any copyright laws

03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:01.000
Or being violated by the copyright holders

03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:03.000
Valve and Adult Swim

03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:05.000
for Team Fortress, I didn't

03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:07.000
Jamie, this was one of your stories, I don't remember

03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000
what this was about Yeah, and I already forgot what it was about

03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000
They're doing some sort of crossover content

03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000
thing or something, they didn't really say why yet

03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.000
Yeah, it was like

03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.000
a quickie I can only hope it's a

03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:19.000
TV series because that would be awesome

03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.000
based on like, you know, the meet the

03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:23.000
whomever

03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:25.000
Sonic Adventure 2 has been spotted on

03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:27.000
Xbox.com, so that's likely to be

03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000
coming to Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon

03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:31.000
Dark Soccer, are you a Sonic Adventure 2 fan?

03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:33.000
Not really, nothing was as good as the first one

03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:35.000
I mean, I'm serious, we tried Sonic Adventure 2

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000
was not as good as the first one But there are

03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:39.000
some fans that will be very happy about that

03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000
I'm sure And they're wrong

03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.000
Jay's raising his hand over there, Jay, are you a big

03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:45.000
Sonic Adventure 2? Yeah

03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:47.000
If Xbox Live could take pre-orders

03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:49.000
I'd pre-order it right now

03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:51.000
Awesome

03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:53.000
DreamWorks and EA are gonna make a need

03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000
for speed movie

03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000
Cause Fast and the Furious just

03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.000
wasn't enough I'll be hiding in a cave

03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:01.000
Very interesting, Capcom

03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:03.000
plans to make some Mega Man 25th

03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000
anniversary news, but I wouldn't hold your breath

03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:07.000
over Mega Man universe or whatever

03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:09.000
Maybe announce a soundtrack that's in it Yeah, exactly

03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:11.000
Yeah, more

03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:13.000
downloads of the old stuff will be

03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:15.000
coming to your way

03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.000
Looking quickly at the Twitter

03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:19.000
real quick, TigerClod sent us a couple stories

03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:21.000
Marvel vs. Capcom

03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:23.000
The Complete Works, 20 years of gaming

03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:25.000
history coming soon

03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:27.000
Hiromichi Tanaka has left Square Enix

03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:29.000
Yikes

03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:31.000
ActDeaf says

03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:33.000
OLR will soon be named Pinkberry Lounge Radio

03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:35.000
Virtual Phil

03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:37.000
who was on Hoardhouse this week

03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:39.000
says, if you had to live in a video

03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:41.000
game for the rest of your life

03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.000
which game would you choose? Pro Tip

03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:45.000
not Silent Hill

03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:47.000
If you had to live in a video game for the rest of your life

03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:49.000
I would live in the Pokemon universe

03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:51.000
cause let's be real, Pokemon are adorable

03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.000
and you could just, you could teach them

03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:55.000
to do your killing

03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:57.000
I would say Mass Effect on a remote planet

03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:59.000
with that

03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.000
is like low on the list of harvesting

03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:03.000
where you could cuddle with Garris

03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:05.000
Yeah, I would live on the palaban

03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:07.000
Loki? You know, I was thinking Saints Row the Third

03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.000
but that's too dangerous, so Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach, Volleyball

03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:13.000
Good answer, anybody on the couch

03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:15.000
what game world would you want to live in most of all?

03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:17.000
Oh god, Animal Crossing

03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:19.000
Animal Crossing says Star Tetsuya

03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000
Jay?

03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:23.000
Cause Cole's kinda hot

03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:25.000
Good answers, good answers

03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:27.000
Misty, did you have one?

03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000
Yeah, I agree with Pokemans

03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:31.000
cause fuck, I picked my name

03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:33.000
my nickname from it

03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:35.000
Ah, there you go, that's true

03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.000
Misty

03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:39.000
You know, it just occurred to me that it would actually be really good

03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:41.000
The

03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.000
Doctor Who games

03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:45.000
That's cheating

03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.000
I'll hide on the TARDIS

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.000
I second that

03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.000
Really want to give thanks to you guys

03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.000
that all gave us OLR 10th anniversary

03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:55.000
shout outs and retweets, there was an awful lot

03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:57.000
of you, I can't name everybody

03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.000
but I just want to say a big thank you to everybody

03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000
on the Twitter who gave

03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.000
their thank yous to us

03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:05.000
so that brings us

03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:07.000
almost to the end of the show

03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:09.000
but just walking in from work

03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:11.000
can I bug you for a minute?

03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.000
Hi, SalaciousPop or Allen is

03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.000
home, how was work?

03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:17.000
Good, happy 10 years to the OR

03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:19.000
Thank you, anything you want to

03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:21.000
say, cause we're almost at the end

03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:23.000
anything you want to say about the anniversary or whatever?

03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000
It's a good show, there's tons of

03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000
people in the apartment right now, just came home and it's a

03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:29.000
big party, but I knew it was going to be like that

03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:31.000
When are all these people going to leave?

03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000
They're fine, they're fine

03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000
Okay, well if

03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000
Allen is home from work, that means

03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.000
we really got to wrap it up and get on

03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:41.000
out of here, Loki, any last minute stories you want to add?

03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:43.000
Final Fantasy XI is getting another

03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:45.000
expansion

03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:47.000
Seekers of Alduin, and it's getting

03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:49.000
a new class Geomancer

03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:51.000
Geomancers are cool

03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:53.000
I said a long time ago it should have got

03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.000
Geomancer, so I'm excited they're actually getting it

03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:57.000
So they're doing that, and that's just kind of crazy

03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:59.000
because I guess it's

03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:01.000
also been around for

03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:03.000
a long time

03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.000
and then Skylanders are getting some

03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:07.000
sidekick characters and

03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:09.000
exclusive Frito-Lay

03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000
things

03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.000
Yay, so

03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:15.000
you're going to get those in bags of Frito-Lays

03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:17.000
and you get little characters that I think

03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:19.000
are compatible with the game, maybe

03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:21.000
Neat

03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:23.000
And then

03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000
there is a

03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000
I don't know if it's a hint

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000
or if it's sort of a tease or something, but

03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:31.000
apparently there was

03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000
an image tweeted by

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000
the creator of Seaman

03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:37.000
that is a Santa Seaman

03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:39.000
perhaps

03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.000
hinting that there may be an

03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.000
announcement or a game release

03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.000
regarding Seaman

03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000
maybe?

03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.000
That's been teased for a while I think, so that could be very

03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:51.000
interesting

03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000
And I guess

03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000
Kim.com is

03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000
launching a new mega upload

03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:59.000
site called Megabox

03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.000
So it'll be interesting to see

03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:03.000
what happens there

03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000
Megabox

03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:07.000
Shane is bugging me to play Final Fantasy 11 again

03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000
to play Geomancer with him, and you know Shane is really

03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000
good at peer pressure, right Jamie?

03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000
I'm telling you

03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000
free to play and my life is over

03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:17.000
Is it going free to play?

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000
I wish

03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000
I already started

03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000
playing Lord of the Rings

03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.000
I think by the time Final Fantasy 14 comes out

03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:27.000
it probably would

03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:29.000
Alright, we really have to

03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:31.000
bring this show to a close and say good night

03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:33.000
First off

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000
over the past 10 years you guys have

03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:37.000
tuned in and supported our show and we just want to

03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.000
say thank you and

03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:41.000
you know we never ask for your money

03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000
although some of you apparently out of the kindness of your hearts

03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:45.000
want to help pay to keep it going

03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:47.000
and trust me we really, really appreciate it

03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:49.000
but you know all we ask most of all

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000
tell a friend or 20

03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:53.000
about the show and help

03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:55.000
spread the word, give us a nice 5 star review on

03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.000
iTunes or whatever pod catching site you use

03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:59.000
Stitcher Radio, you can give us

03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:01.000
thumbs ups and stars on, we appreciate that

03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:03.000
and just whatever to help spread the word of our show

03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000
Before we go though

03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.000
of course we have to get everybody's

03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:09.000
final thought, I want to thank everybody for being here

03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:11.000
in studio tonight

03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.000
Dark Tetsuya, your final thought tonight

03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000
Oh man, I don't even know

03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000
I

03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.000
I don't even know

03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:21.000
10 years

03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000
you know

03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000
I did have a request though

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000
Sure!

03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.000
Is this DJ Melvis'

03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.000
promo?

03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.000
I think so

03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000
Yes, I can do that

03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.000
I did an interview with him and he mentioned it

03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:39.000
On orangelaunchradio.com you can see

03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:41.000
Dark Tetsuya's interview with Mel B right now

03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:43.000
and

03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:45.000
I will play that by request

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000
It's the least I can do for somebody who's been listening that long

03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000
They're talking about C-man in chat and AlphaKananagram

03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:51.000
said Siri man

03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000
That might almost work

03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:55.000
You know there's a bunch of people for the epic rap battles

03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:57.000
There's people requesting

03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000
Siri versus GLaDOS

03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:01.000
and the guys there are seriously considering it

03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000
Alright

03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:05.000
To plug Dark Tetsuya's Where Are They Now series

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:07.000
on orangelaunchradio.com, here's his final thought

03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF

03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:11.000
and for an extra $1.99 a minute

03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000
my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all

03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.000
the fun together

03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.000
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am

03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:19.000
why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.000
and still the fun is just as great

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:23.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights

03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000
Kick it with me and you

03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:27.000
just might realize the best things in life

03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000
are free

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000
Thank you Rob

03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:33.000
Of course, anytime buddy

03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:35.000
JV Mon, thank you so much

03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.000
for coming out here all the way from the Bronx

03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000
You're very welcome

03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:41.000
I hope you had a great time in San Francisco and all that too

03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000
I did, and I had a great time here tonight

03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000
I'm sorry the traffic sucked

03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.000
and thank you once again for the coffee

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:49.000
My favorite thing in the world

03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000
You squeaked a little bit

03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000
You had to go change your pants

03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000
I did, I did

03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:57.000
Rob had special feelings in the pantsal region

03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000
Do you have a final thought tonight, Jay?

03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.000
Now that you put me on the spot, I kind of don't

03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:07.000
You're going to have to come back to me on that one

03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:09.000
Well, you're just going to have to come back to the show

03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:11.000
to give that final thought later on

03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:13.000
So how do you like that?

03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:15.000
I will return, there you go

03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000
I'll be back

03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000
Misty, thank you for

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000
getting on a train all the way out here

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000
I hope you had fun in Sac-A-Tomato

03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:25.000
What's your final thought tonight?

03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:27.000
To confirm your theory

03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000
Out of 50 milliliter bottles of UV cake

03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.000
4 out of the 6 that I packed

03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000
plus the glass of wine

03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.000
Yes, I am drunk by my usual standards

03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:37.000
Whoo!

03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:39.000
Party!

03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000
Good times, good times

03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000
Where to start?

03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:45.000
Lowkey, your final thought tonight?

03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:47.000
My final thought is next week is going to be interesting

03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000
because

03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:51.000
apparently

03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.000
12 AM Eastern Time

03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.000
on July 1st

03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:57.000
which happens to be in the middle of our show

03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000
is when the Jade Gate opens

03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.000
and you know I gotta play that

03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:03.000
Oh lord

03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:05.000
Alright

03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:07.000
I was ranked 159 last time

03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:09.000
I'm going to try better

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:11.000
Go for 158

03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:13.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:15.000
I have to drive home

03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:17.000
and I have to go to work tomorrow

03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:19.000
but this is

03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:21.000
going to be a very

03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.000
I'm going to be dreaming in orange

03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:25.000
I'm going to be dreaming

03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:27.000
and by the way

03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:29.000
reject false icons

03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000
Why not?

03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000
My final thought tonight is

03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:35.000
thank you for giving a shit

03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:37.000
I really mean that

03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:39.000
and 10 more years my friends

03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:41.000
Oh, Rob?

03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:43.000
What?

03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:45.000
Well duh

03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:47.000
That's going to do it for another

03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio

03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:51.000
for all of us here in studio

03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:53.000
We will see you again

03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:55.000
next week

03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000
That's

03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:59.000
not the outro

03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000
Who did that?

03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000
Who did that when I wasn't looking?

03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000
Who did that?

03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:07.000
Somebody

03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000
Somebody switched

03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:11.000
or rude that on me when I wasn't looking

03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:13.000
Bastards

03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.000
Alright here it is for real

03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:41.000
Thank you everybody

03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.000
See you next week

03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:17.000
Alright if you really

03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000
don't want to call it a night just yet

03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000
One more round, one more round

03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:23.000
Here it is

03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:25.000
and god I'm just really not prepared

03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:27.000
tonight I was going to say here it is your fortune cookie message

03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.000
of the day but I

03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.000
didn't have it up

03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:33.000
Fail I'm a failure what can I say

03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.000
Alright let me

03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:37.000
get to the show roll

03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:39.000
I even forgot what it was What do you want to do next week?

03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.000
Let's go to Pinkberry

03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.000
I'm telling you

03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.000
they should be matching grandpa's contribution

03:49:45.000 --> 03:50:13.000
Here it is your fortune cookie message of the day

03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:17.000
I bet you didn't know that

03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:19.000
when I eat

03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:21.000
beans

03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.000
I say it in my own little cloud

03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000
Nobody

03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000
comes to visit

03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:29.000
me in my

03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.000
little

03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000
cloud

03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:35.000
I don't know why

03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:37.000
maybe because I'm

03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:39.000
cutting muffins

03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000
because I love

03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000
beans

03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:45.000
I love beans

03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.000
every day

03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:49.000
Beans are an excellent source of

03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:51.000
protein

03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.000
I love beans

03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.000
doo doo doo

03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:57.000
