Orange Lounge Radio
Hello, my friends out there on the internet
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hopefully you're participating with us live at VOG Network
Or the Voice of Geeks Network
www.vognetwork.com
Where we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
But you might be listening to the podcast feed as well
And that's okay too
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host
To talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys
First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
People are confusing
Why?
Just because
Am I sending you mixed signals?
No, I'm just wondering why I'm like actually in a somewhat good mood
And everybody else is pissy
You're not pissy
You've thrown off the balance
Yeah, I'm not pissy
I maybe wasn't as chipper in the opening as I usually am
But that's because I had the coffee an hour ago as opposed to five minutes ago
I just finished my coffee, it was fantastic
It was delicious
But I've noticed at Whole Foods there's two types of people
There's the people who are like, I'm shopping at Whole Foods, what are you doing here?
And then there's the, oh let me, go ahead of me
Like the lady, I had like my salad, she's like, why don't you check out ahead of me? Go on
You sure?
Yeah, go ahead
I wish there was more people like that in the world
So if you really want to see just the duality of human nature, go to Whole Foods
Alright, say hello as well to tech master Loki
Hello
Who is not at Whole Foods today
No
How you doing, Loki?
I tend to like to buy my food in, you know, the whole form
Is that like a Costco endorsement? I'm not sure
No, I'm just saying that like, you know, I don't want half foods
I see, alright, I get it, there's a joke there
Alright, hopefully you guys that are participating with us live are in the chat room
If not, get your butt over there, live.vognetwork.com
The always present fourth guest on our show is the chat room
And checking the comments in our chat room, I'm not sure
Let's see, I see Stan says, wake me up when it starts, I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac
You know, I checked out that game this week
I got it for like two bucks on Steam during a sale a couple weekends ago
That game's messed up
It is, it really is
That's a disturbing little game
And a lot of the art is, you know, it's by the guys who did Super Meat Boy
But it's a very different kind of game
It's not, you would think it's Zelda when you look at it
But looks can be deceiving, it's more like a twin stick shooter
In Zelda's kind of box
I have wonder if I couldn't hook up my twin sticks
It may work, you can do like a, it tells you, it's weird
When you go into the options, it tells you, use joy to pad
To use whatever joystick
I've just been using the keyboard
If someone says, don't know what it is? Google it
Which I found funny
I've just been using keyboard
But I was just, I thought it was very strange
Like I'm shooting the little things to destroy little piles of poo
Which I might find treasure in
And I was like, this is
The hell is this?
I mean, never mind the story about how his mom wants to kill him
But I won't spoil it, I won't spoil it
This crazy mom
Did you get any of the items?
Cause one of the first items you get is mom's underpants
And I was like
I actually didn't get too far into it
This creeper right there
Cause I had mass effect
Alright, well we are going to talk about our gaming weeks
And all the games that we've been playing this week
But first, I thought we would talk about a couple other things
At the top of the show here
For one, if you were listening to Bobby
When he gave us a call there at the end of the show
He said, nine years, 51 weeks and counting
And that's correct
You know next year, or next year, next week
Is the ten year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio
If you can believe it
We had our very first show
Way back on the live 365 network
June 23rd of 2002
And here we are, ten years later
For some reason, still doing this
And no, I know why we still do this
But it's interesting because a lot of shows
You know, I'm not
I certainly am not going to talk bad about other shows
Cause you know we're big fans of supporting independent podcasts
And all that other stuff
But why do you think there's a lot of shows that don't make it?
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't make it
You know, there's a lot of shows that don't last
Heck, two or three years even
It's a milestone to get to one year
What do you think has caused us to go for ten whole years
Where other people don't make it?
We've set the bar really low
That's true
You know, we don't have a huge audience
And that's okay
You know, we certainly didn't in the first few years of the show
I mean, we were doing
That first show
You're doing better than twelve
The first show was for twelve people
And for internet radio, that was huge
You know, we were really excited
To have twelve people who gave a shit enough to listen to us
And that's the way it was for many years
It wasn't really till a couple things happened
We got a couple Konami exclusives
With some of the DDR games
Which helped bring a lot of eyes to our show
You know, a few years ago
Before we went to the podcast format
And then certainly
Being a video game podcast that existed
When iTunes launched podcasting
We never will have a week that big again
That's for sure
That was a huge week
And, you know, now there's tons and tons and tons of podcasts
All over the iTunes market
So it gets a little harder to stand out
If you're not, you know, IGN or 1UP
Or one of the, you know, big deep pocketed producers out there
But, you know, I'm really happy with the following that we do have
And it does seem like, you know, the folks that do show up
And participate with our show every week
Are really the reason for me that
Kind of we keep doing this, you know
There's a lot of great people that I get to talk to once a week
Thanks to this show
And it is a way for me to hang out with Darkstalker and Loki
Who are, you know, they're okay
Eh
Jamie, what's-
Were you talking?
Jamie, what's motivated you for the past ten years?
She's thinking
It was at my house
For a while
For a little bit
But not in the beginning
Dan says he misses the show being at the house
Does he?
That's actually kind of a nice compliment
Um
My ego
Mhm
Spite
I don't know why you're wasting your time on that show
You're not getting paid for it
Me, me, me
Bitch, please
It's a hobby
It's something you do for fun, you know
I do it for more than just for fun
I do it for the people who are waiting to listen to us
We do have an audience
Mhm
You know, I'm
Even if it's all of 50 people
Right
I don't care
It's more that download it
Mhm
You know, clearly by the numbers
Right
And even if they can't make it into the chat room live
Or catch the podcast later on, you know
I'm not doing this for any kind of selfish type of reason
I'm doing it
I mean, I enjoy it
Except your ego
Well, except my ego, of course
Make my ego grow!
Um
But, no
I
I just do it because I like attention
I mean, because I like all of you
That's why I kinda, I don't know
That's why, and I've talked a little bit about this
And I don't want to be very direct
Because I don't want to throw shade unnecessarily
But I get a little uncomfortable
When I see people who have been doing a podcast
For like one or two years
You know, or whatever, maybe three, I don't know
Kinda stop doing it
And then request a heck of a lot of money to do it again
Mhm
It's like, what's your motivator?
We have integrity
What's your motivator there?
We have integrity
We really do
Mhm
You know, you ask, we deliver
Mhm
Unless you're being bitches
And then we'll, you know, tell you off
Or Rob will have a hissy fit
So, I don't know
Yeah, it's certainly, let me tell you this
It's certainly not money that motivates us
I'll tell you that much, that's for sure
We've had some generous people
And we've had good things fall into our laps
And definitely all of you guys who pitched in for our new show computer
Ronma, mostly, wasn't it?
I mean
It was a variety of people
Yeah
Yeah, I don't wanna give one person more credit than another
But that was, that was a really great
And I also
Gesture
I also do it so Shane will call in every week and sound like he's half asleep
You know that too
So
Oh, hi Shane
By the way, if you are participating with the show at VOG Network
I was a little slow in activating the check-in
Sorry, it doesn't run on a timer
I have to put a button to do it
Lazy
But you can now check into the show
Robleslacker
At live.vognetwork.com and get your points
Sorry about that
Slacker
I just wanted you, I just wanted you to wait for it
He was busy playing that game on his iPad
The
The Pocket Planes
Pocket Planes
Yeah, we'll come back to that in a minute
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks
PokePlane, PokePlane
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
We'll start with you
I played Mass Effect
And I played, um
I started a new guild
So anyone who plays World of Warcraft
I made an all druid guild
So you have to be a druid to be in it
And, uh, it's called Druidia
And if you don't get the joke
Then I feel very, very sorry for you
And probably a little old
I was also, I was either gonna name it that
Or Jewish Princesses
Or Order of Vespa
So, you should all get where that comes from
And I played, like, a little Lotor
But, you know, I, I
This week has really been kind of exhausting for me
And next week is gonna be exhausting as well
I've had some design work
Come onto my plate
That I'm getting a little bit for
I did a book cover
So, um, I really haven't
I've been playing more games than usual, though
I've played some Fractal
You know, I love freaking Fractal
That game pisses me off and I love it for it
It's like an abusive boyfriend
So, I was right that you, uh
Are gonna really like Mass Effect
Even though you're on the first game
Like you'll play through the series
Except for people doing music videos that ruin the ending for me
That was messed up
What you were telling me about that
But, like I was telling you in chat last night
I think there's still a lot of gaps to fill in
That's, you know, I'm still gonna play it
Cause I like the story and I can just make up my own ending in my head
And you will, you, I mean, there's so many subplots
About the various characters
But not so much in one, I hate to say it
But when you get to two, there's a lot
I'm looking forward to Miranda
Miranda's great, Miranda's hot
Yeah, if not for my overwhelming just fandom of Garrus
I would totally romance that bitch
You can't as a fem chef
Sucks!
You can only lez out with Liara, I think
Ashley, Ashley's a bitch
And Liara's too skinny
You can't be lesbian, lesbianic with Ashley
I don't think, no, I'm pretty sure you can't
You know what character I'm also looking forward to?
Jack
Jack is awesome
Yeah, it's a great story
My friend Gary's sister
Just saying
I'm not sure what to think about that, but okay
But yeah, she was pretty cool
Infinel in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
So many people make up the ending for Mass Effect 3 in their head
That's true, and you know what, DarkSakura?
By the time you get to three
There's gonna be that extra content
That's the enriched ending
Which hasn't been ruined for anyone yet
It's the original ending with pop-up bubbles
Like pop-up video?
Exactly
See, this is what this meant
In case you didn't get it
Tigerclaw in chat says
It's all about Miranda's assets
Oh no, I've seen that bitch's ass
She is a nice war asset
It's round
It's round and plump
And you just wanna reach in the screen and get squished
It's modeled after the voice actress
You know who I love too?
Talk about genetic perfection
Not that I'm into aliens
I'm very secure in my homosexuality
But if I were to get it on with a fam alien
Samara's kinda hot
Just sayin'
Even though her children are apparently fucked up
Aha! You haven't even played to yet
You know this
No, I was reading about Asari on the wiki
The Mass Effect wiki
And it came up with whatever it is that they have
And I know one of them's like addicted to
Yeah, yeah
And so I actually, out of curiosity
I did watch on YouTube the what happens if you do it
With the crazy chick
And of course, dead
So that was pretty funny
And I also
I've decided that if I play through it as a dude
I'm totally going after Tali
Cause she's just funny and cute
Oh, there's so much I wanna say
But I can't, just keep playing, keep going
Mass Effect lounge radio
I can't believe I missed this series
For so many years
It's so flippin' good
Anyway
At any rate, I've been averaging like
A planet a play
If that makes sense, Rob
So, like, I just
Well, actually no, two plays
Got me all the way through
The Citadel stuff
And then, cause I had a better idea of what I was doing
Cause I'd already played that
And then instead of going to
Naveria like I did the first time
I actually went to
Pick up Liara
And then, now I'm heading back to Naveria
Which, I should at least
Be where I was
Probably by the end of
The night one night when I'm playing
Cause I tend to, you know, play
And chat with people at the same time
I multitask, I multitask
And Acidic Vampire asked me who my
Favorite character is so far in the first game
And, I mean, Shepard's actually
Pretty, pretty badass
I dig her
I'm assuming you're playing Paragon, cause everybody plays Paragon the first time
Actually, I'm playing neutral
I'm holding it neutral
And my Renegade actually points
Are about even right now
Well, between my, uh
My charm and Intimidate
If that makes sense
So, but I'd have to say
Of anyone other than
Shepard, Garrus
He's just so
He can be a dick
And you love him and he's like Thor, kind of
Except, you know, not as the invalid
Wearing his mother's drapes
I think all boys that play Mass Effect
Go on a bromance, Garrus, too
Like, he's just, you know, he's a likable guy
That's it
He can be kind of a jerk
But he's a good jerk and you like him
He's just a nice, jerky
He's like your husband
He's like Dan, he's really like Dan
And you just can't help but be charmed
By his degrees of arrogance
By the way, I do
I don't mean to veer off
Track too much, but we are
Currently in the
VOG Network Clubhouse on Sony Home
And if you want to log into PlayStation Home
And search for VOG Network
Just search for VOG in all caps and it'll come up
VOG Network
I don't know, what the hell is Spazinator wearing?
It's like a chicken costume
It is a turkey costume with the head of
Sweet Tooth and I'm not sure
The glowing thing is
That is disturbing me
I'm not looking at that anymore
There's also somebody with a sack boy and there's a mime
Well, yeah, Blender's the mime, I get that
I also really like Rex
Rex is cuddly
He's just
I like the gruff, sort of, you know
Mercenary attitude, I mean, I've always
Had a thing for that kind of character
While I'm at it, okay, Liara
Is too talkative and she needs to
Shut up sometimes, I mean, there's one
Thing with being smart, but I hate, you know, when they
Take things and run away with it
Ashley's a bitch, I thought I would like her
But she's really just kind of a bitch hoe bag
And, uh
Kate, I hate to say it
Caden is just too
Mr. Generic Pretty Guy
Get out of my house
I'm sorry, you know what I mean
He's, he's, I mean
Maybe he'll get better
I haven't used him that much
I really think that Tali is adorable
She's just so cute
Alright, I swear we're going to move past the Mass Effect chat
But going to some of the comments from our chat room
At vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says
Garris is the kind of character that will make Shepard feel bad
When he does bad things
Not as much as Liara
It might make her hot in the pants if he does bad things
Moving on, anything else for your
Gaming week, DarkSakura?
I would not have Romanced Rex, I'm sorry
But that's too much like doing it
With, um
I can't even say with
Like, Jabba the Hutt
Sorry
Alright, Loki, how is your gaming? I know you're not a Mass Effect
Addict, so you have something else going on
Oh, thank god
This is turning into like a soap opera
Just talking about all the people that you would have sex with
In Mass Effect
So how many block people have you Romanced in Minecraft?
There are no block people in Minecraft
There's just blocks
And farm animals
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?
How many farm animals have you Romanced?
How many creepers have scared the shit out of you?
None, because I'm playing on peaceful
So there's none
It's a lot easier to build stuff without having things
You know, sneak up on you
I tunneled from
My original track
That went from the one station to the next
To my volcanic layer now
And so I have that
I love that you have an evil underground layer
Oh, it's above ground
It's the tallest mountain in the
I thought it was in the volcano
It is in a volcano
Aren't a lot of evil layers in volcan- I swear that was in a James Bond movie
I swear
It was also in, uh, you know, Austin Powers
That's true
But
I was, uh, hollowing out the volcano
To build more stuff
Although I'm starting to kind of wonder what the hell
I'm supposed to fill this volcano with
Um, I tried making
A library
But apparently if the library
Or the bookshelves
Are too close to lava
Even though the lava could be, like, on several
You know, on the other side of a wall
Several layers away
It'll still catch those books on fire
So there was one time I was like, I'm all crap
I need more, uh, more materials
To build in my library
Come back and the whole library burned down
I'm like, ah, dammit
Now, I don't want to spoil upcoming news stories
But we are going to talk a little bit about some things
That changed in Minecraft this week
And one of them is the removal of the duping bug
How are you feeling about that, Loki?
I just haven't updated yet
Never! I'll never update
No, I will update, it's just, it's a little annoying
This is how I built, like, a huge old
Storage facility now that I'm slowly filling
Stuff up with blocks, but it's really boring
Duping stuff
Well, at some point when they catch up with the PC version
They'll have creative mode in there
Yeah, they're gonna have creative mode
But even technically that they patched out the duping
There are still ways for me to get stuff
That I want to have a save file editor
That you can edit what you have in your inventory
So I can still dupe that way if I wanted
But it's just a pain to, like, pull the save off
And do this
And I know they fixed the, um, you know
The clay spawn rate and stuff
So you can actually find clay now
Instead of it being, like, diamond
You know, like, searching for a diamond
But even though diamond's a lot easier to find
Than this right now
And you have to start a new world
In order for all those update effects
To take effect in your world
So, like, if we respawn the vogseed
Or whatever, it'd actually have different things in it
And they're gonna do the same thing again with pistons
So, right now I'm just gonna stick with this world
And I'm not gonna bother starting a new one
Just to get more clay cause I don't really want clay
And, um
I think I'm gonna start over
I need to do some work in Peaceful
Like, that's what was slowing me down before
Was that I was too, like, I could not get to stuff
Because of the stupid creepers
And all that stuff
And I realize that's kinda part of the fun of the game
But I would like to just do Peaceful
And then, once I have my underground lair built
I will turn on the monsters
Make it the point to go out and destroy them all
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna do
But right now, it's just kinda fun
If I could stop playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
I would do that
For the record, the chatroom and I are talking about Mass Effect still
Don't spoil it for Jamie
She's in the same position I was in about three months ago
She really doesn't know a whole lot about what's upcoming
So, just saying that
Be kind
So, I played that stuff
What else did I do?
Um
I played Call of Duty
Modern Warfare 3 a little bit
A little bit of the System Link stuff
Still, wish I had some more maps to play
Because a lot of them are really big
Whereas the first game, you know, Modern Warfare
Just had a bunch of maps that were pretty small
That we could actually play on
And it wasn't, you know, such a big deal
There was only, like, a couple that were too big
And now it's like the reverse problem
Um, so hopefully there will be
Some more maps that we can check out
Hopefully for free
Because I don't want to have to buy maps for everybody
And then, um, I was gonna play
Gravity Rush
But I
What the fuck?
I don't know
Home is interesting
That's all I can really say
Spazinator's changed into an outfit that says
It gets hard
Get your minds out of the gutter
It's a big piece of wood
I'm not helping, am I?
That says it gets hard
There's a lot of these double entendres
In Sony Home
Dirty ass people who play Home
Like me
But yeah, I've been good this weekend
I have not played any Minecraft this weekend
I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish that
Although maybe when I go home later today I may do that
But, um, I did not play any Minecraft
Today, or yesterday
Anything else for your gaming week?
Uh, that's it
Not a lot for me to report
I've been playing pretty much the usual suspects
As I mentioned before, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
Still kinda consumes
Sentinel, who's awesome
Uh, I considered
Buying Mass Effect 3 on PC
Just so I could play with Alan
Who also has Mass Effect 3 on PC
But now I'm not gonna be able to
Alan's computer blew up last night, like for real
We think it's the power supply
Like, he was playing Mass Effect multiplayer for six hours
Yesterday
And finally there was just this loud
It was during Undersedation Live and I was listening
There's just loud pfft
Damn it, I forgot your game
Come to my house next week
We'll see
Actually, I have to go to Roseville tomorrow anyway
Anyway, off-air discussion
Where was I? Damn it, you threw me off
Oh, Mass Effect
So, Alan's computer broke
So the money I would have spent to get Mass Effect on the PC
I ended up having to buy a power supply
For Alan's computer, so
You know, maybe in the future
But I do want to do a second playthrough of Mass Effect
As Renegade on Xbox 360
Other stuff
I have been playing that's
Non-Mass Effect
I checked out a little more of Sony Playstation Home this week
Thanks to the VOG Clubhouse
It made me kind of want to go through and explore it a little bit more
There's positives and negatives
Positives is there's a whole lot more
It seems like to do
In Home now
A lot more of these mini-games
That are pretty well rounded
I was playing one and the machine is sitting in the VOG Network house
You can just walk up to it and play it
It's called Cluster Puck
Which is kind of a
I don't know, it's like
Tetris Attack meets
I don't know
There's this weird mechanic where you move
You can actually move pieces
Up, down, left, and right, but only the one that you're controlling
And once you attach it to another piece
It becomes part of the big block
That you're moving, and then when they all fall down
If you have three in a row
They go away, it was weird
But I liked it, it was a pretty cool, kind of different little puzzle game
And you unlock dumb little rewards for it
I was checking out Sony's E3 booth
I checked out some type of
What is it, Midway thing?
But, they
Won 99 cents for 50 tickets
To actually play the games
And it's all a contest
And I was like, I don't think I want to do that
My only real complaint about Home is that
Some of it's really slow
And I don't like that it doesn't really buffer
A lot, like
You know, if it's your first time in Home
You have to download everything
For a little while, and I like to think I have a fast connection
That's really the only thing
That really bums me out though
Is that Home is kind of
Remember when they were talking about how it was going to be something
That you could launch
Other games from
And it was going to be literally Home
Like, you wouldn't go into your crossbar
You'd go into Home
And kind of do everything from there
It's too slow, you could never do anything like that
It's like a computer
From the 1980's
It takes two and a half minutes to boot
Sometimes, you know, that's the only
When it loads, and when you have things
Cached, if you've loaded all the areas
Or whatever, it's pretty cool
Once you get in there, once you've downloaded the VOG Clubhouse
And all that, it's pretty cool, but
Moving seamlessly is a little rough still
But I do like, they've really
If you haven't checked out Home since it first
Launched three years ago
There's like a million more things in there now
And tons and tons of stuff to unlock for your characters
That's pretty cool, I like that
Multiple theatres
Dedicated to the Twilight trailer
Oh, really?
No, I'm just making shit up
I haven't played Home, nor do I want to play Home
Is it a Sony movie? I don't know
When there's Sony Pictures movies coming out
You better believe they do stuff like that in Home
Oh, by the way, Rob
Before I forget
Actually, there's one more game that I'm playing
I'm doing the
Mass Effect 3
I
It's like a Facebook game, yeah
Yeah, but I'm already
Preparing for Mass Effect 3
You're committed
I've also been playing an iOS game and it's
Pocket Planes, the new nimble bit game
From the makers of Tiny Tower
Where now you fly planes
Oh, that Dream Heights ripoff?
Right
No, Pocket Planes is not a ripoff of
Dream Heights
I'm sure it will be ripped off soon, though
But yes, you
Go to airports, you buy planes
And you ship people and cargo between them
Exact same art as assets from Tiny Tower
Although, obviously, they had to go in
And draw planes and clouds
But it's like the same style, the same universe
I kind of like that they have the two
Very different kind of games yet in the same universe
I've heard from some people, though, they don't care
For Pocket Planes
It's not as easy to get
As Tiny Tower was
Tiny Tower was a very easy concept to get
Pocket Planes is a little
The airport, you have to manage the planes
So you're not just managing a tower
You're kind of having to juggle two things
There's a lot more places to sink money
As well, and there's Twitter
Integration and all this
The one reason why nimble bits games do so well, though
Is that you really do get the full experience for free
And it doesn't nag you ever
About buying things
But if you want to buy the little bucks that make things
Go faster, sure, you can go get a handful
Of those easy
For 99 cents or 5 bucks or whatever
But the nice thing is
The game will give you bucks
Slowly
You'll start to get bucks, but
You have to be patient if you don't want to pay
To go all the way
We do have a whole little flight team
Or was it flight squad?
It's just VOG
If you put in as the tag
And you can see how you're doing in the world events
With folks like myself and Bobby Blackwolf
And whoever else on the network is playing
The Pocket Planes
That's it for my gaming week
I don't want to talk about any more iOS games or whatever
Let's move on
Let's get into tonight's gaming news
I'll quickly say housekeeping
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com
Slash OLR and follow us on Facebook
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
One more reminder
We are going to get a notice out there
So hopefully some of your favorite game blogs will be posting about this
But our 10 year anniversary special
Is next week
I do know we're going to have some guests
We don't hardly ever have guests anymore
In studio
But I know we're going to have some next week
That are going to show up
That part is of course inevitable
That there's going to be people who want to come out for the 10th anniversary
We have some people traveling a great distance to be here
So that's going to be very cool
And some clips from the oldies episodes
And so forth
I really encourage you guys to be here live
For that
Please participate with us
At vognetwork.com
We have some special piece of loot in it for you
Can't say too much but maybe
It will be on the podcast feed though
If you absolutely have another commitment
Sunday nights of course it will be on the podcast feed
We would just love to see you live
Cancel them
Cancel them for us
We also will be taking calls for an extended period of time

A lot of people have been asking
We are anticipating a lot
So try to keep your messages brief
If you ramble on for 5 minutes I can't play it
We're not going to have the time next week
But if you make it 30 seconds
Again more details on Twitter and Facebook
After the show tonight
Alright now we can get into some gaming news
Loki start us off tonight please
Ok so there's some more details regarding the Wii U
Some of the programming stuff
First off they have infrastructure
In place to allow free to play games
Which is kind of interesting when you think about it
Because they've made many comments
In the past about how they
Didn't like the fact that some of the games
On the iOS platform and stuff like that
Were too cheap and devaluing everything else
But apparently they said
We've designed a system
From a technical standpoint to allow developers
To freely take advantage of things like free to play
And microtransactions
So that's kind of nice
We'll see some of that stuff coming that way
And of course they're saying
Currently
They're not actively looking to
Enter the free to play market
For their first party content
But
They are making it available
For anybody else that may want to
Make a free to play game
Nintendo's not going to do that
And then of course
There's some
There was some
Rumors that they may be getting away
From doing friend codes for
This new system and god I wish
That were the case but apparently
They're not
Friend codes are still going to be a part
Of the online service
However they're going to change
They're not
Saying exactly how
Just saying that
Friends codes
They're going to be there
But not the existing friend code system
You'll be able to identify people as friends
And have a certain level of interaction
Versus different level of interaction
For more general
Population
So
I don't know is that like
The Google groups or something like that
You can do that with Google plus or something
Who knows but still
Kind of annoying that you have to do that
But whatever
And then of course they also said that the system
Will allow achievements in games
However it's not mandatory
So some games will have
Achievements and some may not
I just get this
Feeling from reading some of the
Stuff that it's like Nintendo's
Putting a lot of this
You know stuff that they have available for
Other platforms right now
Like achievements or trophies
And some of this other
Like you know different online places
And they have this
Available for third parties but
Nintendo themselves aren't really
Taking advantage of it it's like
Oh yeah we're just going to
Kind of do things the way we have been doing them
And we're not really going to do
A lot of this online stuff
Or you know have achievements
And things like that I mean it'd be nice
If they did but I don't know
I just don't get the vibe that they're going to be
Kind of doing all this new fancy stuff
They're just kind of be you know repeating what
They've done before
We don't like to do what everybody
Else does we're going to do our thing
If everyone jumped off the bridge would you?
Perhaps
How high is the bridge?
What do you think though about that achievement part
Not being mandatory I find that kind of interesting
Because it seems like the makers
Of games will be able to kind of do whatever they want
I mean some might kind of make it
In parity with whatever's on 360
And Steam and so forth but others
May just decide not to do it
It kind of reminds me of Steam though because Steam has that kind of thing
Where some games do have you know
Achievements and some don't I don't think it's
Necessarily a deal breaker it's kind of
Disappointing that there's not going to be achievements
Along there I mean
It just for me it seems like
Eh we don't really want to
Do that so but I know
You guys want to so we're going to go ahead and
Allow you to do it but we're not going to do it
I mean it just kind of seems like
They're just taking the easy way out
For a lot of this stuff I mean how hard
Have they straight up said the Pikmin's not going to have them?
They haven't said it yet but
Pikmin doesn't have certain things that they
You know kind of hinted
That it would have and then of course
Their reasoning for why it doesn't have said
You know feature is because
It's too hard
So you know
I don't know
We'll get to that later but
It's just it's stupid
Do you think they could land some big free to play games?
You know I don't know you're thinking of
Steam and so forth like I don't know
Well DC Universe is a Sony game so no
But maybe like Spiral Knights from Sega or something?
You know it's good that they have
That infrastructure in place so they could
Possibly do that and also it would be nice
To see if they have like more of like an MMO
Type thing in place I'd imagine
It's free to play with microtransactions
I wouldn't see it being too
Difficult for them to have microtransactions
For like you know subscription
Models and stuff like that but
It's nice to have the options there
But at the same time I just kind of wish
There was a little bit of a parity between
Everything that they're doing
Uh BlackWolf
In our chatroom says certain Nintendo
Things already have achievements such as the Mii Plaza
But suck too
Alright moving on
One of the other big things that came out of E3
Was obviously Microsoft Smart Glass
And this is the whole iPhone
iOS and Android
And likely you know whatever Windows tablets
Have is the whole
They're all gonna be able to run this Smart Glass app
And a lot of people
When they saw that said
Oh Wii U just got stolen
And done better, Wii U's dead, Wii U's gone
So of course Nintendo
Was asked to comment on this whole situation
How does Nintendo intend to differentiate
Between what Microsoft's doing with
Smart Glass and what Nintendo's doing
And essentially according to Satoru Iwata
Who was interviewed here
He said that
Basically it boils down to the fact that
The controls on the tablet devices
Often suck
Quote
From what we have seen so far
It looks to us as what they are able to offer
Really is only a small facet
Of what the Wii U is capable of
We know that the core users
Who love playing video games like controllers
That you hold with two hands
What you don't have on smartphones and tablets
Are the buttons and the control sticks
They prefer to use
Now if they could hold a controller with two hands
And hold a tablet or a smartphone with another hand
There would be no issue
Unfortunately this is not possible for humans to do that
That sounds like a challenge
You can't play a game in a way you can play
With the Wii U
And that's actually officially on Nintendo's website
You can check that out
In that interview
That's also officially full of shit
Really?
Let's see here
What they are describing is basically saying
Because the Wii U tablet has the buttons
And stuff like that
You can play games
Using that you can't play regularly
But at the same time
Look at the games that they are showcasing
That use that tablet and stuff
They have a game where you flick ninja stars
At the screen
That uses buttons because
I don't see any buttons being used there on the touch screen
Or some of the other games
That use that as a secondary display
You know
I don't necessarily have to hold the tablet
To have a secondary display
I can sit it down on the coffee table
Or something like that
They may not require you to necessarily have
To hold that
To play these games
I just think that they are
They are not going to say
Oh shit they are right
They are going to steal our thunder
Well we should have thought better next time
They are not going to say anything like that
Of course they are going to talk it down
Now along similar lines here since we are talking about smart glass
I think it is worth bringing up that the official
Xbox Live app on iOS
Was updated
And yes there is a Microsoft
Xbox app on iOS
Officially by Microsoft
It was updated this week
With the smart glass features in it
Now this feature only works on the phone for some reason
And not on the iPad which I found a little strange
But what you can do with it
Once you update it you hit the little button
When your Xbox is on that says connect to Xbox
And your iPhone essentially becomes a controller
For the Xbox
It actually has a little A button in the middle
So you can kind of use it like a TV remote
But you can also use it to launch a game
And then when you launch a game
The little iPhone turns into a display
That tells you about the game
It is nothing really that great
It is kind of a pain to set up
Because you have to do it each and every time
So it is not like a big time saving thing
But it is certainly showing hints of what is to come
What they are trying to do with this whole second screen technology
It is a little weird that it is not on the iPad yet
But it is available definitely on the iPhone
And that is up now
You can download that now
The other thing you can argue with Nintendo
Is that I don't have to buy another system
To be able to have this technology
Or whatever
It is going to be a lot of great uses for the tablet
But at the same time, like I said last week
I am just worried we are going to get a whole bunch of DS stuff
Not necessarily
First off, I literally think we are going to get DS stuff
I think they are going to do Virtual Console with the DS
I mean, duh
It has got the same setup
So we are going to see that eventually
But literally it is just going to be
Using
The second screen for just crap that you would have
Like in a start menu or something
Because there was a lot of
Games on the DS
It just didn't really need that second screen
But it was there
So they used it for like
Here is a map
Here is some neat touch screen things you can do
Some things were really cool though
Like Elite Beat Agents
But I don't see that really working on the Wii U
It is kind of like everything is there on the touch screen
So it is like, why would I look up
And look at my TV ever
There is really not a lot to do
So I am curious
To see further developments
Of what is actually coming out for Wii U
And unfortunately E3
Kind of didn't show enough
But we will have more on that a little later
In the meantime DarkSakura
Let's switch on to the
Xbox thing
Not under the name of the lube
Unfortunately
Because that would have been awesome
There is a document leak
About an X
I should just say for the new listeners of OLR
We kind of missed that
We had a naming contest
In our popular list list segment a couple months ago
We decided the official name
Of the next Xbox here on OLR
Is the Xbox lube
So if you are wondering where the hell did that come from
We are done
Well at any rate
There was a 56 page document
That was leaked
For what was listed as the Xbox 720
Which I am pretty sure
That is not going to be the final name
It looks kind of like a squishy dreamcast
So I think that is funny
But it was talking about
Having new things like a metro dashboard
Xbox TV apps
Smart glass of course
And then
It was really
Do you remember Rob that E3
When they announced the 360
And all the stuff they wanted it to do
And how they wanted it to be a big hub
It looks like they are still trying
To keep that hub
Thing going on with the new one
But it is also supposed to have
Blu ray support
Native 3D output
And glasses
Concurrent apps
Peripheral support
Sensors
Additional sensors sorry
It says something about a connect 2
And that they are debating whether or not to use
6 or 8
ARM or the
They are just
Really pretty much debating processors
Debating memory
Debating the cores
But they are basically trying to make
It be the be all end all
Of anything that you should have
In your living room
They are putting a price point on it
Of $299 with a projected
10 year life cycle
And they think that they will sell more than 100 million
Units and it is supposed to be out in 2013
The one thing on here
That I think is kind of neat
Is what they are calling project
Fortaleza I guess
The connect glasses
Where basically it is kind of like a VR
Thing
You can actually see all those lasers that the connect
Is actually firing out
If you saw some of those early videos
What was it, infrared?
If you actually look at the connect in infrared
It is like oh my god my room is full of lasers
Well the thing that I think is kind of cool
About this
Is that
It is like an in person interactivity kind of thing
Which I don't know if you have to have
A decent living room
Or if it is adjustable or whatever the crap
But
It makes me think of a kind of
Augmented reality kind of thing
Which honestly I think is fully possible
I don't know if you saw
For anyone who keeps up with my Tumblr
Which is
I will post it later
On my Tumblr I posted a link about
These new
That are
Full on display that basically
Will
Project an image directly to the retina
And
They are using it as enhancing
Poor eyesight and
Portable television that you can watch
With your eyes closed pretty much
And
I am thinking that if they have gone that far
That this is simple
This would be simple technology in comparison
Also
The document that was leaked
Was removed
So even if they are saying
Oh no that is not true
It was removed at the request of
Covington and Burlington LLP
The international law firm
That Microsoft has hired
Hmm
The plot thickens
Oh and by the way
Those Kinect glasses are marked for 2014
Loki I know you have been
Following this new story as well
Do you think it is fanboy wank
Or do you think it is the real deal
Well I thought it was fanboy wank until the lawyers took it down
So there is something in it
Basically it is two years old
The document is not exactly
Brand new but a lot of stuff
It is interesting
I do not know
How much
It is all speculation
They are just kind of talking about
And thinking about something that is not necessarily
Their step by step plan
I did think it is interesting
How they are talking about acquiring
On live and that one of the things
That they are going to incorporate
Later on like in 2015 or something
After the console would launch
Would be that you would never
Need another console again
Any time that you would need to
Upgrade to games and the platform
Can't handle it, it is just streamed
I do not know if that is necessarily
Going to work
But a better Kinect is something
That we would expect
More processing power
The glass thing looks weird
It is kind of like that project glass
That Google did
And it does not mean it is going to happen
I think that is important to say too
Just because they are talking about this two years ago
Does not mean it is actually going to happen
I mean look at something like the Wii Vitality sensor
That even came out on the E3 stage
And suddenly disappeared
It does not mean the glasses thing will happen
This seems to me to be more of an R&D
Type of document
Well, I personally
I am sorry, I will let you finish
But personally I think it is a real document
I do and I think the fact that the lawyers
Took it down, it is what they call
What is it, Streisand syndrome
I think it is called that
The Streisand effect or something
And yes that is as in Barbara Streisand
Because one time
She tried to sue a company
Or her lawyers sued a company that published
A picture of her house
Like four people in the world saw
The picture of that house
Two of them being the lawyers until she sued the company
Then millions of people saw the picture
Of her house
So I think there is a little bit of that going on here
Because the Microsoft lawyers by taking down the document
Have somewhat proven
That there is legitimacy to it
Because Microsoft could have come out and said
Oh that thing is a bunch of crap
And maybe it was not crap
But nobody would have been any wiser
No, if they just said
Oh it is crap and then
However
I do not think it is a deep within
Microsoft document
It did not look professional enough
To be something that was done deep within Microsoft
I think this thing leaked out of some type
Of affiliate arrangement
I think a third party company put this thing together
I do not think it is
Directly Microsoft
Necessarily
Where there is smoke there is fire
And I think there is definitely some hot stuff in this document
Or perhaps
It was
A quote leak
If you know what I mean
Basically get it out there long enough for the
News centers to catch up on it
Yank it
Make it look official
I also think that
If it was like a hype generating
Stunt or something
I just do not really think it would generate
It is not really generating hype
Because it is just all very speculative
Especially if Microsoft is supposed to be announcing a new
Tablet on Monday as all the rumors say
Doing something like that between
E3 and a new tablet is kind of
Dumb
I do not know
There is too much coincidence in here
For this to not be real
I think a big part of it is the smart glass thing
I think the depth of that document
Would have been a lot to whip up
Somebody was really dedicated to pulling a fast one
On the internet if that is the case
Again
I think there is some legitimacy to this
But I do not think everything in here should be accepted
As fact because
A. The age
B. Ideas get thrown around all the time that never come to light
That is
Basically what it boils down to
That is what good brainstorming is regardless
True
You throw out the idea you see if it is possible
If the whole thing is
Some dumb underground
Marketing ploy
Viral thing
Microsoft is trying to get feedback on the glasses thing
But I just think this is a dumb way to do it
If that is the case
If you put out anything the internet will respond to it
It is a guarantee
And if it is something big like Microsoft
Anything attached to Microsoft
The internet is definitely going to give some feedback
But let me just put it this way
If they are going to come to the table with something like that
You know in like two years time
That is not good for Nintendo
Because Nintendo does not
They are not bringing a whole lot to the table right now
They are bringing like
Hey look we can use the tablet with our system
And it is basically a Wii that does HD
That is not
This opens up a lot of possibilities
Of how you can make games and other applications
And stuff but
I do not know we will see
Especially since they are talking about these glasses
Or whatever not launching with the system
I do not know
All we need to see either way
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
Not a whole lot of comments on this story
A lot of people still commenting about DS
And tech specifications and all this stuff
But Tiger Claw says
Smart glass how about dumb glass
I do not know
There are things I like and things I do not like
About this whole smart glass idea
I do not think it is as revolutionary as they make it sound
I mean whoopty shit
You can have some information
Some of the movies do this
Like the Tron Blu-ray
And there are other Blu-rays where you can do a very similar thing
It is cool
It is like the director's commentary track
Very few people go that extra mile to use it
Let's be real
Some of you do
Especially for movies that you love
That is a given but very few people do it
And it is not necessarily that this is something
That is not possible right now
Before this update
Because EA games have been doing this
With Mass Effect and stuff
They will have stuff that ties in with that
Hell you can even do with Call of Duty Elite
You can get the app for that on your Android
IOS devices
And you can tweak shit on there
Before you play the game
So they have this kind of stuff available already
And it is not that like
That does not sell a game tip for me
I mean if you know
Oh hey you can make plays in Madden on your tablet
I am not going to go oh I have to get Madden now
I mean it does not seem like it is something
That is really going to sell me on games
I love this DC Nate in our chat room says
An alternate screen for your console
Dreamcast sheds another tear
It was just
It further proves that thing was just ahead of its time
Well and
Nintendo kind of already
Had that going on with that
Connection to the
Crystal Chronicles
We will just call it the Crystal Chronicles
That and Four Swords were the only games that really used it
Pac-Man
And Animal Crossing if you want to get specific
But like a lot of Nintendo peripherals
Five games used it and then it disappeared
Yeah
So
Like their LAN adapter
One game used it and then it disappeared
And then a bunch of people hacked it
So Mario Kart could use the warp pipe
Or whatever it was
Well that was over the internet stuff
I am talking about using the actual
LAN adapter
I thought only Phantasy Star used that adapter
Maybe online but as far as LANs
Oh yeah you are right
Alright let's move on
So we can get to the classic game of the week
And release dates and all that good stuff
But first some more news stories Loki
Alright so
There is some hoo-ha
I guess about UDraw
And basically
A Georgia law firm is investigating
THQ to see
If they misled their investors
About the demand
For the UDraw tablet
Honestly I thought it was a really cool idea
So I could see where they
Think that the demand would be really high
And then it wasn't
And also I wonder if a lot of that
Kind of hinges on the fact that they were saying
That I think at one time
Nintendo was going to make a few
Games or whatever that would support it
And hell
Let's just get on the topic of the Wii U here
Why wasn't Mario Paint one of the
Launch titles for this system
I mean
That seems like a perfect title for the Wii U
Just saying
But yeah
They're still checking them out
And making sure that there wasn't
Any false and misleading statements
About its progress
I want to say that this is
Not the first franchise
That they were kind of
Supposedly misleading
People on
I want to see maybe UFC or something
I don't know
Interesting
I know those UDraw tablets
Are one of them sitting around
And they're going for dirt cheap
Mmm
THQ's been in a company that's had some
Rough times lately too
This is a fascinating story to me
What is like
I mean could it be that they just said
Okay
I understand that they are saying the demand is high
What if they believe the demand
They literally believe that the demand
Is going to be high for it and it just flops
Is that misleading your investors
I guess you're supposed to be pretty accurate
With how much the demand is but what if
It's just like no one gave a shit
No shits were given that day
Would it be fair to say that
38 studios misled
The state of Rhode Island
Well that's a whole different story
It isn't it isn't
Well I don't believe
Kingdoms of Amalur had a
You know a peripheral that was tied to
Only you know certain games
Well it was that MMO never coming
Out too that really didn't do well
I mean I always have a problem
When you have a device that requires
A special peripheral
Because now you're locked in the buying games
That require that peripheral and if it's not something
That's widely used by a bunch of different companies
Because it was only THQ that was putting out
Stuff for it I mean they had licenses for
Spongebob and Disney princess stuff
And all that but no one
Really cares about that and they tried
Some funky stuff like with
Actually the Spongebob game they tried making
A kind of wire-wire type game
And it was dumb
So I could see why it just
Didn't sell very well and then they tried putting it
On other platforms and just
It bombed kind of like the Tony Hawk
Skateboard idea
I mean it was terrible
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room theorizes perhaps Mario Paint is coming later
It might just be one of their apps
I don't know I kind of think Nintendo
Is over Mario Paint
Part of me thinks it would have come out on the DS a long time ago
It still should
Pictochat
Was Mario Paint
Ooh do you think there's going to be something like Pictochat on the Wii U
Or like over the internet?
Oh is there oh
I guess I haven't been paying attention
You can leave messages and forms and stuff and you can also draw pictures
And stuff
That's kind of cool so if I want to just send Dark Sakura a big penis
I can do that
Well no there's moderation remember
Oh my gosh what if I don't want to post it publicly
What if I just want to send her a private penis
Oh well
I don't know how
Private peni are the best
I don't know how deep the moderation goes
Are they that deep
I'm assuming you can send pics with the camera too
So I mean
How long before penises are being sent
All over the Wii U network privately
Instantly
There's no doubt about it I'm just saying that
The pictures may be sent but will they get to their destination
Check out what I do with my Wii U
You're listening to Orange Penis Radio
Someone will see that penis
And it will be the moderator
The moderator will come home after the first day
Like I've seen so much penis today
I feel like I'm working in the porn industry
Oh Lord dry up
This river of penis
I knew you would get that one
Well you know what's funny
Is that
I don't remember if we talked about this on the show
Or if it's a conversation I was having with somebody
After the fact so I apologize if I'm not
Crediting the right person with this
But somebody was theorizing I think maybe it was on Facebook
That Nintendo's probably
Gonna hire an outsource company to do
All this moderation
So you're gonna have
This huge
Call center-esque thing filled with people
In either the Philippines or India
These poor people are gonna see
Penises all day long
It won't be done in Redmond
I think that's a damn
Fine theory that it's probably gonna be outsourced
I think I see that's my
Problem with this system is I think if
You know I'm an adult
I believe that I should be allowed
To you know post like
You know if I have my friends that I'm playing
Super Mario Brothers U with or whatever
And
Like Rob keeps dying at this one spot
And goes oh this is so hard
And I can tell him quit whining you
Fucking pansy you know and
Should be able to have that little thing pop up
Over world 3-1 or something like that
Why should that all be censored?
You're censoring my fun
No one wants to censor my fun
I just can't wait for somebody to be playing Mario Brothers
And all of a sudden
You have a message
Oh open up the message penis
Oh my god
Or tits I mean come on
Alright
I'm going to lie
They should totally have it in New Super Mario Brothers U
Where you can draw on the background
Of the levels you should be able to just stop
And sketch something on the levels
Uh alpha
Kananagram in chat says sky mario paint on the
DS was Wario do it yourself
I forgot about that
That was Nintendo we don't want to fucking
Make a game you make it yourself
Or WarioWare do it yourself excuse me
Uh let's see
The chat room is wondering
Where pen15 is tonight
This would be a perfect conversation for him
But sadly not here alright
Anyhow anything else you want to say about
Penis or I'm sorry this news story
That's it
Let's move on to some more stories about the Wii U
Uh apparently
Some rumors going around that maybe Nintendo
Didn't show their big game at E3
After all destiny wasn't shown
On the Xbox so maybe
Something was held back a little bit
And this is because of a tweet
That game trailers editor in chief
Shane Satterfield said
Uh apparently
He said before E3
That the Wii U launch lineup
Was looking pretty damn good
Well if that's the case then he's probably the only one
That was thinking that
But it came out later he went on Twitter
And said quote
Just realized that a Wii U game
I knew about well before E3
Was never announced at the show
I'm guessing there's others
To come as well
Oh really? Yeah
Well sure why not
Because this
Got me into a topic on Twitter
Earlier this week that revealed
To me what I believe is the actual
Launch day for the Wii U
Which would be November 18th
I have to check my date
It's a Sunday of course
Of course that way you can camp out Saturday right
Because Nintendo does all their stuff on Sundays
Because Nintendo likes fucking launching shit on Sundays
And I don't know why they're just obsessed with fucking Sundays
So yes November 18th
Now remember before I said
Well the 13th
Is gonna be out the 13th or before
Because there was a game that was dated for the 13th
Well there's other games dated for the 20th
Makes sense
You know just like the Vita launch
There was stuff that was out the week before
Could it just be a really good guest placeholder
Because honestly if I were to make an educated guess
Hmm the weekend before Thanksgiving
Yeah it's kind of in line with the way
They usually do it
But this company doesn't launch games on Sundays
Oh okay
And the game in question would be from Disney
And it's
Der their big game
Which would be
Epic Mickey 2
Which has not been announced yet
For the Wii U and I don't know when it will be announced
But it's coming
So that's a pretty big title for the launch lineup
That they didn't talk about
At all
What up G in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
Says rumor has it Nintendo is gonna show
Metro's game which of course
You know still is nowhere to be seen
Maybe it's the F-Zero game
Dream dream dream fanboy wank wank wank
It would be cool
I mean
I don't know but yeah I mean so
There that's you know
One and I know that
There was one I saw for
Transformers the new Transformers Prime
You know people don't really care about that
But I mean Epic Mickey 2 that's a pretty big fucking
Title not to mention
At all I mean unless
They're worried that it's not gonna be at launch but
I have things
That say otherwise
Alright well right alongside
That a story came out that
Nintendo said a lot of the Wii U
Third party games are yet to be
Announced and that's a quote from
David Yarnton who's the head of Nintendo's
UK division
Apparently this was in Nintendo gamer
Magazine it said quote
I think a lot of third party companies are
Developing for Wii U and a lot of it hasn't
Been announced but we can't comment on
Speculation there are lots of things
Everybody wishes for
Call of Duty is another one that's
Confirmed but
They haven't announced it yet
But then again they also haven't
Announced it for the Wii yet either so
So that comes usually later
What does this mean Nintendo's waiting for their
Tokyo game show concurrent event because they
Don't do Tokyo game show but they usually do a big
Event they may be announcing more
Stuff there I think it's just a way that
These companies are they announce
That far out ahead
You know ahead sometimes like Call of Duty
Every year it seems to be it's always
Gonna be Playstation 3
Xbox 360 PC announced
And then later on like last year it was
At their live
Call of Duty event in LA that they
Announced the Wii version
And then also DS and there was
The you know the elite
Stuff and the
You know special editions
And something none of that stuff's been announced yet
Oh but that's I mean
Just reality check the system's out in
Five months you know assuming it's out in November
Which is obviously a safe bet that's five
Months from now it's not
A whole lot of time to finish up the games
If you don't already know you're doing it
It's interesting I mean
Maybe there'll be something closer
To the end of summer when is Tokyo game show though
October? Seattle?
Oh it's September? Usually
Maybe two months is enough lead time but one month
Definitely isn't
But a lot of these games like I mean I don't see them
Talking about Epic Mickey like Tokyo
Game show because that's not really a title
Skew towards the Japanese market
WhatupG in our chat room says
EA says they will announce a couple of games
At Gamescom for Wii U
FIFA probably
I don't know about NBA Live
But FIFA I think is for sure
Which Gamescom would be the place to announce
That too
Yeah I think they've already said FIFA was gonna be on the Wii U
Madden is on the Wii U
I believe I think that's already been announced
AkumaJP is in our chat he lives in Japan
And has gone to Tokyo game show and confirms
It's September my bad I thought it was October
For some reason
Still
I mean I don't know I could
Yeah I definitely agree this stuff
Lots of it hasn't been announced yet
I mean
For sure there's a lot of stuff that hasn't been announced yet
But I don't know
Everything
That's not been announced
I just know I know that one
And I know that it has a firm date on it
Because they're talking about marketing campaign and stuff
And there's a lot of stuff that's on the week before
And the week after so
It seems to fit
And like I said
They're delaying the game
I don't know if that's even made it out yet
The game is not coming out in September anymore
All the other platforms
It's been confirmed I know for Europe
But they have not announced North America yet
But that is also going to be delayed
Europe is coming out on the 20th
So if you think about it
The console is probably not going to launch
I mean it's going to launch at the same time roughly
In all regions but it's probably not going to launch on that Sunday
Like they did with the Wii
Wii launched on that Sunday
I believe if I remember correctly
Yeah it did
I remember we went out really late at night
And you know remember we were going out and Breslow was here
And everything and the lesbians
We all went out
Well I think it was just me and Kristin
We were at the
Yeah Extifer was at Target with you guys wasn't he?
Yeah Extifer
For a little bit
No Extifer camped out to get the Wii for me
Not at that Target we were at the
Oh you guys went somewhere else
Yeah so was Extifer
I don't remember him being there with us
Because we were just sitting there exchanging fan fiction
I had a Wii the day it came out because Extifer camped out for it
He was at that Target
It was a long time ago
I really don't remember seeing him then
It was a long time ago
Because we would have been hanging out with him
Yeah because remember we went to WinCo I believe
And got orange soda
No all we did was go to Krispy Kreme
And get donuts and coffee
Yeah I remember hearing about that
I only stayed out until about 2 am and then I was like fuck it I'm going home
I'm not staying up for that
Alright one more story for you guys then we're going to travel around the world
And look at release dates but first Dark Sakura has a story for us
I do don't I
Well how about
Well a game that we've brought up on the show before
Draw something
Over it
I like it
At any rate it's kind of funny that
Just as soon as Zynga purchased
OMG Pop
People stopped playing it
They dropped something like
Ten
They did
They lost ten million
Monthly active users
In thirty days
But anyway they might be
Doing a TV show with CBS
That's kind of along the lines
Of what Win Loser Draw was
Well they have that host with the awesome
Hair what was his name Burt something
Not Burt Reynolds but Burt something else
I don't remember
Oh man
But
But the
In the mean time
While that's still in the talks
They're thinking about bringing it out in more
Languages including Chinese
Well I mean if they have a successful
TV show based off of it it would certainly
Justify some of that extremely
High price
I've decided that Draw something
Would be much easier if I had an iPad
Oh hey this says
A complete episode of Win, Lose
Or Draw available here
Complete with commercials
I love stuff like this on YouTube
That's amazing
It's a coke commercial
Let me fast forward
There we go there's one Loser Draw
Burt Convy
Yeah and they all sit on the floor
To play
This show is awesome
Dude that's Alan Thicke
What ever happened to Lani Anderson?
Let's find out
Look I could do this all night but we better not
Oh it says right here in the description
Michelle Lee, Burt Reynolds and Alan Thicke
I hope they have awesome
B list celebrities on
Draw something TV
That would be the only reason to watch
Oh my god
She just is still kinda
Plasticy looking
Well Lani Anderson's gotta be like 65 at least
She was born in 45 so yeah
I wonder if they'll have people
Drawing really elaborate pictures
Something simple
Like Darth Vader holding a cup
And it's a cup
Acidic Vampire
She's on her fourth marriage
Acidic Vampire in our chat room says bring back old game shows
Supermarket Suite please
Hell yes
The last movie she was in was
A Night at the Roxbury
Well you know what they need to do
So here's the trick
If you want to bring Supermarket Suite back
You've gotta write a new app
For iOS that mimics the old game show
And throwing hams into a cart
And brewing the coffee
For a bonus $200
And those huge inflatable bottles of ketchup
That were the bonus prizes
And then maybe somebody will want to make a game show
Out of your iOS game
The last two shows she was on was one called
The Mullets
And then So Notorious
Oh god that was the Tory
Spelling show
Actually that show was really good
Don't judge me
Do not judge me you're judging me
I am judging you
You just said
I of judgment almost
I said I am judging you
Release dates let's travel around the world
And check out what's coming out a lot sooner than the Wii U
That statement doesn't require
Extra garbage
To play a card game
So coming out
Actually tomorrow
Pokemon Conquest
On the DS it crosses
Nobunaga's Ambition
And Pokemon
Because that really needed to be crossed
Some people
Are looking forward to it
Disney Pixar's Brave
The video game on Playstation 3, Xbox
360, Wii and DS
Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes
On Playstation 3, Xbox
360, Wii, 3DS
DS, Vita and PC
And
Steel Battalion Heavy Armor
Game that's gonna really suck
Using the Kinect
So that is also coming out
Oh and I re-released the Quake 4
Because now Bethesda is releasing it
So
Of course, of course
I'm a little concerned because the lights are flickering
We better not have another power outage before
Part A finishes here
I'd rather have the power outage today than next week
Yeah right? Don't jinx it
I'm not jinxing it
I don't know what we're- next week we're gonna need to have like a
Moratorium on power in this place
Because I don't want to blow a fuse
Anyhow, going to Japan
And looking at release dates over
There, we have on the Nintendo 3DS
Hello Kitty
Tohsekai Ryoku
Irona Kunii Dorekake
Shimasho
From Compile, who I am pissed
Compile is around and instead of
Doing the Guardian Legend 2, they're making
Hello Kitty games
Yeah, get with it Compile
You know what your people want
Wouldn't it be hilarious? Rare
Announces, or was it, not rare
Retro Studios, Retro Studios announces
Guardian Legend Cross
F-Zero, the racing action
Shooter game I would jizz
I'm not even gonna hold back
It's what would happen
Let's see
Nothing really on the Vita, although there's a Metal Gear
Solid collection coming out next week in Japan
That's not this week, sorry to say
How about the Playstation 3?
There's some stuff from Sega this week
K-ON! Hokkago Live
HD version
Mass Effect 2 gets a best hits
Version, and I think that's the version that comes with
All the DLC, I wonder if that's localized
With voice acting for Japan, that's pretty cool
I'd like to play a copy
Of that, just, you know, cause it's fun and different
Sniper Ghost Warrior
Comes out as well, and
Shutsugeki
Otometachi
No Senju 2 comes out
From SystemSoft, and I'm trying to think if that's a game
We have over here, I don't think it is
That's not something I recognize
Lol, no
I was looking to see if
Yeah, the Mass Effect, all the box arts
Japanese, I wonder if it's
I wanna see some dialogue
Oh, maybe not
Hey, this is kinda cool, actually
Something SSJ100Matt said in chat
What's that?
I did a quick Google search on why Nintendo does release
Days on Sundays, apparently back
In the Super Nest days, they would release games
During the week in Japan, when games
Were released during the week, people would skip work
In school to buy and play games
Apparently the Japanese government requested Nintendo
Change their release dates to the weekend
So there's no lost productivity
Interesting
I learned something
From the VOG Network chat room tonight, good job
Alright
And knowing is half the battle
Exactly, alright, that's it for Japanese
Release dates, let's move on to the UK
Well, for the UK
Not a whole bunch, it's a really short
List
On the 20th, Magic the Gathering
Duel of the Planewalkers
2013
On the 21st, Mutant Mudds on 3DS
And, let's see
On the 22nd, Civ V
Gods and Kings
And Steel Battalion, Heavy
Armor, and that's it until the 25th
So, nope
Nothing
Well, I mean, nothing
I guess, really good unless you're a big Civ fan
I guess that would apply to you, Rob
But you're not in the UK
So
How about... Well, the good news is
It's out here, and
It's out next week, or I think came out this week
I need to check
I gotta plan an epic Civ V night
With some friends, but, like, literally
That's an all-day, all-night event, so
It'll be sometime in July
So how about moving on to another story?
Alright, we can do that
I'm out of stuff for the UK
That's really it
Let's talk about Star Wars, and how
Something that they announced during E3
That Star Wars, the older public
Is gonna be free to
Well, not really free to play, but you can play for free
Up to level 15
And, you know
People are wondering, are they actually just
Testing the market with this?
And, apparently, I guess maybe that might be the case
They're saying that, you know, because
Before they lost
You know, 400,000 subscribers
And it's probably gonna get worse
Once the new World of Warcraft
Expansion comes out
But, you know, they're saying, you know
If it was just free to play games
And they weren't very good
It wouldn't even be a question, but
There are definitely good games out there
And good games coming out, so, of course
All of this competition impacts your plan
And with what you wanna do
So
It's interesting
The other interesting thing is this article got pulled
As well
But
Maybe they are gonna go all the way
And make it free to play, especially if it's just not
Panning out like they were hoping
If that's the case, it's kinda sad and unfortunate
Because the game hasn't exactly
Been out that long, and that's a really quick turnaround
But, I mean, we've heard the fact
That servers are
Losing people bad
And they're already talking about server merges
But when that game
Excuse me
When that game came out, obviously it was huge
And everybody wanted to check it out
But it had a real problem with retaining people
And I think a lot of that
It hasn't been that long either, I mean, like, five months
Five and a half months
I'm assuming part of that is the weekend game
But I do know some people that are into the end game and enjoying it
It seems like the launch of Star Wars
Was better than the original
World of Warcraft launch, but then again
What you could get away with seven years ago
In this day and age when there's tons of MMOs to choose from
Well, and also I think from what I've been hearing
A lot of the complaints with the Old Republic
Was that it did a lot of the
Same things that World of Warcraft does
You kinda have to make your game
A little different. Yes, I understand it works
For World of Warcraft, but if you just fucking copy them
It's... put it this way
Chinese knockoffs
Have never as good as the real thing
If copying something made it just as good
As the original, then
Why would be
Having a whole bunch of, you know, counterfeit stuff
Star Wars wasn't
Didn't really feel like a Warcraft knockoff
To me, I mean certainly there were some things inspired
By WoW, but there was a lot
That kinda tied into the other Star Wars
Knights of the Old Republic games and so forth
There was a lot
It was a good single player game
That's for sure, and I think that's what happened
A lot of people played to 50 and then that was kinda it
You know, I think
That ended up being part of the problem
They invested so much in the single player
In all the voice acting and everything
I kinda think that might have been one of the big mistakes
Maybe they shouldn't have invested so much
In the voice acting, I mean yes
It really adds a great deep element
And immersion into the game, but I think that was
A resource that could have been better spent somewhere else
More servers
Well, not even that, they didn't need more servers
They had a problem at launch, I thought
They fixed it really quick
It was no worse than what happened in WoW when it started
I think Star Trek Online handled that type of thing better
Because they really only had
Two celebrities for voice acting
They had Leonard Nimoy doing narration
For each of the new areas
And they had
What's-his-face
Zachary Quinto
Yes, as the
EMH, the Emergency Medical Hologram
For the first mission
And after that, I mean, it wasn't anything
You don't have people
Saying, hey, give me money
Or anything
It has very limited voice acting
Yeah, but
They've managed to get dedicated voice actors
For their main people
True
I have to say, even What's-his-face
Metzen does half of everybody
Including Thrall
But
I think their best voice actor
Is the lady that does Sylvanas
Because, oh my god, that just chills
But anyway
They put the money into
Making sure, there's one dedicated
Server that can handle everybody
That's on it, you've got your beta test server
And as far as the voices go
They didn't license any music
It's really kind of limited
But you don't care once you're playing it
Because the game itself is in depth
And I think that's where you're getting
Into the difference
Well, let's move into one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week
And it has to do with Ubisoft
Or as a lot of people have been calling him since last week
Boobysoft
Is apparently talking to Warner Brothers and Paramount
For a movie dealing with
Splinter Cell
This is according to a report from
Deadline, Ubisoft is in talks with
Warner Brothers and Paramount over a
Film tie-in
It doesn't know which game that the movie would follow
It could also follow a new
Kind of story set in the same universe
However, it is worth pointing out
There have also been, in the past, deals on
Uncharted and Bioshock
Nothing's happened yet
So, just because they're talking
About it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it
Although it is interesting to note that Ubisoft
Has also registered some
Domains in regards
To their new IP Watch Dogs
Remember that was the big game they showed
At the end of their press conference that
Made a lot of people pay attention and some said
Kind of stole the show away from the
Big companies
They've registered such domains as Watch Dogs Movie
Watch Dogs The Movie
Watch Dash Dogs The Movie and so forth
This could mean that there's plans
Or talks about a movie
I also kind of think this could just be
Protection of the intellectual property
Just to make sure
Yeah, just so that there's no fan movie or
Whatever or something, you know, and maybe because
The game looks so good it could be a movie
Maybe they think some people are going to mistake it
For one when they start seeing the commercials on TV
I don't think you necessarily
Want to read into this that they're absolutely
Making a movie because of this, this could just be
You know, trying to protect someone
It's the same reason why we registered
TheVogNetwork.com
Because so many hosts
Were calling it TheVogNetwork
Kind of a similar thing
Alright, let's
Let's go back to a time when games
Were simpler and they weren't making movies
Out of every single stinking game
In fact, the only movie that got a game was
Super Mario Bros. or excuse me, the only game
That got a movie was Super Mario Bros. and it
Sucked
It's the classic game of the week
And since it's not the classic
Video game of the week
Screw y'all, I'm doing a pinball game
It doesn't say classic
Video game of the week, she's got a point
This is in my house too
It is
Twilight Zone that was
Done by Bally Midway
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
Uh, that's Mortal Kombat
You unlock this door with the
Key of imagination
Anyway
It was designed by Pat Lawler
Who is like one of the all
Time best pinball
Table designers, like let me go over his
List just real quick
He did Earth Shaker and Whirlwind
He did Fun House where you got to hit
That ugly guy in the head a bunch of times
He did Adam's Family
He did Safe Cracker
With Stern, he did
Roller Coaster Tycoon, Ripley's
Believe it or not, NASCAR, Family Guy
CSI, and Shrek
I mean this guy is
He's done some of the best tables
Out there
But anyway, Twilight Zone
Is based off of the
Twilight Zone TV show
It's one of the super pin series
Of wide body pinball tables
Other ones include
Star Trek The Next Generation and
Indiana Jones The Pinball Adventure
Which is at Disneyland again
It's at the
Was it the Jungle Trader? Anyway
But because
He was so successful with Adam's Family
Midway's like, here you
Can do the whole thing, you don't need to ask us
Anything, and this is considered to be
One of the most complex pinball
Tables ever designed
It has a working gumball
Machine that deposits balls
An analog clock deposits balls
Shut up
I knew you were going to do that
It has a working analog clock
It's a timer for different modes
A power field
Which is basically like
Right on top
Of the left hand side
Of the thing
Basically instead of using flippers
You're using magnets
To play the ball through this little mini field
And the power ball where you use a white ceramic
Ball that's lighter
And it's given that it's
Not magnetic, it's not affected by the
Magnets in the table
It also uses
The original theme
From the Twilight Zone
And it also uses
I don't know who likes
Their early 80's rock
But it uses the song Twilight Zone by
Golden Earring
And it actually
Has a
Really good vocal
Lightness, Tim Kittrow did
The voice of Rod Serling
It was
Supposed to be the first game
To use the Williams Midway
DCS sound system
But it was still being developed
So it used the Yamaha YM-2151
Harris CVSD soundboard
And it is
Considered right now
The top rated electronic pinball
Table of Instagram
As far as
Little fun stuff that's in there
And I'm just going to read through the list on here
It has the door from the
Opening credits right in the
Center of the play field
You have the mannequin, the zodiac
Clop from the very beginning
It has an image of
Henry Burness from the episode
Time Enough At Last
It's next to the slot machine
The hitchhiker
The slot machine and the peeper and the prime mover
You have the most
Unusual camera
Which is actually a pretty good episode
The invader, static, the piano of the house
Has the player piano
From that. You have
Talky Tina from the living doll
Here's your extra ball
I know, it's pretty cool
They need the tower of terror
Where your balls just drop
Robbie the Robot
Is from Uncle Simon and the Brain Center
Whipple is on the play field
And in an animation
And different sound effects
Like the Serling voiceovers
My favorite one which we heard right at the beginning
You unlock this door with a key of imagination
May I present
A most unusual camera
You know, that type of stuff
But the
You have different door panel modes
Where one is like
Ten million points, the light the gumball
The town square madness, fast lock
Super skill shot, the super slot
The extra ball
The camera
The camera is probably one of my favorite modes in that game
There's also the spiral
Clock millions, battle the power
Greed, which actually
Is the same greed sound effect from Adam's Family
Exactly
The hitchhiker
And the clock chaos
There's actually one of my favorite things to do
And this is one of the skill shots in the game
Is when you use
One of the top right flippers
And you have to hold the left flipper open
So that you're shooting it up a ramp
Under the mini field
So I mean, it's really
Complex, really hard
And then on top of that you have four different
Multiball modes
You have the standard multiball
Powerball mania
Where it happens
When you load the powerball into the gumball machine
And then
You have to keep making shots over the main playfield
And you get a 50 million point jackpot
You have the
Fast lock multiball
And then lost in the zone
Which is the wizard mode
Where if you light all of the door panels
You get a door knob with a question mark
And it pops open
And you have 45 seconds
To make an unlimited number of shots
To all the targets
Basically every playable
Single ball mode is active during this time period
So it's basically
45 seconds of three for all
And then
In most of the machines though
You have your standard multiball
With three being released
There's all kinds of custom mods
That people have done
Like one person added in
The Robbie the Robot toy
Into their machine
There's other design mods like the
Third play field magnet
The gumball flashers, the gumballs
We actually I think added an LED into ours
I want to say
But yeah we have a gumball flasher
That's an independent mod
Different you know
Colors, different things you can add in
Just all kinds, people mod their stuff
All the way, now here's the cool stuff
You can play Twilight Zone
Anytime you want to
It's a license table for the pinball arcade
It's out on
Xbox 360, iOS, Android, PS3
PS Vita
And it's supposed to be out for the 3DS
Windows and Mac OS
So it kind of is a game
Like a console game
Well and for anyone who still
Uses VPN which is basically
How we played it for the longest time in my house
You can play it on Windows
I think there's also a version of PinMame
And PinMame
For Linux
I want to say
So there you go, that's the game
It's Twilight Zone
Are you lost in the zone?
Do you unlock this door with the key of imagination?
There it is, Twilight Zone
The pinball game but now accessible
Thanks to the wonders of emulation
On the 360 and Playstation Network
And iPhone and all that good stuff
There it is
Neat choice, something a little bit outside the box
I like it
So we are going to take a quick break
There's plenty more OLR to come, don't miss it
We have the FUGL Question of the Week
Some rapid fire news coming your way
And of course the mailbag and your phone calls
At 1877 Game OLR
All when we come back after a quick break

We have some gaming news here
With rapid fire news
I do want to put out a last call for any tweets
You guys want us to talk about tonight
I'm gonna get to the foogle question of the week in a minute here too
And I think DarkSakura is in her way to opening up the mail bags
You don't have a lot of time left there
But let's do some rapid fire news, Loki
Sorry, I was looking up US Open
Results
Since when were you a tennis fan?
It's not golf
I'm stupid
Well, no, fair enough
This is also tennis
No, but
My grandpa watches it a lot
We went over to my mom's house yesterday for a barbecue
And he was watching it
There was this amateur
17 year old guy
Who was just out shooting Tiger Woods
Which I thought was hilarious
And I wanted to see where he ended up versus Tiger Woods
Tiger Woods ended up 3 over par
For the 3 day course
I don't remember the guys name
Anyways, sorry
So let's talk Journey
Journey
Don't stop
The journey was pretty awesome
And of course
The developer, that game company
Is now gonna go and self publish
Their next game
And they've got
5.5 million dollars
Of capital from Benchmark Capital
Mitch Lasky
And
They're gonna try to publish
Their game on multiple platforms
Possibly PC
And I guess
They haven't announced
Which platform the game's gonna be on
But I'm sure it'll be awesome
Also should note that
One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet
But I kinda hinted at it
On Twitter as well
That Sony will be releasing
On Playstation 3 a Journey compilation
Now
There's only one Journey game
To believe that it's Journey, Flower, and
Flow on disc
Sadly not the 80's
Game starring the super band
Although that would be awesome
But hey, they can add a compilation of Journey
On top of that, you can throw in the music
In there as well
Well it's funny to me though
Flower and all that is good
But the Journey
Why would you release this disc?
Because people can't go online to download it
Or they're not connected
Without being connected
You're not really playing Journey
That's the problem
You're not taking the true Journey
You're like backseat driver
I don't know
Yeah I know
It's a cash grab
Journey still is a fantastic game
But if you're playing it and not being online
Then I think you kinda miss the point
And that's where the other games
Like Flower and stuff become
Journey really needs to be on the Vita
Because that would be amazing
I'm telling you, Flower is one of the best
Racing games I've ever played
Think about it
PlayStation Home would be interesting
On the Vita as well
I don't know if I'd play it though
But I would probably play it more on the Vita
Than I would on the PS3
Anyways, so let's talk Minecraft
Because we haven't talked enough about Minecraft yet
And there was a patch that was released
Earlier, well Friday
The Secret Patch Friday
There's actually a bug fix patch right now
They didn't really do a whole lot
As far as any of the updates to the game
Like I said, it's mainly bug fixes
They added an auto save feature
So you can set it up to automatically save
Every 15 minutes or 2 hours
Or
I guess up to 2 hours
They've also added a coordinate system
To the map, which is kinda good
That's good
You can write down coordinates of where the good stuff is
Exactly
Also, they took away the dupe glitch
So you can't dupe items anymore
Some issues with clay not generating in your maps
Which is a big no-no
So they finally fixed that
It can actually craft stuff with clay
Also some framerate drops
Stuff not spawning
I actually found a glitch that they didn't fix
So I sent them a message
Funny enough, if you set yourself on fire
And switch to the third person camera
That faces the front of you
You don't see the fire
But you'll see it from the back
If you do that
It's a one way fire
And then I guess
Here's the other thing I didn't realize too
They set a fix for awaiting approval
Showing all the time on some signs
I've seen that happen
I didn't realize that the signs had to be approved
They don't
That's weird
Um
I want to point out some comments from chat
Clover Nikon is in chat saying
All the children at the school I work at
Play the Minecraft demo
And I'm like, well what age?
8-10
Which seems kind of young, but it's cool
It's a great game for kids
It's pretty awesome
I do like this
The ability they turn
Or you can enable or disable the tool tips
I can tell you, that stuff pops up for me all the time
And he's seen all this stuff already
And it'll be just like, hey
Did you know you can use Obsidian to do blah blah blah
I'm like, yes I know, I built a giant
Volcano out of Obsidian
I'm well aware of the features of Obsidian
It's just, I don't know, a little
Annoying sometimes
I just want to point out, speaking of kids playing games
When I was 12, or maybe 11
We used to go to the lab at the junior high
No, it must have been 12 because it was junior high school
We used to go to the science lab where they had the computers
We would play Scorched Earth
It's epic
Scorched Earth is still epic
And what was it, Tank 256? There was another one
Just like a Tank 256 or something like that
VGA Tank, I don't know, there was another one
That is a game right there that needs it
That would be the perfect Facebook game
If you think about it
Because it's not something that you take turns
It's a game that you take turns in
And so, why not have it where
You would play Scorched Earth on Facebook
And I am not talking about
Fucking Worms
Inspired by Scorched Earth
I am talking about Scorched Motherfucking Earth
Right? Exactly
So that would be pretty awesome
There will be an update
Though for Minecraft, the next update
That's supposed to add pistons
And that fun stuff
That's sometime in July
I can't wait
Do you realize, literally in one week
We're getting a Skyrim expansion
You may not be in Minecraft
For very long
Do you realize in one week
It's the 10th anniversary of our show
That's Bethesda's present to us
Naturally, that expansion is coming out on my birthday
So it's Bethesda's present to me
The guy who really didn't play enough Skyrim
You really can't
You can never play enough Skyrim
And then finally
Tank Wars
Thank you Jim Sally
I think that was the one I was talking about
Finally, Penny Arcade
Their brand new game is going to be coming out
Not on Xbox Live Arcade
But actually on PC, Mac
On Steam
And Xbox Live Indie Games
It's coming out on June 25th
It was originally supposed to be coming out on the 10th
But they wait until July seems dumb
Which sounds great to me
And the game itself looks awesome
I wasn't a huge fan of the
Adventure game style that the first one had
But this one looks
Straight up
2D Final Fantasy game
So I may have to pick this up
I just hope it doesn't
Require too much knowledge of the other games
Sorry, I was queuing something up here
I don't know, I zoned out when you
Mentioned Minecraft
Kirby
Thank you for ruining it Dark Soccer
I appreciate that
I was going to play the music here
And talk about
That's right, there's a Kirby 20th Anniversary Collection coming out
You may have already known that
But Kirby
20th Anniversary is going to include
Now this is the Wii game
That's kind of like the Mario game
It was announced back in April
But now we know what's actually going to be in it
Kirby's Dream Land
Kirby's Dream Land 2
Kirby's Adventure
Kirby Super Star
Kirby's Dream Land 3
There's also going to be a timeline
Whatever that is
I guess a poster or something
And a soundtrack
It launches in Japan on July 19th
No North American information
As of yet, but I'm sure it will be
Just in time for the holidays
I think they've said September
I didn't see anything about the Kirby's Golf game
On SNES
Which was the best one
I'm giving this props because
It's not a port of a Virtual Console game
Because that's all the 20th Anniversary edition was
Was just fucking Super Mario All-Stars
Ported onto the Wii
Literally game rips of it
The disc rips were like 30 megs
It was literally the ROM
From Super Nintendo
This is at least more than one ROM
And they actually have to mink something
Well, Majesco
The makers of Zumba Fitness
Which sells really well
And NBA Baller Beats
Oh, Snapples
All right, NBA Baller Beats
Well, they've got another baller franchise
That they've just acquired
American Idol is a license they just got
I want to say, when American Idol first came out
Codemasters had it, then Konami had it
I remember the American Idol karaoke revolution games
Well now, I guess Konami lost it
Or gave it up
Because Majesco now has the license
For American Idol
No idea what they're going to do with that
I imagine a type of karaoke game
Would make some sense
Maybe something where J-Lo will just pay you
A bunch of compliments
You know what's kind of funny?
Konami is actually getting out of the music game
Genre completely
Aside from Joy Sound
That they have coming out
Which is a game that's pretty fucking old
You know, I said for the 10th anniversary
We should have a funeral for Bomani
And never talk about it again
But I don't know
I don't want to do that
But it's true
In the first year, there was nothing on the floor
At E3 about Bomani
The very least they should have done
Was put one of those DDRX3
Versus second mix
Machines in the Konami booth
It would have been at least cool
No, it's taken up space for the Castlevania DS game
Which looks pretty awesome
Anyhow, lastly here for me
Mistwalker wants to make
RPGs for the Wii U
But nothing planned yet
Mistwalker, of course, made
The Last Story
Which is finally coming out here in America
Some of the games before that they did
Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey
A criminally underrated 360 game
I need to play that game
You know the biggest problem with Lost Odyssey
Is that the 360 flopsied in Japan
I think if Lost Odyssey had been on the PlayStation 3
We would have had a sequel
I hate to say it, but it's so true
It's just really unfortunate
Because Lost Odyssey is a gem of an RPG
I love that game
A quote from designer
Takuya Matsumoto
The development team and Sakaguchi-san
Are looking forward to making more
Especially for the Wii U because it has another screen
Right in front of you that will add another level
Of strategic elements into the action RPG
So we really are looking forward to it
But we really haven't planned anything
It seems like it's something you could
Easily do, your little menus
You could even draw attack patterns
I could see role playing action games
Working very well with the Wii U
As long as it's in capable hands
I think Mist Walker
Has done a lot of underrated stuff
Could be good if they decide to do it
Since apparently they are
Kind of married to Nintendo now
I didn't realize this, but
They probably sold more of the last story
Than they did Lost Odyssey, sadly
Alright, Jamie, what do you have for us?
Well, I have a few things
We have, first of all
The amount of money the
Humble Indie Bundle 5 closed at
$5.1 million
So all of that
The final amount is
$5,105,169.91
In two weeks
They basically blew
Their previous records from 2 and 3
Just out of the water
So basically
We had
598,794 people buy
Make purchases
With the average price being
$8.53
And it said that Linux users paid
More than anyone else at $12.51
Per transaction
And Windows users were paying the least
At $7.97
They always pay the least
Yeah
But basically most of the purchases
Were made on PC
And then The Last of Us
Is going to
Not be out until 2013
Well, of course
That's when all the games are coming out now
Well, it was
Technically it's late 2012
Early 2013
But that's
What the Naughty Dog
Director
Directors, I should say
Said on Jimmy Fallon
And then Dance Central 2
It has a June DLC
It is
Um
I don't know who this person is
Eaz
Replay
And Nelly's Hot in Here
And Kat De Luna's Wine Up
Yeah, these are all songs
Well, I've heard the Hot in Here song, but I think it's awful
The other two people, I have no idea who the fuck they are
So, uh
I don't care
Alrighty then
What do we have for the week?
Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook
And Google Plus
Put it together and you get FOOGLE
Uh, this week's question
Has to do with the story we talked about earlier
One of the stories we were talking about tonight was
THQ being suspected of misleading investors
On uDraw, which got us thinking
Although all of us may not be financial investors
Per se, we sure do invest a lot of our money
Into our gaming habit
When was a time that you felt
Misled by a gaming company
And, you know, we kept it a little bit vague on purpose
We wanted to see the different ideas that people came up with
There's a lot of interesting responses tonight
Let's start with Facebook tonight
Um, I'm gonna start with Rob D
It's hard not to feel
Constantly misled by Capcom
Their works, and especially their long-running
Franchises, show that their developers
Care about their games and have passion
However, we're promised so much
And all we ever get is nickeled and dimed
Zombie Princess says
The ending of Mass Effect 3
The whole series makes you think your choices
Will make a big difference
In actuality, it doesn't matter at all
Locopoco says
By Capcom stating Marvel vs. Capcom 3
Not Ultimate
Was gonna have a story mode at Comic-Con in E3
Then when I bought it
All I got was a barebones fighter
Sold it back to GameStop two hours later
That's two strikes against Capcom
Um, let's go to
Kareem J who says
Have to agree with the above poster and Capcom
They hype up their franchises
Then release a boatload of DLC
Which should have been on the disc
Then to add a further kick in the balls
They release a Game of the Year edition
I know gamers don't have to buy the game on day one
But if you're really into one of their franchises
You want the game on day one
You can't help but feel like a sucker
Ouch
That's three punches for Capcom
Joe G says
GoldenEye Reloaded
Frankly, I thought Activision was gonna make the original GoldenEye 64
Pretty with some story
A few new missions and James Blonde instead of Pierce Brosnan
This isn't the case
They gutted the game, changed around the story
To make it more like a Craig movie with Call of Duty gameplay
And they fucking took out the jumping mechanics
You can vault over objects
But it's clunky to say the least
Tyler M says
There's been many times
But nothing will beat the letdown that was Spore
I do remember being
Kind of let down by Spore
Spore wasn't
I think even Will Wright
Kind of said it best
He just tried to accomplish too damn much
I don't think he said it that way, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there
Let's see
Let me try to wrap some of this up here
Clover N says
Driver was just awfully misleading
Thank heavens EB Games has a seven day return policy
No questions asked
That's Driver 3
It's Driver with a three in it
It is very entertaining though on its own merits
It's Lulzy for about those first seven days
And then it's over
I remember when you bought that
It's still Lulzy way after that
It's one of those you have to keep going back to after a while
I need to go back to that
Shattered Hawk said
Mass Effect 3
All the hours being drawn in by the story and characters
Only to have all of the relationships and progress mean nothing in the end
Fuck you BioWare
That's three punches in the stomach for Capcom
For Mass Effect 3
Let's go over to the Google Plus
Uh oh
Only one response on Google Plus
You know what that means about Google Plus
No one's on it
That's what it's starting to look like
We have another little kick for Google Plus
Are you saying that Google Plus isn't the amazing thing
That they had us
Let's believe that it was
I have more I want to say about this
But I'm going to wait because there's another Google Plus story
Coming up in a minute
I want to say this about ActDeft
Who has Google Plus all to himself
And says I think there hasn't been a game yet
That has led to think or believe I've been misled
Into buying by a game company
I usually follow the word of other gamers
And consumers before plunging into
Buy a game
Though I can imagine many Mass Effect fans
Believing that EA and BioWare have totally
Scammed them even if they didn't
In parentheses
So there you have it
That's not really a third strike against BioWare
Pointing and laughing at the other people maybe
Looks like Capcom
Took the cake on that one
I can't say I blame the listeners there
There is a lot to be really unhappy about with Capcom
Over the past couple of years
Maybe they'll redeem themselves if
Lost Planet 3 and Dead Rising 3
End up being really really good
I would still like to have that
Mega Man universe someday
Or the Mega Man Legends
They're just trolling us with the Mega Man thing
On top of that
I mean yes that was terrible
However I didn't buy the game so that
Wouldn't have been my choice
My choice would have to be Saints for the Third
And not as
I mean the game itself is a little misleading
Kind of eh
The game itself is pretty fucking funny
I mean that's just a funny
Ass game
It is a fun game
The DLC though on the other hand
Is fucking terrible
It's just the expansion packs
That they had I mean don't get me wrong
I understand the costumes that's a waste of money
But the expansion packs
I was smart enough not to buy the season pass
Because I know well enough
That you know what I'd rather
Pay extra money
And have each one of those expansion packs
Be for you know
Definitely good
Than to just pay twenty bucks
And have them all be terrible
And thankfully I paid seven dollars
Bought the first expansion and it was fucking terrible
Rather reason the second expansion
Even more terrible than the first expansion
Third one
Hey we get Johnny Gapat
Except he's a giant mutant
And it's fucking terrible
So
Yeah I'm not
I feel a little ripped off by them
And also all the on disc
DLC they have more on disc
DLC than fucking Capcom does
It's ridiculous they're still releasing
Stuff today that's on disc
And then they have a whole
Expansion that really could have been
An expansion of the game but now they're
Gonna make it's own retail releases thirty bucks
I'm waiting on that one
I do want to play it because I like
The Matrix and I like Saints Row the Third
But I'm
Very cautious going into it
Lot of chatters chiming in on this tonight
Blender agrees with Loki
Yes Loki Saints Row the Third
DLC pissed me off
Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says
Bethesda got away with making the
True ending a DLC with Fallout 3
I don't see a problem with Bioware
Doing it as well
He makes a good point there about sometimes our
Attention spans we let
One company get away with something but then
Don't let the other
Lots of good comments there at live.vognetwork.com
Let's go back to some news
I'm sure we'll get some calls on this topic a little later
Maybe some emails
Let's go to Loki with news
Let's talk a little bit about
Retro and what their plans are
Apparently
Retro Games
It's been rumored for a while
Well they've come out and said
Hey we'd love to do a Zelda game
And people started asking them
Hey what's Retro working on?
Because you know
You're not really saying anything about them
And
Of course Miyamoto
Basically saying
In terms of them working on a Zelda game
It's not out of the question
But
You know
Right now they're
Incredibly busy with other things
Then of course they said traditionally I think the Zelda team
Has always had close contact with anyone
Who's working on a Zelda game
Traditionally
Except for maybe in the CDI days
Where they did not have close contact
With people that were working on that game
At least they probably
Distanced themselves
Ever since then
That's why Nintendo has had a close relationship
Yeah
Of course they're saying you know
Retro is too busy
For that sort of thing right now
You know saying that they're
Working on something else
And you know very busy right now
But I'm afraid I can't say exactly what that is
That they're working on
Hope it's not another Donkey Kong game
Although Donkey Kong Country Returns is alright
But
I'm kind of curious to see if they are
Making a Zelda game
Could they be doing the next gen Zelda game
Because if you think about you know the next gen type
Zelda game for the Wii U
Because Nintendo hasn't really worked in
Next gen stuff I don't know if Retro's really
Gotten their feet with it
I don't know
We'll see
Alright well I mentioned a minute ago we could come back
And talk about Google Plus
This is not a good thing for the service
PopCap and
Wuga Games
They're going to be disappearing from Google's social media platform
Wuga already shut down
Monster World
Around May 1st
EA is going to be removing Bejeweled Blitz
From the service this week
I think it's already happened
They're going to quote redeploy our resources
To other adaptations of Bejeweled
I think that's their nice way of saying
Fucking no one's playing it on Google Plus
So we'd rather do the phones and
You know the places that people are actually playing Bejeweled at
Wuga said
They decided to
Decided to remove certain games from Google Plus
Because we have had a much
Larger following on Facebook
And they are active users
So goodbye Bubble Island and Diamond Dash
Those are leaving on July 1st
PopCap does say Google is
A valuable gaming partner for PopCap and EA
And will continue to develop for Google
Platforms, that probably means Android
I think also maybe Chrome
Because Chrome has a lot of that really easy integration
With games and stuff like that
Chrome has a bunch of the
Sort of add-ons with it too with games
Which is strange that
You know it doesn't
That that won't therefore
Integrate into Google Plus automatically
But maybe it does
I don't know
I remember seeing ads for Google Plus
Like at the movies and stuff
They really tried to push this and
People just aren't taking the bait
And I'm not sure I totally
Understand why I mean is it the
Interface is because maybe it's
Maybe people don't like the oversimplification
Next to Facebook I do see
Some dedicated Google Plus people
There are definitely some people I see that use
Google Plus more than they use Facebook
And I have to admit I get so
Sick of Facebook shit
There is so much shit on Facebook
I don't need in my life I really don't
You know there's a lot of toxicness there
There's a lot of just
There's a lot of stuff
On there and I'm not saying Google Plus is
Any better in that regard because I think
If everybody was on Google Plus instead of
Facebook it would just be the same thing in
Reverse but
I don't know
I'm just surprised more
People didn't run away
To Google Plus in a way
Well for a while people did
And I was like oh everyone else is still on
Facebook because people needed attention
It's true it is absolutely
True people needed attention
They went back to Facebook I will totally
Admit in some ways that's why I've still
Posted on Facebook it is it's
Been a great promotional tool for the show
Now I will say this
I think there's a huge
And I hope to hell
This doesn't go away because I think there's
A huge potential to do something great
With Google Hangout
And some of the interviews and some of that and I think
There's some cool untapped stuff there
So I hope they don't just close Google Plus
All together and you know what I don't
Care if we only have like five fans on
Google Plus that's five fans
That we have
So you know I don't want to like stop supporting
Google Plus or whatever but you know it is
The fact is it's a smaller group than Facebook
But MySpace
Fuck them
Fuck MySpace we don't care about that
Fuck MySpace
I still get messages on MySpace I'm like
I don't even know where my page is anymore
Let alone
All these artists hey listen to my shit
I'm like no
Zethur in our chatroom says r.i.p. Google Plus
Well yeah
I mean the game's leaving, Bejeweled leaving
That's when your PopCap
Games are leaving
It's really not a good sign
Yikes
Alright anyhow
Let's move on with some more news
DarkSaga
Who pays attention to news?
How about some stuff about Starcraft
That'll make people perk up
Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm
Is 99% done
The lead designer Dustin
Browder basically said
And this is a quote
99% done but that last 1% is a bitch
So
They're saying basically he says
He could do a playthrough
I'm sorry then it's not really 99% done
That was something he said to get quoted
May I finish?
He said they can do a playthrough
And are like wow this is great
Or you can do a playthrough
And then find more items to fix
So basically it's like they're in that last
Beta stage
Or I should say alpha stage
Where they're finding those little last minute things
It sounds like it's all about your tweaking
Which really is like the last little bit
So you're like 90% done
Yeah
But um
So that's the only thing holding it back
At least they're waiting until it's done
What exactly do they have to do?
They have the game done
They're adding an expansion pack
Starcraft 2
I don't know if I want my unit right here
Do you play Starcraft 2?
They are doing some more units and campaign analysis
Here's the thing
Starcraft 2 has to be balanced right
There is so much
Esports and competitive gaming
And things that go into something like Starcraft 2
It has to be right
So I understand there's gonna be some
Extensive testing that goes on with this
Because they cannot afford to have a fucked up
Balance in Starcraft 2
Literally
Hundreds of thousands of dollars go up for contests
Over Starcraft 2
This game is huge in the competitive industry
Especially though with all the shit over Diablo 3
You better bet your ass they're gonna
Really put effort into this
I mean really
If you look at the competitive gaming universe
It's Starcraft 2, League of Legends
That's where it's at right now
You know it's these type of games
It's not so much the shooters these days
I mean yeah there's some of that still don't get me wrong
But it's a huge part
It's Starcraft, Warcraft Arena
To some extent, League of Legends is huge
It keeps getting bigger too
Anyhow
Few more stories for you guys
In the mailbag, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com
And Skype line in a little bit
But for first, Loki
Well something I was talking a little bit about earlier
Things that Nintendo says that they're doing
And then
Doesn't
We just talked about Starcraft 2
And you know similar type of gameplay style
RTS, Pikmin 3
They're not doing online multiplayer
A brand new system that's coming out
HD
And they're not fucking doing online multiplayer
Because they said
Well we can't because there's a ton of Pikmin running around
So it would be hard for us to track all those
Accurately on other systems
Uh
No
That doesn't make any sense to me
I'm sorry
Because if you think about it
There are multiplayer RTS games
Out there
There are multiplayer console RTS games out there
I just fucking named some in the competitive space
Hello, Starcraft, League of Legends
And you can't fucking
I mean
Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of Pikmin running around
At one time, but
Not like billions of
Pikmin running around at the same time
Ever heard of the Zerg?
It's a big
Yeah, so it just seems like a
Piss poor excuse for that
I mean, you have a launch title
You're supposed to be showing off the features of your system
Your system finally gets online
It's supposed to be, hey, Wii U
Nintendo fucking gets online
But no, they don't fucking get online
They don't at all
It's no online multiplayer
You need to be online
And send pictures of your penis to your friends
Yay
But there's co-op local multiplayer
Okay, here's what gets me scared about the Wii U again
It's just all the online
Functionality that they've shown right now
It's the same functionality we have
The 3DS and the Wii
Send messages back and forth
And see what your friends are playing
That's not very functional
Can fucking do on the 3DS with SwapNote
Or on the Wii
Wii has online gameplay
We had online gameplay with Mario Kart
You fucking had online gameplay with the 3DS Mario Kart
Why can't you do online gameplay for
Pikmin
Oh, I don't know
We've never coded online games before
What's the deal?
Oh, but we have local multiplayer
Could it have anything to do with the fact
That the bandwidth that they have to send
Data to tablet or something
Is fucking things up
Because they have to keep things synced between the tablet
And the system
And then also
Other people's systems
I don't know really how it works
Because I'm not a developer
But it just seems like a piss-poor excuse
Just saying
And they even said
One of the other things was that the Wii U
The whole idea was almost scrapped
Because of the price concerns
They were saying sometimes
They almost gave up on the idea of additional screen
This was due over the concern
Of expected high cost
It may not have been feasible
To create this and sell it
At a reasonable price point for the consumers
Um
And of course they haven't said
What the reasonable price point is yet
Maybe now it's more reasonable
To pay $400 for a system
Because there's tablets out there that cost that much
But
I guess it's just
We're gonna have to wait and see
You know, how much the system's gonna cost
And if it's too much
It's gonna flop
If it's the right price point, it'll do okay
But
I don't know
Alright, moving on to a story
About a game a lot of people are looking forward to
We talked a lot about the Wii U tonight
And not enough about this game
Because this game looks so awesome, I can't wait to play it
It's Ni no Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch
What's amazing is that Namco Bandai
Is actually keeping that name in America
It's going to be called Ni no Kuni here
Now they did change the subtitle
Wrath of the White Witch has obviously
Been translated into English
But yeah, the game is still planned
It is, if you're not sure what this game is
It's the whole level 5
And Studio Ghibli
Collaboration, which has been out in Japan already
For a little bit
I don't remember when it's finally coming out here
I think it's towards the end of the year?
2013, yet again
The reasons why they kept the name the same
I love this, this is
Namco Bandai's senior brand manager, Dennis Lee
Quote, we really wanted to make sure
That all the fans who had come to know the game
As Ni no Kuni would still be able
To recognize it and find it
Having a localized name of a game, you know
Like Fight Quest 6, even though
It could be more westernized, that doesn't quite mean
That it has the same feel as the original game
That's why the name of the game
Stayed with Ni no Kuni
There's a sound to it that feels right
And the subtitle was of course localized
To Wrath of the White Witch
Versus the original Japanese title
You know what that means though, right?
Second Country
Ni no Kuni, Second Country
But I'm glad they didn't just call it Second Country
You know?
I'm glad they did keep that name
You know, if a game like Katamari Damacy can sell
With a title that isn't English
Then why not?
Yeah
I think that Dew Prism had a different name
Because I had been freaking looking forward
To hoping that Dew Prism would be out
And then I hear about Threads of Fate
And I'm like, why didn't you just keep it Dew Prism?
Speaking of Fight Quest 6
I really do think that they should bring over
Fight Quest 3 or make a Fight Quest 3
Which is what I would call
Toeball 3
Because they really need a Toeball 3
Because Toeball 2 is awesome
Just saying
Alright, let's go to the mailbag
Every week you guys email us
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
And DarkSakura
Dives in the mailbag head first
Surrounds herself
In the hundreds of thousands of emails
We get every week
And pulls out a lucky few to read here on air
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
That's exactly what happens
Well, we've got a few
And there's one actually that we got
From Redertainment
And just to say right now
I've read it and I'm reading your thing
And I'll give you feedback
Rob, you should also read it and give your feedback
Oh, it was an off-air question
Okay, sure, I'll peek later
So
Anyway, this one
Dear O.L.R.
I first have to say that I love this show
Even if life prevents me from joining in like I used to
Anyway
Cancel your plans
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about
O.L.R. memory I have
Aside from getting pretty close to
Dark Tetsuya
Is that the day my father passed away
June 25th, 2003 from cancer
You guys were there for me
I remember we were holding a show that day
And I had delivered the news that he passed on
And to help me get through it
You guys made me laugh and played songs to help lift my spirit
Ever since then
You guys have been a huge part of my life
Thanks O.L.R. for the memories and keep up the good work
Sincerely, Michelle aka GamerGirl
Wow, that's heavy
Like, you know
I think we sometimes forget
That like people have their lives
And their drama and the things that they're going through
And yet O.L.R. is kind of something
That stayed constant through 10 years
And I think some people have kind of, you know
It's really weird to say
I mean, not in a bad way
But to hear something like that is very powerful
I mean, when somebody's
Looking for normalcy
So they come to the place that they come to Sunday nights
To help them get through it
Like I said
We don't need hundreds of thousands of listeners
To feel that kind of power
That took one person in this case
Very
I'm glad we could help
That's all I can really say
Same here
Alright, the next
This is the one from Reddertainment I can read
Greetings Omni Beings
Attached to this email is a picture
I took at a Best Buy on Saturday
It's of the PC version
Of Final Fantasy XIV
The game is drastically reduced
Not only does the price sticker read 20
The red sticker on the game
Means the game is reduced to $10
Still, even at $10, I question whether
This game was worth my money
I posted this picture on Twitter
Asking if the game was worth my money
The only reply I received told me
That the Wolverine movie game next to
Final Fantasy XIV was worth purchasing
What does it say
About Final Fantasy XIV that I
The gamer who cuts his teeth on
Who cut his teeth on Final Fantasy VIII
Would question buying this game
And when asked, people replied
That I should buy a movie tie-in instead
Stay black Reddertainment
This message has been brought to you by
Locally produced microbrew beer
Which is what I bought instead of a game
You could take a risk
That the 2.0 version
Is going to kick a lot of ass
One thing we didn't talk about this week
There was a blog post on Sony's blog
That was still happening on the PlayStation 3
Whenever the 2.0 version happens
There's going to be a beta test later in the year
I gotta say, it does look pretty sweet
I just, I mean, rebooting an MMO
And expecting people to care
I mean, it's a big
Risk
But if you think about it, if you buy the game now
For $10, you're not going to have to buy it again
When the 2.0 upgrade comes out
At least on PC
I just hope that means free to play
Final Fantasy XI
I wish those rumors about the Vita
Final Fantasy XI were true
Oh god, dream on internet
Okay
We have two more actually
But I never remember saying this
So, okay
I agree with Dark Soccer 100%
When she implied that Nintendo
Redeveloped Super Mario Bros. U
With a Crysis or Unreal type
Graphics engine and put Mario in
Real world 2D side scrolling
environment, oh, with real skies, trees
And weather effects, real gold coins
Abuse the power of the Wii U
I think I had said that it should
Be like, remember how Fantasy Zone
The Sega Ages
2500
Is, where it's all 3D
But it's side scrolling
I think that's what I had
Said
But
I don't know that I would want it to be
Like Crysis or Unreal
I just want it to be
2D side scrolling
But I mean, they could totally do the effects in 3D
I think more like a game like
Castlevania Symphony of the Night
Kinda had 2D, but a little bit of 3D thrown in
I don't know
And we had one last meal that came in
How about Paper Mario? That's a good example too
Came in last minute
And dear lord, sir
Please spell out your words
Well, sent from my iPod
That's what's happening
I type out all of my words fully
On my iPhone
So if I can do it, you can do it
And I'm lazier
Hey lord of the Orange Lounge
What's your most shameful moment
In video games?
Something you wouldn't want people at work to know about
Mine is Star Wars Galaxies
The hundred bucks I spent on a programmable keyboard
Just so I could make
Hundreds of stem packs
Because I want to be a medic
Just that bad
That stupid game was such a let down
Tons of money and time
Never swinging a fucking light saber once
Kisses, Jim Sally
I may not want my co-workers to know about my
World of Warcraft podcast
Actually, a lot of them already
Do know about that
They don't get it, but they think it's
Interesting
I have crappy games that I like and you should see my cubicle at work
I mean
You have to remember
I work primarily
Not exclusively, but primarily
Middle-aged women
So when I say
When I say that I'm into video games
I usually get a, oh
My son's really into that
Type of reaction
We've got a few fellow geeks at my work
But one of them is into Supernatural
Like I am
And you know, Becky works where I do
And she doesn't play games
Well, she plays R.I.P.M. but she sings
I have another friend that plays Xbox
Some of the people I talk to on the phone play games
The person I work
Closest with at my work
Who's another trainer and her and I are the same
Subject matter experts
I will say this
I adore her very much
We work great together, we're a great team
But I do love the fact that even though
She may not totally get all my game talk
She kind of is a closet nerd
And maybe I shouldn't say this on my radio show
But it's not like you guys know her anyway
She's totally into comic books
Oh, I totally know who that is
But no, she was telling me about
Oh no, before you go see the Avengers
You need to go see Captain America
Because there's parts of the story
That are in there that you're not going to see
In the Avengers
She likes to tell me about
How her and her son read comic books
Together, that used to be a bonding thing for them
She's talking about watching Saturday morning cartoons
Together with them, and I thought that was just neat
It was neat
There's nothing to be ashamed of
Unless you're a DC fan
That's why
Just to bring this back to an empowering moment
That's why I love VoG
The Voice of Geeks Network
There's nothing to be ashamed of about being a geek
Let your voice be heard
Nope
Of course, I kind of don't care for the most part anyway
About what, VoG?
Shame on you
No, about people knowing what my fandoms are
You've made a career out of it, woman
At least a nighttime career
Well, I mean, but I really am
Completely happy
You know, I like
My nerdy stuff makes me happy
And, you know
If it comes up in conversation, then I'll be like
Yeah, I play games
Play Mass Effect right now, yo
I got, you know, I actually
One of our reps was like, so what you're playing for this weekend?
Oh, sleeping video games
And like, oh, what are you playing?
I'm playing Mass Effect, really? I just finished that
You know, I have to do the conversation
Back to work
But, you know, I get that
I was like, oh, I play my Wii
I took one of my co-workers
To the Rocky Horror Picture Show in San Francisco
We drove over there
It was awesome
She had a blast
Anyway
She's also a fan of this page on Facebook
One of my co-workers, yeah
Do you be a fan of my page?
Well, you can go like Jamie, too
But I do want to say this
The Orange Lounge radio page is
A part of 500
Do you think for our 10th anniversary
You could get us 500 likes on Facebook?
Like, I could go, oh, we want
1000 likes on Facebook and 5000
Of course we fucking want 5000 likes on
Facebook, but I'm gonna keep the goal reasonable
Let's go
For 500 fans on Facebook
Two more fans before the next episode
That would be great
Alright, is that it for emails?
Yeah, that's all I'm gonna read anyway
Send us your emails
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
DarkSakura will consider it for broadcast
Next week
Meanwhile, let's get angsty
My FU, I have a few FUs
But I also have a thank you
My first FU goes
Towards
This trend lately
Of people having, like, you know
A Camry or some shit
Up on these huge ass wheels
With, like, bicycle spokes in them
You know what I'm talking about, Rob?
They're like wheels
That are, like, way too big
For the car
And the spokes
Are kinda like wagon wheels
Except, they have spokes
You don't get it
It's like, what the fuck are you doing to your car?
And it's like, it doesn't add any
It, first of all
It reduces
It, um
Decreases their gas mileage
Because they have higher wind resistance
It adds no grip to the ground
And it's just not at all good
For their suspension
It's stupid, I mean
You know what broke my heart, Rob?
You know what really broke my heart?
The 1970 Dodge Challenger
Which is one of my favorite muscle cars
With the fucking wheels like that
I wanted to kill a bitch
I would have cut them so hard
Now, I think that I would just fall over dead
If I happened to see one in the 72 Chevelle SS
I mean, that would murder me
And then, there were
There was just the
The people, this is the other thing
People try to sneak around you
Without saying, excuse me
When you don't see them, all you have to do is go
Excuse me, may I get by, please
And I'm like
I'll step aside and be like, okay
It's California in particular
Where people don't do that
And like, anywhere else that I've been
People will tap me on the shoulder and say
Excuse me, may I move around
But they don't do it here
I don't get why
All you have to do is just speak to somebody
And not treat them like they're an inconvenience
But I also
I love my mom
Because I have to direct an FU in her direction
And you know, actually
I've got it in front of me on Facebook
I am going
Making adjustments in my diet
Because I found out there's quite a few foods that make me sick
And my mom says
I've lost 8 pounds in two weeks
And I ain't no vegan, I eat meat
Water weight
So my reply to her was, good for you, how's your cholesterol
And then
You're a bitch
But that's why we love you
And I appreciate your support of my attempts to be healthy
And eat food that's good for me
And lose a little bit of my extra bulk
Thanks mom slash sarcasm
And so
It's just this thing with my mom
Basically
Anything that is not in her scope of reality
She sort of just rejects it
And substitutes it with her own version of reality
And in some places
They call that insanity
So I don't know if it's just a mom thing
She just rejects anything that doesn't fall into her view
So I guess this isn't
Oh I just noticed
I know look at that
500 likes
Thank you whoever just liked us
I can't see who it is
50 for every year of the podcast
Alright now let's do 600
Or no I want 666 now
Well to continue
Yes
It's just that
Again I love my mom
It's not exactly an FU
Really you know what I mean
Where you just go really really
It's like that meme where the
Girl is like looking sideways and making the
Face which you can't see
So this is really good radio
You have a lot of FUs to give tonight
Oh my thank you
Goes towards the nice lady at Whole Foods
Who let me
And my small little purchase
Go through and said oh no you've only
Got a couple you go ahead of me
I have a bunch more than you
And I was like well thank you
You have a nice day and she's like well you too
I hope you have a great evening
Bless her heart I hope she gets some tonight
Yeah
But it just I'm glad that there's nice
Considerate people in the world
And there need to be it just takes one
Act of kindness to make sort of
A ripple effect cause you know if you
If you take that moment and make a difference
In somebody else's day
Then maybe they'll turn around and make a difference
In somebody else's day that's all I'm saying
I'm done
Spent
Loki
Uh
I don't know I don't have anything
FU to my throat being sore
For a third week in a row
She's not going away
So I guess I gotta go see the doctor now
Cause it could
No I don't know what it could be
Maybe allergies
This is annoying
I have to make mine
Intentionally extremely vague
Tonight but FU
To my fear of the
Uncertain and the
Uncomfortable probably causing
Me to chicken out on yet another great opportunity
That's all I'm gonna say
Alright
Really there's nothing wrong with buying new underwear
Nothing wrong with changing brands
No that part's fun
Are you kidding?
That's like
I know they might fit a little differently
Than your current brand
That's the incentive to lose weight
It's like Rob if you lose weight
You can go buy new underwear
Yes
I meant like changing your brand
Oh
They may fit a little weird in some places
Maybe a little too snug
But it's a new opportunity
They might be cheaper and better made
I don't know how comfortable I am talking about my underwear
On Orange Lawn's radio so I think we need to move on
I think it'll be a good idea
Please let's move on with something else
Let's talk about Harmonix and
What they're planning on working on
They actually have three more projects
Or three or more projects
They're in the work right now
And none of them are Rock Band
Or Dance Central
So that's pretty awesome
And
Of course they can't
Talk about it but
At least they're coming out with something new
Eventually
Eventually
But they said yeah
They'll have some crazy stuff to talk about
Hopefully next year
Hopefully soon
Coming soon
Or not
Yes
Someday
Eventually
Alright let's move on
Moving on to
One more story
It's about Capcom
And you gotta love this guy
He's so animated
Yoshinori Ono
He's the guy behind
One of the producers of Street Fighter 4
He's awesome
He is awesome
There's this interview going around
That's on Eurogamer
About how he did Street Fighter 4
Because he was working on Onimusha 4
And he kept submitting a proposal
For a new Street Fighter
After Street Fighter 3 did not do so well
But apparently enough fans
Pestered Capcom
They kind of let him do it
I don't know if you forgot
But he had this whole thing where
He suffered from exhaustion
Legit
I'm not talking about Lindsay Lohan exhaustion
He was just exhausted
I don't want to say retire
But he had to really take a step back
For a little bit
What's interesting
About having come back to work
At Capcom
Nobody told me to take a rest
When I returned to work
Capcom didn't even acknowledge
That I'd been in the hospital
There was no change in my schedule
I was at home for an entire week
Before the doctors allowed me to return to work
When I returned to my desk
There was a ticket to Rome waiting for me
There's no mercy
Everyone in the company says
Ono-san we've been so worried about you
We've been overwhelmed with things to do
That's a pretty bold thing to say about your employer
But then again when you made Street Fighter 4
Which is kind of making Capcom
A lot of money right now I guess you can do that
And that is kind of messed up
I mean I don't know
Is it just here in America
That you can kind of get that
Like if you have an incident like that
I know if somebody at my work
Had a bad incident like that
You would get what's called the work accommodation
Where you work a limited schedule
Whatever your doctor orders
Which I still have
For several months
I took two weeks off
And basically I could take a nap at work if I needed to
Which
Some people might sound like
Oh what a lazy
But no this is like a legit diagnosed thing
Your doctor said she's got to do it
It's related to an immunodeficiency issue
And I was also lacking in B12
And vitamin D
And it's almost
In some cases I've seen people
Compare it to narcolepsy
Where you start finding you'll be aware
Of yourself nodding off
It's just overwhelming
Exhaustion where you hurt
All the time
It's horrible
And anyone who says that it's fake can bite my ass
I'll wake up enough to kick you in the balls
Alright anyhow
What is this
I guess Ono
Was continuing to talk
I thought this was a crazy quote
Was this a quote from Ono? I guess it was
Capcom was very good at squeezing
People to the last drop of their
Blood to get work done
Ouch
You know something else though
I think it's
So they basically bought him a ticket to Rome
To relax
See now that is though
I would say understanding
What they did and saying sorry here you go
Thanks for getting the product out
I know in Denmark they get a month off
Mandatory paid vacation
Finland too
Because they're you know
A socialist democracy and they have the highest
Highest level of
Reported public happiness in the world
Just saying
Learn from this America
Alrighty
Ah
That's it for my story there
I guess we're about ready to open up the skype line
How's it sound when we open up the skype line?
1877 Game OLR
Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
And we'll get to the twitter topics
In just a minute as well but I want to ask Loki
Surprise him here with any last minute stories
He might possibly have for us
Just real quick there's going to be
A different circle pad attachment
That's being offered by Nyko that looks pretty sweet
It actually kind of conforms
To the 3DS shell
So it looks like it's actually part of the 3DS
So cool
And that'll be coming out I guess
For 30 bucks
Soon
So a little bit more expensive but
Pay for quality I guess
And then there's a retro game
That's being put out
On PC
By developer JoyMashers
And it's a game called Oniken
Looks pretty awesome
Supposed to be coming out on
I guess Desura
For $4.99
And that's out uh
It was actually out this coming Friday
On the 22nd
And I guess um
Mac and Linux versions are coming out
Later on
But the game looks a lot like Strider
So
It could be cool
Which Strider? NES Strider?
NES Strider? Well I mean it's an
NES styled game
So it's like NES Strider but
I mean it sort of resembles Strider
But not Commando you know generic
Futuristic action game
Alright the calls are coming in
So let's go to the phones. Hi you're on Orange Taunt Radio who's this?
It's Shane
Hi Shane how are you?
Hello
How are you?
I'm burning up and achy
And tired
For those that listen to Horde House
How are you doing after the surgery?
Well
I'm not falling asleep
In the middle of things as much
Yeah that was a hilarious moment by the way on the show
If you didn't hear this week's Horde House
Shane fell asleep part way through the show
It was amazing, amazing radio
Go check it out
It's because I was on uh
What's that thing? Percocet
I'm still on it, only to get to sleep now
Not for pain stuff
You even have comments in the chat room
BlackWolf says is Shane awake?
I am
Um crap
I totally had what I was gonna say
And then I forgot because you interrupted me
I'm sorry well surely it was about Mass Effect
Percocet
Surely it was about Mass Effect
I honestly don't think it was
Which might
Shock everybody
They replaced him after the surgery
What? Nothing
Nothing? You're not a pod person
Was it E3? Was it something we talked about?
No I remember what it is now because I'm looking at my desktop
So I got that
Indie bundle that had all those really good games
For super cheap
The most recent one
Sorry BlackWolf in chat says Shane's thought fell asleep
That was good
That was good
Yes the Humble Bundle
And I started playing Bastion which you know
I heard so much about
I saw all the banners at E3 last year
I was like oh that looks stupid
And now I'm playing it and the game
It's okay but I want every game to be narrated
Now because that is the
Best part of the game
It's the big shtick it's the part that everybody remembers
It's the part of the game that makes
People feel so like hipster
And that they're playing something artistic
Is like my game has a deep
Voiced bassy narrator
I don't feel hipster but I like to
Jump off you know
Well I fell off the world once and he narrated
That and that's where I was sold
I thought it was so awesome
I want a game that's narrated by the guy from the Old Spice
Commercial in the style of the Old Spice Commercial
That Mustafa guy
That would be awesome
I want a game narrated by Gilbert
Godfried
I think you're about to get stung by a bunch of bees
What is up with that?
That would be terrible
Nobody wants that
I would play that
Oh my god I think you just
Died
You're the worst video game player ever
Have you seen the
Funny video of Gilbert Godfried doing
The audio book for Fifty Shades of Grey
Yes
Yes I have
Oh my god it's fucking amazing
Yes I have
Fifty Shades of Grey
Twilight fanfic becoming legitimate
Oh my god
So Shane
I am addicted and I blame you
And Rob
That's fine I'll take all the blame
For that because
Well here's the thing it's kind of like a pyramid scheme
So now you have to go and find
Somebody that hasn't played it and give it to them
I'm working on it I'm trying to get Dan to play it
So that our entire house is infected
Can Shirmi play it?
No she'll just shit
Oh that's disgusting
Well everyone poops
That's true I know
From my little puppy Especially your new puppy
What did you end up naming your puppy?
Helo from Battlestar Galactica
Cool okay
Well um
Now I am completely addicted to
Including Garris and everything
Because I kind of dig my
Birdman
He is awesome He totally is
But I am looking forward to the
Hotness of Miranda
But I don't know I'm not too impressed with Kaiden yet
Really cause he's just
Not doing anything he's just sort of like
It's cause you're not taking him places
I heard earlier you're like
I don't bring him along
I'm like hi Shepard
Wink
No the same thing I felt for Liara
I hated Liara and then I beat three and I kind of
Liked her and then I started taking her
Through my playthroughs
Well I can't say stuff
And she became my hag
And I like Liara now
So I have her and Kaiden all the time
Well then maybe
Maybe I'll leave Rex at home
For a while and take Kaiden out
Yes
That's a much better idea
Although people have been spoiling crap for me
Well you should
Unfriend them and then drive to their house
And punch them in the throat
It's because I was looking up the stuff
That I'm not doing in Mass Effect
Like I was reading the wiki
And I don't want to
Shoot somebody
Oh yeah
So
That made me mad
That and the triple palette swap
That I won't go into further detail about
We can talk
Later about that because I don't understand what that is
I'm telling her she doesn't
That doesn't tell her the full picture
That doesn't tell her the full
Picture I'm still going to play the whole thing
I'll find out Rob
I'm just saying
Before I hang up here
So you don't hang up on me
Something we'll probably talk about on Horde House
This week that I saw today
I guess it was Dad of Mine for Diablo 3
That you'll get
Some stuff for having the collectors
Miss the Pandaria
You'll get some stuff in Diablo 3 and it looks like some
Banners and stuff but there's also
Possibly these
Wings that say in the
Like the code string
That they give you quad damage
Now how fair is that
To get something that's actually worth
Something that's really good
For another game but you have to buy
A collector's edition of something you may not
Care about
That fucking sucks actually that's pretty shitty
I gotta say
But I'll get the collector's edition anyway cause
I want that soundtrack cause it's really good
And actually before I let you go
I have something I have to play
Oops not that
Was it my commercial I sent you cause that's awesome
No
Holy fuck is this wrong
But holy hell
Is it erotic
He totally missed the part where he's actually
I can't find the actual YouTube on there
It was apparently on College Humor
But I searched their site and I couldn't find it
I'm sure Tiger Claw will have it in 30 seconds now
But it's missed the boat
It's on my Facebook page
Hurry up and end the show so we can go play Mass Effect multiplayer
Bye
1877 game
O-L-R username on Skype
Is Orange Lounge Radio
If you want to give us a call
Do we have any other last minute stories
Or should I go over to Twitter
I had Twitter up on the iPad
Well there was something I was just going to mention real quick
That was kind of interesting
Remember how well we were just talking about
Pinball game during part A
Where Twilight Zone was
The game of the week here
There was a Kickstarter apparently just recently
Pinball Arcade the Twilight Zone
It's to get the Twilight Zone I guess on consoles
Well it must have worked
Hold on let's go to the phone
So we have another call coming in
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
Oh my god is this Rob
Oh my god it is
Oh my god penis
Oh hi
Well yes I have one
Would you like to see it
And unfortunately I've already seen it
Ah to be 20
Ah unicorns
What is up Miss Jessica Harper
From Understation Live Saturday nights at VOG
Not much I thought that you know
Since you've actually been
Showing support for us these past two Saturdays
And stuff
I would actually call in
And say hi guys
Thank you so much you know being able to check in
And get points really helps motivate me
To show no I've
I mean obviously I do love the points
There's no other reason aside from
Going and getting points
No the whole reason there's two reasons
I have to tune into Understation Live every Saturday night
And I can't honestly I won't be there next
Saturday but neither will you
Neither will I
There's two reasons one of them is disco disco
Disco disco
And somebody was asking me when we were going to do
Disco disco on Orange Lounge Radio I said you don't understand
Travis already thinks I steal
All the bits from Understation Live
I'm not gonna
Like further give him evidence
So no disco there's a ban on disco
Disco the closest thing
You can go disco disco in PlayStation Home
That's as close as we're gonna get
But I will say
The second reason is recursive
Travis
Yes recursive Travis
Always makes me giggle it doesn't matter
How pissed off I am how upset
I am recursive Travis just every
Single time I do love though
That you guys it looks like
I gotta say props to Travis and I don't know
If you're part of this effort as well you've gotta be cracking
The whip or something behind the scenes because
Travis is now getting his podcast up
Same day which is amazing
You know it's all
Because of
The vog
Aura it's like it got into his
Veins or something and now he
He just he's part
Of it you know he is in the
Groove and I'm waiting for it
To start you know
Calming down like after a month or two
But you know it's been well over a month
Now it's like been what seven shows
Now that he's been getting up there
Every single week yeah yeah for real
Yeah and um
Not only that but it looks like
Starting with this past week he now has
Saved the archives on Ustream because
If you haven't tuned in to understation live on vog
It actually flips
The radio station disappears
I mean it's still there so if you want just the
Audio like if you're driving in your car or something
You obviously can't watch understation live you can still listen
But if you're watching on your computer it
Flips and you see the Ustream
Well Travis is now saving the Ustreams
So if you're jvmon in our chat
Room asking what is disco disco
You could go to Ustream
And watch now you can
Watch and watch you can actually
Feel like you're there
Watch me disco disco last week
With no pants yes
And watch his you know beard
Get the dirty thoughts out of your head you didn't see anything
Below the belt except my leg
But I have
I've just
Seen Robin very tight
Lacy panties
Lacy silky
Is what I did you make it okay
You need to give some background to this
Because you're going to make it sound like to all the listeners that I enjoy
Walking around in women's panties
Or something like that yes it was rocky
Horror there's a big difference
There's a difference still funny to say
There's a difference
Is there any video games you've been playing lately
Aquaticirl
Well pretty much what I play
Is over and over and over again
Is lotro I am addicted to lotro
Yeah you suck dark soccer into that whole thing
I'm trying to
I see her over there once in a while
And she's like oh it's so pretty I'm like
Yeah that's why I keep trying to tell you people
It seems like it's working a little bit
I'm trying to play it at least once a week
At least once a week
Because I don't know if you know about
My guild druidia
I was seeing something about that yeah
We now have an all druid guild
Called druidia
It was either going to be that or the order of vespa
She has to fit in her time
Between tumblr and facebook
Too I'm just
I've had design work to do
For reals that I've been getting paid for
I'm kidding lady lighten up
She just has such a busy gaming schedule
She has to fit everything in
Yeah my mass effect and my fractal
And my wows and my lotors
And my stows
So yeah I only have time
In my life for one game
That's my MMO addiction right there
Hey you know what getting addicted to an MMO
Still makes you a gamer girl in my eyes
Well I just
See here's how bad I am though
When it comes to console gaming
I used to be right on top of it
You remember how I used to be
I don't own any modern system
The only thing I have is a PS2
You know what though
Gaming can be an expensive hobby
And there's nothing wrong with being a frugal gamer
We have a lot of people listen to this show
That's kind of in your boat
Where it's like you know
I'd love to have a 360 or a Playstation 3
Or whatever but I just
I have to buy stuff at you know
Flee markets
I like paying my rent
Exactly
I've gone through a lot of life changes
Since my gaming days
I now live in a place all by myself
And it's in downtown Sacramento
So it's a little bit more expensive
But you know
You do what you have to do
And so yeah I'm not sharing rent
So I can't go out and buy the pretty toys
And what have you but
You know what we could do?
Typing of the dead
Yeah well unfortunately
When I was going through all of my
Very very difficult times
My Dreamcast was one of the things that went away
You girls can borrow mine anytime
If I can find it
If I can find it
Yes I could
We can type zombies to death at my house
Yeah
And as mentioned in chat I do have Chewy
You do have a Chewy and that's very important
And Chewy takes a lot of my time as well
And space
A lot of my attention yeah a lot of my space
Alright Jessica Harper
I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in a couple more calls
But thanks so much for calling in it's so good to hear from you
And feel free to stop by the studio anytime
Next week might be a little crowded
But if you want to squeeze in here and say hi with everybody else
We would welcome you with open arms
Ah but next week I can't do
Oh duh you're going to Disneyland
I will be in Disneyland
You know what can't blame you on that
So yeah real quick before I go

Geek side of the voice of geeks network

And getting to sit in that 5 hour line for
Radiator Springs Racers
My wife's going to Disneyland
Everybody's going to Disneyland but me
Well you can go with her
I want to take one more trip
In August like I want Alan and I to go on a
Weekday after the kids are back in school
She's trying to convince Christopher to go with her
Oh really?
Well cause I said you know
Originally she wanted to take Josh
And stuff I'm like that's gonna be a
Sucking pain in the ass to try to
You know haul a little kid on a
Plane and he's not used to sleeping
Anywhere other than his crib and stuff and I'm like
Listen you should just go cause I don't ride
I used to love like okay
Like for some reason I'm terribly afraid of roller
Coasters and I don't know why cause it's weird
I am like I was
Terribly afraid of roller coasters then one time
Disneyland it was awesome and then
Alright I'm afraid again
The only roller coaster I will real roller coaster I'll ever do
Is screaming okay Rob
I just want to read in chat real quick though
Black Wolf is complaining
You guys just went I haven't been in
Over a year yeah well
Still two weeks is two weeks too long
Alright caller hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
Who's this? Hey what's up this is X-Link
Hey X-Link I haven't heard from you in a while buddy
How you doing? Good good Black Wolf don't feel too bad
I live right around the corner from
Disney around here and I've been in here so
Don't even remotely feel bad
I haven't been able to get up there and be able to do
Stuff in quite a while so
I've been quite disappointed that they took
Tron away from it but
You know something about that
Rob I have a question for you
How do you feel now
That the Steam Workshop has now
Has been available for Civ 5
I haven't really
Got to play around with it yet
But I'm excited about the potential
That's in there I mean there's always been some
Great mods for Civ so
It just seems like a logical step and I'm kind of
Glad that they're kind of embracing each other
Steam and Civ I haven't
Admittedly played a lot of Sim 5
Ever since I got into the Mass Effect series
But I definitely want to go back and revisit it
I heard the game fell out of balance
Bad with the last patch
That they did so my friends were like I don't really want to play
It kind of sucks right now but I'm imagining
They fixed it with God's I mean they had to
Have with this Gods and Kings expansion so
I'm wanting to check it out in the coming months
Yeah they did a lot of work on it
From what I understood from this last patch alone
When they were adding the Steam
The Steam Network workshop
Onto it and then I'm hearing on top of that
They're also going to be doing a little more odds
And ends to that when Gods and Kings does
Come out in the following week here so
Right right
Which will be very interesting because knowing
That you can make your own religion is going to be kind of
Interesting and intriguing to see what happens
That is a little bit scary but good
I was going to flip this question on you what do you think
About Steam Workshop and Civ integration
Civ 5? Hey I think it's going to be pretty interesting
What they're going to do Sharks with lasers
Or nuclear weapons or you know
Or robotic robots you know
I mean the sky is the limit so
I mean it's going to be intriguing to see
What kind of different mods and stuff
People are going to come up with for the game so
It really is it's like little big Civ
Pretty much yeah
Hey this actually kind of ties into this
I want to bring in this Twitter topic here real quick
Because it sort of is related here and I'm sure
You're going to know this story when I start reading it
From SSJ100Matt who tweeted us saying
I saw this earlier this week
Man plays same Civ 2 game
For 10 years
Civ 2 is my favorite Civ game
So this made me smile
And Sid Meier even did a reaction to it
If you haven't heard basically
And this was all over Reddit and all that stuff
So I'm sure a lot of you already heard about this
But this man has been playing his Civ game for 10 years
He's now in the
I mean not obviously like straight
He's been playing 10 years on and off
His world is in the world
Is in the year 3991 AD
That's a long ways into the game
Trust me
And basically his world has
The Celts, the Vikings and the Americans
Stuck in thermo
Sorry the Celts, the Vikings and the Americans
Stuck in thermonuclear war
For 1700 in game years
That's crazy
They're saying
Is it a strange reflection
On where society is headed
It has a lot of people thinking in deep thoughts
This week
No I did not actually
It's kind of intriguing hearing about that
I'll definitely go back and reread that
But yeah that's crazy
Though I thought they could have sworn
They stopped it like at some point they do
Stop the game like if you get to a certain area
It's like you can't play it after that
Unless it's Civ 3 or 4
It must be
It must be the later Civs
I thought the game always ended at a certain point
As well but maybe 2 had been left open ended
I can't remember
Maybe his game was modded somehow
To let it go on forever
I didn't read about the details on that
In 10 years that's a lot of time
I don't know
Maybe turn a day or something
Or turn a week
I don't know
That's very intriguing but that's very cool
To hear about that
Sid Meier's response was really interesting
He said
My first thought was wow
I can't believe anyone has been playing Civ 2
For so long
It's been more than 15 years since we released that game
And I don't think any of us expected
A decade long game would come out of it
It would be amazing if we could come back
In 2025 and find out if
Someone's had a 10 year game of Civ 5
Going
Well you know it's kind of like
The way he's played and ran is kind of similar to
Monopoly really
If you play it right
I could see it actually going on for that long period
Of time
It's going back and forth type of deal
And you're not really making
Ok I'm going to build up 50 units
And go in there and try to
Massive wipe these
Towns and cities in the short period
Of time
If he's taking his time and just doing it
Building day by day I could actually see
Something like that happening probably
Let me read this comment from JVmon in our chatroom
Saying I know Civ 3 stops scoring
Once you hit 2050 AD
But you can keep playing if you want
I think that's it
The game stops
Yeah I think that's exactly what it is
But I will say this and I know I'm going to get shit for this
Because he just said he plays Civ 3 with his boyfriend all the time
But why are you wasting your time with Civ 3
That one's the worst one in the whole series
I kind of agree
Especially the way that it's advanced
Over time
Yeah I can actually see that
But all the games
If you go back you're like wow
It's kind of cool though
It's like with a lot of games I like to go back and play
From the beginning and going through
And it's kind of cool like even you said yourself
When you're playing Mass Effect
Seeing the changes that have been done from part 1 to part 2
To part 3 to part 4
You know so on and so forth
It's kind of cool to see the
Transactions and seeing what happens
Throughout that time period
And to get their own
Their own thoughts and other people's thoughts
And theories behind it and putting it to work like that
If DarkSakura wanted to jump in here with a thought
And then we'll wrap things up
I was just going to use one of my grandmother's favorite quotes
To each their own said the blind woman
Said the blind woman as she kissed the cow
That is very true
Very very true
Alright XLink I got to let you go
Any other quick final thoughts for our listeners
Not really that I can think of at this time
I'm probably going to go back and play some Rift now
Alright good luck have fun with Rift
Yeah thanks appreciate it
I know him talking about MMOs and obviously I used to play
A lot of WoW with XLink
Until the guild we were in kind of stopped raiding
But I was playing some of the beta
This week and I got to say the beta's
Come a long way and I was doing some panda
Tanking and it was actually quite fun
Maybe I'll squeeze in one more call
1877 game
1877
GameOLR or a username
On Skype Orange Lounge Radio
Meanwhile I got to get through some of these tweets
I wanted to read this one from Dave Falcon
Who said shout out, I actually retweeted it
Shout out to OLR, long time
Fan from many moons ago
Rediscovered you recently
Now listening to you live with my fiance
Well thank you for tuning in
And I realize sometimes
People just don't have time
For OLR anymore or kind of fall out of
The habit of listening you know
It happens but it's really cool that you come back
At least you haven't fallen
Asleep during the damn show
I stop listening when you talk about Minecraft
Fair enough
Jim Sally sent a tweet that said
Hey guys can you tell me how to spend
You a tweet while you're live on air
I wish I could figure this out
You kids and your twittering
Well speaking of which, let's take this phone call
And see who might be there
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey baby
How funny, I was just talking about you
Were your ears burning?
What did you say?
I was reading your tweet
I wrote a tweet to you? Oh yeah sorry about that
Or somebody hacked your account
No that was me, I was a little bit
Funny before and I thought I would tell that joke
Did you like it?
I did, I did
I was saying can you tell me how to spend a tweet
While you're live on the air
You kids and your twittering
You pretty much got
Twitter in a nutshell right there
Bad grammar and all
That's the Jim Salle way
That's the Jim Salle goy
I'm making my own English
I was just going to say to what do we owe
This great phone call tonight
I got you another little present like you asked
I'm the 500th person to like your
Facebook page
Get out, that's awesome
Thank you
I said how come I haven't done this yet
I felt a little ashamed
So I rectified my situation
Thank you for the support
What kind of prize should we give Jim Salle
For being the 500th fan
I think I should get 500
VOG points
Jamie has a prize?
Yeah
You got a round of applause
I was using my slow clap processor
So I'm not going to get the 500
VOG points
And hearts, you get hearts
And you have VOG points
Don't they go away at the end of the month
I think someone told me they go away at the end of the month
Sort of, the main leaderboard
Is monthly
But we are still going to keep track on a year
Basis, but that one is
Going to be a little more for fun
And let me tell you the reason behind that
We want, well just go back to the
Tweet earlier where somebody said
Hey I kind of stopped listening to you guys for a while
But I recently rediscovered you guys
Well you know if somebody kind of comes into
VOG a little bit late
Then you know we are going to be adding more shows
To the network soon so maybe some of their fans are going to be checking it out
We don't want somebody to feel like they can't catch up
Or they can't ever play the game
Because they are never going to be able to beat the score
So that's
We are going to reset the boards every month for that reason
So people have a chance to win
Every month
Listen Rob, everyone that listens to the VOG network
Knows they can't keep up with Jim Sally
So you might as well just give me the 500 points
First off, okay
Second off, it's father's day
You're a good dad, I'm a stay at home dad
I work hard every day, keep my baby girl
Clean and pretty and nice and put her in
Dresses and stuff
All I ask for at the end of the day is
Maybe some extra VOG points
And a little snuggle in the sheets maybe or something
Alright, Jim Sally
Just because you call in to the shows
And you do show your support
I will see what we can do, no promises
You're the boss, you can do it
Here's the thing
Bobby did all the coding work
And he's very
Passionate about his game
I'll see what we can do
Come on, Bobby
Bobby, don't be a douche
Give me my 500 points
Listen, Bobby
Douche wolf
You're not going to win fans that way
Listen
This is not how you do it
You catch more flies with honey than vinegar
Listen Bobby
I don't care about honey or vinegar
I care about my VOG points
Act deaf, this Google plus loving mother fucker is ahead of me
And I won't have it
And I won't have it
I'll give him something to Google plus about
Jeez, I deserve those points
I work hard
I think without me, where would I be?
If anything
If anything
Listen everybody, if you don't think that Jim Sally should get 500 points
Then maybe you haven't been listening to the VOG network enough
Or too much
Or too much
Fine, I award you 500 points
For Gryffindor
For Gryffindor
What is it you were going to say, Rob?
It's a bummer the points aren't compatible
With each other
The conversion rates
You were looking at me funny
Oh, I was looking at you funny because you were yawning
Very loudly
Oh, nothing
Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show
Any last quick, quick thoughts that don't have to do with VOG points
No
I'm just
I'm kind of obsessed with the VOG points now
Bobby, make it happen
Bobby, come on
A lot of people are
Alright, take care of Jim Sally
Have a good one
Thanks for the points, Bobby
Goodnight everybody
Bye
Alright, we got to close up the Skyline
I'm so sorry, I saw other people trying to get through
In fact, there was one caller I'd never seen before
That I really wanted to take
But it just didn't work out, I'm sorry
Email us, mailbagoutorangeloungeradio.com
I'm using Chigurh's suggestion
By the way, we've actually awarded you
The 500 points
But we're taking it away for ranting
No, we are doing no such thing
Bobby and I are already discussing
Something in secret
That's all we can say, it's in secret
A couple more tweets, I got to get some of Tigerclaw's tweets
I posted the best picture
In chat, by the way
Tigerclaw tweets
But I posted the best picture in chat
Of peekathulu
Tigerclaw sends us a tweet
Microsoft's first Android
Title, Connectimals
Remember Connectimals?
They're still around
Apparently it's the first Android game
That they've launched on Google Play's
Store, not to be confused with Google Plus
Which we were talking about earlier
It is out now, it's also on
iOS, just saying
$2.99 on Google Play for Android
A little tie-in there to the
Connect game that I know Loki's a big fan of
He gave me a big thumb
That was a gladiator moment
Right there with the big thumbs down
Alright, let me read
One more tweet here from Tigerclaw
PBS taking a look at
Modern 8-bit culture
That's really cool
The evolution of 8-bit art, I guess it's like a
PBS special that's going on there
That's talking about, I imagine it's got to be things like the
8-bit exhibit and all that stuff
Yeah, I am 8-bit and all that stuff
That's pretty cool
Talking about some of the recent games like VVV
Mega Man 9 and some of that
Stuff that's really caught on, that's really cool
And murals and so forth, you know what?
It's a big part of a lot of people's childhoods
And all that, so
I can totally see why it's in our
Popular culture and all that
Anyway, I gotta close up the tweeters
Close up the mailbag, close up
The phone because it is about closing
Time here at Orange Lounge
Radio, we gotta wrap up the show and say
Goodnight, I wanna check in with Loki
One more time to see if he has any other
Last minute stories
Alright, then we'll go around
And get everybody's final thought and wrap
Quickly, Loki, I don't know if you can talk
About this, what is this that you brought?
The FP
It's basically
A movie where there's these two post
Apocalyptic gangs that compete
And fight each other
By playing DDR
Wasn't that in a Madonna video?
Hated it, no
It's really cheesy
I don't know
It's a screener ahead
I'll have to check that out at some point
Alright
Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's
Final thought
My final thought tonight is
Dinner
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
Picatulu
And Loki
Last but not least, your final thought tonight
My final thought is
This mascot for this game that's on Kickstarter
Zombie Playground looks too much
Like Pedobear
It's Pedo Raccoon
That is
Pedo Raccoon for sure
And Zombie Pedo Raccoon
But that is Pedo Raccoon
Fun!
Alright, hey before we
Close up shop here
I just want to say thank you guys very much
For tuning into Orange Lounge Radio
Thank you for your support over the past 9 years
And 51 weeks
All we ask, tell a friend or two about
Orange Lounge Radio, help spread the word
Hey, we got fans 499
And 500 tonight on Facebook
That's exactly what we're talking about
I know 500 was Jim Sally, I don't know where 499 came from
But thank you whoever that was
And whoever told that person about Orange Lounge Radio
Help us spread the word, word of mouth
And all that stuff especially
And as well
As you know from behind the scenes stuff
There will be easier and more ways
To spread that word soon enough
Uh huh, very true, very true
We've seen things
And also I want to say
Next week is
The 10 year anniversary
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Please help spread the word
Especially to folks who've kind of been missing for a little while
Such as the Twitter comment I read earlier
Just I would really love to hear
From the folks from OLR's past
The Skype line will be open
In about an hour after the show
To take your calls and messages
Uh if you have anything you want to leave
For us to play next week
I'm really looking forward to it
And um
I kind of can't believe it
That's why we haven't said much about it
We kind of can't believe it, it's been 10 years
Shit, we are old
It's our 10th anniversary
We'll be back next week to celebrate
10 years of Orange Lounge Radio
Until then, don't be a dick
Be safe, see you next time
See you next week
See you next time
