0	19960	Tonight, June 10th, 2012, E3 2012 has come to a close and we discuss the highlights,
19960	31720	the lowlights, and everything in between with our live audience.
31720	34280	Yes, Loki in the mid-lights too.
34280	38280	Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
38280	44640	every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live as we always are, every Sunday night
44640	48800	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG
48800	50720	Network or the Voice of Geeks Network.
50720	55200	VOGnetwork.com is where you can go and if you click on live chat, you can chat live
55200	57640	with us, the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio.
57640	58640	My name is Rob Roberts.
58640	62580	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and of course this week
62580	65240	the big E3 expo with my co-host.
65240	67400	First up, Jamie Summers or Dark Sakura.
67400	68400	Hi.
68400	70960	It looks like you were giving my salad the sting guy.
70960	72480	I was trying to figure out what was in it.
72480	74360	I was like, is that avocado or is that?
74360	75360	It's avocado.
75360	77760	I made basically avocado mango salsa.
77760	78760	Okay.
78760	80160	And put it over fresh greens.
80160	83440	Just, you know, green things are always kind of the...
83440	84600	With goat cheese on top.
84600	85600	It's all raw.
85600	86600	Okay.
86600	88880	And delicious because I am back to eating raw food.
88880	89960	There you go.
89960	90960	Not vegan.
90960	91960	Mind you, not vegan.
91960	95120	How do you do raw food without being vegan because it doesn't...
95120	96120	Sashimi.
96120	97120	Oh, okay.
97120	98120	Fish.
98120	99120	And beef tataki.
99120	100120	Oh, there you go.
100120	102120	And raw milk cheese and raw milk.
102120	103120	That works.
103120	104120	And yogurt.
104120	105120	I can have fermented things too.
105120	107020	All right.
107020	108960	Let's also go over to tech master Loki.
108960	109960	Hi.
109960	115640	Who will probably talk about his very non-raw food diet of McDonald's.
115640	118160	You couldn't have two more polar opposites.
118160	120200	That's actually not food though.
120200	121320	She does have a point.
121320	123960	It is definitely not even close to food.
123960	128320	It is the show where every gamer, no matter what you eat, has a voice.
128320	132440	If there was a fast food place on the way here that serves sashimi, then I'd probably
132440	133440	be getting that.
133440	134600	Although it is quite expensive.
134600	135680	I had pop chips.
135680	138680	I think that falls somewhere in between the two of you.
138680	141800	I actually had dinner before I came to this show and then I picked that up on the way
141800	143160	because I was still kind of hungry.
143160	148440	I wanted to stop at Burger King, but there was a bunch of car crashes right in front
148440	152480	of the turn to turn into the shopping center with the Burger King.
152480	154840	I was like, ah, come on.
154840	155840	Party at Burger King.
155840	161200	No, it's probably stupid people on the light rail.
161200	163000	Whatever happened to parties at Burger King?
163000	166160	Like when I was young and this might be dating myself a bit here, but like people used to
166160	168120	have their birthday parties at McDonald's and Burger King.
168120	169600	Is that still like a thing or did they?
169600	170600	I don't think so.
170600	171600	Yeah.
171600	172760	It's all Chuck E Cheese now.
172760	177480	Chuck E Cheese was a little, that's not food either.
177480	179160	However sometimes they have good games.
179160	181120	It really is the shittiest pizza anywhere.
181120	182120	Anyway.
182120	183120	It's still okay.
183120	185960	You know, but you know who started Pizza Time Theater, right?
185960	186960	Huh?
186960	188880	Um, and crap, I forgot his name.
188880	189880	Atari dude.
189880	190880	Oh yeah.
190880	191880	Nolan Bushnell.
191880	192880	Yeah.
192880	193880	Oh, Woodland Hills.
193880	194880	Not that long ago.
194880	195880	I don't know if it's still open.
195880	196880	It was about a year or two ago.
196880	199000	I went to the original Chuck E Cheese way back.
199000	200800	That was the coolest one too.
200800	201800	Really?
201800	202800	Like two stories?
202800	203800	Had two story slide.
203800	205720	It had the full animatronic band.
205720	206900	Oh, it was great.
206900	214480	In Mobile, where I'm from, we had a massive Chuck E Cheese slash Showtime pizza that had
214480	222800	the party room with the hippo girl in it who played a piano and, and Alan said he remembered
222800	223800	that.
223800	229520	And then we had, um, the big party room with the full band and like the room that you go
229520	233520	into to go to the bathroom that's all like LED lights on the wall that would give me
233520	239280	like a seizure and, um, the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.
239280	240280	I remember that.
240280	242640	Chuck E Cheese in a way is almost responsible.
242640	246280	I mean, for real, for me being like so into video games because I remember, I distinctly
246280	251160	remember going when I was three or four years old, it was my sister's wedding reception
251160	252960	for some reason was at Chuck E Cheese.
252960	254720	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
254720	257400	I think it was like the after reception reception.
257400	261320	Like it was like the real reception was at the Elk Lodge, but then like the wedding party
261320	264120	and the families was more for the kids.
264120	267360	So they, I think my sister was like, let's do something for Rob and the kids.
267360	270560	And so, cause my sister was 16 years older than I am.
270560	273880	So that's why like I'm, I'm four and she's like 20 getting married.
273880	274880	Right.
274880	275880	So we all went to Chuck E Cheese.
275880	279720	I distinctly remember I have like people ask, what is one of your earliest memories?
279720	284760	I distinctly remember Crystal Castles and the track ball and the little box that they
284760	289440	used to have to bring over that you can stand on so I could be a four year old playing Crystal
289440	290440	Castles.
290440	292200	We had the sit down pole position.
292200	293200	Nice.
293200	296820	And when they closed the big Chuck E Cheese, they actually moved the same pole position
296820	299680	cabinet to the newer Chuck E Cheese.
299680	304320	And I did as an adult go back and play the exact same one I played as a small kid.
304320	306200	All right, let's go to our chat room.
306200	311680	And the always present, present fourth guest on our show at vognetwork.com.
311680	312680	Click on live chat.
312680	317680	I believe you can also use the URL live.vognetwork.com.
317680	321480	A lot has changed in vognetwork since our last live show and I'll talk about that in
321480	322480	a minute.
322480	323480	Oh, don't forget.
323480	324480	What?
324480	325480	Thanks to Travis last night.
325480	326480	We have the vognetwork.com as well.
326480	327480	That's right.
327480	332460	You can also access at the vognetwork and I believe, I don't know, I maybe, I might
332460	337280	get a hand slap from Bobby for making this public, but I know you registered at voiceofgeeks.com
337280	338480	also works.
338480	339640	So there you go.
339640	341720	Several ways you can get to our website.
341720	347000	We prefer vognetwork.com, but you can also do the vognetwork.com.
347000	349280	Going to our chat room.
349280	353200	Vince Raven is in our chat room saying, is this a prerecorded show or live?
353200	354960	It must be live because I just read your name.
354960	355960	There you go.
355960	356960	We are live tonight.
356960	359200	I know it was taped last week.
359200	361280	There's no such thing as prerecording.
361280	362700	There's just recording.
362700	363760	That's what they say.
363760	364760	That's the buzzword.
364760	368820	It's voiceofgeeks.com not voiceofgeeksnetwork.com, right?
368820	369820	It's voice, right?
369820	370820	Yeah.
370820	371820	Voiceofgeeks.com.
371820	373280	All right.
373280	376600	And some folks in the chat room are hand slapping there for me.
376600	377640	Uh, let's see.
377640	382360	Also some folks reminiscing about showbiz pizza, which I believe was the Chuck E Cheese
382360	383360	of the East coast.
383360	384360	It's kind of the same thing.
384360	388280	And they merge like a black Wolf is in there saying showbiz pizza where a kid can be a
388280	389280	kid.
389280	390740	Well now it's where a kid can get shot.
390740	394280	I don't know if you read some of the crazy things that happened at Chuck E Cheese on
394280	398240	Yahoo and news and all that stuff, but they got an image problem.
398240	399600	They're not what they used to be.
399600	402080	I used to like, um, Bullwinkles.
402080	403920	That was the knockoff Chuck E Cheese.
403920	404920	Oh yes.
404920	406440	Bullwinkles was the shit.
406440	407440	It was awesome.
407440	408440	Oh my God.
408440	411880	Water show that you could, you know, watch while you eat pizza.
411880	414640	Here in Sacramento too, there was the best place.
414640	417960	I know this is like, so like nobody in our audience will understand this cause we're
417960	419320	international and all.
419320	420320	We have folks.
420320	422080	I see Rob from girls gone.
422080	423080	Wow.
423080	424080	From the UK is listening tonight.
424080	428560	I saw Clover Nikon, who I believe is from Australia is listening tonight.
428560	432760	We've got like an international group here tonight.
432760	435620	Now here I am talking about our little hometown of Sacramento, but there used to be this place
435620	439800	called the mine shaft place was the shirt.
439800	441200	Now it's like an abandoned RV.
441200	442200	Yeah.
442200	446800	Now it's like a scary place, but like you used to go underground to start the miniature
446800	447800	golf.
447800	448800	They had a two story arcade.
448800	450100	It was awesome.
450100	455280	And then right before it closed, it had like a dance club in the basement and it was commonly
455280	460000	known as the Mormon dance club because I guess the mine shaft was owned by Mormons.
460000	464360	And so the Mormon dance club, I don't even know how that works, but I just know that's
464360	465360	what everybody did.
465360	466360	Go there one summer.
466360	470060	Like, you know, just, ah, we'll go play miniature golf there cause I've never really been there
470060	471060	before.
471060	475280	Like, and man, it was, it was run down.
475280	476880	It was pretty bad.
476880	479920	Oh, DJ Morpheus is reminding me about Sam's town too.
479920	480920	That was awesome.
480920	481920	Damn.
481920	485240	We had some great entertainment and I'm sure wherever you're from in your hometown, you
485240	488320	used to have these great entertainment places that have probably all shut down.
488320	490520	Alan, were there any awesome ones in the Bay area?
490520	493240	I'm not thinking of he's ignoring.
493240	494240	Oh, okay.
494240	495240	Oh, he's shaking his head.
495240	498640	You know what we had in mobile and it's still there and it's changed names, but it used
498640	500760	to be called mount Asia.
500760	507000	It was a huge like multi level, um, uh, mini golf, but it had a great arcade.
507000	508560	That's where I played truck for the first time.
508560	510440	I was hooked on that game.
510440	513360	The only thing notable I can remember in the East Bay was in Concord.
513360	517920	There was a big Malibu grand Prix, which had the RC cars and then a huge arcade, but it
517920	519960	closed when I was like seven.
519960	521480	So I barely remember it.
521480	525480	They saw some of that Scandi is like, you know, I love, not necessarily our Scandi,
525480	527840	our Scandi went, I don't know what happened to our Scandi.
527840	529400	It's just weird.
529400	532800	But like the other Scandi is, you know, they still have like the old arcades and stuff.
532800	533800	They're kind of cool.
533800	538000	They saw that vibe, you know, they have the go-karts and miniature golf and that kind
538000	539000	of stuff.
539000	540000	I miss retro arcades.
540000	544280	I wish that's why I loved Flynn's arcade at Disneyland and we weren't here last week because
544280	548680	I made another trip to Disneyland and so I got to see electronic as replacement, which
548680	549960	is the mad tea party.
549960	554080	Now I didn't see the actual party cause we were there on weekdays, but I saw the decorations
554080	558080	and it pained me to see Flynn's arcade just gone, just totally gone.
558080	562280	The front had been replaced with something else that wasn't even really themed for Alice
562280	563280	in Wonderland.
563280	565960	Just made me sad as I've been calling it the mad flop party.
565960	569080	I've had some friends that have gone that did not enjoy themselves, but we'll see.
569080	570080	We'll see.
570080	571080	You never know.
571080	574280	I think we're all just very bitter about the whole Tron thing being gone.
574280	576560	Anyhow, let's talk about what's changed real quick.
576560	580480	I will get into video games and E3, but I want to talk about some big things for us
580480	585280	that happened during this last week that we weren't here.
585280	588720	Vognetwork.com, our official site has launched.
588720	594020	If you visited it back in May when we first, you know, established the network with Bobby
594020	598080	and understation live, we had kind of a temporary site there that was just one page with the
598080	599520	chat room taking up the whole page.
599520	603760	The full site is now available and if you haven't been able to take a look at it, I
603760	608880	really encourage you to go because in one week, and I'm not just saying this cause you
608880	614760	know, it's like part my idea, the whole site, but in one week we've accomplished so much.
614760	618760	I'm like really proud and a lot of that is the very hard work that Bobby's been putting
618760	623120	in on the programming side of it, but there's been a lot of hard work on the content side
623120	624200	too.
624200	628900	We have some great authors for editorials that we picked up, thanks to Twitter shout
628900	629900	outs.
629900	634520	Jeff, I know is one of them and Elliot, they've been writing some great stuff for the site
634520	636040	and it's not just video game stuff too.
636040	639160	Remember it's the voice of geeks network, so we have articles on Indiana Jones, we have
639160	644100	articles on of course, you know, Minecraft and there's some other things too, but it's
644100	645640	a wide variety of things.
645640	649840	Yes, right before the show I was asking Raul, who are these people that are, you know, writing
649840	650840	stuff for our site?
650840	653280	Oh my God, I don't recognize these people.
653280	655080	Well, Twitter's a powerful thing.
655080	657200	I know Elliot's been following me on Twitter for a while.
657200	661000	He's based out of the UK and he sent me a direct message that took me like three weeks
661000	666600	to respond to cause my Twitter app was acting up, but he already did some writing, I think
666600	669760	for either a high school or a college paper and I was like, all right, you want to write
669760	670760	for a school?
670760	671760	Let's, let's see it.
671760	672760	And he did that.
672760	678640	Uh, Jeff came in from, this is really cool, video game outsiders retweeted us when I put
678640	683920	or retweeted me, I should say when I put the call out for, um, uh, authors, which by the
683920	689480	way, let me just really quick, really quickly say the fact that we're all like supportive
689480	690480	of each other.
690480	693680	I love video game outsiders and you know, I know they, they sent the retweet for me
693680	694680	and everything.
694680	700520	I hope this dispels the whole, there's an all games and vog network war and they're
700520	704840	a fighting and they're, they, they split, it's civil fricking war.
704840	707080	No, let it go and stop it.
707080	708800	Stop spreading those rumors.
708800	711280	Let them do their thing and be great.
711280	716800	Let us do our thing and also be great because if we're both great, everybody wins.
716800	721040	Anyway, Jeff came in through that retweet and his stuff's been great.
721040	722040	Yeah.
722040	726720	Loki, you say you've been reading that stuff and it's really funny and it's good, good
726720	727720	stuff.
727720	728720	Anyhow.
728720	735500	I'm going to our chat room again at live.vognetwork.com a little more reminiscing there and some
735500	738560	talk about E3 as well.
738560	742120	Act Def is teasing that the, some of the content from orange launch radio, I love this song
742120	744040	is coming this week to vog network.
744040	745040	That's right.
745040	746040	It's going to be growing.
746040	749040	Um, so if you haven't checked out vognetwork.com, please do.
749040	752060	It's not just the station, it's the articles.
752060	758040	And most importantly, the big thing that was announced the Friday before was that it's
758040	759720	all a game.
759720	761840	You can actually sign up.
761840	764800	You can find a loot places on the site.
764800	768560	So EJ from girls gone wow, continuing our conversation from a couple of weeks ago, there's
768560	769560	your loot.
769560	774040	You can check it out over there on the site and you can get loot.
774040	778040	I can't tell you how you get loot, but I'll tell you one of them is really easy.
778040	779040	Like sign up for the website.
779040	780040	Easy.
780040	781040	And you get loot.
781040	784280	Um, you can comment on articles, thumbs up.
784280	789000	You can actually, if you notice Bobby posted a review of, I'm going to mess up the name
789000	790000	of this.
790000	791520	It's jam music band or something like that.
791520	793320	This just came out on Xbox live arcade.
793320	798960	He wrote a review of that and you can actually write a review that agrees or disagrees and
798960	803480	your review, if approved by the original author, which you know, they're not going to disapprove
803480	807800	it just cause you disagree with them, will show up right underneath the original review.
807800	808800	It's pretty cool.
808800	812720	So you can like kind of like have your own say like I disagree because XYZ.
812720	813720	So pretty cool.
813720	817160	We'll have more stuff like that come to the site in the next few weeks.
817160	821440	So yeah, vognetwork.com again, Orange House Radio listeners, if you haven't checked out
821440	825200	the website since the placeholder that was there last month, so much has changed.
825200	826200	Check it out.
826200	832560	Uh, let's go back into games and talking about E3 and before we get into our own gaming week
832560	835520	and the stuff we've been playing as we usually start the show off with, I know we're going
835520	841840	to do a lot of recapping about E3 tonight and I want to talk about this topic that's
841840	845000	been brought up that's kind of hovering over the air.
845000	847920	And that is the question of, is E3 still relevant?
847920	854560	Now, the ESA was very quick to defend the, that question basically that was asked, uh,
854560	859480	by saying, of course it's still relevant, you know, where this is the, all the, I don't
859480	862480	have the quote in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing of course, but you know, all the attention
862480	867160	is on Los Angeles this week and it's still the place to have games shown and be covered
867160	869000	and be exposed to the world.
869000	872700	It is the place to be, but there's a lot of people that are saying, well, you know, in
872700	877360	this day and age of the internet and where everything kind of goes to spike TV the first
877360	883760	day or G4 hits the internet, is it really that important to be there live and in person?
883760	887720	So I want to ask those in studio, especially considering this year E3 was a bit different
887720	888720	for us personally.
888720	891880	This is the first year at Orange Lawns Radio in quite some time.
891880	893380	We didn't really cover it.
893380	897780	We didn't, none of us went and you know, let me ask that question.
897780	899480	Is E3 still relevant?
899480	900480	Loki?
900480	905000	Um, I think it's still relevant because they have a lot of great games being shown there,
905000	909120	but they've kind of made it really difficult for, well, they've always made it kind of
909120	913920	difficult for independent coverage of E3.
913920	919120	It's more of having to, you know, cover the, you know, you don't get invited to the press
919120	924080	events so you cover the feed from Spike TV or something like that, you know, and you
924080	930440	make your comments off of that, which you know, works just fine because it's, you know,
930440	933800	you get to see the same stuff pretty much except you don't get to actually play any
933800	936480	of it.
936480	937480	I don't know.
937480	943360	I think for the gaming industry, I think it's not necessarily the greatest thing for them.
943360	949720	I mean, just because a lot of companies are being hit financially pretty hard and they
949720	955200	can't afford to have these really huge booths and spend millions of dollars on the stuff
955200	961680	like THQ, for example, not at E3 because they can't afford to spend money on that kind of
961680	962680	stuff right now.
962680	968360	They have jobs at stake and properties and, you know, their own company, so they can't
968360	970240	do that.
970240	975280	So I think that, you know, as far as saying, oh, E3 is the place to go for game, you know,
975280	978800	news and to see the games and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily the case.
978800	981080	I mean, yeah, it is a place to go.
981080	985080	It's definitely something that people look forward to, but there's also other conventions
985080	986080	out there.
986080	989920	There's PAX, which is definitely getting a lot of coverage for games and stuff.
989920	995600	And honestly, I mean, you can scale down your booth size a bit and show the same type of
995600	999280	stuff there and I think still get the same kind of press coverage that they're getting
999280	1000280	with E3.
1000280	1006560	Granted, they're not doing these huge keynote events and stuff like that, but I still think
1006560	1008760	it's a good way to get your game covered.
1008760	1012560	Plus, you know, in the day and age of the internet, there's also companies just launching
1012560	1016360	their own games on Kickstarter or, you know, through other means and they can get press
1016360	1018960	coverage that way or, I don't know.
1018960	1024280	I don't think press is necessarily a problem because people were probably talking about
1024280	1030760	Madden and Assassin's Creed and stuff like that beforehand, but now it's just, hey, look,
1030760	1035520	we've got, you know, a bunch of people showing off Assassin's Creed at the Sony, you know,
1035520	1039920	press conference, at the Ubisoft press conference and at the Xbox press conference and at the
1039920	1044680	Nintendo press conference because they only showed Ubisoft games because a lot of them
1044680	1046760	just thought they were so awesome.
1046760	1051280	So yeah, I can see how, you know, they could come to that conclusion.
1051280	1052280	I don't know.
1052280	1056480	I just, I'm just jealous I didn't get to go.
1056480	1061320	I would like to play some more games, but honestly, you know, digesting it through just,
1061320	1065640	you know, reading, you know, other sites covering and stuff, I feel that I kind of took in more
1065640	1069080	information than if I were to be stumbling around because it seems like every time I'd
1069080	1073680	go to E3, it would be like, oh, hey, you know, there's this really cool game and I didn't
1073680	1078960	get to see it because I completely was unaware that they had talked about it or was announced
1078960	1079960	or something like that.
1079960	1083320	And I just never made it over to that booth because I wanted to go see something I was,
1083320	1085320	you know, aware of beforehand.
1085320	1087280	I don't know.
1087280	1092800	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shadownextgen, who is actually at the show
1092800	1096980	and was talking about it extensively on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight said, I think it is
1096980	1099920	important to be in, be there in person if you can.
1099920	1101920	I always enjoy the experience.
1101920	1106080	DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live, I'm reading like comments from other
1106080	1107600	shows tonight, but that's all right.
1107600	1108600	It's a network.
1108600	1111880	DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live says, I said it during Bobby's show,
1111880	1116760	but I see South by Southwest becoming the dominant game showcase in a couple of years.
1116760	1121180	That's a very interesting prediction because South by Southwest is the place where things
1121180	1123840	like Foursquare really took off.
1123840	1127620	And I don't know if you view Foursquare as a game, but if you look at VOG Network as
1127620	1131680	a game, South by Southwest would probably be our show, right?
1131680	1134680	That's an interesting perspective, especially with the technology and everything.
1134680	1137880	Except Foursquare kind of sucks.
1137880	1139840	But think of all the clones that exist.
1139840	1144240	I mean, think of it this way, Facebook basically jacked Foursquare.
1144240	1145240	You know?
1145240	1148920	So, you know, well then again, one could argue, okay, Grant, I better get this out or I'll
1148920	1149920	get corrected.
1149920	1156080	Google Latitude was kind of, you know, also before all of that, but I believe that was,
1156080	1161400	if I got my tech history right, that was Dodgeball and the Dodgeball guy started Foursquare.
1161400	1162400	I've gone cross-eyed.
1162400	1167040	At this point, these big conventions just kind of seem pointless to me because if they
1167040	1173920	really wanted to get reviews and get the press information out there, they would go to like
1173920	1182560	a virtual format, you know, VE3 or something, and send out demos directly to the press,
1182560	1189800	you know, especially since they've been cracking down so hard on, you know, the non-press,
1189800	1191080	you know what I mean?
1191080	1194680	The people who are their version of not industry.
1194680	1197960	I think they're just wasting time and money.
1197960	1201680	What Up G in our chat says, the only thing you don't get from not being at E3 is any
1201680	1202680	hands-on time.
1202680	1206600	Well, I remember a couple of years ago when they did the whole, a lot of demos, not all
1206600	1212400	of them obviously, but quite a handful of demos were available on Xbox Live as they
1212400	1213400	were there at the show.
1213400	1214400	That was pretty awesome.
1214400	1216480	2006 was the year that they did that.
1216480	1222920	And they had like, you know, MotoGP and Lost Planet and there was one other one, but I
1222920	1224760	don't remember what it was.
1224760	1225760	That was awesome.
1225760	1228480	E3 at home is basically like, hey, you know what?
1228480	1229680	We know that you can't go to E3.
1229680	1232840	Here's some of the E3 demos that are available right now.
1232840	1234400	Why don't they do that anymore?
1234400	1239200	I really, I mean, that's a good way to get, you know, information out about your game.
1239200	1242000	But I understand people are like, oh, well, it's not finished, but who cares?
1242000	1243000	You just put that up.
1243000	1245560	Hey, unfinished game, but you get to check the demo for it.
1245560	1248480	MotoNext Gen just bring up an interesting point in our chat, sending out demos to the
1248480	1250240	press wouldn't necessarily work.
1250240	1253240	Not everyone has debug units that can play the early code.
1253240	1256480	Maybe that's a part of it that the code isn't ready for that live environment.
1256480	1257480	You know, there is a difference.
1257480	1262660	They usually prepare demos, you know, that have taken care of, you know, hiding any errors
1262660	1264880	and are programmed for certain time limits.
1264880	1266360	Some companies are sick of doing that.
1266360	1267800	I remember reading an article on that.
1267800	1272080	Some companies are thinking there's the E3 demos are actually kind of not a waste of
1272080	1275680	their time, but it's taking away from time from developing for the game.
1275680	1278640	So, again, why have E3 at all?
1278640	1279880	All right.
1279880	1282680	I really don't see it being relevant anymore.
1282680	1287640	Going to other comments in our chat room, Dark Tetsuya says, we totally need VOGCON.
1287640	1288640	Dream big.
1288640	1289640	Maybe someday.
1289640	1290640	Dream big.
1290640	1291640	Let's see.
1291640	1295020	And Tigerclaw notices that I am on PlayStation Home right now.
1295020	1296280	That is correct.
1296280	1299760	Over there on the TV, look, I'm sitting next to Tigerclaw on the couch.
1299760	1305800	I am in PlayStation Home and I want to pimp the new VOG Network Clubhouse.
1305800	1310520	So if you have your PlayStation nearby, fire it up, search in the clubhouses for VOG and
1310520	1313360	you'll get VOG Network in all caps.
1313360	1316840	And hopefully, oh, it looks like Blender left, but hopefully he'll be back and he can accept
1316840	1317840	more apps into the clubhouse.
1317840	1320040	And I got to say, Blender did a great job with the clubhouse.
1320040	1321800	I didn't even know they had new ones now.
1321800	1325160	He's got this whole, like, desert, I think it's called the Desert Penthouse or something.
1325160	1326160	There's like a little pool.
1326160	1328420	Look at all those arcade games he's got in there.
1328420	1329420	It's pretty neat looking.
1329420	1333000	It totally looks like it's floating.
1333000	1337320	So anyhow, now you'll notice Tigerclaw and I are sitting on the couch, but not too close
1337320	1338320	together.
1338320	1339320	Not too close.
1339320	1340320	There's...
1340320	1341520	It's a nice doodly distance apart.
1341520	1342520	I'm sorry.
1342520	1344480	I do not believe that that's actually home.
1344480	1346360	No one is doing the running man.
1346360	1347360	So, you know.
1347360	1348360	Oh, hey, DDR machine.
1348360	1350180	Is that a DDR machine?
1350180	1351180	Get out.
1351180	1352180	It's a...
1352180	1354000	Yeah, it's like a little DDR machine over there.
1354000	1355320	I believe that is a DDR machine.
1355320	1359480	Well, speaking of home, they have the whole virtual, you know, not to...
1359480	1363680	I mentioned Xbox a minute ago, but they do their whole virtual Sony booth.
1363680	1369000	Granted, it's not the same as being there, but it's kind of a neat little tie-in, you
1369000	1370000	know.
1370000	1371000	It kind of...
1371000	1373640	Again, there's always that question of, what the hell's the point of home?
1373640	1378200	But when you see something like that, you kind of go, oh, that is pretty cool.
1378200	1380600	Did you ever look at the virtual booth in home?
1380600	1384920	I've seen pictures of it, but I haven't been the home for a long time.
1384920	1386840	I actually haven't ever used home.
1386840	1388320	Oh, you got to check it out.
1388320	1389480	It's kind of neat there.
1389480	1391720	I've been playing on my PC.
1391720	1398440	I believe Tiger Claw is fulfilling the running man quota here.
1398440	1399440	You know what?
1399440	1402920	I got to say, this may be the reason to bring a live webcam back to the show.
1402920	1408920	Don't have the cam on us, but put the cam in Sony home, and you guys can look at that
1408920	1410460	while we broadcast.
1410460	1412040	I seriously might do that.
1412040	1413600	That's a good idea.
1413600	1414600	Go me.
1414600	1415600	I'm going to be storming live on air.
1415600	1418080	Mister, I'm going to keep the webcam.
1418080	1419080	You can have the webcam.
1419080	1420080	Look, here's the webcam.
1420080	1421080	There you go.
1421080	1422080	All yours.
1422080	1423080	Have a blast.
1423080	1426840	Well, I thought you had your video camera hooked up.
1426840	1427840	That died, sadly.
1427840	1429480	That $400 camera died.
1429480	1433040	That's part of the reason we haven't had video in a while, and that webcam isn't the best
1433040	1434040	resolution.
1434040	1435040	You know what?
1435040	1436040	I actually think that my camera still works.
1436040	1437040	Oh, yeah?
1437040	1441120	I mean, I've never tried it as a webcam, and I have to convert all of those Disneyland
1441120	1444360	movies, but I think my Panasonic still works.
1444360	1448080	I have an HD camcorder that I'm not using at all.
1448080	1449080	All right.
1449080	1450080	Anyways.
1450080	1452240	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1452240	1453840	We'll come back to E3 in just a moment.
1453840	1456840	Loki's going to wrap up the whole thing for us, and we're going to give our witty insight
1456840	1458080	and commentary.
1458080	1463720	First off, though, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1463720	1464720	Dark Sakura.
1464720	1465720	I played stuff.
1465720	1466720	I played stuff.
1466720	1467720	Yes, you did.
1467720	1468720	And I am so proud of you.
1468720	1469720	Anyway, talk.
1469720	1473200	I played a bunch of Mass Effect until I decided that I really would rather play it on the
1473200	1481560	PC, because I hate the targeting system so much, and it hurts my hand to try to retarget,
1481560	1484120	and I kept dying when I found Counselor Choi.
1484120	1485120	You know what I mean?
1485120	1486120	The matriarch.
1486120	1487120	Yes.
1487120	1493520	So, I swear, she must have been on some pretty nasty PMS, but anyway.
1493520	1497040	So yeah, all of the Asari commandos, like, whooped my ass.
1497040	1501220	So I decided to play it on PC instead, and I've remade my femshep, and totally going
1501220	1502220	after Garrus.
1502220	1503220	Shut up.
1503220	1504280	Don't judge me.
1504280	1506440	Another one indoctrinated, ladies and gentlemen.
1506440	1507440	Shut up.
1507440	1508440	I played some well.
1508440	1511440	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1511440	1512440	Addict.
1512440	1513440	Dealer.
1513440	1517440	Rob, you are the game pimp, okay?
1517440	1518440	You know what?
1518440	1520400	You have to kind of blame Shane for that, really, though.
1520400	1524160	That was just like, that's like the whole, like, this is like, Mass Effect is now this
1524160	1530840	Tupperware pyramid scheme, and Shane is kind of like the regional director, and he got
1530840	1536720	me hooked, and now, in an attempt to, you know, get my free toaster, I got Dark Sakura
1536720	1537720	hooked.
1537720	1539000	It's a pyramid scheme.
1539000	1540280	That's right, it's a pyramid scheme.
1540280	1544840	Oh, and I want to point out, Tigerclaw totally moved closer to me on that couch, you see
1544840	1545840	that?
1545840	1546840	That's still a dudely distance.
1546840	1547840	It is a dudely distance.
1547840	1549920	Well, I think that's the, uh...
1549920	1553640	That's the appropriate distance for dudes to be apart.
1553640	1557480	That is the, um, programmed distance away.
1557480	1559280	That's where your hitbox is.
1559280	1562640	Well, I also played, I did play WoW.
1562640	1565120	I'll put a picture of this on orangehonestready.com.
1565120	1572040	I did play WoW, duh, and I started another MMO just because of Iguana Girl, of Jessica
1572040	1577080	Harper, who has said, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, so finally I'm like,
1577080	1581020	okay, I'll give it a try, you know, because I'm a little bored with WoW because other
1581020	1584480	people are playing Diablo all the damn time, shut up.
1584480	1591280	So, um, the pyramid head scheme, um, so I started playing Lord of the Rings online,
1591280	1599800	and it's actually not bad, um, it's very pretty, I actually prefer it graphically to WoW, um,
1599800	1605120	lots of, lots of fun in-depth stuff, I really like how it more mirrors the books, and you
1605120	1610320	know, without Tolkien's horrible, horrible writing, I'm sorry, you spend, when you spend
1610320	1614900	five pages describing the landscape, and like half a paragraph describing the people you're
1614900	1618000	talking about, that's not good writing.
1618000	1623080	And I'm probably going to hell in the minds of lots of, uh, Tolkien fans, but I don't
1623080	1624080	care.
1624080	1631200	Um, I did play a little Diablo, by the way, um, but I actually, you know, I'm, I've only
1631200	1635520	played, I'm only a level 8 character right now in Lord of the Rings, it's enough that
1635520	1641000	I've gotten kind of a grasp that, number one, I like the camera in WoW better, but I like
1641000	1645160	the scenery in, the graphics in, um, Lord of the Rings better.
1645160	1651400	I do have to say that WoW has better water effects, just saying, um, I actually, when
1651400	1656840	I had it optimized, it basically lets me run the game at full settings, and I had some
1656840	1665040	lag today, but for the most part, it actually runs pretty smoothly, um, I've, uh, I've basically
1665040	1673440	had some problems with, uh, some kill stealing, so I don't like that my targets aren't locked,
1673440	1675400	but, you know, what can you do?
1675400	1679600	It's free, I don't, I like the free part, the free's good, and I played some STO this
1679600	1685280	week, by the way, um, just to, uh, play Dabo at Deep Space Nine.
1685280	1686280	And um...
1686280	1687280	You've been MMOing it up!
1687280	1689680	I have been, I'm like a little whore here.
1689680	1692800	No, I'm not a whore, because I'm paying.
1692800	1695720	Somebody clip that little, clip that little phrase and send it to Travis.
1695720	1697440	I'm a Momo slut.
1697440	1698920	I'm being, I'm a Momo slut.
1698920	1700800	I'm playing the field.
1700800	1706440	Hey, if guys can do it and are, you know, lauded for it, then a woman should be able
1706440	1709320	to be lauded for spreading herself out a little bit too.
1709320	1711080	Just saying.
1711080	1712440	Double standard here, double standard.
1712440	1715760	It was right in his show forums.
1715760	1717320	Bitches.
1717320	1725840	So um, and uh, I have also decided, I'd played the Minecraft demo, the freebie version that's
1725840	1726840	on the website.
1726840	1727840	Hated it!
1727840	1728840	Wait.
1728840	1729840	No.
1729840	1730840	There's no waiting.
1730840	1733040	I hated the demo too.
1733040	1736360	There's no waiting, I thought it was boring as shit.
1736360	1740080	And actually it made me motion sick, it did make me, now the one, actually going back
1740080	1746080	to uh, um, the reason why, the other reason I shifted to playing Mass Effect on PC is
1746080	1749960	because the Xbox version made me motion sick, and I haven't had that yet with the PC version.
1749960	1754160	Because I'm playing it in windowed mode, and it gives me a little bit more to focus on
1754160	1755160	other things.
1755160	1758680	Turned off the motion blur, turned off the fill grain, all of that, it still made me
1758680	1759840	sick.
1759840	1763440	And I hate to say it, but I do get motion sickness with Lord of the Rings because of
1763440	1764740	the camera.
1764740	1770040	Because it's like, okay, you know how in WoW the camera auto adjusts when you're running?
1770040	1773480	In Lord of the Rings you can actually turn your camera around, you can watch yourself
1773480	1778880	sideways, but you're still moving forward with W. If that makes sense.
1778880	1784520	So, I'll try to hit sideways because that's the direction on my screen is trying to run.
1784520	1789840	And my camera is oriented the other way, so it's more or less, I guess, a little bit of
1789840	1793320	user error, but I still would prefer that auto orienting, and I don't know if I have
1793320	1794520	a way to turn that on.
1794520	1799920	However, it's got this full, um, cosmetic thing, so you, it's kind of like, not necessarily
1799920	1805120	like transmogging, because honestly I really like the transmogging system, and you really
1805120	1811160	have to think about what you want, but, um, I do like the cosmetic system and, you know,
1811160	1814120	the dye, you know, you can get clothes dye and everything.
1814120	1820760	And crafting is better, oh my god, crafting is so much easier, the end.
1820760	1829000	So I'm about even, I mean, WoW is still, thanks, sorry, you know, I still like WoW, I'm not,
1829000	1830840	I signed the blood pact, I'm not quitting.
1830840	1835760	And Pandaria may kind of, you know, WoW is really a lull for a lot of people now.
1835760	1836760	I like monks.
1836760	1837760	I want a goat monk so bad.
1837760	1844920	But, you know, the one thing that really, and I decided this today, the really big thing
1844920	1851360	that Lord of the Rings does not have going for it, no true caster DPS class.
1851360	1855320	You have a hunter, that's your only real dedicated DPS class.
1855320	1857240	And you know me, I like the pew pew.
1857240	1864080	I have, what, a mage, a druid, a shadow priest, you know, on WoW, I play caster pew pew.
1864080	1868720	So you know, if that popped up on Lord of the Rings, oh no, that might, that might pull
1868720	1869720	me over permanently.
1869720	1870720	It's the same.
1870720	1871720	And I like free.
1871720	1873720	Did I say I like free?
1873720	1874720	I like free.
1874720	1876200	The MMO queen has spoken.
1876200	1878040	Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1878040	1879040	And Ragnarok Online.
1879040	1880600	How was your gaming week?
1880600	1884200	I played mostly Minecraft.
1884200	1887600	I started by building an artificial volcano.
1887600	1891800	Took the largest mountain that was in the game, well, largest mountain in this one area,
1891800	1897880	and then I built on top of it, all the way up to the top of the skybox, and then I covered
1897880	1903280	the whole thing with obsidian, because I had duped a bunch of obsidian, and then I poured
1903280	1908640	some volcano, or some lava over the top of that, and got too much lava.
1908640	1911680	There was a ton of lava on there, man.
1911680	1915080	You put that in the wrong spot, and it'll just spread like crazy.
1915080	1921000	So I finally took care of that, and got it a little bit more situated to how I like it,
1921000	1924760	and then started to hollow the whole inside off.
1924760	1928600	And actually it's kind of cool, because the whole thing is actually the shrine of fire,
1928600	1933280	because there is fire all over the place, there's lava fountains on the inside.
1933280	1934280	It's just ridiculous.
1934280	1936360	Didn't you do a shrine of fire in Animal Crossing?
1936360	1937360	Oh no, that was Jamie.
1937360	1938360	That was Jamie.
1938360	1939360	That was Jamie that did that.
1939360	1941240	We did the shrine to fire, and we had lesbians.
1941240	1942240	Remember, we had lesbians.
1942240	1943760	Yeah, I do remember the lesbians in your neighborhood.
1943760	1947280	With the rainbow sign in front of her house.
1947280	1949040	It was the one that was the gym teacher.
1949040	1951320	She had the gym themed, and the short hair.
1951320	1954000	I swear she was the biggest lesbian ever.
1954000	1957760	The only thing that kept her from being the ultimate lesbian was by having multiple girlfriends
1957760	1959620	live with her in succession.
1959620	1964640	So you had the shrine to fire in your basement in Animal Crossing.
1964640	1966840	You had the shrine to fire in Minecraft.
1966840	1968760	What game do I make the shrine to fire in?
1968760	1970220	That's what I need to figure out.
1970220	1971800	Just a Minecraft, I don't know.
1971800	1972800	We'll see.
1972800	1974160	Oh, oh, oh, that just reminds me of something.
1974160	1977600	I can have a house in Lord of the Rings, and I might build a shrine to fire there.
1977600	1978600	Just saying.
1978600	1979920	Just don't burn down your house.
1979920	1981320	I miss Mog houses.
1981320	1982480	You know, Rob, I miss Mog houses.
1982480	1983480	I do too.
1983480	1984480	Wowney's houses.
1984480	1985480	They do.
1985480	1986480	They do.
1986480	1987480	Alright, alright.
1987480	1989480	Rather than me just pretending that my goat lives in the back room of the tavern.
1989480	1991480	The man finishes gaming week so we can get to E3.
1991480	1993480	He's gonna get the rest of the damn show.
1993480	1998760	So anyways, so other than, yeah, I've just been playing Minecraft for the most of it.
1998760	2004400	It's kinda cool though, because it, unbeknownst to me, there was a dungeon in the middle of
2004400	2008920	that mountain that I built the volcano on.
2008920	2015280	So now I have this dungeon that's gonna be in the bottom of this giant fortress to fire.
2015280	2016640	And you'll be able to fight mobs down there.
2016640	2017700	So that's kinda cool.
2017700	2019320	So I'll be playing a little bit more of that this week.
2019320	2020760	Did you build an arena down there?
2020760	2021760	I'm going to.
2021760	2022880	I'm going to build an arena.
2022880	2024480	Does Minecraft have PvP yet?
2024480	2025480	No.
2025480	2029640	You can lock a bunch of those ugly things in an arena and make them kill each other.
2029640	2030640	You can do the chickens.
2030640	2035440	You can lock a bunch of, yeah, cause you, if you take the egg and throw it, it makes
2035440	2036440	a new chicken.
2036440	2037680	Yeah, it doesn't do that every time though.
2037680	2042080	You could have chicken fighting, illegal chicken fighting in your arena.
2042080	2046540	I did find it funny though, sometimes I'll be inside the volcano thing like hollowing
2046540	2052000	it out and I'll hear a cow catching fire cause it was stupid and walked into the lava.
2052000	2053240	So that's kinda funny.
2053240	2059480	And then the other game I played, ironically, was an Atari 2600 game.
2059480	2065120	And it's an Atari 2600 game that's exclusive to the contest I'm playing which is for Ready
2065120	2066120	Player One.
2066120	2069580	I don't know if everyone heard, but Ready Player One, you know the wonderful book they
2069580	2073340	keep talking about, they have an Easter egg hidden in the book.
2073340	2075860	And they have a contest now that goes along with that Easter egg.
2075860	2079960	You find the Easter egg, takes you to a website, you play this Atari 2600 game.
2079960	2083600	You find the Easter egg in that, takes you to the next website which the game unlocks
2083600	2084600	there.
2084600	2088080	July 1st and then you play through that game, then you get increasingly harder.
2088080	2092360	And then the next game unlocks August 1st, kinda like the real hunt, except there is
2092360	2093360	a real prize.
2093360	2095240	The real prize is a DeLorean.
2095240	2101800	A DeLorean with a replica flux capacitor inside it that, you know, is being given away.
2101800	2103360	Which sounds all kinds of amazing.
2103360	2104360	Yes, so I...
2104360	2106680	It makes me want to get into this book series.
2106680	2108400	I, um, so I found...
2108400	2109400	Or book.
2109400	2112600	I found the Easter egg after a little bit of a hint from online.
2112600	2116120	Someone mentioned that you have to look for a certain...
2116120	2118640	Because I was looking through the book, I didn't really get a chance to look at it the
2118640	2119640	first day and stuff.
2119640	2123720	And I'm like, eh, I'm looking for a URL, but I didn't quite catch it.
2123720	2127400	And then they mentioned, oh, well you have to look for this type of thing that's with
2127400	2128400	the letters.
2128400	2130320	And then I'm like, oh, okay, there it is, I see it.
2130320	2135580	So I went and played the game, beat the game, um, you know, after Josh went to bed.
2135580	2140400	And I didn't even make the top 100, though, on Leaderboard, but then again, it doesn't
2140400	2144280	matter because each game is time-unlocked, so it's not...
2144280	2149120	The next game's not gonna start until July 1st, and then the final game's August 1st,
2149120	2155400	and really the contest is whoever has all three games completed first is the winner.
2155400	2158800	So how fast you are at the first game and second game doesn't really matter as long
2158800	2164600	as you get the third game after completing the first two, as long as you're first in
2164600	2165600	second.
2165600	2166600	So, I don't know.
2166600	2168000	But Stax was kind of neat.
2168000	2170620	It was like a throwback to, like, Pitfall.
2170620	2171620	It was pretty hard.
2171620	2177640	You had to, you know, it was weird, you have to jump over these, like, static charge things
2177640	2181900	and avoid these things that look like squids, and then there's flashers.
2181900	2184800	There's people trying to flash you like old dirty men.
2184800	2187800	I don't really understand what that has to do with anything.
2187800	2192040	But you're supposed to find, like, six puzzle pieces, and then once you find the six puzzle
2192040	2197440	pieces, you have to find the Easter egg in the game, which is very reminiscent to Adventure,
2197440	2202720	and then once you find that, you go back to, you know, a certain room and you find a QR
2202720	2210680	code that unlocks the third place, and that's eventually where the game's gonna unlock next.
2210680	2214520	And apparently people were aware of the website, like, I've been talking to Dark Tetsuya about
2214520	2217720	the whole thing since, you know, he's into the whole, you know, game and kind of tried
2217720	2222360	to help him out with the game, but, you know, he's like, oh hey, I knew about that website
2222360	2226760	way a long time ago, but it wasn't necessarily because of the Easter egg in the book, it's
2226760	2229560	just, you know, it's kind of obvious what the website is.
2229560	2235200	But yeah, it was fun, it was kind of fun to get to play, like, an old game, and it's also
2235200	2239220	fun to kind of participate in this, like, real life hunt thing.
2239220	2242760	Although if I win a DeLorean, I don't really know what I'm gonna do with it since I don't
2242760	2246760	know how to drive stick, and, you know, and then there's all the other stuff you don't
2246760	2251000	think about, like, paying taxes, registration, and all that stuff, and shipping the car to
2251000	2253320	you, I mean, that's expensive.
2253320	2254320	But it's a fucking DeLorean.
2254320	2255320	But you have a fucking DeLorean.
2255320	2256320	Exactly.
2256320	2262520	I'm like, I rolled that window down, fucking pop in the CD, because it does have a CD player
2262520	2267760	that the guy put in it, and it's all Back to the Future soundtrack right there.
2267760	2270680	Just blast that shit up the radio.
2270680	2272360	Awesome.
2272360	2278520	My gaming week, um, not too terribly thrilling, because I was gone for most of the week.
2278520	2284000	I went to Los Angeles, I was not at E3, I always take E3 week off, but I went with Extifer
2284000	2286880	from Hoard House and his significant other, Matt.
2286880	2289800	We all went down to LA and went to, like, Universal Studios in Disneyland.
2289800	2293760	I won't, you know, spend too much time talking about all of that, since there wasn't a whole
2293760	2299280	lot of gaming involved, but I will say, that Mummy ride at Universal Studios is fucking
2299280	2300280	amazing.
2300280	2301280	I loved it.
2301280	2304160	Extifer and I were screaming like girls, I wish somebody got a YouTube of it, because
2304160	2306080	you guys would have got a kick out of it.
2306080	2307720	Anyway, on to games.
2307720	2309480	When I got home, I did play some games.
2309480	2316160	I played multiplayer Mass Effect a little bit this weekend, because Osfer from our chat
2316160	2319760	room, and Acidic Vampire from our chat room, and Shane from Hoard House is also in chat.
2319760	2323320	We all are, like, playing now, and there's an event going on this weekend.
2323320	2328360	We were having fun last night, trying to survive a gold map, it didn't go very well.
2328360	2332360	Actually, we got to, like, wave five, maybe.
2332360	2335880	Also did some multiplayer over on PlayStation 3 with another listener, Stan.
2335880	2340040	We had kind of a crappy connection, Soul Calibur, so we were trying to do that.
2340040	2342160	We have a dude with a lightsaber doing the Running Man.
2342160	2344320	I think that's Black Wolf.
2344320	2345320	Anyway.
2345320	2348240	Yeah, more dancing now.
2348240	2349680	Ah, two Running Man.
2349680	2350680	Now it's home!
2350680	2354680	Yeah, Blender signed into the clubhouse, and I guess he accepted all these new people,
2354680	2355680	so there you go.
2355680	2357680	We got VX, Jason, XV.
2357680	2361440	Alright, anyhow, hello, back to me.
2361440	2367040	So there was multiplayer Soul Calibur, which sadly was too laggy, but Stan makes some hilarious
2367040	2368040	characters.
2368040	2369040	I loved his Mr. Slave.
2369040	2371360	I was like, people can, like, get away with that in Soul Calibur.
2371360	2374760	It was pretty risqué, we'll just leave it at that.
2374760	2380000	Then played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, which I, that's really Alan's game, not my
2380000	2384040	game, so I was pretty much button mashing, but hey, was having some fun.
2384040	2389920	Also on PlayStation, thanks to the whole PlayStation Plus, thank you Sony, for all those free freaking
2389920	2391440	games this week.
2391440	2392440	I realize they're-
2392440	2394040	Are you borrowing my copy of Little Big Planet 2?
2394040	2395040	No.
2395040	2396040	Oh, okay.
2396040	2397040	Nevermind.
2397040	2398040	I don't think so.
2398040	2399040	I don't have it anywhere.
2399040	2400040	Maybe I didn't loan that to you yet.
2400040	2401040	I don't think you did.
2401040	2403240	So, um, what the hell is that shirt?
2403240	2405240	It's like glowing, sorry, I'm distracted by hope.
2405240	2406240	It's a DVR shirt.
2406240	2407520	This is terrible radio!
2407520	2408520	What?
2408520	2412440	It looks like he's not wearing pants, or is that like a Minecraft bottom?
2412440	2413440	It's like, I don't know.
2413440	2417720	Blender, what the hell are you wearing?
2417720	2421640	It looks like he's not wearing pants, and it's like a censored butt.
2421640	2422640	Anyway.
2422640	2423640	PlayStation.
2423640	2424640	Games.
2424640	2427520	Little Big Planet 2 was one of the free games.
2427520	2434480	So finally, what, about two years late, I'm finally getting into Little Big Planet 2.
2434480	2436100	It's great, obviously.
2436100	2438680	I love the minigames.
2438680	2440760	It's just a great platformer.
2440760	2444720	I've barely scratched the surface of the game, to be honest, but it's everything I loved
2444720	2449880	about the first one, now with, you know, grappling hooks from the very start, and more cutscene
2449880	2450880	stuff.
2450880	2455720	I will say the only thing I kind of didn't like is that the story is really weird in
2455720	2456720	the beginning.
2456720	2462100	I like the more ambiguous nature of the first game, which relied a lot heavier on the narrator
2462100	2463100	and so forth.
2463100	2466880	Now in this one, they're trying to like build a different story, and I'm not really into
2466880	2467880	it.
2467880	2470600	But that's my one tiny, tiny little bitch about it.
2470600	2473560	Otherwise, it's Little Big Planet, and it's great, and I really don't know why it took
2473560	2475520	me so long to get into part two.
2475520	2476520	I really don't.
2476520	2477800	I don't have an excuse.
2477800	2478880	I was too busy playing Mass Effect.
2478880	2479880	We'll say that.
2479880	2480880	I still haven't really gotten into part two.
2480880	2489360	I mean, I played maybe one level of it, and I was just like, other game.
2489360	2491080	So that was pretty much my gaming week.
2491080	2494520	You know, the free Little Big Planet 2, Mass Effect, wow, Diablo, I played a little Diablo
2494520	2498280	with Shane, started a witch doctor, got it up to level like six or something.
2498280	2500960	Not too, enough to kill, enough to beat the beta.
2500960	2504360	We got up to the Skeleton King, and then I was like, I gotta go eat, so.
2504360	2506280	I killed the crap out of the Skeleton King.
2506280	2508280	It actually was hard.
2508280	2509280	A little.
2509280	2510280	A little.
2510280	2514080	All right, housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into E3 news.
2514080	2519240	Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2519240	2523280	Tell friends about the show, word of mouth, you know, again, we're not attached to a big
2523280	2524280	magazine.
2524280	2529920	We hope vognetwork.com will become all the rage someday, and geeks everywhere will visit
2529920	2532680	it, and then we can say we have a big website behind us supporting us.
2532680	2535960	What the hell is that?
2535960	2540560	Is that one of those aliens from Men in Black or something?
2540560	2542940	Blender is in home a lot.
2542940	2547280	He's like the home expert, like look, he started the clubhouse, and look at how well decorated
2547280	2552080	that is compared to the shitty one I made for OLR, which had like an airplane seat and
2552080	2555280	a Pac-Man cabinet.
2555280	2558080	So clearly if there's any weird shit in home, he has it.
2558080	2559600	Anyway, stop getting distracted with the visual.
2559600	2561640	It's terrible radio.
2561640	2563200	It is one of the aliens.
2563200	2568140	Hopefully vognetwork.com will be the shit someday, and geeks everywhere will be visiting
2568140	2572160	it, but until then, we don't have a multimillion dollar website backing us or any of that stuff,
2572160	2576120	so please tell friends about Orange Launch Radio and about VOG Network, because maybe
2576120	2581700	if they hate Orange Launch Radio, they'll love one of the new shows on VOG Network's
2581700	2588760	radio station, including Pod Culture on Monday nights, Anime Jam Session on Tuesday nights,
2588760	2594740	Warcraft Wednesdays with Girls Gone Wow and Hoard House on Wednesdays, and plenty more
2594740	2595740	to come soon.
2595740	2599080	All right, let's get into E3 news.
2599080	2601320	Loki is going to be taking this over.
2601320	2605360	Since I was away at Disneyland and not paying attention to my TV, I was trying to follow
2605360	2611200	the news best I could, but Loki, you were on top of everything, so let's run down the
2611200	2612640	various press conferences.
2612640	2614840	The first people up were Microsoft.
2614840	2620440	Okay, so Microsoft had their press conference, and it was kind of weird, because they started
2620440	2623320	off really strong, because they showed Halo 4.
2623320	2625320	That's how you start off a fucking press conference.
2625320	2626880	Halo 4.
2626880	2628320	Here it is.
2628320	2629320	Get excited.
2629320	2631040	And yeah, it was pretty exciting.
2631040	2637160	It's a pretty awesome looking game, and just going into a little bit more detail about
2637160	2641360	what to kind of expect for it, and man, it looks nice.
2641360	2647200	I mean, actually kind of excited about Halo again, since the last one I was excited about
2647200	2650640	was Halo 3, so it might be interesting to pick up.
2650640	2654320	Some other cool stuff that they showed off besides Halo.
2654320	2660320	Of course, there was the unveiling of Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was an Ubisoft game.
2660320	2665080	That looked pretty awesome, so they had a little clip of that.
2665080	2670120	Of course, talking a little bit more about arcade.
2670120	2673120	They had the summer of arcade stuff.
2673120	2677800	They're talking about some of the games we can expect for that, and actually some interesting
2677800	2678800	things.
2678800	2682480	Some that we already knew about, and some that were kind of on the way.
2682480	2687560	For example, they were talking Deadlight, which is going to be a new side scroller game.
2687560	2689080	It's supposed to be coming out.
2689080	2693880	It looked kind of like a zombie survivor horror type thing.
2693880	2699160	Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, which is supposed to be out, I think, in a couple weeks.
2699160	2705840	Dust and Elysian Tail was something that was actually supposed to be an indie game a while
2705840	2713680	back, but they ended up getting it published because it looks fucking amazing.
2713680	2721240	Let's see, also, Recettear, which is going to be the new Kinect game that's kind of like...
2721240	2723160	People are kind of saying it's a little bit like Angry Birds.
2723160	2729520	I think it's more of like, was it that, the blockbusting game that they had for the Wii.
2729520	2733440	That looked, eh, it's okay.
2733440	2734440	It's a Kinect game.
2734440	2739480	I'm always kind of hesitant about those Kinect games.
2739480	2744400	Other things that they were talking about, of course, entertainment was a big focus for
2744400	2750040	Xbox since they were talking about making this center of entertainment for your household
2750040	2751040	and stuff.
2751040	2756960	Of course, more app announcements, including partnerships with Nickelodeon, Paramount,
2756960	2763440	Makima, or Machinima, I guess, Univision, Televiso, yes.
2763440	2767480	Hell yeah, until somebody on Twitter told me they were ending Sabato Higante this year.
2767480	2768960	That's sad.
2768960	2775200	NHL and ESPN, of course, is getting some new stuff.
2775200	2779600	Other game announcements, other than Halo 4, Forza Horizon, which I knew was coming
2779600	2782640	out, they announced a date, October 23rd for that.
2782640	2784560	Fable the Journey is coming out this fall.
2784560	2788460	Of course, we knew about Gears of War Judgment from the whole Game Informer thing.
2788460	2791040	That's now coming in 2013.
2791040	2796640	Dance Central 3 coming out, with a partnership with Usher in there.
2796640	2800280	He's doing some of the choreography and some of his songs are in there.
2800280	2804200	Also a new Nike Fitness game is going to be coming out.
2804200	2809360	Kind of interesting, I guess, partnership with them.
2809360	2815480	Then, of course, Xbox Music was another big thing that they were talking about, the entertainment
2815480	2816480	thing.
2816480	2818200	You're going to have 30 million tracks with that.
2818200	2822440	Of course, it's going to support some of the new features like Smart Glass, which was another
2822440	2823960	big unveiling.
2823960	2832160	Smart Glass is basically this technology where they can use any iOS, Android, I'm assuming,
2832160	2838160	Windows Phone, tablet, device, anything that you may have already.
2838160	2844360	You download an app for it and it becomes a second screen, just like the Wii U or the
2844360	2847240	Vita and the PlayStation 3.
2847240	2853720	I was floored, personally, hearing that that's not exclusive to a Windows device, that they
2853720	2856040	are going to open that up to iPads and so forth.
2856040	2857200	I mean, it's smart.
2857200	2862000	More people will adopt it because I think finally Microsoft had to admit, you know what,
2862000	2863880	Apple's got a big bite here.
2863880	2868640	We've seen Microsoft take little, like they dip their foot in the pool because there's
2868640	2873160	a fully functional Xbox Live app for iPhone and iPad.
2873160	2875980	It's a universal app that's actually quite good.
2875980	2877680	It's very similar to the Xbox.com website.
2877680	2879020	You can manage your friends list from it.
2879020	2880720	You see your avatars.
2880720	2882320	It's a full-fledged app.
2882320	2888040	Microsoft doing stuff with Apple products is not unheard of, but I did not think they
2888040	2892960	were going to just jump in the pool full in, so this was a pleasant surprise.
2892960	2895080	Yeah, and this is not just for games.
2895080	2900720	I mean, they did announce that Halo 4 and Madden are going to both support this technology,
2900720	2905280	but it's pretty much for everything, including they're talking about some support for some
2905280	2906720	of the apps that they had.
2906720	2909000	One of the examples they gave was Game of Thrones.
2909000	2912920	You could be watching Game of Thrones and getting supplemental information about the
2912920	2916840	series on your tablet while you're watching the series.
2916840	2922000	For example, they'd be showing different locations and it'll zoom in on a map to where those
2922000	2924960	locations are in the whole world.
2924960	2928960	Honestly, it reminds me a lot of the tie-in stuff that they have with some of these Blu-rays.
2928960	2935740	I don't know if you've seen a lot of Blu-rays that have iPod apps or iPad apps that you
2935740	2940240	can watch with the movie and it will have that supplemental information.
2940240	2943720	This technology's been around out there, but now they're adopting it for the console.
2943720	2948760	Plus, you'll be able to control your console using this as well.
2948760	2949760	That's kind of neat.
2949760	2956480	Of course, long-awaited finally announced Internet Explorer is coming to the Xbox.
2956480	2958520	We will now have an internet browser.
2958520	2960880	It will support the smart glass stuff.
2960880	2967560	It'll also be connect-enabled and you'll be able to use voice commands to do searches
2967560	2971160	and stuff like that.
2971160	2974660	That's pretty cool.
2974660	2981040	I'm not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, but hey, whatever, at least it's an option to
2981040	2983040	browse the internet.
2983040	2984040	Cool.
2984040	2985040	Honestly.
2985040	2989560	It'll get porn on my 360, so yay for that.
2989560	2990920	Xbox porn.
2990920	2993640	What about emulators?
2993640	2997760	Do we know if it's going to support Flash or Java or any of that?
2997760	2998760	No idea.
2998760	3002760	Because you know, it isn't complete until you get Super Mario Brothers running on your
3002760	3003760	Xbox.
3003760	3010760	They already technically have that reset glitch Xboxes and they have the dual NAND reset glitch
3010760	3016860	chips you can get where you have one mode that you can boot in that's hacked and one
3016860	3019680	that's stock.
3019680	3023800	Going to some comments from our chatroom at vognetwork.com, Osfer says, I can't wait for
3023800	3024920	Halo 4.
3024920	3029040	The Metroid atmosphere and look to it really pulled me in and Cortana looks better and
3029040	3030840	more emotionally charged than ever.
3030840	3034200	I've heard a lot of good things about it from people who were on the show floor.
3034200	3037960	You know, I got to admit, I feel the same way as much as I wasn't super duper into the
3037960	3039440	first person Metroid games.
3039440	3040440	Well, that's not true.
3040440	3045440	I did love Metroid Prime 3, but I mean, like just seeing that gameplay footage of Halo
3045440	3050360	4 for me, sorry, I'm going backwards, but blame the chatroom.
3050360	3051480	I was really into it.
3051480	3055800	I mean, I, and I haven't really cared about Halo since Halo 3, which, you know, once I
3055800	3059640	played Halo 3 wasn't, you know, it didn't throw me the same way Halo 2 did, but watching
3059640	3064400	the Halo 4, I was like, you know, maybe the change in developers wasn't necessarily a
3064400	3069400	bad thing because it forces them to kind of start over with some new ideas and you do
3069400	3073400	see some of this other influence and I, you know, and that's no disrespect towards Bungie.
3073400	3077160	They made a great game and I'm sure whatever they've got, this destiny thing is going to
3077160	3078160	kick ass too.
3078160	3079160	Well, let's look at it this way.
3079160	3083160	I mean, look at you had people making need for speed games and granted the need for speed
3083160	3087600	games are pretty good and now you have, you know, another company criterion making these
3087600	3091800	need for speed games, you know, or making sequels to these need for speed games and
3091800	3092800	they're better.
3092800	3097640	You know, not saying that the old ones weren't good, but now they're, you know, they have
3097640	3103680	a fresh take on them and so it's a little bit better.
3103680	3110860	One other thing of, you know, kind of, it was a bit of a rumor, but now those $99 contract
3110860	3116720	Xboxes or whatever are coming to more retailers other than Microsoft stores because Microsoft,
3116720	3122320	they kind of figured, hey, we don't have a lot of stores out there, so best buys and
3122320	3128760	also select GameStop locations and from what I hear also from my boss meeting with Microsoft,
3128760	3132560	there is actually, anybody's going to be able to do it as long as you're willing, as long
3132560	3137480	as you fit the criteria that they are looking for and there's like specific things that
3137480	3138480	they need, so.
3138480	3142720	By the way, this was on the OLR Twitter last week, just saying.
3142720	3147640	Sometimes you get the secrets, little secrets, what we can, what little secrets we get, we
3147640	3150080	will let you know.
3150080	3152040	So there was all that stuff.
3152040	3158240	Overall, I think they had a decent press conference just, you know, and I know a lot of the people
3158240	3162280	that were kind of, oh, some other announcements that they made, of course, and some of the
3162280	3166520	stuff, of course, they showed Black Ops 2, a little bit of that and they announced that
3166520	3168920	they're getting DLC first for that.
3168920	3173720	Game with South Park, The Stick of Truth is getting DLC for it first, it's coming out
3173720	3174720	March 5th now.
3174720	3177480	It's going to have Kinect support as well on the 360.
3177480	3182240	Tomb Raider is getting the DLC first on Xbox and also Resident Evil 6 is getting DLC first
3182240	3183240	on there.
3183240	3187660	I got to say, the South Park, The Stick of Truth, fucking amazing looking, is just, I
3187660	3188780	cannot wait for that game.
3188780	3192280	That game looks perfect.
3192280	3197760	I really hope I'm not let down because sometimes trailers look good.
3197760	3198760	It looks great.
3198760	3204160	But yeah, a lot of the complaints about the press conference were, you know, hey, the
3204160	3206520	whole entertainment stuff, hey, I'm here to see the games.
3206520	3213440	I don't want to see, you know, all this garbage about Nickelodeon and Paramount and Xbox music.
3213440	3215240	I don't fucking care about Xbox music.
3215240	3218600	But eh, no K-Press conference.
3218600	3220880	All right.
3220880	3221880	So next up.
3221880	3223760	How do you think overall Microsoft did?
3223760	3228060	There were a lot of people online kind of razzing Microsoft, not fans of the press conference,
3228060	3232600	but in a way I was kind of like, well, what the hell did you expect this year?
3232600	3234680	You knew you weren't going to be seeing the new Xbox.
3234680	3235680	They said that.
3235680	3239040	I know people were saying, oh, because Destiny isn't being shown anymore.
3239040	3240640	They're going to have to give us hints about the new.
3240640	3241640	No, they don't.
3241640	3242640	They're not going to do it.
3242640	3245160	They'll just show more Halo, you know, which is probably what they did.
3245160	3249440	Yeah, they did show a Halo and they showed some third party stuff.
3249440	3254400	One of the things I'm kind of surprised they didn't show anything for was Fable The Journey.
3254400	3258200	Not much other than announcing that it's going to be coming out fourth quarter.
3258200	3260120	They didn't really show anything.
3260120	3262360	That is interesting.
3262360	3266720	I was, you know, I was hardcore thinking there was going to be something with Windows 8.
3266720	3268720	And I guess I was wrong there.
3268720	3272720	The smart glass thing kind of is going to be, I get like a half point.
3272720	3277840	I think smart glass, well smart glass also supports, not only does it support tablet
3277840	3281220	because not, let's be honest, not everybody has a tablet or smartphone.
3281220	3284500	It also does support computers, like PCs and laptops.
3284500	3290580	So if you have a laptop, you can also control your Xbox, although I asked then why the fuck
3290580	3294920	do I need to, you know, view my content on the Xbox if I have my laptop in front of me,
3294920	3295920	but whatever.
3295920	3296920	Hey, it's another option.
3296920	3298400	Sometimes, you know, sometimes you have that party environment.
3298400	3302980	You want to show multiple people at once, like, you know, remember, remember that one
3302980	3306700	New Year's Eve party where we were looking up on the Wii.
3306700	3310480	We had to see the dinosaur porn or what was that?
3310480	3312200	The pterodactyl porno.
3312200	3314960	Thank you, Wii browser.
3314960	3316400	That's fantastic.
3316400	3322000	One of those websites, yes, it is, it was a chick and some dude in a pterodactyl suit
3322000	3324400	and it was the most hilarious thing.
3324400	3325400	Ridiculous.
3325400	3330640	Anyhow, from Microsoft to pterodactyl porn.
3330640	3333120	Let's go to the chatters, live.vognetwork.com.
3333120	3338320	A lot of props for South Park, Acidic Vampire says South Park looks great.
3338320	3339600	Stan says, I think it will be good.
3339600	3342280	The South Park creators are really involved in this game.
3342280	3346480	Tiger Claw says, I liked how Trey Parker and Matt Stone trolled the Microsoft press conference
3346480	3347800	when they showed up for their game.
3347800	3348800	That was fantastic.
3348800	3349800	Mm-hmm.
3349800	3351880	And Degenerate Johnny says, I'm calling it.
3351880	3355480	One of the South Park's DLC will be carbon's ass.
3355480	3357800	Could be ass of fire.
3357800	3361720	Well, they have, you know, it's very cool the way they're doing it.
3361720	3365120	The Lemmywinks or whatever that was.
3365120	3369920	They do have a Lemmywinks tie and one of the finishing or one of the summons you get is
3369920	3374520	Mr. Slave and Mr. Slave sucks the enemy into his ass.
3374520	3375520	Literally.
3375520	3379640	Well, that was, that was that whole Paris Hilton episode or whatever it was.
3379640	3380640	Yes.
3380640	3381640	It's basically that.
3381640	3383920	So, you know, nothing is off limits or sacred.
3383920	3387660	It's interesting, but it's kind of cool though because you get to play as your own character
3387660	3388660	in there.
3388660	3391320	So you design your own character and that's kind of neat.
3391320	3392680	Let me ask Dark Sakura.
3392680	3397240	I know you're the classic gamer of the bunch, but is there anything on the Microsoft press
3397240	3399080	conference that has you excited at all?
3399080	3403080	Any halos or South Park's or no.
3403080	3408160	I mean Halo 4, I guess Dan's going to get it, you know, cause he's Mr. Halo of the house,
3408160	3409480	but I don't give a crap about South Park.
3409480	3412800	What about the Tomb Raider reboot cause I don't like Tomb Raider.
3412800	3413800	But it's a reboot.
3413800	3414800	You never know.
3414800	3415800	But I don't like Tomb Raider.
3415800	3416840	I'm still looking forward to that.
3416840	3422000	Although the delay, you know, having to see it two years in a row is a little bit like,
3422000	3426320	but I suppose not the, it's not the first game that won't be the last that gets shown
3426320	3427320	across multiple years.
3427320	3431320	Unless I can lock the butler in the fridge and break her neck.
3431320	3432320	I'm not interested.
3432320	3435840	It's technically a prequel, so I don't think there's a butler.
3435840	3436920	You crash on an island.
3436920	3438440	It's uncharted Tomb Raider.
3438440	3441060	I don't like uncharted anyway, so.
3441060	3442060	It looks good.
3442060	3443060	Go for it.
3443060	3444400	I mean, it looks good.
3444400	3446400	I'm glad they showed it again.
3446400	3447400	Yeah.
3447400	3448400	Cause you kind of forget about it.
3448400	3456280	Okay, so next was Nintendo, and Nintendo, gotta love them, but I don't understand how
3456280	3459080	they're able to pull something like this off.
3459080	3462360	They had three press conferences, cause one was not enough.
3462360	3466560	They had a conference that was a pre-E3 conference that talked a little bit about the Wii U.
3466560	3470360	Then they had their regular conference, which talked mostly about the Wii U, and then they
3470360	3475300	had a 3DS conference the following day.
3475300	3478760	You have three press conferences, and yet you still don't show a lot of shit.
3478760	3481080	I just don't understand how that works.
3481080	3485120	But okay, so let's start off with the pre-press conference thing that they had, or pre-E3
3485120	3486120	press conference.
3486120	3492460	They talked some of the key features of the Wii U, and including this brand new interface,
3492460	3493460	I guess.
3493460	3497400	It's gonna be the Miiverse, and what Miiverse is, it's kind of an upgrade of the Mi Plaza.
3497400	3504320	You basically see all your Mi's congregating Mi's from friends, Mi's of people playing
3504320	3507660	different games, and you see them playing the different games, and plus you can talk
3507660	3512120	to each other, not only in text chat, but you can picto chat with them as well.
3512120	3514080	So it's Facebook for me?
3514080	3515080	Something like that.
3515080	3520000	You basically can interact with people in a really elaborate way.
3520000	3526120	They've got, you know, I guess spoiler stuff that you can do in there where you can make
3526120	3529520	it so that people don't see your post, don't want to get spoiled on the game, but they
3529520	3534360	have this whole kind of, like you can post in different spots in games and stuff, like
3534360	3538640	for example, oh, I'm having trouble in this area in the game, can anybody help me?
3538640	3542000	And then like, you know, hey, I got through this part of the game like this.
3542000	3547360	That's great and all, but I mean, that's kind of like what Game Facts is for, or something
3547360	3548360	like that.
3548360	3552200	I just, I guess it's neat that they have this feature and that they showed all this stuff,
3552200	3555640	but I don't know, whatever.
3555640	3560040	One of the other things they are showing off also is a brand new controller for the Wii
3560040	3565960	U, the Wii U Pro Controller, which looks like an Xbox 360 controller with the analog stick
3565960	3569920	and the face buttons flip flopped.
3569920	3571480	Cool.
3571480	3577480	I guess that'll be used also in conjunction with, you know, the Wii Pad and stuff if you
3577480	3582000	want to play like regular games instead of using the Wii Remote, although it will support
3582000	3587280	a Wii Remote and all the Wii accessories as well.
3587280	3588280	So that's kind of neat.
3588280	3591840	And then of course, you know, they talked about some of the revisions to the Wii Pad
3591840	3595280	is what they're calling it now, the Wii Game Pad.
3595280	3602140	And basically, you know, the mysterious buttons that were shown there, the one below the directional
3602140	3606200	pad is the near field communication thing, which is weird because I thought it would
3606200	3607640	be like on the screen.
3607640	3611920	It seems to make more sense to me, but I guess they had to put it on the side or something.
3611920	3614720	So they have a TV button on there.
3614720	3621880	What the TV button is for is for actually using the tablet as a remote for your TV,
3621880	3622880	like a universal remote.
3622880	3628000	You can actually launch the system and everything from the pad before you even turn the system
3628000	3632160	on you or you can just switch the channel on your TV.
3632160	3634360	I could do that with my Xbox controller.
3634360	3636360	Good question from She-Hulk in our chat room.
3636360	3637480	And I didn't catch this either.
3637480	3639860	No Blu-ray or DVD for the Wii U?
3639860	3642240	They didn't say what they're using.
3642240	3643240	Huh.
3643240	3644240	Interesting.
3644240	3645240	OK.
3645240	3647680	They didn't say what kind of discs they're using.
3647680	3654080	Maybe they feel it's not needed because I noticed Reggie did emphasize, and the way
3654080	3656240	he said it too is very interesting.
3656240	3663280	He said, you know, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, it's there.
3663280	3664600	You know, he's like, it's all there.
3664600	3668200	Yes, of course it's there, but we want you to experience Miiverse, you know, it's kind
3668200	3669200	of interesting.
3669200	3673680	Well, let's talk about stuff that people aren't going to care about, and let's talk more in
3673680	3676000	great detail about something else.
3676000	3679800	But to his credit, what else are you going to say about Netflix and Amazon and Hulu?
3679800	3681920	Everybody knows that stuff already, you know?
3681920	3682920	They're there.
3682920	3683920	Yay!
3683920	3685520	That's really all there is to say.
3685520	3686520	Yeah.
3686520	3688520	You rhymed.
3688520	3691640	Rama in our chat room says Wii U will support Blu-ray storage.
3691640	3692640	OK.
3692640	3696760	Well, I haven't seen anything yet, but I would assume it's Blu-ray unless they're going to
3696760	3700160	have their own proprietary format, which, you know, whatever.
3700160	3705000	One, of course, the big game, the first game that they unveiled was Pikmin 3.
3705000	3709480	You know, something that has been rumored to be coming to the Wii or the Wii U at some
3709480	3715120	point, and it is a launch title, so they showed off Pikmin 3, and it looks pretty, except
3715120	3719120	I don't care about Pikmin, so, you know, whatever.
3719120	3723220	And as you mentioned, you know, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Instant Video
3723220	3727720	coming to the Wii U, hopefully at launch, because they like to announce things that
3727720	3729960	aren't necessarily going to be ready.
3729960	3735480	Scribblenauts Unlimited was another game that they showed off that's pretty awesome.
3735480	3742600	It does use the tablet, so you can actually create your own words in this, so that's kind
3742600	3743600	of cool.
3743600	3747280	That's the neat feature there, and it can be played exclusively on the tablet if you
3747280	3748280	want.
3748280	3752720	And then they announced some stuff from Namco, which I honestly have never heard of before
3752720	3758080	today, but Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tank Tank Tank, where did that come from?
3758080	3760200	I'm getting a Wii U.
3760200	3761920	I did not hear these rumors.
3761920	3765360	I would have never heard them on our show.
3765360	3768880	We would never have, you know, known about that a few weeks ago.
3768880	3769880	Yeah.
3769880	3774960	And then of course, a surprise, they're trying to Director's Cut coming to the Wii U, which
3774960	3775960	is neat.
3775960	3780760	Now, I might have missed this because I was playing in a home over there for a second
3780760	3785320	checking out the awesome backyard that Blender built for the clubhouse, but Mass Effect 3,
3785320	3786320	Wii U?
3786320	3787600	Mass Effect 3 is turned to the Wii U.
3787600	3791960	Which has a lot of us kind of wondering, how is that going to work, because, I mean, you
3791960	3792960	can't...
3792960	3795480	Maybe you target on your little monitor.
3795480	3800280	Well, yeah, no, that part I figure maybe the biotics and the gun stuff is on the monitor
3800280	3804380	or whatever, but I'm kind of like, how can you just skip Mass Effect 2?
3804380	3808080	Like Mass Effect 1, I can see people skipping, although I don't recommend it.
3808080	3811100	I could see you skipping that, but you can't skip Mass Effect 2.
3811100	3812480	You can't.
3812480	3817120	So Mass Effect 3 is going to have to really have something special to separate it from
3817120	3819660	the other versions to get me to want to buy it.
3819660	3822400	Although Mass Effect 3 does have a pretty awesome multiplayer, so it'll be interesting
3822400	3825440	to see if that's pulled off as well on the Nintendo system.
3825440	3830480	Plus, microtransaction hell, again, I wonder if that's going to be pulled off as seamlessly
3830480	3831480	on the Wii U.
3831480	3832800	They must think so.
3832800	3837160	So I think that tells us a lot right there about Nintendo's online structure.
3837160	3840000	If EA's willing to put Mass Effect 3 on it.
3840000	3845760	Another title that they announced was Sing, which is being developed by the DJ Hero developers,
3845760	3851200	and Sing is your generic karaoke game with the words on the Wii pad.
3851200	3853200	Whoopty shit.
3853200	3855740	That's what I have to say about that.
3855740	3859400	And admit it, Call Me Maybe was stuck in your head all week long after that, and it's the
3859400	3860400	number one song on iTunes.
3860400	3861400	Nope.
3861400	3862400	It was not.
3862400	3863400	Honestly.
3863400	3865400	I've never heard of that before.
3865400	3867680	I would play it for you, but you'd slap me.
3867680	3868680	Is it that bad?
3868680	3869680	It's pretty bad.
3869680	3873320	3DS stuff, they talked a little bit about Paper Mario, that's supposed to be coming
3873320	3876400	out this season, holiday season.
3876400	3881560	New Super Mario Brothers 2, which is headed to the 3DS on August 19th.
3881560	3888000	Also Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon for the 3DS this holiday.
3888000	3895060	They of course announced, I thought it was going to be New Super Mario Brothers Me, oh,
3895060	3901680	but they had to trump me, and it's now called New Super Mario Brothers U, which is announced,
3901680	3904200	and it will have multiplayer games.
3904200	3905200	Gotcha.
3905200	3906200	Oh!
3906200	3907200	Nintendo.
3907200	3908840	And so they have that coming.
3908840	3914000	Batman Arkham City Armored Edition is headed to the Wii U, and basically the Game of the
3914000	3919120	Year edition with some extra bells and whistles in there.
3919120	3920120	Let's see.
3920120	3922800	I just want to say real quick, because some of the folks in the chat room are commenting,
3922800	3926640	we're about a minute lagged from when we say things to when they get encoded and people
3926640	3927640	hear them.
3927640	3930360	So people in chat right now are talking about Mass Effect 3.
3930360	3935300	Acidic Vampire says, no Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the Wii U equals fail.
3935300	3938820	And Act Deft reminds us, PlayStation 3 skipped Mass Effect 1.
3938820	3941640	But again, I'm saying Mass Effect 1 is okay to skip.
3941640	3942640	I don't recommend it, but it's okay.
3942640	3945760	But they had though, to be fair, they had a motion comic.
3945760	3949000	Yes, and What Up G reminds us that they did have that bridge.
3949000	3953080	So Technus says Bioware will just do another interactive graphic comic.
3953080	3955580	And that's certainly kind of the likely thing.
3955580	3960620	Now Dark Tetsuya linked us in chat to the story on MyNintendoNews that mentions that
3960620	3964880	Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back, which I guess is what they're calling the Wii U version,
3964880	3969920	will include an enhanced storyline from the original game on PlayStation, oh no, this
3969920	3972800	says PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3972800	3977540	I think he got the stuff mixed up, because I was going to say Take Earth Back I heard
3977540	3983160	was a DLC expansion that's possibly coming in the future.
3983160	3986000	So never mind, I guess that's not about the Wii U.
3986000	3987660	That's what I get for trying to do stories live.
3987660	3991920	And of course, and I'm surprised that they did this, because I didn't think it's that
3991920	3998360	popular anymore, but I guess it is, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no, it said the original game,
3998360	4002720	so this is about the Wii U version, it's the original game on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
4002720	4003720	and PC.
4003720	4006400	Sorry, I'm just, I'm seeing this for the first time, so I'm trying to process this myself
4006400	4007400	here.
4007400	4010360	Because it hasn't spoken about the enhanced content, and they're saying hopefully it's
4010360	4012720	not just going to be the reworked ending.
4012720	4016960	But I had heard a rumor previously that Take Earth Back was supposed to be some type of
4016960	4021480	expansion for the multiplayer game that had more maps, and more human classes.
4021480	4024760	It's just probably the game of the year edition of Mass Effect 3 is what they're getting.
4024760	4029800	And I mean, that's pretty much what it is, and with some extra bells and whistles, that's,
4029800	4031880	that is a lot of their launch line up.
4031880	4032880	Whatever.
4032880	4033880	Anyhow, move on.
4033880	4039560	So then of course, you know, there was also talk, well they announced also Wii Fit U,
4039560	4043880	which is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, and they showed that it had like a pedometer
4043880	4049840	attachment that's available as well, so you'll be able to interact with that.
4049840	4054320	And then also, you know, some of these Wii U games, they showed that you can play them
4054320	4060680	without actually having the system on the TV, so you can exercise and stuff like that
4060680	4065960	without looking at the TV, I don't know, it just looks stupid if you're working with the
4065960	4073320	Wii Fit balance board and Wii U tablet, I mean just, come on, it's just, whatever.
4073320	4077840	And then finally also, the Wii U will support two different Wii gamepads, however there
4077840	4082560	will be a hit in frames per second, it will actually be halved, so the upper limit will
4082560	4089920	be 30 frames per second on both Wii U tablets, which, eh, whatever.
4089920	4098440	Finally, I guess, you know the big thing for me with the Wii U, oh, oh, I forgot my most
4098440	4105920	favorite one unveiled that they had, Lego City Stories, which is now Lego City Undercover,
4105920	4111040	is coming to the 3DS and the Wii U, and it looks pretty awesome.
4111040	4114600	I think it's a different developer now, because before it looked like Grand Theft Auto, it
4114600	4118240	still has that kind of sandbox thing to it, but it definitely doesn't look like Grand
4118240	4123480	Theft Auto anymore, but it looks pretty amazing, definitely one of the launch games to have
4123480	4124720	on that.
4124720	4130340	However, it doesn't sell me a system, and I still am worried that they didn't talk enough
4130340	4133360	about what their online plan is.
4133360	4137560	Yeah, we know about Miiverse and I can talk with people, leave them little notes about
4137560	4143700	shit in-game, but that doesn't tell me what your infrastructure is, or how you're playing
4143700	4145440	to do all this stuff.
4145440	4151320	You know, in the games that they announced for launch, half of them are stuff that's
4151320	4152320	already been out.
4152320	4160960	You have Ninja Gaiden 3, you've got Batman Arkham City, and Darksiders 2, which are going
4160960	4164840	to have already been out for a few months by the time the system launches.
4164840	4172000	You know, Assassin's Creed 3 looks pretty cool, but why should I buy another system
4172000	4176040	to play a game that I can already play on my system right now, and it will look pretty
4176040	4181840	much the same, but it's going to have a few extra gimmicks with it, with this new controller.
4181840	4184180	That's the problem that doesn't sell me on this stuff.
4184180	4189040	For the Wii, for the people that own a Wii, yes, it's a great upgrade to the system that
4189040	4194760	you already have, but you can also get that same kind of upgrade with an Xbox or PlayStation
4194760	4196560	3.
4196560	4197560	That's the problem I have.
4197560	4201960	There's just not a lot to launch, you know, the lineup is not that great for me.
4201960	4204000	Also, new Super Mario Brothers U.
4204000	4205600	You mean you don't want Nintendo Land?
4205600	4208240	Oh yeah, how am I forgetting about Nintendo Land?
4208240	4209240	Nintendo Land.
4209240	4210240	I was going to say, I haven't heard of Nintendo Land yet.
4210240	4211240	Nintendo Land.
4211240	4214080	Um, basically the Wii Sports Wii Play, whatever, Tech Demo Land.
4214080	4219400	The giant cocktease land, because there's my F-Zero, did you see that?
4219400	4223960	It is basically Tech Demo Land, that is what it is, it's their fucking spinning tech demos
4223960	4224960	together.
4224960	4225960	Well.
4225960	4228080	I will bet you anything that will be a fucking packing game.
4228080	4229240	It has to be.
4229240	4230840	What was Wii Sports?
4230840	4231960	What was Wii Sports?
4231960	4233640	It was Tech Demo Land.
4233640	4234840	And it was the pack-in game.
4234840	4236920	So of course Nintendo Land is the pack-in game.
4236920	4241440	They might not necessarily have a pack-in game, but I think it might be the pack-in
4241440	4242440	game.
4242440	4243440	Which is great.
4243440	4247480	Maybe they'll have two, they might have two SKUs where one is the, kind of like, remember
4247480	4251360	the old old school NES, how they actually had three versions of that when that first
4251360	4252360	came out.
4252360	4255700	There was the robot pack that came with Rob the Robot and like Gyromite.
4255700	4259800	And then there was the action pack that came with the Zapper and Super Mario Brothers Duck
4259800	4260800	Hunt.
4260800	4264040	And then there was the vanilla ass pack, I don't remember what it was called.
4264040	4265040	The core.
4265040	4266040	The core?
4266040	4267040	Did they call things core back then?
4267040	4268040	I think it was called the core system.
4268040	4269040	Hmm.
4269040	4271880	Well whatever, it was just the NES and Super Mario Brothers basically.
4271880	4276680	So I wonder if the Wii U won't launch with a similar type of thing where you could have
4276680	4282680	just the plain Jane system or you get the extra, maybe the extra Wii U controllers since
4282680	4284640	we hear that they will support two players.
4284640	4288240	Yeah, here's the thing though, they're gonna support two players, but not any of the launch
4288240	4291520	titles are gonna support two players on those pads.
4291520	4296360	So it's something that's coming way down the line.
4296360	4302080	But I'm sorry, it just doesn't, you have a brand new system that you're launching and
4302080	4307560	then you, like your Mario game, New Super Mario Brothers U, don't get me wrong, New
4307560	4309640	Super Mario Brothers is probably an awesome game.
4309640	4314440	I didn't play much of the first game, but you know what, I played New Super Mario Brothers
4314440	4316160	on the DS and it was great.
4316160	4317560	It was a great game.
4317560	4322380	And I'm sure Wii, New Super Mario Brothers was pretty awesome.
4322380	4326320	And then you've got New Super Mario Brothers for the 3DS, New Super Mario Brothers 2.
4326320	4329340	And now you have New Super Mario Brothers U.
4329340	4331120	The problem is, that game looks last gen.
4331120	4333240	And that game looks like a Wii game.
4333240	4337680	And yes, I know, you know, it's a great game and you're launching it on the system, but
4337680	4342960	you, I think you need, if you want to show off this game, this system, you need to like
4342960	4348660	come out with something big, like a Super Mario Galaxy type of game or a Mario 64.
4348660	4353200	Something like, holy shit, I did not expect to see Mario like that instead of, hey look,
4353200	4355880	it's slightly prettier New Super Mario Brothers.
4355880	4359120	It just doesn't look good.
4359120	4364440	As much as I, like, I do want that Mario Brothers Wii U game, but I'm not sure I'm totally sold
4364440	4365840	on this system yet.
4365840	4368800	But just to be devil's advocate for a minute, doesn't Pikmin 3 kind of show off some of
4368800	4370320	those capabilities a little better?
4370320	4371320	Tank.
4371320	4372320	Yeah, but Pikmin.
4372320	4376080	Pikmin 3 is not a game I think that's going to appeal to everybody.
4376080	4381080	I don't think it, Pikmin doesn't have, it has a following, but it doesn't have a huge
4381080	4382080	following.
4382080	4383080	It's a niche game.
4383080	4384080	Let's be honest, it's a niche game.
4384080	4385840	It didn't sell that great.
4385840	4387320	It's not a Super Mario Brothers.
4387320	4390560	Rama's reminding me of a couple other Nintendo packs that I forgot earlier.
4390560	4392960	There was the Power Pack when the Power Pad came out.
4392960	4393960	That was later.
4393960	4396440	But yeah, the MarioBrothers.com world class track meet.
4396440	4399240	And he says that there was one that was Hogan's Alley in Duck Hunt.
4399240	4402600	I don't remember Hogan's Alley ever being a pack-in game, but maybe it was like, it
4402600	4404680	wasn't very well distributed.
4404680	4408280	I remember Hogan's Alley as a launch game, and that would make sense as like a zapper
4408280	4411240	pack or something, but anyway.
4411240	4414000	Orange Launch Radio reporting the news from 25 years ago.
4414000	4419180	But I mean, that's just my problem though, is they don't have, there's still a lot of
4419180	4421040	information that we need from Nintendo.
4421040	4423600	A price and a date, for God's sake.
4423600	4425920	Well, but they did that with the Wii.
4425920	4430320	They came out later around Tokyo Game Show time, because they don't do Tokyo Game Show,
4430320	4433840	but they'll do their own little thing, and that's when they'll announce it.
4433840	4437240	Well, cool, but I need to know more about the system.
4437240	4439840	And right now, as it stands, I'm not buying one.
4439840	4441760	I'm not even buying one near launch.
4441760	4443320	I just, I don't want it.
4443320	4444320	I don't...
4444320	4450440	I'm kind of with you, but the price will, I mean, A, the price, and B, my disposable
4450440	4454040	income, which I may or may not have at that end of the year, will really factor into my
4454040	4455040	decision.
4455040	4459560	One other thing too is just, I don't, I learned my lesson with the Wii.
4459560	4463680	The Wii was awesome, I had fun, but see, the Wii compared to what was already currently
4463680	4466480	available was very, very different.
4466480	4470960	This is just, hey look, I have a traditional controller with a goddamn screen on it.
4470960	4472880	Here's my problem with it.
4472880	4475400	You know all these cool things that you're talking about with that controller?
4475400	4476400	Well guess what?
4476400	4481620	You've had two screens for fucking years now with the DS, and how many really truly unique
4481620	4483520	games have you seen come out of it?
4483520	4484520	Probably a handful.
4484520	4485880	You can count them on one hand.
4485880	4491040	Of games that are really using both screens, just in an amazing way.
4491040	4497520	But I don't think we're gonna get a lot of these really big games, because you just,
4497520	4501240	I mean you've had time to do something unique with this, and you're just not gonna use these
4501240	4502240	two screens.
4502240	4503240	It's gonna be a gimmick.
4503240	4507280	I will say this though to Nintendo's credit, is that even though the Wii U lineup left
4507280	4511320	me feeling, and I think a lot of us feeling a little, eh, especially when they ended with
4511320	4513760	Nintendo Land, I think that was a big, eh.
4513760	4514760	Oh, yeah.
4514760	4515760	That was just kinda, that's it?
4515760	4516760	Yeah, that was too bad.
4516760	4518760	There was no Zelda or something?
4518760	4523000	But, the 3DS lineup looked great.
4523000	4524000	I gotta say.
4524000	4527160	That new, you know, the Golden Coins Mario game looked great.
4527160	4530440	The Castlevania game especially looked great.
4530440	4535320	So I feel like the 3DS, I kinda wish they'd shown, I mean I realize they did that whole
4535320	4538680	second press conference where they showed more, but I was kinda hoping for a little
4538680	4542400	more at the big show, because there's a lot of good stuff going on in the 3DS.
4542400	4544160	Was there something that was missing?
4544160	4545560	The redesign of the 3DS?
4545560	4548840	Well, that too, but, Animal Crossing.
4548840	4549840	No Animal Crossing.
4549840	4551640	It was missing, wasn't it?
4551640	4552640	Delayed.
4552640	4554440	Don't think it's coming out this year.
4554440	4555600	Delayed!
4555600	4556600	Not coming out this year.
4556600	4557600	Swept under the rug.
4557600	4558600	Delayed.
4558600	4559600	I betcha.
4559600	4560760	I, you know what, I guarantee that's not coming out this year.
4560760	4565400	Too many, there's too many games that they have first party that are coming out that
4565400	4566400	they won't put out this year.
4566400	4567600	It's not ready.
4567600	4571360	I think the Wii U might end up suffering a little bit like the 3DS did.
4571360	4574440	Not a strong enough launch, and next year they cut the price.
4574440	4581500	It is a very, I gotta say, I mean, you're gonna have a hard time selling somebody on,
4581500	4586640	let's just, you know, an average parent or whatever, okay, I can buy this system now,
4586640	4589720	well who knows what the Wii's gonna be, you know, dropping down to, I mean, let's say
4589720	4597200	it goes down to, you know, 99 bucks or something, oh man, 99 dollar Wii, that'd be crazy, but,
4597200	4600800	you know, you've got the Wii system right now, and I can buy new Super Mario Brothers,
4600800	4605360	and it's pretty awesome, I mean, the people aren't gonna know, oh hey, oh that's the Wii
4605360	4611200	U version, you know, and honestly, the Wii U stuff, aside from, oh cool, I, you know,
4611200	4617640	I can play on my Wii pad or whatever when, um, you know, someone's on the TV, fuck, that's
4617640	4620000	not how you're supposed to be selling your system.
4620000	4623800	You're not supposed to be selling your system, hey, when someone wants to watch TV, you can
4623800	4629000	play your game system on this pad, no, you're supposed to say, hey, when someone's playing
4629000	4633800	something on the TV, you bop out your fucking 3DS and you play New Super Mario Brothers
4633800	4637960	2 on there, that's how you fucking solve that situation, you sell them on the portable system
4637960	4641560	and the regular system, you don't say, hey, you don't fucking need the portable system
4641560	4646280	because, hey, you got the stupid tablet now, they're fucking stupid, I mean, it's just
4646280	4647280	dumb.
4647280	4651160	Let's, we're at an hour 18, so, before we move on this, let me read some comments from
4651160	4656400	chat on this whole thing, um, Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, at, um, vognetwork.com
4656400	4660920	live chat says, I would like a new platformer of Black Tiger for the Wii U and that would
4660920	4665480	help convince me to buy one, I have the PlayStation 2 compilation pack with Black Tiger and Dungeon
4665480	4669080	Buster chimes in saying, I'd snatch one up day one if it had something like that, everybody's
4669080	4672560	got their dream game, you know, I've been sitting here saying F-Zero, F-Zero, F-Zero,
4672560	4676960	god damn it, F-Zero, you know, everybody's got their game that they want to have, um,
4676960	4682040	let's see, uh, Acidic Vampire says, screw a 3DS Castlevania, give me a next gen Castlevania
4682040	4687080	a la Symphony of the Night, amen to that, shadow next gen, who is at the show, chimes
4687080	4696600	in, most of the Wii U titles shown at E3 are launch titles, so, no, no, no, no, no, true,
4696600	4702960	true and not true, launch window titles, no, I'm serious, they're not launch day titles,
4702960	4707720	they're launch window and that's, and although what he's saying is mostly true, Nintendo
4707720	4713400	doesn't, I mean, Nintendo certainly doesn't project, let's say, quite as badly as Sony,
4713400	4721160	Last Guardian, or Microsoft, Halo 4 last year and Tomb Raider, do, but, Nintendo did, really,
4721160	4727240	troll us, what, really, they, they don't project, not as bad, I'm not saying, but I will, I
4727240	4732480	am saying, Nintendo did do that whole Smash Brothers thing last year, and we know that
4732480	4737640	that's a good three years away, but, but, but, but, they didn't show anything, and they
4737640	4742800	said, we're announcing it, it'll come out eventually, ooh, Rob, Raginator's calling
4742800	4750920	on you, what, why, what, F-Zero is overrated, get out, someone smack him with a fish, is
4750920	4753460	he in the home, is he in the home, cause I'm gonna go bop him in the head and Sony home
4753460	4759900	right now, I'm on the hunt, where's Raginator, I'm gonna go smack him, meanwhile, speaking
4759900	4767160	of Sony, let's talk a little bit about Sony, Sony had some pretty interesting things, they
4767160	4775800	came out talking about, you know, their Sony mascot Battle Royale, Sony All Stars Battle
4775800	4780620	Royale game, did announce two new characters for it, and kind of confirming that there
4780620	4785700	are gonna be some third party characters in there, they announced Big Daddy's gonna be
4785700	4791080	one of the playable characters, and also Nathan Drake, which is kind of a duh, but those are
4791080	4799360	gonna be available as well, I'm sure they've got a lot more to unveil there, they did talk
4799360	4811080	a little bit about some interesting ideas, I guess, one of them was this, I don't even
4811080	4817600	know why, a Wonder Book, it kind of makes me wonder why they would come out with this,
4817600	4824440	Wonder Book is basically this paper book that has AR tags in it, and it interacts with,
4824440	4828440	not necessarily, well the move, it does interact with that, but it interacts with the Playstation
4828440	4835600	I, and it's supposed to make reading more like TV, and one of the first games, if you
4835600	4842400	will, that's gonna use it is JK Rowling's Book of Spells, and you know, they're kind
4842400	4849320	of selling it on, oh hey, she wrote it, and it's all this all new stuff, and hey, check
4849320	4855880	it out, it's pretty sweet, it was pretty fucking boring, it was probably the worst thing that
4855880	4856880	they had of their whole.
4856880	4861300	Here's the thing though, now keep in mind, we weren't watching the press conference,
4861300	4865760	we were only reading the tweets, because we were in line for Indiana Jones, or something
4865760	4872800	at the time, so while you guys were kind of like seeing that, and I guess bored with the
4872800	4877480	presentation, those of us were kind of reading about it, and we actually sat there going,
4877480	4882480	that is a brilliant move by Sony, because the part there that you glossed over that
4882480	4889080	I think is crucial, they have fucking JK Rowling in their back pocket now, don't underestimate
4889080	4894440	the power of that woman, Pottermore ain't that great either, Pottermore is actually
4894440	4899580	pretty neat, and people, but I suck at mixing spells, MC people, there's a lot of people
4899580	4910400	going crazy over it, Pottermore is also very age broad, true, I just think, I think there's
4910400	4914920	a lot more to this, especially with the whole, you know, Sony does have a family friendly
4914920	4918640	thing that they need to try to get a little bit of that Nintendo audience, and I think
4918640	4923000	the Wonder Book is a way to kind of push that, don't underestimate it, that's all I'm saying,
4923000	4927800	you know what, I understand where you're coming from there, but it's, you're asking someone
4927800	4932120	to purchase, if they don't own a Playstation 3, you're asking them to purchase a Playstation
4932120	4938440	3, a Playstation Move set up, and then this Wonder Book on top of it, like a $400 investment
4938440	4942960	for a fucking lame ass looking game, but, I keep saying Wonder Book and I think of Super
4942960	4948120	Book, but, right, what if you're the soccer mom sitting there deciding which one of those
4948120	4953660	three systems to put under the tree at Christmas, the Playstation 3, the 360, or the Wii U,
4953660	4959240	and you've got a decision to make, one of them has JK Rowling in it, oh, well, I enjoy
4959240	4964800	the Harry Potter books myself, being a soccer mom, I might buy that one instead.
4964800	4968160	Well, you know what, that's fine, because at least they'll be disappointed and they'll
4968160	4973520	still have a capable gaming system when they're done wasting their time with Book of Spells,
4973520	4984440	but honestly, I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but to buy that for that specific thing,
4984440	4989680	it looks terrible, it looks fucking terrible, and if you think about it, Rob, they also
4989680	4993840	have Harry Potter for Kinect, so if you want to go that bullshit route of, well, they have
4993840	4997960	JK Rowling to this Book of Things, yeah, I could read a fucking book and pretend to do
4997960	5000360	magic or I could become fucking Harry Potter!
5000360	5001360	Alright.
5001360	5003400	I think becoming Harry Potter wins!
5003400	5004400	Fine, you made your point.
5004400	5008640	I'm in fucking Hogwarts, my creepy face is on that stupid avatar!
5008640	5014200	Fine, you made your point, let's move on, we're spending more time talking about Wonder
5014200	5015880	Book than they did at the conference.
5015880	5019540	So anyways, other things that they talked about besides Wonder Book, of course, a lot
5019540	5024120	of cool stuff for Playstation Plus, Playstation Plus, as we mentioned, you're gonna get a
5024120	5028120	lot of free content, and they announced, you know, the Playstation Plus members are gonna
5028120	5034960	get 12 new games starting this month, and of course, you know, full free games, if you're
5034960	5039520	a subscriber of Playstation Plus, and they're gonna be adding more as time goes on.
5039520	5044560	Also, Playstation 1 classics are coming back to the Vita, no duh there, that's kind of,
5044560	5049240	you know, been leaked out already, and they're gonna slowly roll those out, starting with
5049240	5056520	I think Final Fantasy VII, and maybe Tomb Raider, some other stuff.
5056520	5057520	That's pretty amazing.
5057520	5064080	Also, some Vita titles, um, not a whole lot of, like, first-party Vita titles that are
5064080	5066640	gonna be coming out for, you know, the, um...
5066640	5069800	I was also shocked at the lack of Vita.
5069800	5073800	It was basically, I mean, all the stuff that was coming out this fall is pretty much stuff
5073800	5074800	we already knew about.
5074800	5079600	I mean, you know, LittleBigPlanet carding, and, um, LittleBigPlanet.
5079600	5082880	To be fair, some of that may show up at Tokyo Game Show.
5082880	5086920	After all, Sony is a Japanese company, some of that may be in their back pocket for Tokyo
5086920	5087920	Game Show.
5087920	5089320	At least, I hope to hell that's what happens.
5089320	5094960	Um, and then of course, also, um, you know, there's the Playstation, um, you know, All
5094960	5097640	Stars Battle Royale, which is gonna be on the Vita as well.
5097640	5099200	Um, another pretty cool thing...
5099200	5103280	I gotta say this, Shadownextgen in our chatroom says, where is the Vita price drop?
5103280	5104720	That was made up by the internet.
5104720	5108640	I don't, I think people assume just because the 3DS had a price drop, the Vita was gonna
5108640	5109640	get one too.
5109640	5112680	It's too soon, they're not gonna announce a price drop yet.
5112680	5117040	Yeah, I kind of agree, and I think the tech in the Vita, it would be a bigger loss to
5117040	5118880	Sony to do something like that.
5118880	5122840	They're not gonna, first off, they're not gonna announce, I mean, a price drop three
5122840	5125800	months after it's come out, that's gonna be like, oh, yeah, we failed.
5125800	5127480	I mean, they're not gonna do that.
5127480	5130520	They're not gonna also, I mean, they're not gonna announce, hey, we're gonna drop the
5130520	5132920	price in, uh, October.
5132920	5139320	That being said, however, now that they've kind of ignored it at this show, now they
5139320	5142240	might have painted themselves in a corner to have to do that.
5142240	5145120	Tokyo Game Show is gonna be critical to the future of the Vita.
5145120	5146120	Believe it.
5146120	5150960	Um, they did talk about, you know, some games that are kind of a big does, um, Call of Duty
5150960	5156640	Black Ops Declassified, not necessarily gonna be the same Black Ops 2 game, so, it's a little
5156640	5162280	disappointing to me, but, I have to see what it is, and then Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation,
5162280	5167080	which is gonna be its own kind of unique game with its own character, which is kind of cool.
5167080	5170880	Um, that launches October 30th as well.
5170880	5178680	Um, and then, of course, you know, the big, big reveal that they had was the brand new,
5178680	5187560	um, was it, uh, Quadric Dream Game, which is Beyond Two Souls, and, um, just such an
5187560	5189640	amazing looking game.
5189640	5193520	Basically, kind of taking everything that you liked from Heavy Rain and just amping
5193520	5194520	it up.
5194520	5202680	Just the motion capture in it now is just ridiculous how well that looks, um, and, you
5202680	5208320	know, big name stars, you know, behind it as well, just, it's cool, I mean, definitely
5208320	5214800	gotta check it out, um, they have now, um, oh god, who's the fucking actress, I hate
5214800	5215800	myself.
5215800	5216800	Ellen Page.
5216800	5222720	Ellen Page, yes, Ellen Page is now, um, Juno, doing the mocap, and, uh, Kitty Pride.
5222720	5223720	That too.
5223720	5224720	Kitty Pride.
5224720	5228720	Doing the mocap and the, um, you know, the voice work for that game.
5228720	5230520	I saw the screens from it, it looks really good.
5230520	5235120	It's interesting, it's kind of like a supernatural, uh, Heavy Rain almost.
5235120	5239040	You've got, you know, you're playing as the spirit and you're also playing as her, and
5239040	5245160	so the spirit thing can, you know, interact with the environment and stuff, um, it's neat.
5245160	5248560	It looked, it looked pretty cool, and, you know, if you don't like the quick time events
5248560	5251880	stuff, then maybe not for you, but, um, you know, then you probably didn't like Heavy
5251880	5252880	Rain either.
5252880	5256160	So, uh, I, I need to go watch that trailer, I heard a lot of excitement about it.
5256160	5260120	Granted, I kind of miss the boat on Heavy Rain, but, yeah, definitely watch the demo
5260120	5261120	footage.
5261120	5262120	They have 20 minutes from the game, it looks awesome.
5262120	5263540	I'm gonna check it out, for sure.
5263540	5264540	Really cool.
5264540	5267920	But, uh, so overall Sony's conference, yeah, uh, it's pretty cool.
5267920	5268920	Oh, and one more thing.
5268920	5273460	Oh, Big Planet 2 is getting some DLC, um, that's gonna turn the Vita into a controller
5273460	5274460	for the game.
5274460	5275460	That's pretty cool.
5275460	5276460	That's cool.
5276460	5277460	That's very cool.
5277460	5278460	A lot of cross play stuff there.
5278460	5283200	I think, honestly, um, out of the three, I think they have the strongest, because they
5283200	5288400	showed off, um, this really amazing game, a new property for them, a new IP.
5288400	5291960	And then, of course, um, you know, they were showing off some of, like, the stuff that
5291960	5292960	they had.
5292960	5294320	Third party was pretty awesome.
5294320	5296840	It didn't seem like there was a lot that bored me too much.
5296840	5302080	Wonder Book was pretty eh, I mean, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like Nintendo's press
5302080	5305200	conference was just like, okay, when we get into the good stuff, when we get into the
5305200	5306200	good stuff, it's over?
5306200	5307200	It's over?
5307200	5311040	I mean, it's like, when are we getting to these, like, holy crap, holy crap, I need
5311040	5315640	to buy this system for this game, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool, and I mean.
5315640	5320480	I think next year's Nintendo's press conference, it better be anyway, it's gonna be a lot like
5320480	5322380	that one a couple years ago.
5322380	5325960	Remember that year, I think this was two years ago, where Reggie came out on stage and was
5325960	5333480	basically like, you want games, fine, here's some games, bam, bam, bam, bam, and he showed
5333480	5339880	like eight of them off in a row and he's like, there's all your fucking games, goodnight.
5339880	5343720	For real, like that, that's how we do it, but like, that's what he's gonna have to do
5343720	5344720	next year.
5344720	5347920	The problem with the Wii U thing was, they had like the three conferences, and it was
5347920	5352000	just like, we have to explain to you why the Wii U is important, fuck, I don't care, I
5352000	5356720	want to see the goddamn games, I'll figure it out by the game footage that you have.
5356720	5360200	You can explain to me later if I go, I don't understand why the game is cool, you know,
5360200	5362440	I just, I don't know, whatever.
5362440	5367120	Zappy in our chatroom says, Nintendo needs to learn the magic of one more thing, harness
5367120	5368120	the Steve Jobs.
5368120	5369120	Perhaps.
5369120	5371520	He did that with fucking Metroid, remember that?
5371520	5375160	One more thing, fucking Metroid games, like, that's awesome.
5375160	5380800	Metroid game by Team Ninja, that sounds awesome and will be okay when it comes out.
5380800	5386280	Alright, anyhow, was that, I think that might have been the same year, no, that was the
5386280	5387840	year before, I think.
5387840	5392000	It was the year that that Metroid game was actually coming out, that I think was the
5392000	5397320	year where Reggie was like, we got this, we got this, we got this, and if any of you fuckers
5397320	5400360	write that no games are coming out for the Wii, I will personally come to your house
5400360	5401360	and beat your ass.
5401360	5402360	At least, that's what I heard.
5402360	5405720	My body is ready to kick some ass.
5405720	5410680	Alright, quickly, the third party crest conferences, because we're already at that one and a half.
5410680	5415400	They didn't have that many this year, but Ubisoft did, sorry off of them, of course.
5415400	5420800	Konami had the online one that showed lots and lots of Metal Gear Rising, which, granted,
5420800	5424000	if you like violence, looks great.
5424000	5425000	It sounds cool.
5425000	5427080	I didn't watch that one, unfortunately.
5427080	5429840	Ubisoft, they had Just Dance 4, duh.
5429840	5434560	It is going to have some Wii U specific features, including a puppet master mode where you can
5434560	5436520	change up the dance moves on the fly.
5436520	5439840	Yeah, that's kind of fun if you're in a party environment, I guess.
5439840	5444000	Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth, which is coming to the Wii U, and Kinect.
5444000	5451560	Uh, and it also is supposed to be like, kind of, they said drawing from the Secret Invasion
5451560	5452560	universe.
5452560	5457440	It has like, Skrulls posing as superheroes and stuff, but it looks terrible.
5457440	5459480	The Secret Invasion thing was crap.
5459480	5461280	It looks fucking terrible.
5461280	5463580	It was even worse than Civil War.
5463580	5466640	The gameplay looks bad, just saying.
5466640	5471440	Um, and they have like the X-Men in there, so I don't understand how that's Avengers,
5471440	5472440	but whatever.
5472440	5476080	Never involved in Wolverines in every team in the Marvel universe, ever.
5476080	5477080	It's true.
5477080	5479080	Hey, he's gotta work.
5479080	5482680	He even powered up, he even hung out with Power Pack.
5482680	5486240	Hey, time for a total tangent where I derail the show.
5486240	5487960	I finally saw the Avengers this weekend.
5487960	5488960	Wasn't it good?
5488960	5489960	Did you stay for the whole thing?
5489960	5490960	It was pretty good.
5490960	5491960	The whole thing?
5491960	5498680	No, we thought once we saw the dude, we thought it was over, and then we realized in the car
5498680	5502560	on the way home, wasn't Jamie talking about a scene with Bla Bla Bla?
5502560	5505280	Oh, god damn it, there must have been more after the credits.
5505280	5512400	This is why you always, always, always, always, always stay through the entire credits of
5512400	5515480	a Marvel movie, because they will fuck with you.
5515480	5517200	One does not simply leave a movie.
5517200	5519640	Leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits.
5519640	5520640	Okay, I made a mistake.
5520640	5521640	It's on YouTube.
5521640	5525680	That means, that means, we're gonna go back and see it.
5525680	5530120	Rayman Legends was another game that they showed off, and that was the sequel to Rayman
5530120	5531640	Origins.
5531640	5532640	Pretty awesome.
5532640	5537080	It's gonna have five player co-op with the Wii U, and also the Pro Controller and Wiimote
5537080	5541320	are supported, and the gameplay looks just awesome.
5541320	5548000	Just really, really cool stuff that they've got going there with that, so very cool.
5548000	5552520	One of the games that I thought was a joke when they were showing it originally on the
5552520	5558000	Wii U pre-E3 conference, which was a zombie game that this really dorky guy was just kind
5558000	5562000	of being all cliche about, and like, I need help!
5562000	5563000	Help me, internet!
5563000	5565120	I need to know how to beat this boss!
5565120	5566120	I need to show him!
5566120	5568240	That commercial was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
5568240	5570440	But it's a real game.
5570440	5572360	Zombie U is the name of it.
5572360	5574240	It's a fucking stupid name.
5574240	5578560	It was originally Killer Freaks from Outer Space, which was gonna be a neat looking game
5578560	5583680	that had almost evil rabbits looking characters, but now it's a generic zombie shooter game.
5583680	5592960	But they're gonna have some interesting uses of the Wii controller, and honestly, to me,
5592960	5597200	this game looks like it's gonna be another Red Steel, which some people may like Red
5597200	5600920	Steel, but Red Steel ended up being one of those games that, hey, it looked pretty cool
5600920	5604160	at E3, and then when it came out, it was not very cool.
5604160	5607120	It was just kinda, ehhh.
5607120	5611520	But we'll see, I mean, zombie game, neat.
5611520	5620440	And then, of course, they talked a little bit about Far Cry 3, which, oh, that trailer
5620440	5622080	that they showed was a bit graphic.
5622080	5627640	It was boobies, hey, boobies, and apparently, you know, I know Bobby was talking a little
5627640	5632120	bit about it, how, and I even asked him, like, hey, were you watching this online, or were
5632120	5634480	you watching this on, like, Spike or G4 or something like that?
5634480	5637200	Did they censor those fuckin' tits on TV?
5637200	5638680	Nope, they did not.
5638680	5642960	So that's a little problem.
5642960	5648920	And Boobiesoft hashtag was launched from there.
5648920	5649920	And then, um.
5649920	5655960	By the way, I love Aisha Tyler, and I think it's great that she got to emcee, I think
5655960	5660200	she, it's funny, because what do her and Joel McHale have in common?
5660200	5663320	They've both hosted the soup on E.
5663320	5665280	Aisha Tyler was the host before.
5665280	5667600	So I love her, I think she's great.
5667600	5674040	She's got a podcast, too, Girl, I almost said Girl's Gone Wow, but that's not her show.
5674040	5675120	That's not her show.
5675120	5678400	It's Girl on Guy, I think is the name of the show, and it's pretty good.
5678400	5679400	Alan's a really big fan.
5679400	5682160	But she's actually a gamer, so that's kinda cool.
5682160	5685520	And she has a big lady boner for Halo.
5685520	5686520	I like her a lot.
5686520	5687520	She's funny.
5687520	5688520	I've met her.
5688520	5690240	I would love to have her on the show.
5690240	5694120	I know that will never happen, because she, like, does the talk on CBS.
5694120	5696480	But I would just love to chat with Aisha Tyler.
5696480	5697480	She was funny.
5697480	5699840	I met her in person once, but, um.
5699840	5702500	I don't know, it's.
5702500	5707000	She was not that annoying, but the other guy, oh my fucking god.
5707000	5708400	Why was he there?
5708400	5711780	He was so fucking annoying, and the banter was just annoying.
5711780	5715280	And then finally, they also, they were talking a little bit about their service that they've
5715280	5716280	got.
5716280	5721640	They have some free games that you can play, including, they've added Trials Evolution,
5721640	5726200	and Beyond Good and Evil HD, I Am Alive, and some more stuff to their free play service.
5726200	5730200	So that's pretty awesome that they've got that as well.
5730200	5734020	And last but not least, the big thing.
5734020	5738560	And they're kind of like a, you know, proponent of the, oh yeah.
5738560	5741160	And we got one more thing we have to show you.
5741160	5747480	So, um, their one more thing that they showed off was this game, a brand new IP called Watch
5747480	5749320	Dogs.
5749320	5750320	That game looked rad.
5750320	5751320	And it looks fantastic.
5751320	5752320	I did watch that.
5752320	5753320	That looked rad.
5753320	5754320	And you know what?
5754320	5759260	Most people were going around saying, Ubisoft won E3, I mean, whatever the hell that means.
5759260	5761440	You won, congratulations, you win an E3.
5761440	5762440	I think they did.
5762440	5767120	They based on that almost single-handedly, that.
5767120	5769100	It had more people talking than anything else.
5769100	5770180	That was an amazing game.
5770180	5776280	It's basically this kind of futuristic game where you play this guy who has, he's hijacked
5776280	5781560	control of this, it's in the future, it's Chicago, and basically this computer runs
5781560	5782560	the whole city.
5782560	5783560	Everything.
5783560	5787440	Every telephone networks, you know, street lights, you know, whatever.
5787440	5793080	He has this, almost like a magic phone that he can dial in and hack anything, you find
5793080	5797700	out information about people, and it's just this whole espionage, you know, stealth kind
5797700	5800800	of action game, and there's a shooter element in there as well.
5800800	5804520	And just the integration with your phone, it's supposed to, you know, kind of use the
5804520	5806820	smart glass stuff.
5806820	5807820	Really cool-looking thing.
5807820	5812360	Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Nintendo, but A, was that game announced for Wii U?
5812360	5813360	Nope.
5813360	5814360	Because I don't think it was.
5814360	5819000	And B, I think that's a real problem when more, that's a real problem when more people
5819000	5823400	are talking about somebody else's game that's not coming to your system more so than your
5823400	5825400	brand new system.
5825400	5826400	That is very bad.
5826400	5830720	Well, here's the other bad thing, too, is when you're thinking about it, it's technically
5830720	5836800	a system that is capable of graphics that are on these two other systems that have this
5836800	5841800	game, and it has a fucking tablet controller already that could support this stuff, and
5841800	5843940	yet it's not on your system.
5843940	5844940	So that's a problem.
5844940	5845940	However-
5845940	5850000	Yeah, I mean, to be fair, yet, we never know what might ultimately pan out before the launch.
5850000	5851000	Well, they keep insisting-
5851000	5852400	It may not be a launch window game.
5852400	5855280	Remember, Reggie was focusing on launch window games.
5855280	5856280	This may not be-
5856280	5857800	This definitely isn't launch window.
5857800	5858800	That's for sure.
5858800	5859800	That could be the problem.
5859800	5862000	Well, here's the other thing, too, is-
5862000	5864520	And Shadow Next Gen says it wasn't announced for any system.
5864520	5866520	It wasn't announced for 360 or PS3 either.
5866520	5871160	The press site they have listed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
5871160	5874560	Everyone thinks it's for Next Gen, though, and it could be.
5874560	5877240	It looks very Next Gen, that's for sure.
5877240	5882480	Another game that was not at Ubisoft at all, which is kind of surprising, was Rainbow Six
5882480	5883480	Patriots.
5883480	5884480	Where was that?
5884480	5885480	That was just missing.
5885480	5892120	So, who knows where that's been, but I don't know.
5892120	5893120	Pretty exciting show.
5893120	5894120	Let's line up.
5894120	5895120	Let's quickly do EA.
5895120	5897320	We were running long for part A, but we knew we would.
5897320	5898320	It's E3 week.
5898320	5901000	EA, real quick, they had lots of sports games to show off.
5901000	5904320	Of course, brand new.
5904320	5907000	Madden now, it's a brand new engine that's going to be running.
5907000	5912160	The new Infinity Engine has really awesome physics and stuff, so that looks pretty cool.
5912160	5913720	They talked a little bit about some new games.
5913720	5916600	Dead Space 3, which is kind of a duh that's coming out in February.
5916600	5919040	Need for Speed Most Wanted being rebooted by Criterion.
5919040	5923960	Looks like Burnout with Cops, Burnout Paradise with Cops, great.
5923960	5928200	Sim City that's going to be now online only, which is kind of annoying.
5928200	5929200	Boo.
5929200	5932240	That decision is going to tank that franchise.
5932240	5933240	Watch.
5933240	5936360	Because what they're saying, and Bobby went into this a little bit on his show tonight,
5936360	5940440	and I totally am agreeing with his sentiment, is that it's getting away from that whole
5940440	5941440	sandbox thing.
5941440	5944920	Like, remember how you could, like, unleash Godzilla and a nuclear strike and all that
5944920	5945920	on your city?
5945920	5948080	And then, okay, just go back and load your save file.
5948080	5949360	You can't do that.
5949360	5951640	When it's online only, there's no save files now.
5951640	5952840	People like doing that in the Sims.
5952840	5955200	It's just, why would you do that to your franchise?
5955200	5958880	I think that is a really bad decision.
5958880	5959880	Watch.
5959880	5961440	It worked for Diablo.
5961440	5964100	It's not going to work for you, EA.
5964100	5969240	People were used to, Diablo being online only, I mean, not that everybody's okay with that
5969240	5975520	anyway, but so many people were already playing that game online that it wasn't a deal breaker.
5975520	5978000	But SimCity, you don't play that online.
5978000	5979000	Ever.
5979000	5982560	And it's sad, too, because that's a game that I would like to play offline, and it looks
5982560	5983880	like an amazing game.
5983880	5985680	It's just, eh.
5985680	5989400	Unless you do have a local file.
5989400	5993680	Because for some online franchises, they do pull your data off a local file.
5993680	5995840	So that could work.
5995840	5997320	But not likely.
5997320	6000560	Yeah, I don't think that they're going to, because Diablo 3, if you think about it, could
6000560	6004080	have done that as well, but they didn't go that route.
6004080	6006840	I think they just shot the franchise in the foot with that decision.
6006840	6007840	Watch.
6007840	6008840	They can always change it.
6008840	6009840	They've got time.
6009840	6010840	I don't think they're going to.
6010840	6013360	I think the whole thing is they're trying to combat piracy, and they think that online
6013360	6015360	only is the way to go.
6015360	6018040	But, I don't know.
6018040	6021280	Once again, you're hurting the legitimate users of it.
6021280	6023160	Medal of Honor Warfighter looks amazing.
6023160	6025400	Very realistic looking game.
6025400	6029240	Crisis 3 is just kind of weird, I don't understand why I need to use a bow and arrow in this
6029240	6030240	game.
6030240	6031240	Neat.
6031240	6035600	I mean, it's a beautiful looking game, that's for sure.
6035600	6040800	SimCity Social for Facebook, they announced, which, cool.
6040800	6044840	Battlefield 3, of course, they were, you know, the Battlefield 3 premium service, they announced
6044840	6045840	that.
6045840	6052280	It's out on PS3 first, and then PC and Xbox, kind of opposite of Call of Duty Elite.
6052280	6055160	Star Wars Old Republic is sort of going free to play.
6055160	6059440	They're going free to play up to level 15, and they're going to also be adding new content
6059440	6062480	as well.
6062480	6067680	Also Madden NFL kind of jumping on the social bandwagon that they have with FIFA, and they
6067680	6069560	actually have some interesting stuff now.
6069560	6074480	The new game has like a fake Twitter feed that's on there that comments on your performance
6074480	6078840	and stuff like you're having real fans comment on your game, which is kind of cool.
6078840	6087520	They've got that going, plus a lot of other presentation perks that they added with that.
6087520	6094600	Last but not least, the big one, EA has secured the UFC franchise, so that's going to be coming
6094600	6102220	to EA now, and they bought it from THQ for an unset amount of money, and basically the
6102220	6107320	reasoning behind that was UFC 3, which was the last UFC game to come out from THQ, didn't
6107320	6111520	make their money, so they have to cut it, and that's what they did.
6111520	6115800	They cut the franchise and sold it to EA, although I'm worried now if it's going to
6115800	6118920	be like EA Sports MMA, which is kind of terrible.
6118920	6122580	All right, well, thank you.
6122580	6127560	That was a lot of news from E3, but I think we kind of covered it all there and gave our
6127560	6130800	feedback as well as you guys there in our chat room, and we do have some more to talk
6130800	6131800	about.
6131800	6132800	We're not done with the show yet.
6132800	6134280	We're going to get into some of the little stuff in the next half.
6134280	6137680	What's kind of sad that we didn't see was no Dead Rising 3 announcement.
6137680	6139520	That is interesting.
6139520	6140880	That didn't end up happening.
6140880	6143000	Why do you think that is?
6143000	6145760	Maybe it's one of those things, like I've been hearing from a lot of different developers
6145760	6148100	and publishers, it's not ready to show.
6148100	6151200	They're not ready to show it yet, or they're not ready to talk about that yet.
6151200	6153040	Which is the whole excuse behind Last Guardian.
6153040	6155680	Yeah, Last Guardian.
6155680	6159960	Capcom had a few things that they were showing off, obviously Street Fighter.
6159960	6160960	You know what?
6160960	6161960	I don't really know.
6161960	6165840	They referred the Vita, and then they also had Lost Planet 3, which was a big thing.
6165840	6166840	Devil May Cry.
6166840	6168640	They were kind of focusing on those franchises.
6168640	6172840	If you think about it, those are coming out quarter one, so this might be a fourth quarter
6172840	6173840	game.
6173840	6175760	It might be something for next E3, or maybe something that they announced at the Tokyo
6175760	6176760	Game Show.
6176760	6177760	Who knows?
6177760	6179760	So, it may just not be ready yet.
6179760	6180760	Hmm.
6180760	6181760	Interesting.
6181760	6182760	All right.
6182760	6185000	Well, we're running a bit long, but we do have a few more segments we want to get in
6185000	6187240	here before we get to part B tonight.
6187240	6189120	Some people prefer it long.
6189120	6193000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates on what is coming
6193000	6197000	out a little sooner than any of the games we just talked about.
6197000	6201480	This week, we don't have a whole ton, but we've got Lollipop Chainsaw on PS3 and 360,
6201480	6204640	and that's sometimes all you need.
6204640	6208200	Dirt Showdown's supposed to be coming out this week, although I'm not sure if it's actually
6208200	6211400	going to be coming out on Tuesday, because they're having production problems.
6211400	6212880	But sometime, hopefully, this week.
6212880	6215520	That's on PS3 and 360.
6215520	6219480	And then, not a whole lot else.
6219480	6221680	You're a fan of the Nickelodeon series iCarly.
6221680	6225160	There's a Groovy Foodie game coming out on Nintendo DS.
6225160	6230040	On the Vita, getting a couple games, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Gravity Rush.
6230040	6233520	Gravity Rush looks pretty awesome, so hopefully that'll be pretty cool.
6233520	6237800	And then, I believe that's it.
6237800	6239900	All right, traveling to Japan.
6239900	6243880	Not a whole, whole lot over there, but on the Nintendo 3DS, gone.
6243880	6248840	Baku Baku Baku Adventure comes out this week, as well as Heavy Fire, The Chosen Few.
6248840	6251680	Again, that's the 3DS in Japan.
6251680	6253360	Going over to the PlayStation Vita.
6253360	6254360	Oh, I lied.
6254360	6257680	This is a big week, because there's a lot of people that are going to want this.
6257680	6260800	Persona 4, The Golden, comes out in Japan this week.
6260800	6263960	There's a whole little accessory set, as well, that you can get for the Vita.
6263960	6268840	There's also a Super Monkey Ball game called Tokumori Asobita comes out this week, as well,
6268840	6270440	on the PlayStation Vita.
6270440	6273240	I have a feeling more people will be crazy about the Persona 4.
6273240	6276000	I know there's a lot of fans of that here in the US.
6276000	6280880	Going to the PlayStation 3, Lollipop Chainsaw in Japan, as well, and also a game called
6280880	6285520	Lord of Sorcery, as well as some new joystick adapters coming for you.
6285520	6288640	Is that Lord of Sorcery from Sony?
6288640	6291960	I believe that is just Sorcery here.
6291960	6292960	It is from Sony.
6292960	6293960	Yeah, that's Sorcery.
6293960	6296120	And that's a move integrated game.
6296120	6300520	FIFA 12 gets a price reduction, as well, on the PlayStation 3 this week.
6300520	6308800	Quickly taking a look at the Xbox 360, Akai Katana Shin gets a price reduction this Friday,
6308800	6313960	as well as Eshatos gets a price reduction, as well, and Lollipop Chainsaw on the 360,
6313960	6314960	as well.
6314960	6315960	And that's Japan.
6315960	6316960	Dark Sakura?
6316960	6323040	Well, we have a few things in the UK, and I would tell everybody if my thing would pull
6323040	6324040	up.
6324040	6325040	There we go.
6325040	6331320	We have coming up on the 13th, Doctor Who, the Eternity Clock, and Gravity Rush.
6331320	6337200	And then on the 15th, we have Combat Wings, the Great Battles of World War II, Heroes
6337200	6342840	of Ruin, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Lollipop Chainsaw.
6342840	6344720	And that would do it for the UK.
6344720	6345720	All right.
6345720	6352160	Well, let's go way back, back past E3 and past what's coming out this week, and go way
6352160	6355000	back in time to when things were a little bit simpler.
6355000	6360360	Back when you had to read about E3 and Nintendo Power.
6360360	6363360	Okay, maybe not that long ago, but still, pretty far back.
6363360	6367000	It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week, where Dark Sakura's gonna go into
6367000	6369160	the gaming vault and pull out an old-ass video game.
6369160	6374560	She thinks, hey, while you guys are waiting for all this stuff to come out, respect a
6374560	6375560	classic.
6375560	6378400	This is one from, literally from the vault, which is how I decided.
6378400	6379400	All right.
6379400	6383800	I picked a box of PS games, and this was the second one on them.
6383800	6386440	And what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?
6386440	6387440	Policemauts.
6387440	6391960	Policemauts is one of the cinematic adventure games.
6391960	6394840	It was done by Hideo Kojima.
6394840	6395840	It has...
6395840	6396840	Yeah.
6396840	6397840	It was a Konami game.
6397840	6398840	The old Konami logo.
6398840	6399840	Aw.
6399840	6402480	I missed that.
6402480	6408440	It was initially released for the PC 9821 in 1994.
6408440	6413760	And then they remade versions for the 3DO, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn in 96.
6413760	6418580	It has never officially been released outside of Japan, although they were going to localize
6418580	6420120	it on the Saturn.
6420120	6426920	And then on August 24th, in honor of the 46th birthday of Hideo Kojima, there was an unofficial
6426920	6430400	translation patch that came out on the internet.
6430400	6435260	Policemauts is a, I would say, a spiritual successor to Snatcher.
6435260	6438280	It's the same type of game.
6438280	6445600	With this one, it's a very interesting game because it really refers back to different
6445600	6454040	references like to Lethal Weapon and Urashima Taro, which is an old Japanese tale.
6454040	6459920	The game is about a detective who travels to a space colony to investigate his ex-wife's
6459920	6463480	murder and her new husband's disappearance.
6463480	6468800	So it is first person, point and click interface, and you play as the protagonist, Jonathan
6468800	6475680	Ingram, who is a policeman, basically, a former police officer trained to be a police officer
6475680	6477680	in space.
6477680	6483180	With the console, you use the mouse, but on the Saturn version you can use the light gun
6483180	6490840	for shooting parts of the game, so it's actually a little bit more rich in terms of play.
6490840	6494480	But on the other consoles, it's basically point and click, first person shooter type
6494480	6503280	stuff, with random saves and everything, and it actually has an easter egg that, if you've
6503280	6510360	got a save file of Tokimeki Memorial, it refers back to it, so pretty funny.
6510360	6513960	And of course, that came up in Metal Gear Solid, where it read your save files on your
6513960	6514960	PlayStation card.
6514960	6520800	Ooh, you are a careful man who saves often.
6520800	6527280	So basically, again, like I said, he is, Jonathan Ingram is a police snot who is assigned to
6527280	6533600	Beyond Coast, which is the first functional space colony in 2013, so next year, or apparently
6533600	6534600	colonizing space.
6534600	6541600	So he goes to see what happened to Lorraine, who is his ex-wife, and her husband's vanished,
6541600	6543000	so he has to find out what's going on.
6543000	6551260	He works with his buddy from the LAPD, Ed Brown, who is helping him with the investigation.
6551260	6553640	And so, it really is just that, point and click.
6553640	6557920	Now, for different versions that came out, I did mention it originally was on the NEC
6557920	6566600	PC 9821, and it was one CD-ROM that had an installation floppy disk, and the cutscenes
6566600	6573040	were rendered in hand-drawn pixel art, instead of full motion video.
6573040	6578120	It also is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games.
6578120	6583440	Then it came out on the 3DO on September 29th, 1995, that was two CD-ROMs, and it had animated
6583440	6584440	cutscenes.
6584440	6586440	It was CG animation.
6586440	6588640	All the graphics were completely redrawn for it.
6588640	6593400	The PS version came out on January 19th, 1996, on two disks.
6593400	6594400	That's the version I have.
6594400	6598120	Actually, I have the best hits version of that, just to say.
6598120	6601840	Then it came out on the Sega Saturn on September 13th, 1996, and it used, like I said, the
6601840	6603160	light gun.
6603160	6608400	Other versions that have been out is that there was the Policenauts pilot disk for 3DO
6608400	6613940	that had a playable demo of the backstory of the game, featurettes, and information
6613940	6615700	on the voice actors and developers.
6615700	6619520	Then there was the Policenauts private collection that came out on the Playstation February
6619520	6620520	9th, 1996.
6620520	6625600	It had a lot of the same content, and an earlier version of the game's script.
6625600	6628680	The Playstation 1 has been reissued twice.
6628680	6633160	There's the Konami The Best version, which is the one that I have, and then it came out
6633160	6641520	for the Playstation Store, making it downloadable for Playstation Portable and for PS3.
6641520	6643820	There was a plan to localize it on the Saturn.
6643820	6649200	There actually is cover art that exists for this, and there's a fan translation that was
6649200	6657480	done for the Playstation, which you can actually use through Emulator.
6657480	6659400	I've seen a bunch of it through that.
6659400	6665560	I've played through half of it in Japanese with a copy of that script.
6665560	6672960	There was also a soundtrack that was released, and then Policenauts FN, which is a range
6672960	6676420	of versions of the music from the soundtrack.
6676420	6681720	There was the MIDI Power Pro 3, so there was a MIDI arrangement of the Policenauts music,
6681720	6683680	and the Snatcher Policenauts music disc.
6683680	6687880	It was called Music Collection of Hideo Kojima Black Disc.
6687880	6692720	And there you go, Policenauts.
6692720	6696800	If I may say so, there's also references to Policenauts and Snatcher in the Metal Gear
6696800	6698440	games.
6698440	6702720	When it detects your save files and all that.
6702720	6711280	In fact, here's an obvious one, there's a scene where Otacon is flashed back to being
6711280	6718000	a big nerd, and there's scenes from Policenauts and Snatcher in his flashbacks.
6718000	6722160	Baconbits in our chatroom asks, is there an official release on the US Playstation Network?
6722160	6723160	No.
6723160	6724160	Nope.
6724160	6725160	But maybe someday.
6725160	6726160	Bug him enough.
6726160	6731400	However, however, you can find Policenauts, I think, relatively inexpensive if you're
6731400	6734440	getting the re-release.
6734440	6737480	And again, you can play it on an emulator with an English patch.
6737480	6738960	So if you want to go to the trouble.
6738960	6742800	Or if you happen to be able to read and understand Japanese, you can play it on a PS3.
6742800	6744120	And there's the way I played it.
6744120	6749320	I sat down with a freaking script that gave me my options.
6749320	6751000	It was a pain in the ass.
6751000	6752000	But you did it.
6752000	6753600	But I did it.
6753600	6759920	We beat the freaking Rurouni Kenshin game, the RPG, with a copy of the script.
6759920	6763800	And we beat Grandia, we played through half of Grandia with my friend Krista there because
6763800	6765480	she could read everything.
6765480	6768740	So I will tell you this right now.
6768740	6772040	My Japanese reading is like a literate five year old.
6772040	6773040	Seriously.
6773040	6775040	I know maybe 30 Kanji.
6775040	6777200	That's it.
6777200	6778200	Keep trying.
6778200	6779300	You might get up to a six year old soon.
6779300	6780300	Maybe when I move.
6780300	6781300	All right.
6781300	6782300	We're going to take a break.
6782300	6784200	We're almost two hours with no break here.
6784200	6788500	And I need to go check into the show tonight at vognetwork.com and get my vog points so
6788500	6790200	I can get more loot.
6790200	6791680	And hopefully you guys will do the same thing.
6791680	6793800	Or you might join us in the VOG Network Clubhouse.
6793800	6796360	Again, just search for VOG in the PlayStation Home.
6796360	6797880	And there's VOG Network all in caps.
6797880	6799800	I think we're going to fill this place tonight.
6799800	6803420	Blender's already like, do we need a second clubhouse?
6803420	6804760	We might.
6804760	6808420	So anyhow, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a minute with more of
6808420	6817100	Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6817100	6822800	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 460 for this June the 10th
6822800	6823800	of 2012.
6823800	6826280	We are live at vognetwork.com.
6826280	6827640	Be sure to check into the show.
6827640	6832000	Get your points and maybe some hidden loot there.
6832000	6834520	Also we're live in the PlayStation Network Clubhouse.
6834520	6837720	This is the last time most people have left, honestly.
6837720	6842720	And I don't know how, we need to convince Sony somehow to give us more than 30 people
6842720	6843720	to get in that clubhouse.
6843720	6846760	But I was checking out, Blender put in all these little like arcade games you can play
6846760	6851160	and I was playing Electro Kid, which I didn't realize, I mean, I knew there were some mini
6851160	6852160	games.
6852160	6855320	Like I remember there was like a Arknoid clone breakout type thing that was kind of basic
6855320	6858120	and some other little things that were in there when home first launch.
6858120	6861560	Like that Electro Kid I was just playing was kind of like a old school 8-bit platformer.
6861560	6865320	I was like, wow, I kind of behind the times on home.
6865320	6867480	Like the Namco games or something that you could do?
6867480	6873200	Well, they tied into the, like all it would do, it was a launcher for the Namco collection
6873200	6874200	game.
6874200	6875720	Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.
6875720	6880220	But still kind of neat and it looks like they are building more and more games into home.
6880220	6881600	So that's, that's pretty cool.
6881600	6885040	So I was checking that out a little bit during the break.
6885040	6890320	Also before we get back into some long news here, I was asked to plug another show and
6890320	6894860	I'm like, all right, whatever, I'm, I'm, I'm a supporter of indie podcasts and so forth.
6894860	6895860	This isn't a podcast.
6895860	6896860	It's a live show.
6896860	6898760	It's one of our listeners who's PMing me here.
6898760	6902440	Vince Raven hosts a show called Back in Time.
6902440	6910360	It airs live Wednesdays at 10 PM on his college's website, ehc.edu.
6910360	6913280	It's W-E-H-C-F-M.
6913280	6916360	He does music and movie reviews and all that stuff.
6916360	6919680	It's 10 o'clock Eastern, ehc.edu.
6919680	6920720	And you know what?
6920720	6921720	Why not?
6921720	6923080	I'll plug something one of the listeners wants to plug.
6923080	6927240	Plus I have to admit, I got my start on college radio too.
6927240	6934520	I used to DJ for KCSC 95.5 in Chico, California, even though that wasn't a real radio frequency.
6934520	6935800	You had to have this little thing.
6935800	6937520	It was cable radio.
6937520	6940960	You had to hook up the cable to your radio.
6940960	6942920	Yeah.
6942920	6946400	I probably have way more listeners now than I did back then.
6946400	6947400	That's for sure.
6947400	6948840	But we all have to get our start somewhere.
6948840	6955060	So hey, maybe someday Vince Raven will have his own network that he started after college
6955060	6956060	radio.
6956060	6957060	Who knows?
6957060	6958060	He'll have his own network somewhere.
6958060	6959060	All right.
6959060	6963000	Anyhow, also at vognetwork.com, be sure to participate in the forums.
6963000	6964880	We are running forums again.
6964880	6968640	They look very generic right now, but I know that's on the plate for Bobby to expand this
6968640	6969640	week.
6969640	6970920	Bobby has been working nonstop on the site.
6970920	6975600	You have to remember, VOG Network has only been up in its full form for a week.
6975600	6979700	And for a while, about a month before that, he was coding the version that you saw on
6979700	6980880	Friday when it launched.
6980880	6983200	And he's been still coding nonstop that week.
6983200	6985800	And I'm always like, Bobby, you should take a break.
6985800	6987680	Bobby, you should go to Disneyland like I did.
6987680	6989160	Bobby, you should get away from your computer.
6989160	6991680	He's like, we've got to do a mobile site.
6991680	6993040	We've got to do this other thing.
6993040	6994040	Things I can't talk about.
6994040	6995040	We've got to do this other thing.
6995040	6996520	And I'm just like, Bobby.
6996520	6998680	So he's working very, very hard behind the scenes.
6998680	7001740	I know, Dar Sacher, you did some of the graphic stuffs.
7001740	7003440	So some of the pretty colors.
7003440	7004920	And there's other things coming up.
7004920	7005920	That's right.
7005920	7006920	Content-wise.
7006920	7009640	That directly involves our listeners.
7009640	7011560	But should I?
7011560	7012560	I should.
7012560	7013560	Drop a hint.
7013560	7015920	VOG10 and VOGblog.
7015920	7017520	All right.
7017520	7020280	We do have VOGvlog.
7020280	7022200	There'll be more for that a little later.
7022200	7023200	All right.
7023200	7027280	Anyhow, let's get back into some actual gaming news out of E3.
7027280	7030860	First, some rapid fire news starting with Loki.
7030860	7035480	So let's talk a little bit about Dawnguard.
7035480	7039400	The new expansion for Elder Scrolls Skyrim sounds awesome.
7039400	7041360	And it's coming out very soon.
7041360	7046300	Actually in a few weeks, the tentative date right now is the 26th of June.
7046300	7052000	And that'll be on Xbox 360 only right now because they are getting the DLC first.
7052000	7055240	And so there is currently a beta right now, which they have not accepted me.
7055240	7057320	Very disappointed there.
7057320	7058880	But that will be hopefully very soon.
7058880	7060120	We'll get to play the full thing.
7060120	7061760	And I will definitely be picking that up.
7061760	7068240	And I may actually get into a game that's not Minecraft for a little bit.
7068240	7069240	Yay.
7069240	7073440	And there is a sequel announced to Dead Rising, Dead Rising Riptide.
7073440	7081400	It is coming out soon, probably this fall, I mentioned, or imagine.
7081400	7082400	Consoles and PC.
7082400	7087760	Doesn't really say when, but there's supposed to be an extensive reveal this summer.
7087760	7089480	So probably the fall.
7089480	7094520	And last but not least was a game that wasn't shown during the press conferences.
7094520	7101360	But Project P100, a Wii U launch title, which is going to be coming to us from Platinum
7101360	7102440	Games.
7102440	7107600	And it kind of looks like a cross between Viewtiful Joe and Pikmin.
7107600	7112800	And you basically play like these superheroes that get other superheroes and other citizens
7112800	7116640	to kind of form together to attack monsters that are attacking Earth.
7116640	7120880	I saw somebody in chat, and I'm sorry I forget who, said that that was their game of the
7120880	7121880	show.
7121880	7123820	So some people are already excited about this.
7123820	7125120	It's pretty cool.
7125120	7128160	Alright, moving on.
7128160	7134400	WarioWare makes a showing at E3, but not in the way you might think.
7134400	7137640	It's part of Game and Wario.
7137640	7142020	That's just something that kind of was on the E3 page but not really seen at the show.
7142020	7146160	Why wasn't that show instead of like, you know, half the amount of...
7146160	7148760	Because it's not a launch window title, probably.
7148760	7153280	Anyhow, the description says, Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action.
7153280	7157720	Game and Wario features a collection of games that use only the Wii U gamepad controller.
7157720	7161840	The games retain the original flair and character of the microgames from the WarioWare series.
7161840	7166600	So it sounds like it's maybe a more fleshed-out version of WarioWare, which could be very
7166600	7167660	interesting.
7167660	7173480	Some games called Arrow and Ski and Shudder sound a lot like, you know, one-word WarioWare
7173480	7174480	games.
7174480	7175480	But, yeah, unfortunately it's not WarioWare.
7175480	7176740	I mean, if it was WarioWare, ha-ha.
7176740	7179160	It's not, but it sounds like it kind of might be.
7179160	7180800	Like it might be the spiritual successor.
7180800	7181800	You know that term?
7181800	7182800	I don't want a spiritual successor.
7182800	7184800	I want an actual successor.
7184800	7187920	Screw the spiritual successor stuff.
7187920	7190000	We don't need spiritual successes.
7190000	7192120	That's if your franchise didn't do very well.
7192120	7194480	This is WarioWare that we're talking about.
7194480	7199400	Well, when I think of characters in Sega franchises that ought to turn up in Sonic and All-Stars
7199400	7204400	Racing Transformed, I don't necessarily think of Danica Patrick, NASCAR Racing Star.
7204400	7205400	But guess what?
7205400	7209000	She's going to be a playable character in Sonic and All-Star Racing Transformed.
7209000	7210760	That's kind of cool.
7210760	7211760	That is kind of cool.
7211760	7216520	You know, and I realize especially, she's a good role model for women because she's
7216520	7220400	in there doing a boy sport that has a lot of, you know, and she's, well, you're kind
7220400	7222520	of giving me stank face a little bit.
7222520	7223520	No.
7223520	7226680	Well, I hate the term men's sport when...
7226680	7227680	I know.
7227680	7228680	I don't...
7228680	7229680	It's driving a car.
7229680	7232440	I don't like it either, but let's say male dominated.
7232440	7233440	Okay.
7233440	7234440	That works.
7234440	7235440	All right.
7235440	7238840	And, you know, she's, she kind of kicks a lot of ass and, you know, has done very well
7238840	7242160	for herself being a spokesperson for various sites and so forth, and now she's going to
7242160	7243800	be playable in a video game.
7243800	7246320	So that'll be pretty cool.
7246320	7249880	Clover Nikon in our chat room though says, I want Alex Kidd to be playable.
7249880	7251640	How about the return of Alex Kidd?
7251640	7253360	Where the hell has he been?
7253360	7255400	We need Alex Kidd in Shinobi World 2.
7255400	7256400	Dream on.
7256400	7260520	I want to say that, like, I remember the first game had a lot of like old Sega characters.
7260520	7264360	I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.
7264360	7268280	There are some Danica haters, cue the Danica haters in our chat room.
7268280	7272920	Hey, you want to talk about a franchise that could, you know, or a company that could use
7272920	7276880	one of those, like, oh, hey, our mascots are fighting a battle royale type thing.
7276880	7278480	Sega would be pretty amazing.
7278480	7279480	I would.
7279480	7280720	Didn't they do something like that?
7280720	7283040	I thought they had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
7283040	7284040	No, I'm sorry.
7284040	7285480	That was Ubisoft.
7285480	7286760	Let me read the haters.
7286760	7287760	It's the internet.
7287760	7288760	There's always going to be haters.
7288760	7292680	DJ Morpheus says, great, another avenue that shows Danica can't drive.
7292680	7295960	Blender says, Danica sucks, I'm ho.
7295960	7301400	So every fandom has their haters, all right.
7301400	7305040	Moving on.
7305040	7309040	It's hard to laugh and then go into a story like this because stories like this are never
7309040	7313240	easy to report on, but yet again, another studio has closed.
7313240	7316080	It's THQ's San Diego studio.
7316080	7320020	They were the ones doing the UFC license, mostly was the stuff they were doing those
7320020	7321020	games.
7321020	7326560	So because the license has transitioned elsewhere to Electronic Arts, the San Diego studio has
7326560	7328760	been closed.
7328760	7331520	Maybe they can get hired at EA.
7331520	7333920	That's the tiny little silver lining in this.
7333920	7334920	We'll see.
7334920	7338420	Moving on to some more rapid fire news, Dark Sakura.
7338420	7339920	Let's see what we've got.
7339920	7344140	Well, first of all, the Humble Indie Bundle 5 has three new additions to it.
7344140	7352320	If you pay above the minimum, which is right now at $8.14, you get Braid, Super Meat Boy,
7352320	7353320	and Lone Survivor.
7353320	7362200	Now, I think this is pretty cool for the Minecraft fan in the room, that Marcus Pearson actually
7362200	7371800	paid $9,999.99.
7371800	7374200	Next up, Portal 2 in Motion.
7374200	7377760	It actually is going to use the PlayStation Move.
7377760	7378760	And you know what?
7378760	7382760	I don't give a crap about that because I played on the PC.
7382760	7387560	It's basically the stuff that they had, remember, that was the N, I think it was like Sixth
7387560	7390480	Sense or N Sense or some weird like N Space.
7390480	7393000	It uses the same from the Razer Hydra.
7393000	7394000	Yeah, Razer Hydra.
7394000	7396480	I was just gonna keep naming random names.
7396480	7399000	Yeah, you know the motion controller, I mean it sucks.
7399000	7402840	Well, not suck, but no one's buying it for the PC.
7402840	7406020	So why not recycle the content here?
7406020	7409640	It pissed me off because Sony showed that in one of their little compilations of footage
7409640	7411960	and we were like, holy shit, a new Portal game.
7411960	7413240	Holy shit, yay, yay, yay.
7413240	7415000	And then it's, oh, it's Move DLC.
7415000	7417280	Whatever, DLC is DLC.
7417280	7418280	I guess.
7418280	7419280	I follow that under, I don't give a shit.
7419280	7420280	I guess.
7420280	7422880	And well, how about Sony stuff anyway?
7422880	7423880	Tokyo Jungle.
7423880	7425200	We're getting it, we're getting it.
7425200	7426800	We don't have to import it.
7426800	7428400	I can be a gazelle.
7428400	7431760	This was the game we lost our shit on last week and said it should be the new President
7431760	7432760	Cat.
7432760	7433760	Well, that didn't take long.
7433760	7436840	They are bringing it to North America, yay.
7436840	7445080	Well, in fact, this actually was, I'm trying to find the guy's name.
7445080	7452560	Scott Rode, who was the Sony VP of Product Development and Worldwide, he says, it'll
7452560	7455600	ship here, it'll ship everywhere.
7455600	7458840	And to him, I'm going to read this directly from the article.
7458840	7465960	To him, Tokyo Jungle's worldwide release is emblematic of Sony's crazy innovative approach.
7465960	7469900	He says the game is just wacky, but in a good way because we like to show that there's still
7469900	7473880	an art form and you can still experiment.
7473880	7476000	I want the hell out of this game.
7476000	7477000	Just saying.
7477000	7478000	I know.
7478000	7479000	I kind of want it to.
7479000	7480000	It's going to be awesome.
7480000	7481000	I'm lusting in my heart after it.
7481000	7482240	All right.
7482240	7484400	And lusting in your heart is lusting for real.
7484400	7489120	Well, now we're to the part of the show where we're going to get to the foogle question
7489120	7493240	of the week.
7493240	7495080	What the hell is a foogle, you might be asking?
7495080	7497320	Well, it's Facebook and Google Plus combined.
7497320	7499360	You get a foogle.
7499360	7502840	We ask a question on Facebook and Google Plus and you guys answer it.
7502840	7504120	And we read some of the answers.
7504120	7505360	There's a lot of answers tonight.
7505360	7506360	I can't read them all.
7506360	7507360	I just can't.
7507360	7509160	We read some of the answers here live on the show.
7509160	7512640	But if you want to see all the answers, check us out on Google Plus.
7512640	7516440	The link is on our website because you can't get a short URL on Google Plus yet.
7516440	7520280	You just go to orangelandtrader.com and in the upper right hand corner is a box that
7520280	7521280	says extended play.
7521280	7524360	Just click on that Google Plus logo and you can add us there.
7524360	7528520	And yes, there are people using Google Plus because we got a couple of responses over
7528520	7529520	there.
7529520	7533840	Tonight we have Michael D answering our question of the week which was, what in your opinion
7533840	7536440	was the highlight of E3 this year?
7536440	7539760	What is the thing you are looking forward to most of all?
7539760	7543920	And Michael D says from the press conferences, oh excuse me, he did sign it, Technus, my
7543920	7544920	bad.
7544920	7548240	Technus says from the press conferences, I'd say what Ubisoft announced pretty much blew
7548240	7549240	the big three away.
7549240	7553320	They had a great combination of going in strong with their existing IPs and finishing with
7553320	7556800	Watch Dogs, a game that sounds as amazing as it looks.
7556800	7560320	I would also like to mention that the tech demos for the new next gen engines, i.e.
7560320	7565240	Unreal Engine 4, CryEngine 3, Final Fantasy tech demo, look extremely impressive.
7565240	7567600	Overall, I was pleased with this E3.
7567600	7571560	Except for Microsoft in which I asked, please stick to the game, save the multimedia info
7571560	7574560	for CES.
7574560	7579320	Good point there about the tech demos for the next gen stuff.
7579320	7582620	Some of that stuff was really impressive and finally, you know, just when you think the
7582620	7587760	graphics can't get any better, there they go, they get better.
7587760	7593800	Lastly, going to a comment from Rababa on Google Plus says, I think the understated
7593800	7595560	highlight was smart glass.
7595560	7598560	If they use this potential, it will pretty much derail the Wii U tablet controller.
7598560	7602160	Don't get me wrong, I want the Wii U to succeed, but it will have to be truly awesome
7602160	7603160	to be successful.
7603160	7606800	I'm still waiting for the delay in release to 2013 because their marketing should be
7606800	7611880	almost full swing by now to release in the fall, predicting that Wii U may just delay.
7611880	7614040	I don't think Nintendo can afford it.
7614040	7617840	Their stocks next year would plummet, or the earnings and all that.
7617840	7619840	It has to come out.
7619840	7623240	I most look forward to saving money from not buying games this year.
7623240	7628280	Clothes, Gears of War, Yawn, I just don't like too many shooters.
7628280	7631240	Let's go to Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
7631240	7634600	Picaruno answered and said, probably going to get some shit from someone for this, but
7634600	7640000	apart from Assassin's Creed 3, none of the games on offer wowed me.
7640000	7644080	Wonder Book is a great idea, but its implementation on the Playstation 3 is stupid.
7644080	7646520	It would sell a lot better on iOS.
7646520	7647920	Here's what I'm going to say about Wonder Book.
7647920	7651280	It's going to bomb as bad as Eye of Judgment.
7651280	7655360	Dark Glass actually interests me a lot more than the Wii U, mainly because it works with
7655360	7657040	all your existing gear.
7657040	7661000	Its applications are nothing new, but I think they'd be a welcome addition to the Xbox 360's
7661000	7662000	capabilities.
7662000	7665360	Also, where the fuck were the Vita games, Sony?
7665360	7670120	Flaco Jones says, beyond two souls, it looked like they took heavy rain's gameplay and improved
7670120	7671120	everything.
7671120	7673440	Again, the thing that most excited you about E3.
7673440	7676960	Rhetortainment says, ditto on what Picaruno said.
7676960	7680680	I want to see more from Metal Gear Revengerance, such as gameplay.
7680680	7682840	Quantic Dreams Beyond Two Souls stood out for me.
7682840	7683840	I loved Heavy Rain.
7683840	7686120	I bought a Playstation move just to play again.
7686120	7689520	When I saw Beyond Two Souls, I made a mental note to buy this game.
7689520	7693560	Then I made a note on my droid that reads, buy Beyond Two Souls the day that it comes
7693560	7694560	out.
7694560	7696640	That's two people in a row excited about Beyond Two Souls.
7696640	7700720	Metal Gear Solid game, or not Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising game actually looked pretty
7700720	7701720	awesome.
7701720	7705660	Shane from Hoard House commented and said, I'd have an addition to my previous statement,
7705660	7707160	which was about Mass Effect 3.
7707160	7709880	I'd say Mass Effect 3 Wii U, Beyond Two Souls.
7709880	7710880	Here it is again.
7710880	7713920	Watch Dogs and Last of Us were the only things I cared about at E3.
7713920	7715800	I'm super hyped for those games.
7715800	7719160	Yes, completely forgot about Last of Us, one of the big games that they showed, and that
7719160	7721320	was one of their two IPs that they introduced.
7721320	7723480	But granted, we knew about that one already.
7723480	7724480	Yeah.
7724480	7725480	The Last Opus.
7725480	7728560	I'm sad it's no longer The Last Opus.
7728560	7732560	Tiger Caw says, I think the highlights for this year's E3 was Ubisoft with their accidental
7732560	7737620	nip slips up courtesy of Far Cry 3, and the unveiling of the new game Watch Dogs.
7737620	7741640	The new game from the creators of Heavy Rain called Beyond Two Souls during the Sony press
7741640	7742640	conference.
7742640	7744840	As for Nintendo, Zombie Reggie.
7744840	7745840	That is all.
7745840	7746840	What?
7746840	7747840	Okay.
7747840	7751360	Did you happen to watch the video of the pre-E3 conference?
7751360	7752360	A little bit.
7752360	7753360	I skipped around.
7753360	7758120	What the fuck is up with Miyamoto holding a god damn, or, Iwata, holding a banana.
7758120	7759840	A bunch of bananas for no reason.
7759840	7761720	He wanted to be a gif.
7761720	7763640	Ronnie B says, I agree with Picaruno.
7763640	7767280	Assassin's Creed 3 and the concept for Beyond were the only games that stood out for me,
7767280	7768280	really.
7768280	7769720	I hate what they've done with Dead Space.
7769720	7773120	Stan says, hate on me all you want, but Pikmin 3 looks so fun.
7773120	7776440	I almost went out and bought Pikmin 1 and 2 just from watching 3's trailer.
7776440	7780440	Well, now would be a great time to re-buy 2, because didn't the new control version come
7780440	7781440	out?
7781440	7782440	Loki?
7782440	7783440	Is that out here in the States?
7783440	7784440	Yeah.
7784440	7785440	It just came up today.
7785440	7786440	There you go.
7786440	7791440	Acidic Vampire says, I'm stoked for South Park RPG Tomb Raider, Beyond Two Souls, The
7791440	7793880	Last Opus, Pikmin 3 and Dead Space 3.
7793880	7798920	Oh, and the upcoming PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 with a gimmicky controller, aka the Wii U.
7798920	7801960	Actually, I'm not enthralled by it.
7801960	7805120	Red the Haze says, Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising.
7805120	7807280	Screw the haters saying that they're similar.
7807280	7811320	They should shut up about games that aren't out and that they haven't played before.
7811320	7817440	Oh, and the Ellen Page waifu simulators, which is the new emerging video game genre.
7817440	7820760	That's because Ellen Page is heavily inspired in The Last of Us, right?
7820760	7823440	In one of the characters based off her, sort of?
7823440	7824440	Looks likers.
7824440	7825440	Looks likers.
7825440	7830000	All right, let me do one more comment here.
7830000	7831440	Actually, two more.
7831440	7835640	Critical Myth said, Highlight was the Square Enix next gen demo, but for right now I'm
7835640	7838240	most looking forward to The Last of Us.
7838240	7840040	At least we have a good idea when it's hitting the shelves.
7840040	7844080	And lastly, from Dark Charger, nothing particularly stood out.
7844080	7848360	E3 this year is about the whole show being greater than the sum of its parts.
7848360	7852480	Despite the lack of a single bombshell, the many games, mostly third parties, were enough
7852480	7856720	to keep it not only my attention, but have me checking the calendar for several important
7856720	7857720	releases.
7857720	7863200	Perhaps entering E3 with tempered expectations ensures that I, or the gamer in general, always
7863200	7864200	wins.
7864200	7865200	Interesting.
7865200	7867720	Final note, but a good one, I think.
7867720	7868720	Setting the bar low.
7868720	7876680	See, the problem with next year's E3 is the bar is really high, because we have Sony and
7876680	7881600	Microsoft hopefully debuting their new consoles, although honestly, guys, nothing's set in
7881600	7882600	place.
7882600	7888720	Especially if the Wii U kinda goes pfft when it launches, which it very well might, I think
7888720	7891360	a lot of pressure would be off by Microsoft and Sony.
7891360	7895960	The longer they wait, the better the consoles will be, and the more trouble Nintendo will
7895960	7897160	be when they do launch.
7897160	7899400	Let them sit in the oven a little longer, right?
7899400	7901120	Seriously, because they're in no hurry.
7901120	7905760	They were talking about a console that's basically spec-wise the same as, you know, PlayStation
7905760	7907680	3 and Xbox 360.
7907680	7913440	Now that's not necessarily a thing that's gonna be a detriment to them, but, I mean,
7913440	7915280	because the Wii did take off.
7915280	7921080	However, I don't think that this console's that different than the Wii, and your average
7921080	7926600	soccer mom, if you will, is not gonna go, I need to have this, because it's like, well,
7926600	7929080	it kinda does the same thing the Wii does.
7929080	7930080	It's gonna be interesting.
7930080	7935040	I'm really curious to see what happens, because, you know, when the Wii first came out, there
7935040	7939880	was a lot of us going, what the hell's that name, and, but it would, it worked, so we'll
7939880	7940880	see.
7940880	7941880	And the Wii U.
7941880	7942880	Hey, whatever.
7942880	7950000	Hey, you know what, at the very least, we still have the Kung Pao jokes, and any attention
7950000	7956800	given back to Kung Pao is more attention and possibility for a sequel to that movie.
7956800	7960600	Shadow Next Gen brings up a good point, the DVD format on the 360 is becoming a serious
7960600	7961600	issue.
7961600	7965360	Maybe, maybe, uh, it can't afford to be DVD only much longer.
7965360	7969680	I mean, I guess there is always digital, but, I mean, it's not really gonna help.
7969680	7975080	They can always, I think that there's always a possibility that they'll have game installs.
7975080	7979240	They have it on the PlayStation 3, so just have it now where it comes with ships on three
7979240	7982120	discs, but you only need one, you can install the other two.
7982120	7986080	But technically, you can buy an Xbox 360 without a hard drive, so that shit shouldn't be required.
7986080	7988560	Yeah, technically, it still has four gigs.
7988560	7991720	That's not enough for some games.
7991720	7995480	Alright, let's move on with some more stories, we're gonna get to the mailbag of the Effies
7995480	7998000	of the Week, and of course, your phone calls, but let's try to get through these stories
7998000	7999000	kind of quick here.
7999000	8000000	Loki.
8000000	8007640	Alright, so, real quick, um, apparently Vivendi is looking to sell, um, part of, a part or
8007640	8015640	all of their stock in Activision, and of course, Vivendi, um, owns 61% of the controlling stake
8015640	8021400	in, uh, Activision, and apparently they're holding a meeting on the 22nd of this month
8021400	8027880	to discuss the potential for the sale of, um, part or all of its holdings, and, um,
8027880	8034800	basically, I think they're trying to drum up some more money, and, um, you know, basically,
8034800	8039320	they're saying, uh, some people believe that Vivendi's worth more if it's split up into
8039320	8044120	various parts, and the potential split doesn't really mean anything for Activision other
8044120	8052400	than a lot of shares on the market all at once, so, yeah, I don't really think it means
8052400	8057120	a whole lot, other than, you know, one company's not really gonna own anything, although, it's
8057120	8060320	kinda sad when you think about Vivendi, they purchased all these other companies when they
8060320	8062560	bought Activision, and...
8062560	8066920	It seems like a weird time to sell it off, I mean, I don't know, I didn't think there
8066920	8069360	was bad news necessarily coming out of there right now.
8069360	8071720	It's bad news, maybe they just need more money, maybe, you know, that section...
8071720	8072720	That could be!
8072720	8075720	Maybe that section of their business is doing okay, but they want, you know, they want their
8075720	8077040	fat paycheck.
8077040	8081920	Perhaps, or maybe they think it's good now, but maybe they're not so excited about the
8081920	8082920	future, but...
8082920	8084920	Maybe they gotta go, ew, it's all sticky!
8084920	8086200	Get rid of it!
8086200	8089100	Maybe they're a little worried about some of this Diablo 3 fallout, and maybe they're
8089100	8093100	worried about the next WoW expansion, and maybe this new Blizzard product, I'm focusing
8093100	8094880	on Blizzard, but I can't help myself.
8094880	8098080	I don't think that's, I think I just want money.
8098080	8099080	Sell off some shares.
8099080	8100080	And who doesn't?
8100080	8101080	Retire.
8101080	8106960	Well Sega doesn't want money, clearly, because they took Hatsune Miku Project Diva F for
8106960	8111920	the Vita to E3 to show it off, and then said, oh, it's not coming out of North America.
8111920	8116120	Which is very weird, it's very weird, usually games don't show up at E3 that aren't coming
8116120	8121480	out of North America, but according to a Sega rep, it was a sneak peek of a game coming
8121480	8122480	to Japan.
8122480	8127000	There are many Project Diva fans out there, like Dark Sakura, so it is disappointing to
8127000	8128960	hear that this will not be coming out.
8128960	8130840	However, Vita is region free, right?
8130840	8131840	That's true.
8131840	8140440	So maybe this is all hint, hint, hint, it's not coming to America, hint, wink, import.
8140440	8141640	Let's go to the mailbag.
8141640	8147180	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your
8147180	8149320	emails here on the show.
8149320	8153800	Dark Sakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst again at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
8153800	8155960	and pick out some of her favorite emails to read right now.
8155960	8158640	Well, I'm going to read all the ones that are in there.
8158640	8159640	They're not very long.
8159640	8162040	Hey OLR, quick question for all three hosts.
8162040	8165520	Of all the games you saw presented at this year's E3, which ones are you planning to
8165520	8167680	buy on day one, if any?
8167680	8173160	And I'm honestly, I'm interested in Beyond Two Souls, and I want to play Tank Tank Tank,
8173160	8177400	because I'm sorry, that game is freaking addictive as hell.
8177400	8181360	Otherwise I'm not super interested in hardly anything, so.
8181360	8186440	I'm a little behind still, I feel, but I definitely want that new Tomb Raider game.
8186440	8195200	I'll probably end up getting the Wii U, I don't know, to be determined.
8195200	8201880	That Ubisoft game Watch Dogs looks really good too, I might have to check that out.
8201880	8204820	Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U.
8204820	8211760	Borderlands 2, for sure, South Park, The Sick of Truth, and...
8211760	8217720	Oh yeah, I totally want that South Park game too.
8217720	8219520	Really, those are the only two that jumped out right now.
8219520	8221720	Grand Theft Auto 5, whenever the hell that fucking comes out.
8221720	8222720	Yeah, where was that?
8222720	8224920	Eh, it's not ready yet.
8224920	8229280	They probably think, hey, well, Take Two's not really at, you know, they aren't really
8229280	8230280	at E3.
8230280	8231920	Their booth always has no electric fence.
8231920	8235960	And so they probably, you know, maybe it's just not ready to show off yet, because I
8235960	8240200	mean, if you think about it, it's probably about a year away from being released, so...
8240200	8244640	They'll just have their own fucking splash, but hey, fucking Grand Theft Auto 5, you're
8244640	8246520	buying this shit, you know it.
8246520	8247520	Let's continue.
8247520	8249960	I'm pretty sure Dan would want to get Halo 4, so.
8249960	8254200	And then, Ospher, who wrote the email, says, for me, Halo 4 and Beyond Two Souls 4 must
8254200	8255200	have titles.
8255200	8257360	Except I misread it as titties, so.
8257360	8258360	Sincerely, Ospher.
8258360	8262280	P.S., all my love goes to the Krogan, but I guess I can spare some for my fellow Mass
8262280	8263280	Effect gamers.
8263280	8264280	Heart!
8264280	8267800	You know, actually, speaking of titties, Far Cry 3 actually looks pretty awesome.
8267800	8269920	I actually may pick that up day one.
8269920	8272080	You know what game looked ridiculous?
8272080	8275140	Alan made me watch the trailer last night.
8275140	8276140	That Hitman Absolut-tion.
8276140	8278840	Okay, well, the trailer was ridiculous.
8278840	8283400	The trailer was totally ridiculous, with the stripper nuns and guns.
8283400	8285960	They're trying to think, like, this is all the things that boys like.
8285960	8286960	Well, they even...
8286960	8287960	Don't forget exploding toilets.
8287960	8291680	They even, well, even, like, a lot of people in the industry are just like, what the fuck
8291680	8292680	was that trailer?
8292680	8294200	That just makes no sense.
8294200	8295720	The game looks pretty good.
8295720	8296720	Anyhow.
8296720	8297720	Next email!
8297720	8300720	Um, Robert M. here.
8300720	8304360	You guys mentioned Retro City Rampage's Meat Boy minigame on last week's pre-taped...
8304360	8307280	I hate that word!
8307280	8309280	Taped show.
8309280	8313700	Last month's Nintendo Power had a feature on the game for WiiWare, including a Splosion
8313700	8315240	Man minigame as well.
8315240	8317240	Not sure how that works license-wise.
8317240	8322320	I get the impression that this will join Meat Boy and Spelunky as unreleased, especially
8322320	8324500	this late in the Wii's life cycle.
8324500	8327320	For what other consoles is it scheduled?
8327320	8328320	As for the...
8328320	8329320	Oh, go ahead.
8329320	8330320	You were gonna say?
8330320	8336040	Uh, Xbox Live Arcade, uh, PlayStation Network for both, um, PlayStation 3 and the Vita as
8336040	8337040	PC.
8337040	8338040	Nice.
8338040	8339040	Okay.
8339040	8344640	As for the voice of Geeks Network, how practical do you expect it'll be for shows doing video
8344640	8349320	content, under Sedation Live in particular, to have a video podcast feed?
8349320	8353440	I know when he was doing Friday Night Gaming, Bobby said such a feed would be three gigabytes
8353440	8354440	an episode.
8354440	8362040	Uh, yeah, the problem is you have to compress the video and then it's tricky.
8362040	8364160	It's tricky to do something like that.
8364160	8368680	Um, you know, yeah, video podcasts are hard and there haven't been a lot of successful
8368680	8369680	ones that are over.
8369680	8372860	I mean, most of them are like five minutes long.
8372860	8378080	That's how they deliver the video podcast because five minutes worth of HD video is
8378080	8380380	like our three hour show, you know?
8380380	8381380	They're about the same size.
8381380	8384120	There's plenty of them that use, um, just post them to YouTube.
8384120	8385120	Yeah, that's true.
8385120	8389160	Um, you know, I think Travis has been putting clips on YouTube and so forth and I'd certainly
8389160	8390700	encourage him to continue doing that.
8390700	8398360	But for now, I think him particularly is very about getting people in for the live experience.
8398360	8402100	So I don't think he's going to take a whole lot of effort to try and get the video up
8402100	8404140	when he is putting the audio out there at least.
8404140	8407480	So at least, and I will say this, give mad props to Travis.
8407480	8409640	He's got that shit on same day turnaround now.
8409640	8410640	Like forever.
8410640	8413000	We were like, Travis, get season five up, Travis, get season five.
8413000	8414960	He's worked out a system where he's on same day turnaround now.
8414960	8415960	So props to him.
8415960	8418840	I think that's, I think that is important too.
8418840	8423840	I finally saw the disco thing and disco disco Lord.
8423840	8426680	It made me glad I didn't have a webcam at the time.
8426680	8429740	Uh, Oh God, did he put that on YouTube?
8429740	8430740	I don't think so.
8430740	8431740	Phew.
8431740	8432740	Phew.
8432740	8433740	Um, I don't know.
8433740	8434740	I didn't look.
8434740	8435740	Um, I will say this.
8435740	8439440	We are looking at doing more type of like vlog content cause like Travis did that studio
8439440	8441440	tour that went up during the week.
8441440	8445960	And I'm going to do one that's a little more talking head, but I've got one coming up in
8445960	8449680	the next week that I'll, I'll, should I spoil it?
8449680	8450680	Spoil.
8450680	8453060	I'll, I'll say this much, I'll drop a hint.
8453060	8457840	I'm going to explain why I am not doing a particular podcast.
8457840	8460700	People have been asking me to do a podcast on a certain topic and I'm going to explain
8460700	8462800	in depth why that's not going to happen.
8462800	8463800	And sorry.
8463800	8464800	Mm hmm.
8464800	8471440	Um, so to continue with the email as for the voice of geeks network, how proud, Oh, nevermind.
8471440	8472440	I already read that.
8472440	8473440	Blah.
8473440	8474440	Next email.
8474440	8476200	Um, Hey guys, die.
8476200	8477200	You're sexist.
8477200	8478200	Um, sorry.
8478200	8484520	Um, so I just finished watching the E3 press conference conferences while I was really
8484520	8488200	looking forward to what Microsoft and Nintendo had to offer and didn't really expect much
8488200	8493000	from Sony ended up liking the fact that Sony focused on games for the most part as really
8493000	8496940	considering the Wii U since I thought it would be next gen system that would get all the
8496940	8500420	new games for other, that other systems shared plus Mario and Zelda.
8500420	8503640	Unfortunately after their press conference, it seemed like they were focusing too much
8503640	8507720	on the gimmicks and the multi console games were all out of date.
8507720	8509640	So I guess I'll have to pass on that.
8509640	8513120	I did think the new Kinect features and the smart glass that Microsoft presented were
8513120	8514120	cool.
8514120	8519300	However, when it comes to games, I just don't care about getting into Halo or Gears of War
8519300	8522880	after all this time and they didn't offer anything new game wise.
8522880	8524880	Sony still won me over with their exclusives.
8524880	8529320	I love to have you rain, so I will be buying beyond right away.
8529320	8533600	The last of us looked like a great way to tell a different kind of story with the already
8533600	8538880	proven uncharted game engine and while I don't care much about God of war or PlayStation
8538880	8541720	all sores, it's all stars, not all sores.
8541720	8542720	All sores.
8542720	8547040	It's the amazing game where you fight STDs.
8547040	8549440	That is important.
8549440	8550440	Oh God.
8550440	8551440	It's herpes man.
8551440	8559640	Herpes, that sores herpes man versus Mrs. Gonorrhea, ringworm gun, ringworm gym, ringworm
8559640	8561280	gun.
8561280	8565640	Anyway, um, all stars.
8565640	8570080	It's still nice that Sony is delivering for fans of those types of games as well.
8570080	8573800	I just wish Wii U wasn't trying to ram this new controller down our throats more like
8573800	8575200	up your ass.
8575200	8577720	Um, seriously, it's not just swallow it.
8577720	8579760	It's take it as a suppository too.
8579760	8586000	Um, I had high hopes when I saw the pro controller that there would be an alternative, but there,
8586000	8590360	but they aren't even getting the awesome looking Watch Dogs game, at least not when it comes
8590360	8591360	out.
8591360	8594800	That means no Mario or Zelda for me, as long as they keep pushing gimmicky controls and
8594800	8595800	that's from Flacco Jones.
8595800	8600440	There's the other thing too, like once again, it gets me thinking about the Wii U, um, their
8600440	8604640	biggest features that they like were pimping out.
8604640	8608280	This system can be played when someone wants to watch TV.
8608280	8610000	I just don't understand that.
8610000	8613000	You're supposed to, okay, this system is supposed to be so awesome that you want to play it
8613000	8614000	on your TV.
8614000	8616760	And I know a lot of people probably have multiple TVs they can play it on.
8616760	8620520	I don't understand why that's necessarily a feature that we need to be pimping out.
8620520	8626160	And, and once again, just like the Wii was, they're pimping it as like this party environment
8626160	8631360	that all these party games, you know, like Just Dance has this, you know, Poppy Master
8631360	8632360	Mode.
8632360	8633360	Hey, guess what?
8633360	8637880	I hardly ever have people over to my house to play games nowadays because I have a kid.
8637880	8642320	I can't just be getting the party going and you know, oh, hey, we gotta be quiet because
8642320	8645320	we have the kid there, you know, so I don't have that.
8645320	8652880	So the fact that, you know, Super Mario, um, New Super Mario Brothers, you or, you know,
8652880	8654600	Rayman Legends has five player co-op.
8654600	8659920	I can't get two player co-op in my household, let alone five people.
8659920	8662580	Let me get out here a couple points on Wii U from our chat room.
8662580	8667500	Shadownextgen in our chat room at vognetwork.com, click on live chat says, I love how no one
8667500	8668640	can see what is happening.
8668640	8672600	Mass Effect 3, for example, will obviously be late to the Wii U, but with EA BioWare
8672600	8678320	being on board with Wii U, that means Mass Effect 4 will be day date with the other consoles.
8678320	8682080	Black Wolf says, you know, if they didn't spend all that time discussing the new controller,
8682080	8685600	we would have been like, wait, why did you not give us more information on the controller?
8685600	8687920	No, we wouldn't have.
8687920	8690040	Yes, they would have.
8690040	8691640	I agree with them.
8691640	8693600	Unless you're just in the same boat that I am.
8693600	8694700	Don't care.
8694700	8697880	What more information did we get about their controller?
8697880	8702120	The quote unquote final design, and the whole fact that you can use two of them now, which
8702120	8703720	was a big thing people were bitching about last year.
8703720	8706280	That's not important though, but if you think about it, that's not important, because we
8706280	8709480	didn't see any games that used two of them, so who knows how that's going to be utilized,
8709480	8712320	and we already saw the final design and got leaked out already.
8712320	8715660	So what did we need to know about the controller that we didn't know already?
8715660	8716660	Back to the email.
8716660	8717660	Can I read the last email?
8717660	8721000	Greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8721000	8723660	I thought I'd say hi and keep up the good work.
8723660	8726680	Your show helps make my Mondays bearable at work.
8726680	8729440	I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions of E3.
8729440	8730440	One last thing.
8730440	8734480	I just bought my first smartphone and was wondering if there are any apps and or games.
8734480	8736520	Do you think I'd be crazy not to get?
8736520	8738920	Peace and Chicken Grease, Serious Turtle.
8738920	8739920	Yes.
8739920	8742600	And we need to know what kind of phone you have too.
8742600	8743600	We don't know what kind of phone.
8743600	8746280	There's a big difference between Android and iOS.
8746280	8749160	There's some games that are between both.
8749160	8753560	I like Cut the Rope, personally, and Temple Run.
8753560	8755400	I'm so addicted to Temple Run recently.
8755400	8759920	I got Bubble Bobble, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble, Best of Move.
8759920	8762400	I played the crap out of it.
8762400	8772120	And seriously, it is, you know, that I actually really liked Espigobluda too.
8772120	8778080	And I really, you know, as far as apps, I know I'm looking at my phone right now.
8778080	8783240	The Midway Arcade Collection isn't bad, especially because I think it was 99 cents or
8783240	8787320	relatively low cost, and it does have a lot in it, even though I kind of hate using the
8787320	8789080	touch screen controls.
8789080	8792160	Bejeweled Blitz is a free PopCap game.
8792160	8793160	That's pretty cool.
8793160	8794160	Pinball Arcade.
8794160	8796160	Oh, oh, yes, the Pinball games.
8796160	8797160	Oh my gosh.
8797160	8800680	There's Zen Pinball has a Pinball version, and then there's that new one too.
8800680	8801680	Yeah, Pinball Arcade.
8801680	8802680	There's Juke Beat.
8802680	8803820	I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy.
8803820	8804820	Both are worth getting.
8804820	8805820	Absolutely.
8805820	8806820	Robot Unicorn Attack, Peggle.
8806820	8807820	Plants vs. Zombies.
8807820	8809320	Beat Hazard is on iOS now.
8809320	8812220	You know, Plants vs. Zombies, I don't really like so much on the iPhone.
8812220	8814680	It would need a larger thing.
8814680	8818300	R-Type, actually, believe it or not, R-Type is one of the few shooters that works very
8818300	8819300	well on the iPhone.
8819300	8821720	Well, I'm just seeing what else I have.
8821720	8825140	As far as like regular apps, you know, I've got Facebook.
8825140	8826560	For Twitter, I use Echo Phone.
8826560	8828660	I paid for Echo Phone, and it's worth it.
8828660	8832340	If you're on iOS, Flipboard.
8832340	8835480	I have the Tumblr app, Goodreads, because I like to share my books.
8835480	8839600	The Steam app, AIM, Pinterest, you know, I've got all the usual stuff.
8839600	8840600	And then...
8840600	8841600	XTube?
8841600	8842600	Not Jamie.
8842600	8843600	Just kidding.
8843600	8848480	I've also got a program that, when I go to eat out, I use called Check, Please, that
8848480	8854840	actually splits your meal, includes or dis-includes tip, and lets you go up to 30% tip.
8854840	8856560	Ah, downloading that right now.
8856560	8859800	QR Reader, because of all the stuff using QR codes now.
8859800	8863240	And actually a really neat little clock program called Nuka.
8863240	8867760	Nuka does all these interesting different digital watches, and the Nuka app is actually
8867760	8871920	pretty fun to play with, and has neat timers and everything.
8871920	8875400	I have Secret Garden that Ikuma JP did.
8875400	8876960	I use Shazam all the time.
8876960	8879080	You're not going to go through all seven pages of your phone, are you?
8879080	8880080	No, I'm not.
8880080	8881320	I'm just picking the best ones.
8881320	8885840	I have the Kindle app, but I love Shazam because I go to Pinkberry and like the music, so I'll
8885840	8890480	tag the music at Pinkberry, and then I usually go and download albums.
8890480	8892640	If you're playing Mass Effect 3, get the data pad.
8892640	8897400	I mean, there's just lots of good stuff, and, you know, when you go to Disneyland, use Mouse
8897400	8902240	Plate, you know, so that you know how long you have to wait for Space Mountain.
8902240	8907240	But really, those are just some good ones, and that was the last email.
8907240	8908640	Awesome.
8908640	8912440	Just root your phone and download them all for free.
8912440	8917480	Alright, let's move on with the FUs of the week, because some things that E3 might have
8917480	8920320	made us angry, or maybe stuff IRL.
8920320	8937080	We're going to find out right now.
8937080	8941640	I'm not really upset about anything, except for my nail polish deciding that it all wanted
8941640	8947040	to come off tonight, and my nails are kind of brittle, so.
8947040	8951520	Fucking in my throat for being sore, it's not really, I don't know, it's like a weird
8951520	8952520	thing.
8952520	8955960	I don't know if it's allergies, or if it's cold, or strep throat, or what, but for like
8955960	8960520	the last two weeks, my throat's just been like, I'll get sharp pains every now and then,
8960520	8965600	and you might, I feel really raspy right now at this talk that I've made.
8965600	8968760	But like, I'll just all of a sudden, I'll be like talking, and like, ah, tickle, I have
8968760	8974480	to cough, and it hasn't gone away, and I really wish it would go away, because it's annoying.
8974480	8978000	I hope it's not strep throat, because then that means I have to have my tonsils out.
8978000	8980000	I haven't had that happen yet.
8980000	8985120	I like to keep all my body parts intact, even the unnecessary ones.
8985120	8990520	They are necessary, they do serve a purpose until they get infected.
8990520	8994280	You know, I still have everything I was born with except for my wisdom teeth.
8994280	8995280	Lucky you.
8995280	8998280	I'm missing a gallbladder, I'm missing wisdom teeth, anyway.
8998280	9003320	Uh, moving on, um, my F.U. of the week goes to, believe it or not, this is going to shock
9003320	9004320	you.
9004320	9005320	Disneyland.
9005320	9009400	Yep, Disneyland on Wednesday was a fucking hot mess, oh my gosh.
9009400	9013040	I guess all those people were there for the Cars Land preview, the cast members, and that
9013040	9016440	must have been all the veteran cast members, because the noobs were running the place.
9016440	9020080	And uh, yeah, just, just so crowded, especially for a Wednesday.
9020080	9025560	And I get that it's summer, but I've gone E3 week the last like three years, and I've
9025560	9027560	never had an experience as terrible as last week.
9027560	9029240	Like, every other year's been relatively good.
9029240	9030240	Okay, Rob.
9030240	9031240	I don't know, because I didn't get to go.
9031240	9033940	Tell me, how bad did the Mad Tea Party blow?
9033940	9037480	I think it wasn't running weeknights, but I did see the decorations.
9037480	9040560	The decorations looked great, they spent a lot of money on them, which kind of pissed
9040560	9041560	me off.
9041560	9046240	My friends were there this past weekend, they said it was the worst thing to ever happen.
9046240	9047240	That's too bad.
9047240	9048240	Yeah.
9048240	9051000	It was basically, what did you call it, the Mad Suck Party or something?
9051000	9052000	The Mad Flop Party.
9052000	9053000	That was the Mad Flop Party.
9053000	9054640	I like to call it the Mad Flop Party.
9054640	9060800	Um, but yeah, the one thing that bugged me most of all is that Disney don't, don't give
9060800	9064620	celebrities the royal treatment and shut down the entire fucking ride just because one celebrity
9064620	9065620	wants to ride it.
9065620	9069420	They need to, I'm not saying, look, I get if you want to have the little ushers, bring
9069420	9072600	them up the exit and give them a little bit of special treatment, but you don't stop the
9072600	9074480	entire fucking ride because the celebrity's on it.
9074480	9075480	I don't care.
9075480	9077080	I don't care if it's Barack Obama.
9077080	9078080	I don't care who it is.
9078080	9079140	That is kind of lame.
9079140	9081080	You don't stop for everybody else.
9081080	9082760	Who was a celebrity?
9082760	9085240	Uh, David Beckham and his wife Posh Spice.
9085240	9086240	Lame.
9086240	9092960	Yeah, they could do it at least for like a real celebrity like Neil Patrick Harris.
9092960	9094800	Anyhow that just kind of ticked me off.
9094800	9099900	So meanwhile, let's get back into, I know, I know, I, I, I, I just did not have a good
9099900	9102760	experience on Wednesday and that ticked me off cause it was like extra for Matt's first
9102760	9105940	experience at Disneyland and they enjoyed themselves cause we had a really good time
9105940	9106940	on Monday.
9106940	9110160	It wasn't nearly as bad and we got to fit in a lot of the good stuff, but Wednesday
9110160	9113480	was, was a mess.
9113480	9115800	I could go on and on, but I won't.
9115800	9120960	So meanwhile, Loki, let's get back into the gaming news, uh, uh, Twitter topics, a few,
9120960	9123160	and then Skypline most of all in a little bit.
9123160	9127640	So one of the rumors that we were supposed to get out of E3 was that one of these, um,
9127640	9131700	streaming companies is supposed to be partner of a console, but they didn't see that.
9131700	9135040	No OnLive or no, uh, Gaikai teaming up with consoles.
9135040	9142040	But OnLive did say that they are going to be teaming up with smart TV, um, manufacturers
9142040	9147640	including LG smart TVs with Google TV and internet browsers as well.
9147640	9153920	Um, they're going to be allowing the online service to be used in browser, um, which is
9153920	9154920	kind of neat.
9154920	9159640	And of course if you have a, one of those smart TVs, you can download an app that will
9159640	9164320	allow you to stream stuff and then you just have to buy the controller as well.
9164320	9166960	Um, that's kind of neat.
9166960	9173000	I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen smart TVs, you know, take off yet, but I mean, I'm
9173000	9174720	sure in the future we're going to see that.
9174720	9176960	I mean, everything's fucking connected to the internet now.
9176960	9179840	So pretty cool.
9179840	9184960	And of course when the games are showing on there's Borderlands, it looks sexy, of course.
9184960	9189460	Um, some other little details about the Wii U is some actually really good news because
9189460	9193420	Nintendo could have made the bad decision here, but they made the good decision.
9193420	9196640	So we need to, you know, I know we've been giving Nintendo a little bit of a hard time
9196640	9201000	tonight, but we need to applaud this decision and that is that Nintendo is working on the
9201000	9207360	system to figure out how Wii owners are going to transfer their content to the Wii U.
9207360	9213120	Designer Katsuya Iguchi said, uh, we are readying the system, yes, to transfer saves and everything
9213120	9214520	you've bought.
9214520	9218120	So the good news is if you bought virtual console stuff and WiiWare stuff, they're going
9218120	9221360	to transfer over to the Wii U and it doesn't sound like they're going to charge you more
9221360	9223360	for it or try to sell it to you again.
9223360	9224360	Yay.
9224360	9226960	Oh, that's good.
9226960	9228080	That is very good.
9228080	9229080	Have a cookie, Nintendo.
9229080	9233300	I wonder if it's being done with the friend code for the, cause that'll be tied to the
9233300	9234300	console.
9234300	9235300	Who knows?
9235300	9236300	Who knows?
9236300	9239360	Now, while there's good news, we have to of course follow that up with a little bit of
9239360	9240360	WTF news.
9240360	9246960	Uh, that whole Miiverse thing, it came out after the, uh, show that Miiverse, which will
9246960	9248880	allow you to kind of like post messages.
9248880	9251920	It's kind of like the Nintendo social network, I guess, for lack of a better term.
9251920	9256320	Uh, Satoru Iwata said there will be filtering on the Miiverse content.
9256320	9258880	The first will be automatic content filtering.
9258880	9262480	So if you post something that's like, fuck you and your fucking dog, it's going to hit
9262480	9265960	that filter cause it says the F word and won't post.
9265960	9274000	However, the second, there will be a moderator reading all posts before they're published.
9274000	9279520	That seems crazy, but yes, live people will be screening all the messages and they say
9279520	9283680	it may take about 30 minutes between the time you post something and the time it's actually
9283680	9285640	visible because of that delay.
9285640	9289600	Lastly, users can also flag if something is missed, which we know will happen at some
9289600	9290600	point.
9290600	9291600	That's lame.
9291600	9292600	That is extreme.
9292600	9298140	I mean, I get, I get that, you know, it's kind of like a forum so you can post stuff
9298140	9300440	and there should be moderators for that stuff.
9300440	9302040	That's fine.
9302040	9308260	I have a problem with them going all 1984 and just let's monitor every single thing.
9308260	9313920	And also being an adult owning a console, I don't give a fuck if the word fuck is in,
9313920	9314920	you know, something.
9314920	9315920	If they're like, fuck this boss.
9315920	9316920	I hate it.
9316920	9318600	I fucking died nine times.
9318600	9319600	That's acceptable to me.
9319600	9320880	I'm not a fucking little child.
9320880	9324560	I don't need to be, Oh, let's start.
9324560	9325620	Little children will be using it.
9325620	9326620	I understand that.
9326620	9327620	But you know what?
9327620	9333420	They have, they have wonderful parental technology, you know, that you can block this stuff so
9333420	9336720	you can put content filtering for those age groups.
9336720	9338800	They'll figure out how to override by themselves.
9338800	9343600	Well then you gotta be smart and fucking that maybe, well maybe this system will get overridden
9343600	9344600	too.
9344600	9346920	I, I want to be able to go post and Loki's me verse.
9346920	9347920	Fuck you.
9347920	9348920	You fucking fuck.
9348920	9352320	That should, that should be, that's what X-Box is for.
9352320	9353320	Rob.
9353320	9355360	No, that's for saying far worse words.
9355360	9356360	Go ahead.
9356360	9357360	Frisbee.
9357360	9358360	Everyone learned lead.
9358360	9362320	Um, by the way, probably moderators will know a little tangent here.
9362320	9365160	What about FIFA, FIFA and the whole connect thing.
9365160	9369720	If you fucking swear, you get, you get flagged by the shit is funny.
9369720	9370720	I'm sorry.
9370720	9371720	That is funny.
9371720	9372720	I know.
9372720	9373720	Yeah.
9373720	9374720	That's funny.
9374720	9377560	Like the, to me, the whole fact that the connect will pick it up if you're saying like, fuck
9377560	9379400	you flag.
9379400	9380400	That's funny.
9380400	9382040	If you don't like it, unplug the connect.
9382040	9387080	But if they have that technology, why don't we apply it to the goddamn X-Box service?
9387080	9388920	That's a little too big brother.
9388920	9392980	And if I want to say like, if we're playing mass effect online and I want to be like this
9392980	9397880	fucking Banshee bitch can S my D, you know, then I should be able to say I should be able
9397880	9398880	to swear on my TV.
9398880	9403120	But then again, here's the thing is that if I were to ever play FIFA, which is not going
9403120	9406840	to happen, I'm not going to fucking use connect.
9406840	9408120	Fuck that shit.
9408120	9410360	All right.
9410360	9416580	That's my, we, you news, uh, Esperanto.
9416580	9417580	You know what?
9417580	9419080	Actually, that's a great idea.
9419080	9422900	You know what, the average person actually can look at a page written in Esperanto and
9422900	9426580	figure out what it says because that's the purpose of the language.
9426580	9430240	Anyone who knows any little bit of Latin, which just about every English speaker does
9430240	9434840	know a little bit of Latin and Greek is part of the basis of our language and the romance
9434840	9435840	languages.
9435840	9438040	No Esperanto.
9438040	9440560	I've read a page in Esperanto and I've never learned it.
9440560	9441560	How do I say fuck you?
9441560	9444160	You fucking fucking Esperanto Frick year.
9444160	9445160	I don't know.
9445160	9446880	I'm going to look it up actually.
9446880	9449160	Well, read a story first.
9449160	9454960	Oh yeah, that, um, is being bitches.
9454960	9456720	That's my official title of this.
9456720	9463480	They're not going to copy steam 75% off sales because they think it cheapens the IP and
9463480	9466040	they don't want to copy that practice.
9466040	9471040	Um, there's a quote from David Demartini, the origin boss.
9471040	9474760	Um, obviously they think it's the right thing to do after a certain amount of time.
9474760	9479000	I think it, I just think it cheapens your intellectual property.
9479000	9483480	Um, honestly, steam is successful.
9483480	9488880	It clearly works and people are still forking out the money to buy the games.
9488880	9493240	So what about it is cheapening the IP if it's bringing it to a wider audience?
9493240	9496520	And it's not like steam's just going, okay, we're going to charge less for your game.
9496520	9497520	They're good.
9497520	9500880	They're coordinating with these different developers and publishers and saying, okay,
9500880	9506480	hey, we want to mark it down to drive up some, you know, business and you drive up some sales
9506480	9511640	for you guys as well as maybe bringing a little bit of, you know, exposure to your product
9511640	9513400	and then EA saying, ah, fuck it.
9513400	9514400	We don't care.
9514400	9515920	You know, well, you know what?
9515920	9517600	No one has to purchase stuff through origin.
9517600	9520160	Just saying, you know, there are other services out there.
9520160	9523720	So if you don't want to put your stuff on sale, then fine.
9523720	9524720	Someone else will.
9524720	9529040	Well, and here's another thing that he's saying is what steam does might be teaching the customer.
9529040	9532880	I might not want it in the first month, but if I look at it in four or five months, I'll
9532880	9536320	get one of those weekend sales and I'll buy it at that time at 75% off.
9536320	9541920	What he's not realizing is that people who are into the game will buy it when it comes
9541920	9542920	out.
9542920	9545000	They don't care about waiting for a sale.
9545000	9547120	They'll get it when it comes out.
9547120	9551360	You know, when portal two came out, now true, I didn't buy it for myself cause I knew I
9551360	9556720	was getting it for Christmas slash Hanukkah slash Kwanzaa slash Festivus, whatever, which
9556720	9557720	I did.
9557720	9561360	Um, but I was all hot and bothered to buy it when it came out.
9561360	9566360	You know, so I've bought, like I bought fractal when it came out, you know, I've bought tons
9566360	9571060	of games when they've come out, even though I knew, like for example, okay, here, here's
9571060	9572560	a good example.
9572560	9578860	Um, Marvel versus Capcom three or no, um, not Marvel versus, yeah, I bought it right
9578860	9579860	when it came out.
9579860	9581200	Well, Dan bought it right when it came out.
9581200	9584860	As soon as ultimate Marvel and we knew ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three would be out and
9584860	9585860	guess what?
9585860	9586860	We bought that too.
9586860	9589520	It just, if someone wants it, they don't care.
9589520	9590520	They're going to go get it.
9590520	9593920	The sheer amount of games I've purchased on steam, well, mostly through the Humblelandy
9593920	9599600	bundles, but I have not played most of them and I have a lot of people, you know, my coworkers
9599600	9603920	and stuff that buy stuff on steam that say, yeah, I'll see this game for like five bucks.
9603920	9607960	I'm like, fuck, I'm going to pick that up because I may play it eventually.
9607960	9614680	So there's a lot of really quick, um, just spontaneous purchases because of these sales.
9614680	9617160	And I think it's, you know, sure.
9617160	9623920	Keep your game at $20, you know, and someone may pick it up or drop the $5 and the check
9623920	9624920	stand purchase.
9624920	9625920	Yeah.
9625920	9628680	It's, you know, when you're in line at the grocery store and go, Oh man, I love Twix
9628680	9629680	two for a buck.
9629680	9632760	And it's usually a lot of these independent games that most people aren't like aware of
9632760	9633760	that.
9633760	9634760	Oh, I sense all.
9634760	9635760	Yeah, sure.
9635760	9639440	I'll try it for, if it's a buck, you know, if it sucks, whatever I paid five bucks for
9639440	9644360	a game, just, you know, like I've played the binding of Isaac for like five minutes, which
9644360	9646600	was another game I played this week.
9646600	9647600	Oops.
9647600	9648720	Um, but you know, it's good.
9648720	9652680	It's something I can go back, you know, if I'm feeling kind of bored, I don't have anything
9652680	9656820	to do, then I can go in and play cave story, which I, you know, bought on the hundle indie
9656820	9659180	bundle before too.
9659180	9667600	So it's, he's not, he's using a business, the business mentality and not real world
9667600	9668600	common sense.
9668600	9674120	Well, at the end of story, origin is not as big of a deal as steam is at the end of the
9674120	9675120	day.
9675120	9676700	What brought people into steam?
9676700	9677700	Those sales.
9677700	9678700	Duh.
9678700	9683680	Well, and here's another thing that he says, um, we don't believe in the drop it down,
9683680	9687440	spring it up 75% off approach, which is not necessarily what steam is doing.
9687440	9692040	Um, but we've got something else that we do believe in that we'll be rolling out.
9692040	9695880	I don't know what that is and honestly I don't care because I'm only going to ever play one
9695880	9696880	game on origin.
9696880	9701120	If I have to buy 10 get one free and they're stupid anyways because they're like, Oh, we
9701120	9704660	don't believe in marking stuff down and bringing it back up and price clearly don't believe
9704660	9705660	in making money.
9705660	9712160	Well, apparently you're, you didn't have no idea what your, you know, iOS team is doing
9712160	9716560	because there's a lot of EA games that go down the 99 cents when those properties are
9716560	9718240	like $7 or whatever.
9718240	9719240	Well said.
9719240	9725200	Well, so it's like, I mean, Hey, you, you're talking this talk right here, but at the same
9725200	9727680	time you're doing something completely different in this platform.
9727680	9728680	So you know why?
9728680	9729680	Who gives a fuck?
9729680	9732480	What do you want to do and you know, people hate it and then they'll just won't go to
9732480	9733480	your service.
9733480	9738020	You'll eventually fold if it doesn't work for you that whatever your plan is, that's
9738020	9739020	the way it is.
9739020	9740020	All right.
9740020	9741020	Two more stories.
9741020	9742020	And then the Skypline Loki.
9742020	9747280	So there's a new app that's going to be coming to Xbox, um, pretty soon.
9747280	9749640	And it's the Virgin gaming app.
9749640	9753980	And what the Virgin gaming app is going to do is it's going to run a tournament service.
9753980	9759980	And so you can, um, launch into a bunch of different Xbox live tournaments, including,
9759980	9764600	and this of course is, you know, with, uh, Xbox gold.
9764600	9767640	Um, apparently you can, uh, enter different tournaments.
9767640	9772880	Some are free, some are with a paid entry and you can compete in a variety of different
9772880	9774960	games, um, through their service.
9774960	9778400	I think they actually do this right now through their website, um, Virgin gaming.
9778400	9785180	But I guess right now they're going to be partnering with EA sports, 2k sports and Ubisoft,
9785180	9789200	and they're going to have different, like, you know, matchmaking, um, stuff.
9789200	9799800	And also, I don't know, some, uh, different services was it pay to have pays to have game
9799800	9802080	as their tagline for Virgin gaming.
9802080	9805000	It'll be interesting to see what it is.
9805000	9809400	I'm curious on how that's really going to work and, um, you know, how we can leverage
9809400	9812980	it to have tournaments for OLR and VOG network and so forth.
9812980	9813980	But, uh, we'll see.
9813980	9814980	Too bad.
9814980	9818420	Too bad they didn't do this shit back in the day when Grand Theft Auto wasn't modded the
9818420	9823720	fucking hell because I kicked a lot of ass in vanilla Grand Theft Auto and episodes from
9823720	9824720	Liberty City.
9824720	9826280	Well, there's always Grand Theft Auto 5.
9826280	9827280	There is.
9827280	9829120	I will fucking own that shit again.
9829120	9830620	I am ready.
9830620	9831620	Your body is ready.
9831620	9835720	I need, I need to play Max Payne 3 because that's supposed to be pretty awesome, but
9835720	9838760	Grand Theft Auto 5, I will dedicate my life to that game.
9838760	9840760	Alright, let's move on to one last story here.
9840760	9844400	I want to end on a good note with the stories tonight and this is a great note.
9844400	9847320	And, uh, you know, we talked a little bit last week about, you know, Curt Schilling's
9847320	9851920	studio and all the closures and all that, but a big, huge games, one of the studios
9851920	9858320	that was, uh, closed in that whole 38 Studios, uh, debacle from a couple weeks ago has basically
9858320	9861960	been gobbled up by Epic Games.
9861960	9865820	And this is good news because Epic Games is going to open a brand new studio called Epic
9865820	9870000	Baltimore and it's made up of the folks from Big Huge Games.
9870000	9874000	I think that's quite awesome that basically, um, they, they've helped them find jobs.
9874000	9877660	Of course, not everybody's going to go cause some people might, you know, decide to do
9877660	9880800	something else, but most of them sounds like you're going over to this.
9880800	9885320	The official quote on this from Epic Games President Michael Capps quote, on Wednesday,
9885320	9891000	the ex, uh, BHG, Big Huge Games leadership game leadership team contacted us.
9891000	9894600	They wanted to start a new company and keep together some of the key talent displaced
9894600	9899300	by the layoff and hope that they could use an Epic IP as a starting point for a new game.
9899300	9902900	We love that they all wanted to keep working together, but it was pretty clear they'd have
9902900	9907520	trouble building a demo and securing funding before their personal savings ran out.
9907520	9908640	So there they go.
9908640	9910700	They are going to be working on a big IP.
9910700	9912040	Who knows what it is?
9912040	9918120	It won't be reckoning to though, unless Epic ends up buying that IP because I believe the
9918120	9923080	state of Maryland owns that now or Rhode Island, excuse me, also their thing was, is we make
9923080	9924080	IP.
9924080	9927080	We don't buy IP, so they're not going to buy the IP.
9927080	9933000	Uh, Blackwell ventures a guest that Epic Baltimore could be making infinity blade for consoles.
9933000	9938000	That is a pretty big, uh, Epic IP that, you know, wouldn't surprise me.
9938000	9943720	You know what would fit down, uh, fit right with, um, Epic in that it's something that
9943720	9947760	kind of got canceled a long time ago, even though it looked really awesome.
9947760	9950120	Project offset would have been fucking amazing.
9950120	9954440	It was that first person, like fantasy RPG game that was like a first person shooter
9954440	9958560	almost, but like with giant dragons and shit, it looked really amazing.
9958560	9959560	That would be cool.
9959560	9965120	Like a project offset game, but developed by Epic, like an RPG fantasy game, but like
9965120	9967040	Gears of War, I guess.
9967040	9968280	Let's open up the Skype line.
9968280	9973200	It is open one eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
9973200	9977240	Certainly you have something to say about the news tonight, so give us a call and we
9977240	9980280	will talk E3 or whatever it is that's on your mind tonight.
9980280	9984360	In the meantime, um, quickly, let's try to fit in a couple of last minute stories here.
9984360	9985360	Loki.
9985360	9989360	Um, so yes, let's, uh, I don't have anything pulled up again.
9989360	9990360	Oh, you don't?
9990360	9991360	That's all right.
9991360	9992360	I can go to Twitter.
9992360	9993360	All right, let me go to Twitter real quick.
9993360	9997840	Let me bring it up cause I wasn't prepared for that either.
9997840	9998840	That's okay.
9998840	9999840	All right.
9999840	10003320	We do have some tweets at twitter.com slash O L R. Oh, and how convenient.
10003320	10004800	Skypline's already going off.
10004800	10008640	Now you have some time to pull up the other stuff higher on orange house radio.
10008640	10009640	Who's this?
10009640	10010640	It's Shane.
10010640	10011640	Hey, hey, hey Shane.
10011640	10012760	How you doing?
10012760	10016260	I'm tired and hungry and grouchy.
10016260	10017260	Why are you grouchy?
10017260	10019720	Cause I can't eat or drink anything.
10019720	10022000	So are you supposed to be fasting for something?
10022000	10023800	No, I have surgery tomorrow.
10023800	10026160	So I'm not supposed to eat or drink.
10026160	10027400	So you're fasting for something.
10027400	10028400	I guess.
10028400	10029400	Okay, fine.
10029400	10030400	Yeah.
10030400	10032400	But not a good reason.
10032400	10038560	Well, good luck with all of that stuff and can't wait to talk to you when you're on drugs.
10038560	10043680	I know that will be why you should tune into Horde house on Tuesday, which by the way gets
10043680	10045840	it's, well, they, they don't hear it on Tuesday.
10045840	10049600	They hear it on Wednesday, Wednesday live, not live.
10049600	10050600	Damn it.
10050600	10052040	It's new for us.
10052040	10057720	Should I just hang up and we could start this over premiered at vog network.com on Warcraft
10057720	10060280	Wednesdays and then on the podcast feed Wednesday night.
10060280	10061280	All right.
10061280	10062560	Anyhow, they don't need to know it's tape Tuesdays.
10062560	10063560	All right.
10063560	10064840	So Shane, what are you talking about?
10064840	10066040	It's not taped on Tuesday.
10066040	10067040	That's right.
10067040	10068400	It's taped really quickly.
10068400	10069400	Live.
10069400	10070400	All right.
10070400	10075100	Shane's been playing guru for me in private messages for Mass Effect so that I actually
10075100	10079020	will not go to Noveria first.
10079020	10080020	It's what I do.
10080020	10081020	All right.
10081020	10082020	You do too.
10082020	10083160	What did you want to call on the show about tonight?
10083160	10084160	Shane?
10084160	10085160	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
10085160	10086160	No, wait.
10086160	10087160	I don't want to hear what you have to say.
10087160	10088160	I want to talk about your corgi.
10088160	10090160	I want to talk about your corgi.
10090160	10091160	Yes.
10091160	10094140	My corgi that I will have this weekend.
10094140	10096220	So he's not your corgi yet.
10096220	10097760	He's my corgi.
10097760	10099720	You put a deposit down on the corgi.
10099720	10100720	Yes.
10100720	10105120	Because that specific one that I showed you a picture of the corgi can exactly help you
10105120	10106120	recover from surgery.
10106120	10109760	In fact, that might make things worse.
10109760	10110760	Hopefully but I don't care.
10110760	10113280	I'm going to share with everyone what I shared with Shane earlier.
10113280	10114280	What?
10114280	10115280	You know what corgi means?
10115280	10116840	Sheepdog in Welsh.
10116840	10117840	So you're getting a sheep.
10117840	10118840	Wait a minute.
10118840	10119840	But you're afraid of sheep.
10119840	10121680	Then it will run it away clearly.
10121680	10124600	That's what sheepdogs before they heard sheep.
10124600	10125600	Away from me.
10125600	10126600	Yes.
10126600	10127600	All right.
10127600	10128600	Fair enough.
10128600	10129600	All right.
10129600	10130600	What?
10130600	10131600	Okay.
10131600	10132600	Now I'll hear what you have to say.
10132600	10133600	What did you, what did you really want to call in about tonight?
10133600	10138240	I just wanted to gloat because clearly I won that list list from a couple of weeks ago.
10138240	10139240	What makes you say that?
10139240	10142200	It's a segment of the show where we come up with a definitive list.
10142200	10143200	Yes.
10143200	10144200	Yeah.
10144200	10149360	And we had to say what we wanted on Wii U and of everything we all said, me talking
10149360	10153280	about Mass Effect was the only thing that came true.
10153280	10155640	Well congratulations, Shane.
10155640	10157920	You get a no prize.
10157920	10158920	Yeah.
10158920	10159920	You get a new version of Mass Effect.
10159920	10160920	I know.
10160920	10164120	Shane can have a raspberry.
10164120	10168520	I can someday give you a free piece of loot on voggenetwork.com.
10168520	10169520	How's that sound?
10169520	10170520	No.
10170520	10171520	I want something worth something.
10171520	10172520	Hey now.
10172520	10176880	Hey now don't devalue the loot at voggenetwork.com.
10176880	10181160	I can't sell it or make money off of it.
10181160	10186360	You can soon post it on your profile like you're supposed to be able to do in home.
10186360	10187360	What have a profile?
10187360	10188360	Yeah.
10188360	10192360	You can have one night alone with Kayden.
10192360	10193360	How about that?
10193360	10197640	I don't know.
10197640	10204080	You're like, just one.
10204080	10210100	What if they decide in Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U, they're just going to not have Kayden
10210100	10212960	in it because they're just going to say, you know what, we're going to just go with this
10212960	10214840	storyline from the first game.
10214840	10218840	What if, because it's on Nintendo console, they cut out all the sex scenes?
10218840	10224520	Oh, oh, I don't know if I could get it then.
10224520	10227320	I'm still waiting for the Garrisnookie, so.
10227320	10229280	You have to wait till, well I should just go.
10229280	10230280	I know.
10230280	10231280	It's in the second one.
10231280	10232280	I know.
10232280	10233280	All right.
10233280	10236680	So in the first one I've decided that I am going to bang the hell out of Kayden.
10236680	10238240	Just out of support for Shayne.
10238240	10239240	Good.
10239240	10240240	Thank you.
10240240	10241240	What?
10241240	10242240	That's the right way to play the game.
10242240	10243240	Because Ashley's a bitch.
10243240	10244240	Yes.
10244240	10245240	Oh, I've taught you well.
10245240	10246240	I don't like her.
10246240	10253320	I like Tali, but she's kind of dumb.
10253320	10259440	The other thing I was calling in about, because I care, so other people should care.
10259440	10264980	The new DJ Maxx game on Vita, while it doesn't have a release date, I guess Pentavision confirmed
10264980	10268760	that there will be a collector's edition in America.
10268760	10274960	And they announced three of the licenses already, which are just songs from the previous games.
10274960	10278600	But it's still something important because we actually get a real honest to goodness
10278600	10280600	K-pop license.
10280600	10281600	That's cool.
10281600	10286760	What bands are we expecting to see under the...
10286760	10292460	Right now we've only got a K-pop group called Cara, I don't know how to say it, with their
10292460	10294800	song Step from Technica.
10294800	10301120	And then a guy named Mr. Funky, who does a lot of music for the later DJ Maxx games with
10301120	10307740	Rockstar and Signalize by Paul Bazuka, who again does a lot of music for the later games.
10307740	10311240	But what's interesting is that I don't know where Step is from.
10311240	10317400	I know it's from a Technica game, but Rockstar and Signalize are both from the latest Technica
10317400	10319560	game that came out, Technica 3.
10319560	10325880	So we might see more transplants from current music instead of stuff from way back when.
10325880	10329000	And that makes me happy.
10329000	10332120	That sounds like it would be worthy, I believe.
10332120	10333120	Yes.
10333120	10336840	I just need to know how many hundreds of dollars I'm going to spend on this collector's edition,
10336840	10338680	because that will happen.
10338680	10343200	It'll probably only be like $10 or $20 more than retail.
10343200	10344200	Yeah, probably.
10344200	10348080	And it won't come with anything that's worth anything, like they haven't in a while.
10348080	10356280	I used to get awesome puzzles and face masks, and in the last one I got a CD and a crappy
10356280	10357440	book.
10357440	10360200	So it might not actually be worth it, I'll just download the game instead.
10360200	10363960	All right, Shane, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
10363960	10365280	Whatever, that's fine.
10365280	10367360	All right, talk to you later in the week.
10367360	10368360	Okay.
10368360	10369360	Happy surgery.
10369360	10370360	Thank you.
10370360	10371360	Bye.
10371360	10372360	Bye.
10372360	10375960	1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10375960	10376960	Sorry about that, guys.
10376960	10379800	We just had Bugmageddon here in the studio.
10379800	10381760	I don't know why, like tons of bugs.
10381760	10383720	They just love the light.
10383720	10387960	And Alan's trying to do laundry outside and had to run in, and all the bugs followed him.
10387960	10388960	It's gross.
10388960	10389960	Raid everywhere.
10389960	10395160	1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10395160	10397040	Are you ready for last minute stories now, Loki?
10397040	10398440	You just have one thing.
10398440	10399440	All right, that's fine.
10399440	10400440	I'll go to tweets after that.
10400440	10401440	All right.
10401440	10406440	So there is a new Kickstarter for a sword fighting game called Klang.
10406440	10410680	And you know, it's always good to have a good video to, you know, get people interested
10410680	10412400	about your property.
10412400	10416520	Well, they got Gabe Newell in there.
10416520	10421860	Apparently, he is quite handy with blacksmithing.
10421860	10425840	And so of course, he was in there to poke fun at the fact that Half-Life 3 is not out
10425840	10427400	and he was a jerk.
10427400	10429120	He was forging a new crowbar.
10429120	10430120	All right.
10430120	10431120	Let me go to the phones.
10431120	10432120	We had another call on the line.
10432120	10433120	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10433120	10434120	Who's this?
10434120	10436120	Chugga chugga choo choo, motherfuckers.
10436120	10437120	It's Jim Sally.
10437120	10438120	Hey, hey.
10438120	10440080	Hey, and you can say that word on this show.
10440080	10441080	I'm sorry.
10441080	10442080	You know that, right, man?
10442080	10446040	I'm so sick of being held back on Bobby's show.
10446040	10448880	Hey, he's just taking the Nintendo approach.
10448880	10449880	It's all right.
10449880	10450880	Oh, fuck.
10450880	10451880	I love this.
10451880	10454880	You guys, I love this new Nintendo approach with moderating everyone's shit.
10454880	10459880	I don't, I don't, listen, I know most people are complaining about this bullshit that they're
10459880	10462360	going to monitor everything before you post it up or whatever.
10462360	10464720	I'm thinking cha-ching, cha-ching, motherfuckers.
10464720	10465960	I just sent my resume off.
10465960	10469800	I could, I could probably weed through that shit at home all day.
10469800	10475000	Maybe there will actually be some type of like Nintendo reality show where people audition
10475000	10478080	to be one of the moderators and they'll call it The Moderator.
10478080	10480640	Oh, that's a genius idea.
10480640	10482200	And it'll be on the Nintendo network.
10482200	10486400	It sounds like, it sounds like something a Japanese company would do for sure.
10486400	10487400	And you could compete.
10487400	10489160	Fucking right I can.
10489160	10491640	I mean, friggin' right I can.
10491640	10492640	All right.
10492640	10495920	So what, no, really, what are your thoughts on E3 this week, Jim Salley?
10495920	10498040	It was all next to nothing.
10498040	10502360	Like, every time I watch E3, I'm just, I don't want to say I'm depressed afterwards, but
10502360	10505960	like, I feel like I was let down the last couple of years.
10505960	10508320	You wouldn't say you're depressed because you look for the cyanide?
10508320	10511480	No, I didn't, no, I didn't make the Kool-Aid.
10511480	10515760	I didn't make Kool-Aid with Vocky in it, because I thought we were going to get some crazy
10515760	10519960	shit to see, but nope, we didn't get nothing.
10519960	10522600	Wii U is pretty weird though, it's strange.
10522600	10525080	What about the stuff that everybody's going crazy about?
10525080	10528160	What about the Watch Dogs and the Beyond Two Swords?
10528160	10535080	Ah, that's all garbage to Jim Salley, listen, if it's not, if it's not Halo 4, it's everything
10535080	10536080	else.
10536080	10537080	That's all I'm going to say.
10537080	10538720	So you're a Halo 4 fan?
10538720	10540400	Who doesn't love, who isn't a Halo game?
10540400	10542040	Who doesn't love Halo?
10542040	10548840	Well, I have fallen out of love with Halo a bit since all the stuff after 3, but I will
10548840	10551760	say Halo 4 looks pretty darn interesting.
10551760	10554840	What do you think kind of about the different look, it has kind of a different look to it,
10554840	10556560	what do you think of it?
10556560	10560920	I think it's about time we changed it up a little bit anyway, I was getting kind of drab
10560920	10565360	before, almost like redundant before, so we're not changing up a little bit.
10565360	10570200	I'm really concerned though with the online, I wonder how well they'll do, because Bungie
10570200	10571200	kind of babied us.
10571200	10573200	They did it right for a long time.
10573200	10576280	So do you think the change in studio was a good thing?
10576280	10580520	Ah, yeah, because to be honest with you, I don't think Bungie could keep it up, they
10580520	10584600	said it themselves, that they were getting kind of sick of, not honestly sick, but they
10584600	10589080	were getting kind of bored with doing Halo, right, and if they're not going to have that
10589080	10593440	same drive to build the great Halos like they did in the past, then it is time to pass the
10593440	10596000	torch on to someone new.
10596000	10600400	And I can agree with that, I mean, especially, it actually has to do with I think anything
10600400	10603400	that one is working on, if you don't have the enthusiasm, it's going to show in the
10603400	10604400	end product.
10604400	10609280	Exactly, right, which is why we see a lot of Obsidian games, when they're just, they
10609280	10612160	know they're only getting the sequel, right, they just pump it out as quick as they can,
10612160	10615040	because they just need to get their money and they want to be done with it, they don't
10615040	10617040	care, they want to move on.
10617040	10618040	Yeah.
10618040	10620840	It's sad, it was an error though, man.
10620840	10624560	So what else does the Jim Sally train want to share with us tonight here on OLR?
10624560	10626520	Is Loki there, or is he eating pizza right now?
10626520	10627520	I'm right here.
10627520	10633560	Listen, I'm really ashamed of myself, I'm going to admit this to you, but I've been
10633560	10640680	at the very last mission of Grand Theft Auto IV for about a year, and I can't fly a fucking
10640680	10642280	helicopter to save my life.
10642280	10645200	That's alright, their controls are kind of terrible.
10645200	10648920	Is there like a cheat though, or something I can do, like, it's got to be some sort of
10648920	10649920	a cheat.
10649920	10651280	To control the helicopter better?
10651280	10655920	I don't know, like a helicopter doesn't die mode or something?
10655920	10662760	Well you can put in your god mode code and just bring up your phone, and then when you
10662760	10671800	have the phone up, you can just keep hitting the health, it's the GTA555-0100 is the number,
10671800	10676320	and then basically you just keep hitting that and you'll keep replenishing the health on
10676320	10677880	the helicopter.
10677880	10686240	Really though, it's difficult to keep shooting down the bad guy in the game.
10686240	10690360	So really my best bet is to go get a kid from the elementary school to come over and just
10690360	10691360	do it for me?
10691360	10698680	Yeah, you could do that, or I mean, you can hack it even further, but it's probably just
10698680	10702520	easier just to use that cheat code if that's the way you want to go.
10702520	10704520	But I have to type that in as I'm falling to my death?
10704520	10708680	No, no, you just type it into your phone beforehand so you have that cheat up, and then you bring
10708680	10713720	it up on your cheats menu in the phone, and then you can just keep hitting A over and
10713720	10719800	over or X or whatever, and each time you hit it, it'll recover the health in your helicopter,
10719800	10725600	or you can just wait until your helicopter starts smoking or whatever, and it'll replenish
10725600	10729640	the health on the helicopter.
10729640	10733720	You're my best friend, Loki.
10733720	10734720	There you go.
10734720	10737720	Friends are made, and now you have something to do right after the show.
10737720	10738720	Right after the show, baby!
10738720	10739720	It's time to go finish.
10739720	10740720	GTA 5-5-5!
10740720	10741720	All right.
10741720	10745320	Jim, Sally, I gotta let you go so we can get into some more calls, but thanks so much for
10745320	10746320	stopping in tonight.
10746320	10747320	Okay, man.
10747320	10749520	I just want to dedicate this call to my buddy Birdman.
10749520	10753120	Listen, Bird, if you've been drinking too much and I gotta call your brother to come
10753120	10757960	over and take you home at the party, then maybe you've had too many beers, Birdy, or
10757960	10759520	not enough.
10759520	10760520	And don't drink and drive, ever.
10760520	10761520	Don't drink and drive.
10761520	10762520	That's why I called your brother.
10762520	10764120	You drunk fuck, Bird.
10764120	10765120	Jesus Christ, man.
10765120	10766120	All right, Birdman.
10766120	10768520	Don't drive your car to my house and drink a six-pack of beers.
10768520	10769520	Get the fuck out of here, Bird.
10769520	10770520	Go with your brother.
10770520	10771520	I love you, Sky.
10771520	10772520	All right.
10772520	10773520	Love you, too.
10773520	10774520	Take care.
10774520	10775520	All right, thanks.
10775520	10776520	Thanks, Loki.
10776520	10777520	No problem.
10777520	10778520	Oh, I see how it is.
10778520	10782520	I was gonna say bye, Darkie, but I guess not now.
10782520	10783520	Aww.
10783520	10784520	Heart.
10784520	10785520	Bye, sweet Darkie.
10785520	10786520	Heart face.
10786520	10787520	Little bum.
10787520	10788520	I made the little bum thing for you.
10788520	10789520	Making duck face.
10789520	10790520	With the three.
10790520	10791520	With the number three.
10791520	10792520	I'm hanging up now.
10792520	10793520	Bye, Jim Sally.
10793520	10799520	Everybody look at my bum.
10799520	10801520	That was a great note to end on.
10801520	10802520	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10802520	10807120	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10807120	10810520	If you think you can follow that call, good luck to you.
10810520	10815020	Meanwhile, I'm gonna try to do Twitter topics here.
10815020	10818520	Every time I've done it, though, I've been derailed, though, but we'll go to a couple
10818520	10819520	tweets here.
10819520	10827520	TigerClaw305 sent us a tweet about Nexon pays $685 million for 14.7% of NCSoft.
10827520	10828520	NCSoft.
10828520	10830520	They've made games like Guild Wars.
10830520	10831520	I know it's one of their big titles.
10831520	10832520	Ion.
10832520	10834520	They've done a couple other MMOs as well.
10834520	10838520	They are now the largest shareholder in NCSoft.
10838520	10840520	So, there you go.
10840520	10841520	Very cool.
10841520	10846520	That's part of a two-year agreement between these two South Korean gaming companies.
10846520	10851520	So, we'll see what is born of that partnership later on.
10851520	10858520	TigerClaw sent us another tweet about Kojima seeing social and core games converging together.
10858520	10861520	And this is kind of some of what you saw in some of Nintendo's presentation.
10861520	10863520	That's what Kojima said.
10863520	10866520	In an interview with CVG, he said, quote,
10866520	10869520	I don't think social and core games are separate.
10869520	10874520	Both will evolve together, and at some point, I feel the social side of things will converge
10874520	10875520	with the core gamers.
10875520	10881520	I think in the future, maybe Metal Gear will change in certain ways to integrate social aspects.
10881520	10885520	If you look at other games on the market now, you can see it's already happening.
10885520	10888520	So, Metal Gear may at some point get involved.
10888520	10890520	How do you guys feel about that?
10890520	10894520	Do you think he's onto something there, or do you think maybe too far?
10894520	10896520	Casual Metal Gear game?
10896520	10898520	Yeah, I don't know about that.
10898520	10900520	That's very interesting.
10900520	10908520	I mean, I thought what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network did was already kind of social,
10908520	10911520	and not that it's always showing the best parts of society.
10911520	10914520	But, you know, I kind of thought that was the social gaming.
10914520	10918520	Because what used to be social gaming arcades.
10918520	10921520	And look what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network has done to arcades.
10921520	10923520	I don't know.
10923520	10927520	I don't think, I mean, when I hear this, I think Facebook games.
10927520	10930520	And there's very few Facebook games I get excited about.
10930520	10931520	Very, very few.
10931520	10934520	Although, I will say, you don't know Jack is pretty fucking awesome on Facebook.
10934520	10936520	Just saying.
10936520	10938520	Hmm.
10938520	10940520	I've derailed the chat room, and this is epic.
10940520	10943520	We're talking about Filipino food now.
10943520	10948520	One more call, or one more, time for one more call, and I'll get to one more tweet here.
10948520	10953520	1877 game OLR again, or a username on Skype is orangeonsradiolastcall for calls.
10953520	10956520	Meanwhile, we got one more tweet here from actdeft.
10956520	10961520	The Nubuo Summer Bundle Kickstarter.
10961520	10963520	So it's a Kickstarter that he's linked us to.
10963520	10966520	It's music inspired by video games.
10966520	10967520	And it's a Kickstarter.
10967520	10970520	They're trying to raise $8,000.
10970520	10971520	And why are they doing this?
10971520	10976520	Well, they're trying to do video game music information in English and Japanese.
10976520	10981520	A two-CD original and arranged soundtrack album for the browser game Rokochan.
10981520	10983520	And doing some different design work there.
10983520	10987520	Proceeds of the Kickstarter will benefit the bundle's eight participating musicians.
10987520	10990520	And will be the first source of funding for the Rokochan team.
10990520	10996520	So I guess it's kind of like a little bit of a startup company here slash get a cool little soundtrack album.
10996520	10999520	I will say this though, some of the albums that are included in this,
10999520	11006520	Super Meat Boy Choice Piano Cuts, Splatterhouse Volume 1 Volume 2, and Splatterhouse Butchered.
11006520	11009520	So if you're a Splatterhouse fan, also in there in the arranged pack,
11009520	11014520	Looks like our friend Mega Ran who was on the show a few weeks ago is involved there with Black Materia the remixes.
11014520	11016520	As well as some stuff by Metroid Metal.
11016520	11018520	So those are some groups you should know of.
11018520	11023520	So go onto Kickstarter and search for N-U-B-U-W-O.
11023520	11025520	Nubwo.
11025520	11026520	There it is.
11026520	11028520	That's it for tweets.
11028520	11029520	The phone ain't going off.
11029520	11032520	So I'm thinking the show's about over.
11032520	11036520	Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight to our little program.
11036520	11042520	We really appreciate you guys tuning in every week and supporting independent podcasting.
11042520	11043520	We really appreciate your support.
11043520	11050520	Again, if you like what you hear, leave us a nice review on iTunes or whatever pod software site you use to get this.
11050520	11051520	There's a new one now.
11051520	11052520	There's Stitcher Radio.
11052520	11057520	If you don't download podcasts directly to your device, there's an app in the App Store.
11057520	11060520	And it's also, it's iOS and it's Android called Stitcher Radio.
11060520	11063520	And you can give us thumbs up and likes and stuff.
11063520	11065520	And there actually is like a chart that ranks shows.
11065520	11068520	And I think last I looked, we were number 40 or something in games.
11068520	11070520	And we can go a little higher, right?
11070520	11072520	Give us some thumbs up.
11072520	11073520	Stitcher's free.
11073520	11074520	So go get it.
11074520	11075520	Give us some thumbs up.
11075520	11076520	It's on the web too.
11076520	11080520	I'll have to get the link for the website or Tiger Claw will beat me to it in about five seconds here.
11080520	11083520	We could definitely use your thumbs up and your likes over there on Stitcher Radio.
11083520	11085520	We'd really appreciate that.
11085520	11086520	Or just tell a friend.
11086520	11092520	Word of mouth is how we spread the good word of Orange Launch Radio and grow the O.L. Army.
11092520	11096520	Before we conclude tonight, though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11096520	11098520	Dark Sakura, we'll start you tonight. Ladies first.
11098520	11100520	I'm changing the fortune cookie.
11100520	11101520	You can't do that.
11101520	11102520	Yes, I can.
11102520	11104520	Alright, fine. You can change the fortune cookie.
11104520	11106520	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11106520	11109520	I have to get off Kickstarter. It's dangerous.
11109520	11111520	Spending too much money?
11111520	11114520	Well, no, I've been luckily not spending too much money.
11114520	11117520	But I'll talk to you out there about stuff.
11117520	11122520	I don't know. I've just seen some of these ideas that people come up with.
11122520	11123520	It's just like, really?
11123520	11125520	No, we're not doing a Kickstarter.
11125520	11127520	No, no, no, no, no.
11127520	11128520	Not at all.
11128520	11129520	Alright.
11129520	11131520	Not at all. There's definitely no one I'm getting at.
11131520	11132520	Alright.
11132520	11140520	My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to eating what's in that crock pot right over there in the corner of the room.
11140520	11147520	And all those bugs can go die of raid poisoning. Stupid bugs.
11147520	11150520	That's it. We're done. We're out of here.
11150520	11153520	Thank you everybody so much for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.
11153520	11155520	And we'll see you again next week.
11155520	11159520	We didn't mention it all tonight, surprisingly, just because E3 has kind of dominated everything.
11159520	11166520	But I will mention now, we are two weeks away from the ten year Orange Lounge Radio anniversary show.
11166520	11167520	If you can believe it.
11167520	11168520	That's a long time.
11168520	11170520	Two weeks away.
11170520	11172520	Are you going to be here?
11172520	11173520	Yeah, I'll be here.
11173520	11175520	Okay, there was a week you weren't going to be here.
11175520	11176520	That was supposed to be this week.
11176520	11177520	Oh, but you made it anyway.
11177520	11178520	Yeah.
11178520	11179520	Oh, hooray.
11179520	11180520	Alright, great.
11180520	11181520	So are you really giving me the webcam?
11181520	11184520	Yes, I'm giving you the, well technically that was from Akuma JP.
11184520	11187520	So Akuma JP gave you, then gave me, then gave you back the webcam.
11187520	11188520	Cool.
11188520	11189520	Alright.
11189520	11191520	That's it. We're done. We're out of here.
11191520	11192520	Have a great night everybody.
11192520	11195520	Thanks for staying up late with us or listening to us at work or whatever it is.
11195520	11196520	Just can't thank you guys enough.
