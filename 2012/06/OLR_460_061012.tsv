10216	12378	Sky, and Loki.
13979	23028	Tonight, June 10th, 2012, E3 2012 has come to a close and we discussed the highlights, the lowlights, and everything in between with our live audience.
31747	33408	Yes, Loki in the mid lights too.
34329	39853	Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
40433	50340	Orange Lounge Radio live as we always are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at VOG Network, the Voice of Geeks Network.
50440	56444	VOGnetwork.com is where you can go and if you click on live chat, you can chat live with us, the hosts of
56804	57604	of Orange Lounge Radio.
57624	58465	My name is Rob Roberts.
58825	64427	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and, of course, this week, the Big E3 Expo with my co-host.
64967	67468	First up, Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura.
67528	67848	Hi.
67968	70029	It looks like you were giving my salad the sting eye.
71089	72410	I was trying to figure out what was in it.
72650	74031	I was like, is that avocado?
74271	74991	It's avocado.
75111	77272	I made, basically, avocado mango salsa.
77692	77992	Oh, okay.
78652	80033	And put it over fresh greens.
80053	83094	Just, you know, green things are always kind of the, hmm.
83354	84315	with goat cheese on top.
84495	85116	It's all raw.
85516	85836	Okay.
86116	86697	And delicious.
87037	88639	Because I am back to eating raw food.
88659	89219	There you go.
89840	90940	Not vegan, mind you.
91021	91441	Not vegan.
91892	94114	How do you do raw food without being vegan?
94314	95014	Sashimi.
95855	96475	Oh, okay.
96676	96876	Fish.
97016	98017	And beef tataki.
98037	98477	Oh, there you go.
98597	101259	And raw milk cheese and raw milk.
102019	102280	That works.
102360	102940	And yogurt.
103280	104461	I can have fermented things, too.
105462	105762	All right.
106883	108704	Let's also go over to Tech Master Loki.
109105	109405	Hi.
109585	114148	Who will probably talk about his very non-raw food diet of McDonald's.
115049	117930	I had pop chips, I think that falls somewhere in between the two of you
138777	142680	I actually had dinner before I came to this show, and then I picked that up on the way, because I was still kind of hungry.
143260	152186	I wanted to stop at Burger King, but there was a bunch of car crashes right in front of the turn to turn into the shopping center with the Burger King.
152567	154568	I was like, ah, come on.
154648	155709	Party at Burger King.
156209	161112	No, it's probably stupid people in the light rail.
161132	162872	Whatever happened to parties at Burger King?
163093	168095	When I was young, and this might be dating myself a bit here, but people used to have their birthday parties at McDonald's and Burger King.
168115	168996	Is that still a thing?
169136	170236	I don't think so.
170957	171937	It's all Chuck E. Cheese now?
172838	175419	Chuck E. Cheese was... That's not food either.
177381	179062	However, sometimes they have good games.
179122	181024	It really is the shittiest pizza anywhere.
181144	183165	Anyway, it's still okay.
183445	185507	But you know who started Pizza Time Theater, right?
186027	187068	Huh.
187868	188809	And crap, now I forgot his name.
188949	189489	Atari dude.
189910	190610	Oh yeah, Nolan Bushnell.
190630	191411	Yeah.
191731	194173	Didn't he start a place in Woodland Hills not that long ago?
194253	195213	I don't know if it's still open.
195313	196294	It was about a year or two ago.
196354	198996	I went to the original Chuck E. Cheese way back.
199276	200337	That was the coolest one, too.
200617	200877	Really?
201077	202058	Like two stories?
202078	203159	It had a two-story slide.
203979	205700	It had the full animatronic band.
205720	206361	Oh, it was great.
206561	206801	Great.
206881	218684	In Mobile, where I'm from, we had a massive Chuck E. Cheese slash Showtime pizza that had the party room with the hippo girl in it who played a piano.
218704	221684	I remember that.
221704	223165	And Alan said he remembered that.
223725	234247	And then we had the big party room with the full band and the room that you go into to go to the bathroom that's all LED lights on the wall that would give me a seizure.
234507	234647	Mm-hmm.
235328	238271	and the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.
239453	240154	I remember that.
240334	250606	Chuck E. Cheese in a way is almost responsible, I mean for real, for me being like so into video games because I remember, I distinctly remember going when I was three or four years old, it was my sister's wedding reception and
251167	273839	for some reason was at Chuck E. Cheese that's awesome no no no wait no no I think it was like the after reception reception like it was like the real reception was at the Elk Lodge but then like the wedding party and the families was more for the kids so they I think my sister was like let's do something for Rob and the kids and so because my sister was is 16 years older than I am so that's why like I'm I'm four and she's like 20 getting married right
274959	276880	We all went to Chuck E. Cheese.
277780	279741	People ask, what is one of your earliest memories?
279821	290045	I distinctly remember Crystal Castles and the trackball and the little box that they used to have to bring over that you could stand on so I could be a four-year-old playing Crystal Castles.
290245	291847	We had to sit down pole position.
292327	292627	Nice.
293048	298753	And when they closed the big Chuck E. Cheese, they actually moved the same pole position cabinet to the newer Chuck E. Cheese.
299614	304199	And I did, as an adult, go back and play the exact same one I played as a small kid.
305162	306163	All right, let's go to our chat room.
323220	326562	Thanks to Travis last night, we have thevognetwork.com as well.
326582	326862	That's right.
326882	329564	You can also access at thevognetwork.com.
329584	335888	And I believe, I don't know, I might get a hand slap from Bobby for making this public, but I know you registered it.
336228	337989	Voiceofgeeks.com also works.
338449	339370	So there you go.
339610	341311	Several ways you can get to our website.
341691	345814	We prefer vognetwork.com, but you can also do thevognetwork.com.
346834	352716	Going to our chat room, Vince Raven is in our chat room saying, is this a pre-recorded show or live?
353176	354837	It must be live because I just read your name.
354897	355377	There you go.
355457	356978	We are live tonight.
357038	359079	I know it was taped last week.
359099	361139	There's no such thing as pre-recording.
361179	362600	There's just recording.
362620	363440	That's what they say.
363560	364581	That's the buzzword.
364661	368262	It's voiceofgeeks.com, not voiceofgeeksnetwork.com.
368562	370623	Right, it's voiceofgeeks.com.
370843	371083	All right.
373204	376286	And some folks in the chat room are hand slapping there for me.
377026	377346	Let's see.
377486	383249	Also, some folks reminiscing about Showbiz Pizza, which I believe was the Chuck E. Cheese of the East Coast.
383309	384689	It's kind of the same thing and they merge.
385069	388631	Like Black Wolf is in there saying, Showbiz Pizza where a kid can be a kid.
388911	390692	Well, now it's where a kid can get shot.
390812	397315	I don't know if you read some of the crazy things that happened at Chuck E. Cheese on Yahoo and news and all that stuff, but they got an image problem.
397435	398496	DarkSakura.com
419298	423881	We have folks, I see Rob from Girls Gone Wow from the UK is listening tonight.
424021	428143	I saw Clover Nikon, who I believe is from Australia, is listening tonight.
428443	430985	We've got like an international group here tonight.
432746	436848	Now here I am talking about our little hometown of Sacramento, but there used to be this place called the Mindshaft.
437748	439369	That place was the shit.
439529	441329	And now it's like an abandoned RV.
441529	442910	Yeah, now it's like a scary place.
442990	446831	But you used to go underground to start the miniature golf.
446911	448691	They had a two-story arcade.
449031	449772	It was awesome.
450012	454453	And then right before it closed, it had a dance club in the basement.
454513	459374	And it was commonly known as the Mormon Dance Club because I guess the mineshaft was owned by Mormons.
459934	461315	And so the Mormon Dance Club...
462515	464977	I don't even know how that works, but I just know that's what everybody calls it.
464997	474764	We did go there one summer, like, you know, just, ah, we'll go play miniature golf there, because I've never really been there before, like, and man, it was run down.
475285	476406	It was pretty bad.
477547	479828	DJ Morpheus is reminding me about Samstown, too.
479848	480849	Samstown was awesome.
480929	482891	God damn, we had some great entertainment.
483091	488195	And I'm sure wherever you're from, in your hometown, you used to have these great entertainment places that have probably all shut down.
488575	491217	Alan, were there any awesome ones in the Bay Area that I'm not thinking of?
492930	493470	He's ignoring me.
493510	493810	Oh, okay.
493870	494511	Oh, he's shaking his head.
494551	496952	You know what we had in Mobile?
497012	499633	It's still there and it's changed names, but it used to be called Mount Asia.
500773	506896	It was a huge, like, multi-level mini-golf, but it had a great arcade.
506916	508536	That's where I played Trog for the first time.
508556	509797	I was hooked on that game.
510417	538302	the only thing notable I can remember in the East Bay was in Concord there was a big Malibu Grand Prix which had the RC cars and then a huge arcade but it closed when I was like 7 so I barely remember it they still have some in Scandia I love, not necessarily our Scandia our Scandia went, I don't know what happened to our Scandia it's just weird but like the other Scandias they still have the old arcades and stuff they're kind of cool, they still have that vibe they have the go-karts and miniature golf and that kind of stuff
538624	563676	I miss retro arcades I wish that's why I loved Flynn's Arcade at Disneyland and we weren't here last week because I made another trip to Disneyland and so I got to see Electronica's replacement which is the Mad Tea Party now I didn't see the actual party because we were there on weekdays but I saw the decorations and it pained me to see Flynn's Arcade just gone just totally gone the front had been replaced with something else that wasn't even really themed for Alice in Wonderland just made me sad
564176	565718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
585136	588359	Vognetwork.com, our official site has launched.
588739	599208	If you visited it back in May when we first established the network with Bobby and Understation Live, we had kind of a temporary site there that was just one page with the chat room taking up the whole page.
599568	605393	The full site is now available and if you haven't been able to take a look at it, I really encourage you to go because...
606814	611798	In one week, and I'm not just saying this because it's part of my idea, the whole site.
612158	614780	But in one week, we've accomplished so much.
614860	615961	I'm really proud.
616101	620404	And a lot of that is the very hard work that Bobby's been putting in on the programming side of it.
620725	623386	But there's been a lot of hard work on the content side too.
624207	629271	We have some great authors for editorials that we picked up thanks to Twitter shoutouts.
630752	632413	Jeff, I know, is one of them, and Elliot.
632433	634133	They've been writing some great stuff for the site.
634474	636014	And it's not just video game stuff, too.
636054	638996	Remember, it's the Voice of Geeks Network, so we have articles on Indiana Jones.
639056	642618	We have articles on, of course, Minecraft, and there's some other things, too.
643338	645600	But it's a wide variety of things.
645620	651003	Yes, right before the show, I was asking Ramal, who are these people that are writing stuff for our site?
651023	651683	I'm like, I don't know.
651903	653024	I don't recognize these people.
653144	655045	Well, Twitter's a powerful thing.
655085	657027	I know Elliot's been following me on Twitter for a while.
657067	670056	He's based out of the UK and he sent me a direct message that took me like three weeks to respond to because my Twitter app was acting up but he already did some writing I think for either a high school or a college paper and I was like, alright, you want to write for us?
670096	671097	Cool, let's see it.
671157	672077	And he did that.
673078	680924	Jeff came in from, this is really cool, Video Game Outsiders retweeted us when I put, or retweeted me I should say when I put the call out for...
682045	699887	uh authors which by the way let me just really quick really quickly say the fact that we're all like supportive of each other I love video game outsiders and you know I know they they sent the retweet for me and everything I hope this dispels the whole there's an all games and VOG network war
700367	704408	and they're a fightin' and it's civil frickin' war.
704608	704848	No.
705628	706808	Let it go and stop it.
706989	708049	Stop spreading those rumors.
708749	710729	Let them do their thing and be great.
711250	715971	Let us do our thing and also be great because if we're both great, everybody wins.
716211	721032	Anyway, Jeff came in through that retweet and his stuff's been great.
721092	725313	Yeah, Loki, you say you've been reading that stuff and it's really funny and it's good.
725613	725973	Good stuff.
727773	733658	Anyhow, going to our chat room again at live.vognetwork.com.
734058	737380	A little more reminiscing there and some talk about E3 as well.
738541	743684	Actdeft is teasing that some of the content from Orange Launch Radio, I love this song, is coming this week to VOG Network.
743985	745025	That's right, it's going to be growing.
745686	748508	So if you haven't checked out vognetwork.com, please do.
749008	750329	It's not just the station.
750529	751509	It's the articles.
751929	759172	And most importantly, the big thing that was announced the Friday before was that it's all a game.
759692	761492	You can actually sign up.
761832	764773	You can find loot places on the site.
764814	768975	So EJ from Girls Gone Wow, continuing our conversation from a couple weeks ago, there's your loot.
769815	773757	You can check it out over there on the site and you can get loot.
774197	777859	I can't tell you how you get loot, but I'll tell you one of them is really easy.
777959	780140	Like sign up for the website easy and you get loot.
781261	783902	You can comment on articles, thumbs up.
784302	789364	You can actually, if you notice, Bobby posted a review of, I'm going to mess up the name of this.
789424	791425	It's Jam Music Band or something like that.
791465	792986	This just came out on Xbox Live Arcade.
793346	794366	He wrote a review of that.
794786	798547	And you can actually write a review that agrees or disagrees.
798927	807429	And your review, if approved by the original author, which they're not going to disapprove it just because you disagree with them, will show up right underneath the original review.
807749	808369	It's pretty cool.
808429	810690	So you can kind of have your own say.
810770	813530	Like, I disagree because X, Y, Z. So pretty cool.
813550	816571	We'll have more stuff like that come to the site in the next few weeks.
817151	817411	So yeah.
818311	819351	VOG Network.com.
819792	825074	Again, Orange House Radio listeners, if you haven't checked out the website since the placeholder that was there last month, so much has changed.
825154	825554	Check it out.
827415	830576	Let's go back into games and talking about E3.
830936	837759	And before we get into our own gaming week and the stuff we've been playing as we usually start the show off with, I know we're going to do a lot of recapping about E3 tonight.
838619	844442	And I want to talk about this topic that's been brought up that's kind of hovering over the air.
844942	847323	And that is the question of, is E3 still relevant?
848809	856473	Now, the ESA was very quick to defend that question, basically, that was asked by saying, of course it's still relevant.
856813	861435	I don't have the quote in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing, of course.
861455	869159	But all the attention is on Los Angeles this week, and it's still the place to have games shown and be covered and be exposed to the world.
869199	870359	It is the place to be.
870659	874001	But there's a lot of people that are saying, well, you know, in this day and age of the Internet...
874481	879822	and where everything kind of goes to Spike TV the first day or G4 hits the internet.
880262	883323	Is it really that important to be there live and in person?
883723	888624	So I want to ask those in studio, especially considering this year E3 was a bit different for us personally.
889164	891804	This is the first year at Orange Lounge Radio in quite some time.
891844	892965	We didn't really cover it.
893825	894605	None of us went.
895405	897705	And let me ask that question.
897765	899546	Is E3 still relevant?
899726	899966	Loki?
901347	912816	I think it's still relevant because they have a lot of great games being shown there, but they've kind of made it really difficult for... Well, they've always made it kind of difficult for independent coverage of E3.
913857	928429	It's more of having to cover the... You don't get invited to the press events, so you cover the feed from Spike TV or something like that, and you make your comments off of that, which works just fine because it's...
930351	934189	you get to see the same stuff pretty much except you don't get to actually play any of it
936613	936973	I don't know.
937013	943358	I think for the gaming industry, I think it's not necessarily the greatest thing for them.
943438	962330	I mean, just because a lot of companies are being hit financially pretty hard and they can't afford to have these really huge booths and spend millions of dollars on the stuff like THQ, for example, not at E3 because they can't afford to spend money on that kind of stuff right now.
962370	963871	They have jobs at stake and...
965873	968754	and their own companies, so they can't do that.
970195	979281	So I think that as far as saying, oh, E3 is the place to go for game news and to see the games and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily the case.
979381	981042	I mean, yeah, it is a place to go.
981082	985605	It's definitely something that people look forward to, but there's also other conventions out there.
985645	989548	There's PAX, which is definitely getting a lot of coverage for games and stuff.
989908	990948	And honestly, I mean...
991869	1000212	You can scale down your booth size a bit and show the same type of stuff there, and I think still get the same kind of press coverage that they're getting with E3.
1000352	1008675	Granted, they're not doing these huge keynote events and stuff like that, but I still think it's a good way to get your game covered.
1008755	1017418	Plus, in the day and age of the internet, there's also companies just launching their own games on Kickstarter or through other means, and they can get press coverage that way or...
1018678	1043281	I don't know, I don't think press is necessarily a problem, because people were probably talking about Madden and Assassin's Creed and stuff like that beforehand, but now it's just, hey, look, we've got a bunch of people showing off Assassin's Creed at the Sony press conference, at the Ubisoft press conference, and at the Xbox press conference, and at the Nintendo press conference, because they only showed Ubisoft games...
1043961	1046363	because a lot of them just thought they were so awesome.
1046383	1051167	So yeah, I could see how they could come to that conclusion.
1051387	1051728	I don't know.
1051968	1055150	I just... I'm just jealous I didn't get to go.
1056672	1071023	I would like to play some more games, but honestly, digesting it through just reading other sites' covering and stuff, I feel that I kind of took in more information than if I were to be stumbling around because it seems like every time I'd go to E3, it would be like, oh, hey...
1071924	1079694	There's this really cool game and I didn't get to see it because I completely was unaware that they had talked about it or it was announced or something like that.
1080034	1084599	And I just never made it over to that booth because I wanted to go see something I was aware of beforehand.
1085440	1085741	I don't know.
1087066	1090451	I think it is important to be there in person if you can.
1090471	1091893	I always enjoy the experience.
1102446	1130967	DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live I'm reading like comments from other shows tonight but that's alright it's a network DJ Morpheus from Saturday's Under Station Live says I said it during Bobby's show but I see South by Southwest becoming the dominant game showcase in a couple of years that's a very interesting prediction because South by Southwest is the place where things like Foursquare really took off and I don't know if you view Foursquare as a game but if you look at VOG Network as a game South by Southwest would probably be our show right?
1131587	1134649	That's an interesting perspective, especially with the technology and everything.
1134689	1136090	Except Foursquare kind of sucks.
1137851	1139852	But think of all the clones that exist.
1139892	1140813	I mean, think of it this way.
1140933	1143254	Facebook basically jacked Foursquare.
1144255	1145296	Yeah.
1145576	1149458	Well, then again, one could argue, okay, Grant, I better get this out or I'll get corrected.
1149838	1153721	Google Latitude was kind of also before all of that, but...
1154261	1160884	I believe that was, if I got my tech history right, that was Dodgeball, and the Dodgeball guy started Foursquare.
1161685	1162445	I've gone cross-eyed.
1162625	1165707	At this point, these big conventions just kind of seem pointless to me.
1166027	1166227	Yeah?
1166507	1180574	Because if they really wanted to get reviews and get the press information out there, they would go to like a virtual format, you know, VE3 or something, and send out demos directly to the press.
1182583	1184565	I think they're just wasting time and money.
1197869	1202612	WhatUpG in our chat says, the only thing you don't get from not being at E3 is any hands-on time.
1202632	1213077	Well, I remember a couple years ago when they did a lot of demos, not all of them, obviously, but quite a handful of demos were available on Xbox Live as they were there at the show.
1213097	1213878	That was pretty awesome.
1214238	1223503	2006 was the year that they did that, and they had MotoGP and Lost Planet, and there was one other one, but I don't remember what it was.
1224624	1225704	That was awesome.
1226385	1228446	E3 at home is basically, hey, you know what?
1228487	1229547	We know that you can't go to E3.
1229607	1232469	Here's some of the E3 demos that are available right now.
1232790	1235212	Why don't they do that anymore?
1235592	1238434	That's a good way to get information out about your game.
1239114	1241336	But I understand people are like, oh, it's not finished.
1241356	1241916	But who cares?
1241957	1242677	You just put that up.
1242697	1245259	Hey, unfinished game, but you get to check out the demo for it.
1245359	1247662	Shadownext, JenJuz bring up an interesting point in our chat.
1247682	1250064	Sending out demos to the press wouldn't necessarily work.
1250145	1252808	Not everyone has debug units that can play the early code.
1253088	1256432	Maybe that's a part of it that the code isn't ready for that live environment.
1256652	1257233	There is a difference.
1257253	1264501	They usually prepare demos that have taken care of hiding any errors and are programmed for certain time limits.
1264781	1266263	Some companies are sick of doing that.
1266423	1267664	I remember reading an article on that.
1267724	1275430	Some companies are thinking that E3 demos are actually not a waste of their time, but it's taking away time from developing for the game.
1276150	1277812	Again, why have E3 at all?
1279773	1281915	I really don't see it being relevant anymore.
1282523	1286684	Going to other comments in our chatroom, Dartetsuya says, we totally need VOG Con.
1287464	1289664	Dream big, maybe someday, dream big.
1290585	1294865	Let's see, and Tigerclaw notices that I am on PlayStation Home right now.
1294945	1295766	That is correct.
1296226	1299526	Over there on the TV, look, I'm sitting next to Tigerclaw on the couch.
1299986	1305347	I am in PlayStation Home, and I wanna pimp the new VOG Network Clubhouse.
1305748	1307988	So if you have your PlayStation nearby, fire it up,
1308448	1312852	Search in the clubhouses for VOG and you'll get VOG Network in all caps.
1313312	1317875	And hopefully, oh, it looks like Blender left, but hopefully he'll be back and he can accept more apps into the clubhouse.
1317895	1319837	And I gotta say, Blender did a great job with the clubhouse.
1320117	1321698	I didn't even know they had new ones now.
1321758	1325101	He's got this whole desert, I think it's called the Desert Penthouse or something.
1325141	1326282	It's like a little pool.
1326582	1328324	Look at all those arcade games he's got in there.
1328824	1330505	And the couch totally looks like it's floating.
1330525	1331186	Yeah.
1332967	1333448	So, anyhow.
1333728	1337655	Now, notice Tigerclaw and I are sitting on the couch, but not too close together.
1337835	1338416	Not too close.
1339798	1341501	It's a nice doodly distance apart.
1341601	1342102	I'm sorry.
1342402	1344285	I do not believe that that's actually home.
1344465	1346248	No one is doing The Running Man.
1348331	1349072	Oh, hey, DDR Machine.
1349112	1350012	Is that a DDR Machine?
1350092	1350492	Get out.
1350532	1354034	Yeah, it's like a little DDR Machine over there.
1354054	1355275	I believe that is a DDR Machine.
1355295	1363279	Well, speaking of home, they have the whole virtual, you know, not to, you know, I mentioned Xbox a minute ago, but they do their whole virtual Sony booth.
1364080	1368762	Granted, it's not the same as being there, but it's kind of a neat little tie-in.
1368942	1373125	You know, it kind of, again, there's always that question of what the hell's the point of home?
1373605	1376647	But when you see something like that, you kind of go, oh, that is pretty cool.
1376667	1377007	Yeah.
1378137	1379759	Did you ever look at the virtual booth in home?
1380780	1382702	I've seen pictures of it.
1382722	1384945	I haven't been to home for a long time.
1385045	1386667	I actually haven't ever used home.
1387127	1388189	Oh, you gotta check it out.
1388249	1389210	It's kind of neat there.
1389570	1391412	I've been playing on my PC.
1391773	1395177	I believe Tigerclaw is fulfilling the running man quota here.
1398360	1398860	You know what?
1398920	1402721	I gotta say, this may be the reason to bring a live webcam back to the show.
1402781	1406502	Don't have the cam on us, but put the cam in Sony Home.
1407882	1409962	And you guys can look at that while we broadcast.
1410522	1411842	I seriously might do that.
1411902	1412703	That's a good idea.
1413523	1413963	Go me.
1414363	1415403	Brainstorming live on air.
1415683	1417123	Mister, I'm gonna keep the webcam.
1418064	1418904	You can have the webcam.
1418944	1419924	Look, here's the webcam.
1420024	1420464	There you go.
1420584	1421004	All yours.
1421504	1422084	Have a blast.
1422944	1425745	Well, I thought you had your video camera hooked up.
1426657	1427979	That died, sadly.
1428059	1429320	That $400 camera died.
1429621	1431683	That's part of the reason we haven't had video in a while.
1431703	1433425	That webcam isn't the best resolution.
1433445	1433705	You know what?
1433745	1436108	I actually think that my camera still works.
1436468	1436689	Oh, yeah?
1436989	1438471	I mean, I've never tried it as a webcam.
1439031	1441674	And I have to convert all of those Disneyland movies.
1442675	1444337	But I think my Panasonic still works.
1444417	1446680	I have an HD camcorder that I'm not using at all.
1448121	1448422	Alright.
1449583	1452165	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1452246	1453647	We'll come back to E3 in just a moment.
1453707	1457451	Loki's going to wrap up the whole thing for us and we're going to give our witty insight and commentary.
1457891	1463237	First off though, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1463677	1464158	DarkSakura.
1464338	1464958	I played stuff.
1464998	1465619	I played stuff.
1465819	1466439	Yes, you did.
1467119	1469280	And I am so proud of you.
1469700	1473682	I played a bunch of Mass Effect until I decided that I really would rather play it on the PC.
1474162	1478064	Because I hate the targeting system so much.
1478744	1481165	And it hurts my hand to try to retarget.
1481546	1483426	And I kept dying when I found Counselor Troi.
1484107	1484667	You know what I mean.
1485227	1485968	The matriarch.
1486128	1486288	Yes.
1487968	1491589	So, I swear, she must have been on some pretty nasty PMS.
1491629	1496390	But anyway, so yeah, all of the Asari commandos whooped my ass.
1497050	1501932	So I decided to play on PC instead, and I've remade my FemShep and totally going after Garrus.
1502292	1502652	Shut up.
1503092	1503552	Don't judge me.
1504092	1505893	Another one indoctrinated, ladies and gentlemen.
1505913	1506133	Shut up.
1507313	1508133	I played some WoW.
1508273	1509073	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1509773	1509994	Addict.
1510014	1511454	Dealer.
1511514	1511794	Dealer.
1514304	1516266	Rob, you are the game pimp, okay?
1517407	1517708	You know what?
1517768	1520290	You have to kind of blame Shane for that, really, though.
1520330	1525676	That was just like, that's like the whole, like, this is like, Mass Effect is now this Tupperware pyramid scheme.
1526837	1531582	And Shane is kind of like the regional director, and he got me hooked.
1532082	1537208	And now, in an attempt to, you know, get my free toaster, I got DarkSakura hooked.
1537768	1538728	It's a pyramid scheme.
1538888	1539288	That's right.
1539308	1540149	It's a pyramid scheme.
1540689	1544410	Oh, and I want to point out, Tigerclaw totally moved closer to me on that couch.
1544450	1544890	You see that?
1545390	1546811	That's still a doodly distance.
1547051	1547891	It is a doodly distance.
1547911	1553573	Well, I think that's the... That's the appropriate distance for dudes to be apart.
1553593	1556394	That is the programmed distance away.
1557374	1558414	That's where your hitbox is.
1560235	1562595	Well, I also played... I did play WoW.
1562715	1564396	I'll put a picture of this on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1565207	1565768	I did play WoW.
1566188	1566488	Duh.
1567109	1583480	And I started another MMO just because of Iguana Girl, of Jessica Harper, who has said, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, so finally I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try, you know, because I'm a little bored with WoW because other people are playing Diablo all the damn time, shut up.
1584461	1586963	So, um, the Pyramid Head scheme, pfft.
1587763	1616702	um so I started playing Lord of the Rings online and it's actually not bad um it's very pretty I actually prefer it graphically to well um lots of lots of fun in-depth stuff I really like how it more mirrors the books and you know without Tolkien's horrible horrible writing I'm sorry you spend we spend five pages describing the landscape and like half a paragraph describing the people you're talking about that's not good writing
1617943	1623328	And I'm probably going to hell in the minds of lots of Tolkien fans, but I don't care.
1624128	1627231	I did play a little Diablo, by the way.
1628312	1634137	But I actually, you know, I've only played, I'm only a level 8 character right now in Lord of the Rings.
1634877	1648768	it's enough that I've gotten kind of a grasp that number one I like the camera in WoW better but I like the scenery and the graphics in Lord of the Rings better I do have to say that WoW has better water effects just saying um
1650623	1655868	I actually, when I had it optimized, it basically lets me run the game at full settings.
1656408	1659651	And I had some lag today, but for the most part, it actually runs pretty smoothly.
1661273	1674865	I've basically had some problems with some kill stealing, so I don't like that my targets aren't locked, but you know, what can you do?
1675346	1675807	It's free.
1676288	1677230	I like the free part.
1677311	1677912	The free's good.
1678434	1680279	And I played some STO this week, by the way.
1681041	1683447	Just to play Dabo at Deep Space Nine.
1685109	1687030	You've been MMOing it up.
1687511	1688051	I have been.
1688111	1689312	I'm like a little whore here.
1690252	1692454	No, I'm not a whore because I'm paying.
1692594	1695736	Somebody clip that little phrase and send it to Travis.
1695836	1696896	I'm a Momo slut.
1697577	1698858	I'm a Momo slut.
1699238	1700138	I'm playing the field.
1701579	1708984	Hey, if guys can do it and are lauded for it, then a woman should be able to be lauded for spreading herself out a little bit too.
1709184	1709784	Just saying.
1710905	1711846	Double standard here.
1711906	1712506	Double standard.
1712526	1713747	He was writing his show for him.
1713767	1713967	I was like,
1715914	1716315	Bitches.
1717237	1724069	So... And I have also decided... I played the Minecraft demo.
1724931	1726534	The freebie version that's on the website.
1726955	1727616	Hated it!
1729833	1731775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1749790	1754694	because I'm playing it in windowed mode and it gives me a little bit more to focus on other things.
1754995	1756876	Turned off the motion blur, turned off the fill grain.
1757517	1759318	All of that, it still made me sick.
1759739	1763822	And I hate to say it, but I do get motion sickness with Lord of the Rings because of the camera.
1764543	1768667	Because it's like, you know how in WoW the camera auto-adjusts when you're running?
1770028	1776494	In Lord of the Rings, you can actually turn your camera around, you can watch yourself sideways, but you're still moving forward with W. Right?
1777334	1794160	if that makes sense so I'll try to hit sideways because that's the direction on my screen is trying to run and my camera is oriented the other way so it's more or less I guess a little bit of user error but I still would prefer that auto orienting and I don't know if I have a way to turn that on
1794480	1797541	However, it's got this full cosmetic thing.
1798281	1800962	It's kind of like, not necessarily like transmogging.
1801322	1803662	Because honestly, I really like the transmogging system.
1804422	1806563	And you really have to think about what you want.
1807543	1810364	But I do like the cosmetic system.
1810484	1813644	And you can get clothes dye and everything.
1814065	1815365	And crafting is better.
1815785	1819066	Oh my god, crafting is so much easier.
1819386	1819806	The end.
1820726	1822988	So, I'm about even.
1823688	1827931	I mean, WoW is still, thanks, sorry, you know, I still like WoW.
1828491	1830693	I signed the blood pact, I'm not quitting.
1830773	1835696	And Pandaria may kind of, you know, WoW is really a lull for a lot of people now.
1835837	1837157	I want a goat monk so bad.
1838158	1851270	But you know the one thing that really, and I decided this today, the really big thing that Lord of the Rings does not have going for it, no true caster DPS class.
1851310	1854933	You have a hunter, that's your only real dedicated DPS class.
1855273	1856574	And you know me, I like the pew-pew.
1857415	1857875	I have what?
1857995	1861157	A mage, a druid, a shadow priest, you know, on WoW.
1861357	1863217	I play Caster Pew Pew.
1864038	1869680	So, you know, if that popped up on Lord of the Rings, I'll know that might, that might pull me over permanently.
1870920	1871320	Just saying.
1871801	1872141	All right.
1872261	1872901	And I like free.
1873021	1873761	Did I say I like free?
1873781	1874262	I like free.
1874482	1876062	The MMO queen has spoken.
1876603	1877983	Meanwhile, Loki, how was your gaming?
1878003	1878703	And Ragnarok Online.
1878983	1880204	How was your gaming week?
1880692	1882693	I played mostly Minecraft.
1884274	1886835	I started by building an artificial volcano.
1886855	1895879	I took the largest mountain in this one area and then I built on top of it all the way up to the top of the skybox.
1897400	1902782	Then I covered the whole thing with obsidian because I had duped a bunch of obsidian.
1902802	1906404	Then I poured some lava over the top of that.
1907204	1908345	and got too much lava.
1908565	1910305	There was a ton of lava on there.
1911626	1914627	You put that in the wrong spot and it'll just spread like crazy.
1915027	1920409	So I finally took care of that and got it a little bit more situated to how I like it.
1920910	1924051	And then started to hollow the whole inside off.
1924671	1930654	And actually it's kind of cool because the whole thing is actually the Shrine of Fire because there is fire all over the place.
1930674	1932554	There's lava fountains on the inside.
1933235	1934055	It's just ridiculous.
1934215	1934695	DarkSakura.com
1959566	1964549	So you had the shrine to fire in your basement in Animal Crossing.
1964569	1966390	You had the shrine to fire in Minecraft.
1966730	1968411	What game do I make the shrine to fire in?
1968631	1969652	That's what I need to figure out.
1970072	1970672	Also Minecraft?
1970692	1971073	I don't know.
1971753	1972113	We'll see.
1972694	1973974	Oh, that just reminds me of something.
1974254	1977396	I can have a house in Lord of the Rings and I might build a shrine to fire there.
1978097	1978477	Just saying.
1978897	1979898	Just don't burn down your house.
1979998	1981219	I miss MOG houses.
1981279	1982500	You know, Rob, I miss MOG houses.
1982560	1983101	I do too.
1983401	1984282	Wow needs houses.
1984402	1984782	They do.
1985002	1985223	They do.
1985323	1985543	All right.
1986163	1989366	Rather than me just pretending that my goat lives in the back room of the tavern.
1989386	1991388	Let the man finish his game in a week so we can get to E3.
1991408	1992829	He's going to get the rest of the damn show.
1993449	1998674	So anyways, so other than, yeah, I've just been playing Minecraft for the most of it.
1998874	2008840	It's kind of cool, though, because unbeknownst to me, there was a dungeon in the middle of that mountain that I built the volcano on.
2008920	2012982	So now I have this dungeon that's going to be in the bottom of this giant fortress to fire.
2015224	2016364	And you'll be able to fight mobs down there.
2016624	2017445	So that's kind of cool.
2017685	2019146	So I'll be playing a little bit more of that this week.
2019286	2019586	DarkSakura.com
2042190	2051194	I do find it funny that sometimes I'll be inside the volcano thing like hollowing it out and I'll hear a cow catching fire because it was stupid and walked into the lava.
2051975	2052675	So that's kind of funny.
2053491	2058955	And then the other game I played, ironically, was an Atari 2600 game.
2059376	2065780	And it's an Atari 2600 game that's exclusive to the contest I'm playing, which is for Ready Player One.
2066621	2072806	I don't know if everyone heard, but Ready Player One, the wonderful book they keep talking about, they have an Easter egg hidden in the book.
2073306	2101032	and they have a contest now that goes along with that easter egg you find the easter egg, takes you to a website you play this Atari 2600 game you find the easter egg in that, takes you to the next website which the game unlocks there July 1st and then you play through that game, then you get increasingly harder and the next game unlocks August 1st, kind of like the real hunt except there is a real prize the real prize is a DeLorean a DeLorean with a replica flux capacitor inside it that is being given away
2101775	2103216	Which sounds all kinds of amazing.
2103456	2103676	Yes.
2104076	2106477	It makes me want to get into this book series.
2107878	2112280	So I found the Easter egg after a little bit of a hint from online.
2112380	2117162	Someone mentioned that you have to look for a certain... Because I was looking through the book.
2117182	2119683	I didn't really get a chance to look at it the first day and stuff.
2119783	2123545	And I'm like, I'm looking for a URL, but I didn't quite catch it.
2123665	2127887	And then they mentioned, oh, well, you have to look for this type of thing that's with the letters.
2127967	2128467	And then I'm like,
2128767	2129528	Oh, okay, there it is.
2129588	2129888	I see it.
2130248	2134271	So I went and played the game, beat the game after Josh went to bed.
2135532	2138413	And I didn't even make the top 100, though, on leaderboard.
2138513	2143176	But then again, it doesn't matter because each game is time unlocked.
2143257	2146038	So the next game is not going to start until July 1st.
2147379	2148980	and then the final game is August 1st.
2149060	2155223	And really the contest is whoever has all three games completed first is the winner.
2155323	2162127	So how fast you are at the first game and second game doesn't really matter as long as you get the third game after completing the first two.
2163548	2165049	As long as you're first in that.
2166449	2167890	But Stax was kind of neat.
2168070	2170411	It was like a throwback to Pitfall.
2170672	2171432	It was pretty hard.
2171492	2172012	You had to...
2173713	2174334	Thanks for watching!
2188965	2196848	You're supposed to find six puzzle pieces, and then once you find the six puzzle pieces, you have to find the Easter egg in the game, which is very reminiscent to Adventure.
2197388	2205051	And then once you find that, you go back to a certain room, and you find a QR code that unlocks the third place.
2205632	2209073	And that's eventually where the game's going to unlock next.
2210033	2212835	And apparently people were aware of the website.
2213095	2216276	I've been talking to Tetsuya about the whole thing since he's into the whole...
2216877	2219281	You know, Gamma kind of tried to help him out with the game.
2219361	2223989	But he's like, oh, hey, I knew about that website way a long time ago.
2224270	2226714	But it wasn't necessarily because of the Easter egg in the book.
2226754	2228918	It's just it's kind of obvious what the website is.
2231158	2232499	But yeah, it was fun.
2232679	2234560	It was kind of fun to get to play an old game.
2234941	2238603	It's also fun to kind of participate in this real-life hunt thing.
2239224	2243827	Although, if I win a DeLorean, I don't really know what I'm going to do with it since I don't know how to drive stick.
2244387	2251192	And then there's all the other stuff you don't think about, like paying taxes, registration, and all that stuff, and shipping the car to you.
2251292	2252333	I mean, that's expensive.
2253274	2253974	But it's a fucking DeLorean.
2253994	2255095	But you have a fucking DeLorean.
2255195	2255776	Exactly.
2257216	2258497	Some things are worth it.
2259157	2263340	Roll that window down, fucking pop in the CD because it does have a CD player that the guy put in it.
2264460	2266702	It's all Back to the Future soundtrack right there.
2267622	2269243	Just blast that shit up the radio.
2271519	2272720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2289978	2294842	I won't, you know, spend too much time talking about all of that since there wasn't a whole lot of gaming involved.
2294882	2299825	But I will say that mummy ride at Universal Studios is fucking amazing.
2299885	2300546	I loved it.
2301146	2302547	Xtfer and I were screaming like girls.
2302607	2305209	I wish somebody got a YouTube of it because you guys would have got a kick out of it.
2305789	2307631	Anyway, on to games.
2307691	2309432	When I got home, I did play some games.
2309692	2319579	I played multiplayer Mass Effect a little bit this weekend because Osfer from our chat room and Acidic Vampire from our chat room and Shane from Horde House is also in chat room.
2319719	2323242	We all are playing now and there's an event going on this weekend.
2323302	2326846	We were having fun last night trying to survive a gold map.
2326886	2327566	It didn't go very well.
2328988	2330529	Actually, we got to wave five, maybe.
2332251	2335614	Also did some multiplayer over on PlayStation 3 with another listener, Stan.
2335894	2339378	We had kind of a crappy connection in Soul Calibur, so we were trying to do that.
2340051	2342152	We have a dude with a lightsaber doing the Running Man.
2342292	2343693	I think that's Black Wolf.
2344854	2345915	Anyway.
2347096	2347996	I got more dancing now.
2348496	2349357	Ah, two Running Men.
2349697	2350538	Now it's home!
2350578	2355261	Yeah, Blender signed into the clubhouse and I guess accepted all these new people, so there you go.
2355441	2356602	We got VX, Jason, XV.
2358083	2358563	Alright, anyhow.
2359724	2360344	Hello, back to me.
2361445	2367289	So there was multiplayer Soul Calibur, which sadly was too laggy, but Stan makes some hilarious characters.
2367409	2368569	I loved his Mr. Slave.
2368850	2371031	I was like, people can get away with that in Soul Calibur.
2371411	2373353	It was pretty risque, we'll just leave it at that.
2374753	2381578	Then played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ultimate, which I, that's really Alan's game, not my game, so I was pretty much button mashing.
2382128	2383449	But hey, I was having some fun.
2383949	2384990	Also on PlayStation.
2385350	2387192	Thanks to the whole PlayStation Plus.
2387272	2391055	Thank you, Sony, for all those free freaking games this week.
2391575	2393737	I realized... Are you borrowing my copy of LittleBigPlanet 2?
2394357	2394497	No.
2394838	2395158	Oh, okay.
2396159	2396379	Never mind.
2396479	2397059	I don't think so.
2397380	2398220	I don't have it anywhere.
2398240	2399281	Maybe I didn't loan that to you yet.
2399301	2399842	I don't think you did.
2400422	2403184	So... What the hell is that shirt?
2403244	2405926	It's like... Sorry, I'm distracted by... It's a DDR shirt.
2406066	2407087	This is terrible radio.
2407467	2407607	What...
2408449	2411819	It looks like he's not wearing pants or is that like a Minecraft bottom?
2412401	2413604	It's like, I don't know.
2413625	2415230	Blender, what the hell are you wearing?
2417725	2420846	It looks like he's not wearing pants and it's like a censored butt.
2420886	2424168	Anyway, PlayStation games.
2425168	2427349	LittleBigPlanet 2 was one of the free games.
2427509	2432771	So finally, what, about two years late, I'm finally getting into LittleBigPlanet 2.
2434432	2435772	It's great, obviously.
2436212	2437673	I love the mini games.
2438633	2440134	It's just a great platformer.
2440934	2450070	I've barely scratched the surface of the game to be honest but it's everything I loved about the first one now with you know grappling hooks from the very start and more cutscene stuff.
2450780	2477173	I will say the only thing I kind of didn't like is that the story is really weird in the beginning I like the more ambiguous nature of the first game which relied a lot heavier on the narrator and so forth now in this one they're trying to like build a different story and I'm not really into it but that's my one tiny tiny little bitch about it otherwise it's a little big planet and it's great and I really don't know why it took me so long to get into part two I really don't I don't have an excuse
2477893	2479034	I was too busy playing Mass Effect.
2479074	2480495	I still haven't really gotten into Part 2.
2480935	2482757	I mean, I played maybe one level of it.
2483998	2486259	And I was just like, other game.
2489362	2490602	So that was pretty much my gaming week.
2491083	2493745	You know, the free LittleBigPlanet 2, Mass Effect, wow, Diablo.
2493785	2499189	I played a little Diablo with Shane, started a Witch Doctor, got it up to level like 6 or something.
2499509	2500590	Enough to beat the beta.
2500950	2503592	We got up to the Skeleton King and then I was like, I gotta go eat.
2504513	2506214	I killed the crap out of the Skeleton King.
2506607	2507467	It actually was hard.
2508328	2508688	A little.
2509028	2509328	A little.
2510148	2510468	Alright.
2511209	2513810	Housekeeping real quick and then we'll get into E3 news.
2514150	2514990	Join us on Facebook.
2515010	2516530	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2516811	2517151	Twitter.
2517191	2518711	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2519131	2520572	Tell friends about the show.
2520792	2521452	Word of mouth.
2521572	2523893	You know, again, we're not attached to a big magazine.
2524253	2532636	We hope VOG Network.com will become all the rage someday and geeks everywhere will visit it and then we can say we have a big website behind us supporting us.
2532656	2533336	What the hell is that?
2535937	2536317	I don't know.
2561622	2562463	It is one of the aliens.
2576758	2577619	and Plenty more to come soon.
2596531	2598493	All right, let's get into E3 news.
2598953	2604277	Loki is going to be taking this over since I was away at Disneyland and not paying attention to my TV.
2604638	2609562	I was trying to follow the news best I could, but Loki, you were on top of everything.
2610002	2612584	So let's run down the various press conferences.
2612644	2615106	The first people up were Microsoft.
2615247	2623113	Okay, so Microsoft had their press conference, and it was kind of weird because they started off really strong because they showed Halo 4.
2623173	2625015	That's how you start off a fucking press conference.
2625415	2625495	Boom.
2625655	2626275	Halo 4!
2626796	2627296	Here it is!
2628257	2628837	Get excited!
2650570	2654093	Some other cool stuff that they showed off besides Halo.
2654113	2659216	Of course, there was the unveiling of Splinter Cell Blacklist, which was an Ubisoft game.
2660237	2662998	That looked pretty awesome, so they had a little clip of that.
2665080	2669783	Of course, talking a little bit more about arcade games.
2670063	2672804	They had the summer of arcade stuff.
2673024	2676425	They were talking about some of the games we can expect for that.
2676445	2677906	Actually, some interesting things.
2677986	2681287	Some that we already knew about and some that were kind of on the way.
2682287	2687629	For example, they were talking Deadlight, which is going to be a new side-scroller game.
2688090	2688950	It's supposed to be coming out.
2689230	2693171	It looked kind of like a zombie survival horror type thing.
2693852	2697373	Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD, which is supposed to be out, I think, in a couple weeks.
2699155	2711851	Dust and Elysian Tale was something that was actually supposed to be an indie game a while back but they ended up getting it published because it looks fucking amazing and
2713573	2716856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2739412	2750520	Other things that they were talking about, of course, you know, entertainment was a big focus for Xbox since, you know, they were talking, you know, about making this like the center of entertainment for your household and stuff.
2750540	2759867	So, of course, more app announcements, including, you know, partnerships with Nickelodeon, Paramount, Machima, or Machinima, I guess.
2760847	2763049	Univision, Televiso, yes.
2763289	2766932	Hell yeah, until somebody on Twitter told me they were ending Sabado Gigante this year.
2767612	2768373	That's sad.
2769814	2775077	NHL and ESPN, of course, is getting some new stuff.
2775137	2776118	Other game announcements.
2777103	2780286	Halo 4, Forza Horizon, Fable, Gears of War Judgment, Dance Central 3, Usher,
2800082	2803403	Also, a new Nike fitness game is going to be coming out.
2803983	2806684	Kind of interesting, I guess.
2807444	2808545	Partnership with them.
2809245	2813346	And then, of course, Xbox Music was another big thing.
2813406	2814586	They were talking about the entertainment thing.
2815967	2818027	You're going to have 30 million tracks with that.
2818107	2823349	And, of course, it's going to support some of the new features like Smart Glass, which was another big unveiling.
2823769	2837198	SmartGlass is basically this technology where they can use any iOS, Android, I'm assuming Windows Phone, tablet, device, anything that you may have already.
2838158	2846804	You download an app for it and it becomes a second screen just like the Wii U or the Vita and the PlayStation 3.
2847444	2853385	I was floored, personally, hearing that that's not exclusive to a Windows device.
2853545	2856066	That they are going to open that up to iPads and stuff.
2856186	2856926	I mean, it's smart.
2857146	2858326	More people will adopt it.
2858486	2861007	Because I think, finally, Microsoft had to admit, you know what?
2861887	2863287	Apple's got a big bite here.
2863327	2868328	And we've seen Microsoft take little... Like, they dipped their foot in the pool.
2868388	2872549	Because there's a fully functional Xbox Live app for iPhone and iPad.
2873129	2892858	it's a universal app that's actually quite good it's very similar to the xbox.com website you can manage your friends list from it you see your avatars like it's a full-fledged app so Microsoft doing stuff with Apple products is not unheard of but I did not think they were gonna just jump in the pool full in so this was a pleasant surprise
2893089	2894750	Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones
2915485	2916025	and so on.
2943952	2947473	Plus, you'll be able to control your console using this as well.
2948514	2949274	So that's kind of neat.
2949434	2956336	And then, of course, long-awaited, finally announced, Internet Explorer is coming to the Xbox.
2956356	2958437	So we will now have an Internet browser.
2958537	2960358	It will support the smart glass stuff.
2960778	2968321	It will also be Kinect-enabled, and you'll be able to use voice commands to do searches and stuff like that.
2968981	2971682	So that's pretty cool.
2974710	2979092	I'm not a huge fan of Internet Explorer, but hey, whatever.
2979732	2981914	At least it's an option to browse the internet.
2984055	2985575	Cool.
2985715	2988297	It'll get porn on my 360, so yay for that.
2989477	2990798	Xbox porn.
2990838	2991798	What about emulators?
2993619	2996941	Do we know if it's going to support Flash or Java or any of that?
2996981	2997401	No idea.
2998842	3003244	Because it isn't complete until you get Super Mario Brothers running on your Xbox.
3003444	3018063	Well, they already technically have that reset glitched Xboxes and they have now the dual NAND reset glitch chips you can get where you have one mode that you can boot in that's, you know, hacked and one that's stock, so...
3019584	3022146	Go into some comments from our chatroom at vognetwork.com.
3022466	3024567	Osfer says, I can't wait for Halo 4.
3024928	3030571	The Metroid atmosphere and look to it really pulled me in, and Cortana looks better and more emotionally charged than ever.
3030951	3033853	I've heard a lot of good things about it from people who were on the show floor.
3034133	3036135	You know, I gotta admit, I feel the same way.
3036295	3040958	As much as I wasn't super-duper into the first-person Metroid games—well, that's not true, I did love Metroid Prime 3—
3041798	3066909	but I mean like just seeing that gameplay footage of Halo 4 for me sorry I'm going backwards but that's fine blame the chat room um I I was really into it I mean I and I haven't really cared about Halo since Halo 3 which you know once I played Halo 3 wasn't you know it didn't throw me the same way Halo 2 did but watching the Halo 4 I was like you know maybe the change in developers wasn't necessarily a bad thing because it forces them to kind of
3067529	3069050	Start over with some new ideas.
3069150	3070911	And you do see some of this other influence.
3071111	3073472	And that's no disrespect towards Bungie.
3073492	3074472	They made a great game.
3074532	3077954	And I'm sure whatever they've got, this Destiny thing is going to kick ass too.
3078294	3079154	Let's look at it this way.
3079174	3081875	I mean, look, you had people making Need for Speed games.
3081935	3084056	And granted, the Need for Speed games are pretty good.
3084296	3091499	And now you have another company, Criterion, making these Need for Speed games or making sequels to these Need for Speed games.
3091719	3092260	And they're better.
3092280	3093080	Yeah.
3093420	3100664	Not saying that the old ones weren't good, but now they have a fresh take on them, and so it's a little bit better.
3103665	3120254	One other thing, kind of a rumor, but now those $99 contract Xboxes or whatever are coming to more retailers other than Microsoft stores because Microsoft, they kind of figured, hey, we don't have a lot of stores out there, so
3121014	3138173	best buys and also select GameStop locations and from what I hear also from my boss meeting with Microsoft there's actually anybody's going to be able to do it as long as you're willing as long as you fit the criteria that they are looking for and there's like specific things that they need so
3138464	3140725	By the way, this was on the OLR Twitter last week.
3140825	3141285	Just saying.
3142606	3143786	Sometimes you get the secrets.
3144046	3144606	Little secrets.
3144967	3145667	What we can.
3145787	3146927	What little secrets we get.
3147568	3148228	We will let you know.
3150029	3151449	So there is all that stuff.
3153330	3156151	Overall, I think they had a decent press conference.
3156331	3161213	And I know a lot of the people that were kind of... Oh, some other announcements that they made, of course.
3161853	3162974	and some of the stuff.
3163595	3165556	Of course, they showed Black Ops 2, a little bit of that.
3165696	3168418	They announced that they're getting DLC first for that.
3168779	3169900	Same with South Park.
3169940	3173342	The Stick of Truth is getting DLC for it first.
3173382	3174503	It's coming out March 5th now.
3174643	3177005	It's going to have Kinect support as well on the 360.
3177426	3182530	Tomb Raider is getting the DLC first on Xbox and also Resident Evil 6 is getting DLC first on there.
3183050	3186192	I got to say though, South Park, The Stick of Truth, fucking amazing looking.
3186212	3188654	It is just, I cannot wait for that game.
3188694	3190376	That game looks perfect.
3190396	3190716	Perfect.
3192377	3196018	I really hope I'm not let down because sometimes trailers look good.
3197759	3198359	It looks great.
3198679	3199159	It looks great.
3200260	3206522	But yeah, a lot of the complaints about the press conference were, hey, the whole entertainment stuff, hey, I'm here to see the games.
3206722	3213485	I don't want to see all this garbage about Nickelodeon and Paramount and Xbox music.
3213505	3217086	I don't fucking care about Xbox music, but an okay press conference.
3218647	3219007	All right.
3220862	3223746	So next up, how do you think overall Microsoft did?
3223766	3228012	There were a lot of people online kind of razzing Microsoft, not fans of the press conference.
3228052	3232499	But in a way, I was kind of like, well, what the hell did you expect this year?
3232619	3234662	You knew you weren't going to be seeing the new Xbox.
3234702	3235303	They said that.
3235603	3236845	I know people were saying.
3237265	3238987	Oh, because Destiny isn't being shown anymore.
3239007	3241249	They're going to have to give us hints about the new... No, they don't.
3241890	3242410	They're not going to do it.
3242430	3245153	They'll just show more Halo, which is probably what they did.
3245293	3248496	Yeah, they did show a Halo, and they showed some third-party stuff.
3248516	3253521	One of the things I'm kind of surprised they didn't show anything for was Fable the Journey.
3254361	3258125	Not much other than announcing that it's going to be coming out fourth quarter.
3258145	3259586	They didn't really show anything.
3260107	3260808	That is interesting.
3262529	3265672	I was, you know, I was hardcore thinking there was going to be something with Windows 8.
3266652	3267993	And I guess I was wrong there.
3268013	3270355	But the smart glass thing, kind of.
3270455	3272757	Smart glass is going to be... I get like a half point.
3272897	3279162	I think smart glass... Well, smart glass also supports... Not only does it support tablet... Because not... Let's be honest.
3279202	3280763	Not everybody has a tablet or a smartphone.
3281263	3284466	It also does support computers, like PCs and laptops.
3284506	3287668	So if you have a laptop, you can also control your Xbox.
3287989	3288229	Although...
3289634	3294856	I asked then, why the fuck do I need to view my content on the Xbox if I have my laptop in front of me?
3294876	3295416	But whatever.
3295436	3296996	Hey, it's another option.
3297036	3298397	Sometimes you have that party environment.
3298417	3299977	You want to show multiple people at once.
3301178	3306619	Remember that one New Year's Eve party where we were looking up on the Wii.
3306699	3309600	We had to see the dinosaur porn.
3309720	3310500	Or what was that?
3310540	3311821	The pterodactyl porno.
3311841	3312141	Yeah.
3313478	3314679	Thank you, Wii Browser.
3314699	3316361	That was fantastic.
3316442	3323792	One of those websites, yes, it was a chick and some dude in a pterodactyl suit and it was the most hilarious thing.
3323812	3324873	It was ridiculous.
3324893	3326115	It was ridiculous.
3327196	3329760	Anyhow, from Microsoft to pterodactyl porn.
3330600	3331421	Let's go to the chatters.
3331801	3335464	Live.VogNetwork.com A lot of props for South Park.
3335744	3337886	Acidic Vampire says, South Park looks great.
3338326	3339647	Stan says, I think it will be good.
3339667	3341849	The South Park creators are really involved in this game.
3342269	3347713	Tiger Claw says, I liked how Trey Parker and Matt Stone trolled the Microsoft press conference when they showed up for their game.
3347733	3348594	That was fantastic.
3349594	3351476	And Degenerate Johnny says, I'm calling it.
3351876	3355018	One of the South Park's DLC will be Cartman's Ass.
3356339	3357300	Could be Ass of Fire.
3358644	3361785	Well, they have, you know, it's very cool the way they're doing it.
3361845	3364066	The Lemmy Winks or whatever that was.
3365106	3373909	They do have a Lemmy Winks tie and one of the summons you get is Mr. Slave and Mr. Slave sucks the enemy into his ass.
3376201	3376521	Literally.
3376561	3379503	Well, that was that whole Paris Hilton episode or whatever it was.
3379523	3381824	Yes, it's basically that.
3382584	3383885	Nothing is off limits or sacred.
3383925	3384445	It's interesting.
3384485	3388007	But it's kind of cool, though, because you get to play as your own character in there.
3388027	3389468	So you design your own character.
3390048	3391109	And that's kind of neat.
3391297	3392318	I don't like Tomb Raider.
3412796	3413956	But it's a reboot, you never know.
3414116	3414937	But I don't like Tomb Raider.
3415377	3427320	I'm still looking forward to that, although the delay, you know, having to see it two years in a row is a little bit like... But I suppose it's not the first game, it won't be the last, that gets shown across multiple years.
3427360	3431321	Unless I can lock the butler in the fridge and break her neck.
3431621	3432221	I'm not interested.
3432241	3435042	It's technically a prequel, so I don't think there's a butler.
3435522	3436863	You crash on an island.
3436883	3438683	It's Uncharted, Tomb Raider.
3438703	3439663	I don't like Uncharted.
3440223	3440904	It looks good.
3443885	3444445	I mean, it looks good.
3444465	3445506	I'm glad they showed it again.
3445846	3446046	Yeah.
3446867	3447908	Because you kind of forget about it.
3448488	3450910	Okay, so next was Nintendo.
3450990	3451450	Nintendo...
3453750	3458613	I don't understand how they're able to pull something like this off.
3459053	3461975	They had three press conferences because one was not enough.
3462315	3473682	They had a conference that was a pre-E3 conference that talked a little bit about the Wii U. Then they had the regular conference which talked mostly about the Wii U. Then they had a 3DS conference the following day.
3475276	3476317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3491889	3492829	Interface, I guess.
3492889	3494249	It's going to be the Miiverse.
3494790	3497330	And what Miiverse is, it's kind of an upgrade of the Mi Plaza.
3497370	3504951	You basically see all your Mi's congregating Mi's from friends, Mi's of people playing different games.
3505311	3506812	And you see them playing the different games.
3506892	3511872	And plus, you can talk to each other, not only in text chat, but you can picto chat with them as well.
3512072	3513073	So it's Facebook for me?
3513833	3514493	Something like that.
3514573	3519914	You basically can interact with people in a really elaborate way.
3519934	3520654	They've got, you know,
3522242	3527347	I guess spoiler stuff that you can do in there where you can make it so that people don't see your post.
3527367	3528988	I don't want to get spoiled on the game.
3529308	3541339	But they have this whole like kind of like you can post in different spots in games and stuff like for example oh I'm having trouble in this area in the game can anybody help me and then like you know hey I got through this part of the game like this.
3541859	3542980	That's great and all but
3544713	3547814	I mean, that's kind of like what GameFAQs is for or something like that.
3547834	3554395	I guess it's neat that they have this feature and that they showed all this stuff, but I don't know, whatever.
3555596	3568559	One of the other things they are showing off also is a brand new controller for the Wii U, the Wii U Pro Controller, which looks like an Xbox 360 controller with the analog stick and the face buttons flip-flopped.
3571359	3571639	Cool.
3573600	3581023	I guess that'll be used also in conjunction with the Wii Pad and stuff if you want to play regular games instead of using the Wii Remote.
3581123	3584985	Although it will support a Wii Remote and all the Wii accessories as well.
3587266	3587966	So that's kind of neat.
3588266	3589527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3611758	3614219	Also, they have a TV button on there.
3614679	3622861	What the TV button is for is for actually using the tablet as a remote for your TV, like a universal remote.
3622881	3630682	You can actually launch the system and everything from the pad before you even turn the system on, or you can just switch the channel on your TV.
3632323	3633863	I could do that with my Xbox controller.
3634283	3637424	Good question from SheHulk in our chat room, and I didn't catch this either.
3637504	3639044	No Blu-ray or DVD for the Wii U?
3639850	3641531	They didn't say what they're using.
3641931	3642211	Huh.
3643512	3643852	Interesting.
3644072	3644833	Okay.
3645153	3647474	They didn't say what kind of discs they're using.
3647674	3656198	Maybe they feel it's not needed because I noticed Reggie did emphasize, and the way he said it too was very interesting.
3656238	3659140	He said, you know, Netflix, Amazon.
3660515	3685141	Hulu it's there you know he's like it's all there yes of course it's there but we want you to experience me you know it's kind of interesting yeah so let's talk about stuff that people aren't gonna care about and let's talk more in great detail about something else but to his credit what else are you gonna say about Netflix and Amazon and Hulu everybody knows that stuff already you know they're there yay that's that's really all there is to say
3686508	3686848	Yeah.
3686928	3687609	You rhymed.
3688609	3691291	Ranma in our chatroom says Wii U will support Blu-ray storage.
3692412	3692732	Okay.
3692992	3698856	Well, I haven't seen anything yet, but I would assume it's Blu-ray, unless they're going to come out with their own proprietary format, which, whatever.
3700998	3704800	One, of course, the big game, the first game that they unveiled was Pikmin 3.
3704840	3712165	You know, something that has been rumored to be coming to the Wii or the Wii U at some point, and it is a launch title.
3712225	3713906	So they showed off Pikmin 3, and it looks pretty...
3714847	3718189	Scribblenauts Unlimited was another game that they showed off that's pretty awesome.
3719049	3720470	It does use the tablet and stuff.
3720490	3721030	You can actually...
3738138	3738718	I'm getting a Wii U.
3760381	3761902	I did not hear these rumors.
3761922	3764044	We would have never heard them on our show.
3765344	3767926	We would never have known about that a few weeks ago.
3769827	3775331	And then of course, surprise, they're trying to director's cut coming to the Wii U, which is neat.
3775991	3790387	Now, I might have missed this because I was playing in a home over there for a second, checking out the awesome backyard that Blender built for the clubhouse, but Mass Effect 3, Wii U, which has a lot of us kind of wondering, how is that going to work?
3790467	3792349	Because, I mean, you can't...
3793990	3795451	Maybe you target on your little monitor.
3795691	3796032	Well, yeah.
3796552	3803536	That part, I figure maybe the biotics and the gun stuff is on the monitor or whatever, but I'm kind of like, how can you just skip Mass Effect 2?
3804316	3808099	Like, Mass Effect 1, I can see people skipping, although I don't recommend it.
3808139	3810700	I could see you skipping that, but you can't skip Mass Effect 2.
3811100	3811541	You can't.
3812461	3819063	So Mass Effect 3 is going to have to really have something special to separate it from the other versions to get me to want to buy it.
3819543	3825025	Although Mass Effect 3 does have a pretty awesome multiplayer, so it'll be interesting to see if that's pulled off as well on the Nintendo system.
3825425	3827406	Plus, microtransaction hell.
3827726	3832248	Again, I wonder if that's going to be pulled off as seamlessly on the Wii U. They must think so.
3832808	3838810	So I think that tells us a lot right there about Nintendo's online structure if EA is willing to put Mass Effect 3 on.
3839831	3863731	another title that they announced was Sing which is being developed by the DJ Hero developers and Sing is your generic karaoke game with the words on the Wii pad whoopty shit that's what I have to say about that and admit it Call Me Maybe was stuck in your head all week long after that and it's the number one song on iTunes it was not I've never heard of that before
3865538	3867099	I would play it for you, but you'd slap me.
3867699	3868219	Is it that bad?
3868479	3870500	It's pretty bad.
3870520	3872701	3DS stuff, they talked a little bit about Paper Mario.
3872721	3874142	That's supposed to be coming out this season.
3874943	3875523	Holiday season.
3876443	3877444	New Super Mario Bros.
3877804	3880525	2, which is headed to 3DS August 19th.
3881426	3884907	Also, Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon for the 3DS this holiday.
3886028	3886128	Um...
3888032	3893775	They, of course, announced... I thought it was going to be New Super Mario Bros.
3893875	3894155	Me.
3894795	3898917	Oh, but they had to trump me, and it's now called New Super Mario Bros.
3899177	3903900	You, which is announced, and it will have multiplayer... Gotcha!
3905000	3905140	Oh!
3905700	3906321	Nintendo!
3906781	3908562	And so they have that coming.
3908822	3916526	Batman Arkham City Armored Edition is headed to the Wii U, and basically the Game of the Year edition with some extra bells and whistles in there.
3917226	3917346	Um...
3918993	3919574	Let's see.
3920054	3927022	I just want to say real quick, because some of the folks in the chat room are commenting, you know, we're about a minute lagged from when we say things to when they get encoded and people hear them.
3927442	3929705	So people in chat right now are talking about Mass Effect 3.
3930386	3934190	Acidic Vampire says no Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the Wii U equals fail.
3935311	3938074	And Actdeft reminds us PlayStation 3 skipped Mass Effect 1.
3938795	3941677	But again, I'm saying Mass Effect 1 is okay to skip.
3941757	3943078	I don't recommend it, but it's okay.
3943138	3945860	They had, though, to be fair, they had a motion comic.
3945960	3948582	Yes, and WhatUpG reminds us that they did have that bridge.
3948982	3955286	So Technus says BioWare will just do another interactive graphic comic, and that's certainly kind of the likely thing.
3955606	3968515	Now, DarkTetsuya linked us in chat to the story on MyNintendoNews that mentions that Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back, which I guess is what they're calling the Wii U version, will include an enhanced storyline from the original game.
3969115	3972057	Oh no, this says PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3972157	3975459	I think he got the stuff mixed up.
3975479	3983084	Because I was going to say, Take Earth Back, I heard, was a DLC expansion that's possibly coming in the future.
3983204	3987567	So never mind, I guess that's not about the Wii U. That's what I get for trying to do stories live.
3987667	3993351	And of course, and I'm surprised that they did this because I didn't think it's that popular anymore, but I guess it is.
3995573	3996154	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3996214	3997656	No, it said the original game.
3998397	3999818	So this is about the Wii U version.
4000099	4003202	It's the original game on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4003283	4006527	Sorry, I'm seeing this for the first time, so I'm trying to process this myself here.
4006987	4012434	EA hasn't spoken about the enhanced content, and they're saying hopefully it's not just going to be the reworked ending.
4012734	4013956	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4029717	4031458	That is a lot of their launch lineup.
4046523	4048183	So you'll be able to interact with that.
4049724	4058305	And then also, some of these Wii U games, they showed that you can play them without actually having the system on the TV.
4058385	4062786	So you can exercise and stuff like that without looking at the TV.
4063146	4069247	I don't know, it just looks stupid if you're working with the Wii Fit balance board and Wii tablet.
4069267	4070988	I mean, just come on.
4071228	4072428	It's just whatever.
4073309	4090110	and then finally also the Wii U will support two different Wii gamepads however there will be a hit in frames per second they'll actually be halved so the upper limit will be 30 frames per second on both Wii U tablets which whatever honestly
4092597	4093858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4111135	4114377	I think it's a different developer now because before it looked like Grand Theft Auto.
4114557	4119039	It still has that kind of sandbox thing to it, but it definitely doesn't look like Grand Theft Auto anymore.
4120119	4121220	But it looks pretty amazing.
4121540	4123901	Definitely one of the launch games to have on that.
4124922	4126702	However, it doesn't sell me a system.
4127083	4133286	And I still am worried that they didn't talk enough about what their online plan is.
4134006	4139429	Yeah, we know about Miiverse and I can talk with people, leave them little notes about shit in-game, but...
4140589	4141169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4160572	4164773	which are going to have already been out for a few months by the time the system launches.
4165413	4181477	Assassin's Creed 3 looks pretty cool, but why should I buy another system to play a game that I can already play on my system right now and look pretty much the same, but it's going to have a few extra gimmicks with it with this new controller.
4181757	4183858	That's the problem that doesn't sell me on this stuff.
4184178	4184658	For the Wii...
4185598	4185999	Super Mario Bros.
4186019	4186039	U
4206363	4208185	Oh yeah, how am I forgetting about Nintendo Land?
4208345	4209886	I was going to say, I haven't heard of Nintendo Land yet.
4209906	4214090	Nintendo Land, basically the Wii Sports, Wii Play, whatever, Tech Demo Land.
4214110	4217393	The giant cocktease land, because there's my F-Zero.
4217774	4218374	Did you see that?
4219375	4221157	It is basically Tech Demo Land.
4221317	4222939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4242139	4270374	which is great maybe they'll have two they might have two SKUs where one is the kind of like remember the old old school NES how they actually had three versions of that when that first came out there was the robot pack that came with Rob the Robot and like Gyromite and then there was the action pack that came with the Zapper and Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt and then there was the vanilla ass pack I don't remember what it was called the core the core did they call things core back then I think it was called the core system well whatever it was just the NES and Super Mario Brothers basically
4271855	4294897	so I wonder if the Wii U won't launch with a similar type of thing where you could have just the plain Jane system or you get the extra maybe the extra Wii U controller since we hear that they will support two players yeah here's the thing though they're going to support two players but not any of the launch titles are going to support two players on those pads don't so it's something that's coming way down the line um
4296423	4298164	Thanks for watching!
4322372	4323753	And then you've got New Super Mario Bros.
4323773	4325374	for the 3DS, New Super Mario Bros.
4325654	4325374	2.
4326295	4327596	And now you have New Super Mario Bros.
4328156	4331198	U. The problem is, that game looks last gen.
4331318	4332799	That game looks like a Wii game.
4333180	4338984	And yes, I know it's a great game and you're launching it on the system, but I think you need...
4339784	4348475	If you want to show off this game system, you need to come out with something big, like a Super Mario Galaxy type of game, or a Mario 64.
4348535	4352119	Something like, holy shit, I did not expect to see Mario like that.
4352179	4355743	Instead of, hey look, it's slightly prettier New Super Mario Bros.
4355924	4356805	It just doesn't look...
4357958	4358258	Good.
4359118	4365461	As much as I do want that Mario Brothers Wii U game, but I'm not sure I'm totally sold on this system yet.
4365801	4371102	But just to be devil's advocate for a minute, doesn't Pikmin 3 kind of show off some of those capabilities a little better?
4371162	4375584	Yeah, but Pikmin 3 is not a game I think that's going to appeal to everybody.
4376124	4381286	I don't think it... Pikmin doesn't have... It has a following, but it doesn't have a huge following.
4381366	4382127	It's a niche game.
4382747	4383287	Let's be honest.
4383327	4384027	It's a niche game.
4384087	4385748	It didn't sell that great.
4385788	4387189	It's not a Super Mario Brothers.
4387429	4390450	Ranma's reminding me of a couple other Nintendo packs that I forgot earlier.
4390490	4392831	There was the Power Pack when the Power Pad came out.
4392871	4393471	That was later.
4393791	4396012	But yeah, the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt World Class Track Meet.
4396393	4398894	And he says that there was one that was Hogan's Alley in Duck Hunt.
4399314	4404456	I don't remember Hogan's Alley ever being a pack-in game, but maybe it was like... Maybe it wasn't very well distributed.
4405138	4405639	Hogan's Alley
4411218	4413498	Orange Lawn Trader reporting the news from 25 years ago.
4413899	4420960	But, I mean, that's just my problem, though, is they don't have... There's still a lot of information that we need from Nintendo.
4421200	4423341	A price and a date, for God's sake.
4423401	4425541	Well, but they did that with the Wii.
4425901	4433363	They came out later around Tokyo Game Show time, because they don't do Tokyo Game Show, but they'll do their own little thing, and that's when they'll announce it.
4434123	4439684	Well, cool, but I need to know more about the system, and right now, as it stands, I'm not buying one.
4439904	4441686	I'm not even buying one near launch.
4441846	4443208	I just... I don't want it.
4443448	4454362	I don't... I'm kind of with you, but the price will... I mean, A, the price, and B, my disposable income, which I may or may not have at that end of the year, will really factor into my decision.
4454382	4456284	Well, and here's the other thing, too, is just...
4457345	4459506	I learned my lesson with the Wii.
4459586	4460367	The Wii was awesome.
4460627	4461067	I had fun.
4461087	4466250	But see, the Wii, compared to what was already currently available, was very, very different.
4466390	4470372	This is just, hey, look, I have a traditional controller with a goddamn screen on it.
4471653	4472453	Here's my problem with it.
4472873	4475074	You know all these cool things that you're talking about with that controller?
4475375	4475995	Well, guess what?
4476235	4479557	You've had two screens for fucking years now with the DS.
4479897	4483019	And how many really, truly unique games have you seen come out of it?
4483359	4484019	Probably a handful.
4484119	4485400	You probably can count them on one hand.
4485900	4490104	of games that are really using both screens just in an amazing way.
4490924	4501853	But I don't think we're going to get a lot of these really big games because you've had time to do something unique with this and you're just not going to use these two screens.
4501893	4502614	It's going to be a gimmick.
4502794	4514058	I will say this, though, to Nintendo's credit, is that even though the Wii U lineup left me feeling, and I think a lot of us feeling a little, eh, especially when they ended with Nintendo Land, I think that was a big, eh.
4514258	4516119	Oh, yeah, that was just kind of, that's it?
4516419	4517259	Yeah, it was too bad.
4517299	4518240	Zelda or something?
4518360	4521901	But the 3DS lineup looked great.
4523075	4526917	I gotta say, that new, you know, the Golden Coins Mario game looked great.
4527197	4529878	The Castlevania game especially looked great.
4530398	4542183	So, I feel like the 3DS, I kind of wish they'd show, I mean, I realize they did that whole second press conference where they showed more, but I was kind of hoping for a little more at the big show because there's a lot of good stuff going on.
4542223	4543324	Did you know something that was missing?
4544184	4545525	The redesign of the 3DS?
4545605	4547966	Well, that too, but Animal Crossing.
4548846	4549506	No Animal Crossing.
4549586	4550767	It was missing, wasn't it?
4551877	4553299	Delayed Delayed Delayed Delayed Delayed
4574841	4585207	It is a very... I gotta say, I mean, you're gonna have a hard time selling somebody on... Let's just, you know, an average parent or whatever, okay?
4585308	4586488	I can buy the system now.
4586608	4589290	Well, who knows what the Wii's gonna be, you know, dropping down to.
4589330	4594413	I mean, let's say it goes down to, you know, 99 bucks or something.
4594433	4594813	Oh, man, $99 Wii?
4594853	4595473	That'd be crazy.
4595954	4596074	But...
4597095	4616632	and you know you've got the Wii system right now and I can buy new Super Mario Brothers and it's pretty awesome I mean the people aren't gonna know oh hey oh that's the Wii U version you know and honestly the Wii U stuff aside from oh cool I you know I can play on my Wii pad or whatever when um you know someone's on the TV or
4617032	4619913	Fuck, that's not how you're supposed to be selling your system.
4619953	4626394	You're not supposed to be selling your system, hey, when someone wants to watch TV, you can play your game system on this pad.
4626834	4633896	No, you're supposed to say, hey, when someone's playing something on the TV, you bop out your fucking 3DS and you play New Super Mario Bros.
4633916	4634516	2 on there.
4634536	4636296	That's how you fucking solve that situation.
4636576	4638957	You sell them on the portable system and the regular system.
4638977	4643998	You don't say, hey, you don't fucking need the portable system because, hey, you got the stupid tablet now.
4644358	4645599	They're fucking stupid.
4645679	4646880	I mean, it's just dumb.
4647720	4652323	We're at an hour 18, so before we move on to this, let me read some comments from chat on this whole thing.
4652683	4662109	Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, at vognetwork.com, live chat, says, I would like a new platformer of Black Tiger for the Wii U and that would help convince me to buy one.
4662409	4691660	I have the Playstation 2 compilation pack with Black Tiger and Dungeon Buster chimes in saying I'd snatch one up day one if it had something like that everybody's got their dream game you know I've been sitting here saying F-Zero F-Zero F-Zero god damn it F-Zero you know everybody's got their game that they want to have let's see Acidic Vampire says screw a 3DS Castlevania give me a next gen Castlevania a la Symphony of the Night amen to that Shadow Next Gen who is at the show chimes in most of the Wii U titles shown at E3 are launch titles so
4694059	4695541	Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
4695781	4696902	True and not true.
4696922	4698884	Launch window titles.
4699384	4700265	No, I'm serious.
4700725	4702847	They're not launch day titles.
4702948	4716941	They're launch window, and that's... And although what he's saying is mostly true, Nintendo doesn't... I mean, Nintendo certainly doesn't project, let's say, quite as badly as Sony, last Guardian, or Microsoft, Halo 4 last year and Tomb Raider,
4717741	4722484	do, but Nintendo did troll us what?
4722705	4722965	Really?
4723725	4724506	They don't project?
4725026	4725767	Not as bad.
4725927	4737174	I'm not saying, but I am saying, Nintendo did do that whole Smash Brothers thing last year, and we know that that's a good three years away, but they didn't show anything.
4737374	4741477	And they said, we're announcing it, it'll come out eventually.
4741657	4743278	Ooh, Rob, Bagenator's calling on you.
4743478	4743719	What?
4743799	4744059	Why?
4744139	4744359	What?
4744579	4746140	F-Zero is overrated.
4746180	4746861	Get out!
4749142	4750082	Someone smack him with a fish.
4750102	4750623	Is he in the home?
4750943	4751603	Is he in the home?
4751623	4754064	Because I'm going to go bop him in the head in Sony Home right now.
4754725	4755285	I'm on the hunt.
4755325	4756125	Where's Ragenator?
4756906	4757746	I'm going to go smack him.
4759047	4760467	Meanwhile, speaking of Sony.
4761048	4762468	Let's talk a little bit about Sony.
4762928	4765450	Sony had some pretty interesting things.
4765470	4774114	They came out talking about their Sony mascot Battle Royale.
4774194	4776415	Sony All-Stars Battle Royale game.
4777215	4782640	did announce two new characters for it and kind of confirming that there are going to be some third-party characters in there.
4783922	4790328	They announced Big Daddy's going to be one of the playable characters and also Nathan Drake, which is kind of a duh.
4790808	4792690	But those are going to be available as well.
4793951	4797014	I'm sure they've got a lot more to unveil there.
4798876	4800497	They did talk a little bit about...
4802659	4805563	Some interesting ideas, I guess.
4807786	4813594	One of them was this, I don't even know why, a wonder book.
4815117	4815177	J.K.
4815197	4815777	Rowling's Book of Spells
4841691	4867217	and you know they're kind of sending it on oh hey she she wrote it and it's all this all new stuff and hey check it out it's pretty sweet it was pretty fucking boring it was probably the worst thing that they had of their whole here's the thing though now keep in mind we weren't watching the press conference we were only reading the tweets because we were in line for Indiana Jones or something at the time and
4867837	4890396	so while you guys were kind of like seeing that and I guess bored with the presentation those of us were kind of reading about it and we actually sat there going that is a brilliant move by Sony because the part there that you glossed over that I think is crucial they have fucking JK Rowling in their back pocket now don't underestimate the power of that woman
4891496	4893298	Pottermore ain't that great either.
4893659	4895061	Pottermore's actually pretty neat.
4895962	4897924	But I suck at mixing spells.
4898746	4901249	There's a lot of people going crazy over it.
4901890	4904533	Pottermore is also very age-broad.
4905314	4905655	True.
4906876	4907277	I just think...
4909860	4918225	I think there's a lot more to this, especially with the whole, you know, Sony does have a family friendly thing that they need to try to get a little bit of that Nintendo audience.
4918245	4920426	And I think the Wonder Book is a way to kind of push that.
4921207	4922207	Don't underestimate it.
4922327	4922908	That's all I'm saying.
4922928	4923388	You know what?
4923568	4926030	I understand where you're coming from there, but it's...
4926730	4944364	you're asking someone to purchase if they don't own a Playstation 3 you're asking them to purchase a Playstation 3 a Playstation Move set up and then this Wonder Book on top of it like a $400 investment for a fucking lame ass looking game I keep saying Wonder Book and I think of Superbook right?
4944844	4945124	I might...
4963581	4964622	buy that one instead.
4977771	4985276	I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but to buy that for that specific thing, it looks terrible.
4985576	4986576	It looks fucking terrible.
4986877	4994401	And if you think about it, Rob, they also have Harry Potter for Kinect, so if you want to go that bullshit route of, well, they have J.K.
4994481	4995622	Rowling's in this book of things.
4996022	5000225	Yeah, I could read a fucking book and pretend to do magic or I could become fucking Harry Potter.
5000345	5000765	Alright.
5001205	5003066	I think becoming Harry Potter wins.
5003166	5004367	Fine, you made your point.
5004487	5005608	I'm in fucking Hogwarts.
5005728	5008549	My creepy face is on that stupid avatar.
5008769	5009170	Fine.
5009690	5010691	Well, you made your point.
5011491	5012452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5031927	5039191	and, of course, you know, full free games if you're a subscriber of PlayStation Plus and they're going to be adding more as time goes on.
5039651	5042213	Also, PlayStation 1 Classics are coming back to the Vita.
5043173	5043713	No duh there.
5043754	5046175	That's kind of, you know, been leaked out already.
5046655	5054679	And they're going to slowly roll those out starting with, I think, Final Fantasy VII and maybe Tomb Raider, some other stuff.
5056400	5057241	That's pretty amazing.
5057601	5058922	Also, some Vita titles...
5060122	5069546	Not a whole lot of first-party Vita titles that are going to be coming out for the... I was also shocked at the lack of Vita.
5069866	5074508	It was basically... I mean, all the stuff that was coming out this fall is pretty much stuff we already knew about.
5074908	5079010	I mean, LittleBigPlanet carding and LittleBigPlanet.
5079590	5082771	To be fair, some of that may show up at Tokyo Game Show.
5083111	5084872	After all, Sony is a Japanese company.
5084892	5085312	That's true.
5085372	5087473	Some of that may be in their back pocket for Tokyo Game Show.
5087653	5089234	At least I hope to hell that's what happens.
5089908	5097212	And then, of course, also there's the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which is going to be on the Vita as well.
5097792	5099233	Another pretty cool thing.
5099253	5099853	I've got to say this.
5099873	5102714	ShadowNextGen in our chatroom says, where is the Vita price drop?
5103255	5104735	That was made up by the internet.
5104935	5109458	I think people assumed just because the 3DS had a price drop, the Vita was going to get one too.
5109878	5110878	It's too soon.
5110898	5113039	They're not going to announce a price drop yet.
5113280	5114060	I kind of agree.
5114140	5118202	And I think the tech in the Vita, it would be a bigger loss to Sony to do something like that.
5118862	5124047	They're not going to announce a price drop three months after it's come out.
5124087	5126409	That's going to be like, oh yeah, we failed.
5126429	5127350	They're not going to do that.
5127470	5132514	They're not going to announce, hey, we're going to drop the price in October.
5132774	5141822	That being said, however, now that they've kind of ignored it at this show, now they might have painted themselves in a corner to have to do that.
5142242	5169964	Tokyo Game Show is going to be critical to the future of the Vita believe it they did talk about you know some games that are kind of big does Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified not necessarily going to be the same Black Ops 2 games so it's a little disappointing to me but we'll see what it is and then Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which is going to be its own kind of unique game with its own character which is kind of cool that launches October 30th as well
5172466	5200346	and then of course the big big reveal that they had was the brand new Quadric Dream game which is Beyond Two Souls and just such an amazing looking game basically kind of taking everything that you liked from Heavy Rain and just amping it up just the motion capture in it now is just ridiculous how well that looks um
5202393	5205816	and big name stars behind it as well.
5207177	5208038	It's cool.
5208098	5210360	Definitely got to check it out.
5210620	5213963	They have now... God, who's the fucking actress?
5214544	5215264	I hate myself.
5215665	5216145	Ellen Page.
5216245	5216906	Ellen Page, yes.
5217026	5221670	Ellen Page is now doing the mocap and... Kitty Pryde.
5222651	5223031	That too.
5223271	5223792	Kitty Pryde.
5224372	5225673	I saw the screens from it.
5226113	5227694	It looks really good.
5244621	5244981	It's neat.
5245182	5246362	It looked pretty cool.
5247203	5249924	If you don't like the quick time event stuff, then maybe not for you.
5249984	5252446	But you probably didn't like Heavy Rain either.
5252526	5254647	I need to go watch that trailer.
5254667	5256008	I heard a lot of excitement about it.
5256068	5257929	Granted, I kind of missed the boat on Heavy Rain.
5258390	5260531	Definitely watch the demo footage.
5260551	5261712	They have 20 minutes for the game.
5261752	5262272	It looks awesome.
5262312	5263273	I'm going to check it out for sure.
5263433	5263793	Really cool.
5264654	5266076	So overall, Sony's conference?
5266737	5267458	Yeah.
5267498	5267938	How'd you feel?
5268018	5268899	Oh, and one more thing.
5269000	5273986	A little Big Planet 2 is getting some DLC that's going to turn the Vita into a controller for the game.
5274407	5274927	That's pretty cool.
5274988	5275448	That's cool.
5275789	5276329	That's very cool.
5276409	5277791	A lot of cross-play stuff there.
5278552	5278793	I think...
5279313	5282395	Honestly, out of the three, I think they have the strongest.
5282715	5288137	Because they showed off this really amazing game, a new property for them, a new IP.
5288397	5292439	And then, of course, they were showing off some of the stuff that they had.
5292539	5294000	Third Party was pretty awesome.
5294360	5296401	It didn't seem like there was a lot that bored me too much.
5296761	5298142	Wonder Book was pretty eh.
5298522	5305871	I mean, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like Nintendo's press conference was just like, okay, when we get into the good stuff, when we get into the good stuff, it's over?
5306572	5307053	It's over?
5307313	5315443	I mean, it's like, when are we getting to these like, holy crap, holy crap, I need to buy the system for this game, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool, and I mean...
5315803	5337811	I think next year's Nintendo's press conference it better be anyway it's gonna be a lot like that one a couple years ago remember that year I think this was two years ago where Reggie came out on stage and was basically like you want games fine here's some games bam bam bam bam he showed like eight of them off in a row and he's like there's all your fucking games good night
5339423	5340364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5362635	5366719	Zappy in our chatroom says Nintendo needs to learn the magic of one more thing.
5366840	5368141	Harness the Steve Jobs.
5369222	5370824	They did that with fucking Metroid.
5370844	5371345	Remember that?
5371525	5371905	One more thing.
5371925	5373487	Fucking Metroid game!
5375189	5380175	Metroid game by Team Ninja that sounds awesome and will be okay when it comes out.
5381716	5382217	Alright, anyhow.
5383758	5385279	Was that, I think that might have been the same year.
5385359	5387560	No, that was the year before, I think.
5387881	5396086	It was the year that that Metroid game was actually coming out that I think was the year where Reggie was like, we got this, and we got this, and we got this.
5396387	5401150	And if any of you fuckers write that no games are coming out for the Wii, I will personally come to your house and beat your ass.
5401410	5402311	At least that's what I heard.
5402731	5404332	My body is ready to kick some ass.
5406949	5410253	All right, quickly the third-party crest conferences because we're already an hour and a half.
5410273	5410693	All right, real quick.
5410713	5413496	They didn't have them any this year, but Ubisoft did.
5414177	5414998	Sorry off of them, of course.
5415359	5422367	But Konami had the online one that showed lots and lots of Metal Gear Rising, which, granted, if you like violence, looks great.
5424028	5424889	It sounds cool.
5425129	5426530	I didn't watch that one, unfortunately.
5427231	5429272	Ubisoft, they had Just Dance 4.
5429693	5430013	Duh.
5430914	5436518	It is going to have some Wii U specific features including a puppet master mode where you can change up the dance moves on the fly.
5436939	5439100	Yeah, it's kind of fun if you're in a party environment, I guess.
5439801	5443364	Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth, which is coming to the Wii U and Kinect.
5444245	5444365	Um...
5447118	5457814	and it also supposed to be like kind of they said drawing from the secret invasion universe that has like scrolls posing as superheroes and stuff but it looks terrible.
5457834	5459416	The secret invasion thing was crap.
5459496	5461058	It looks fucking terrible.
5461319	5462701	It was even worse than Civil War.
5463582	5466523	The gameplay looks bad, just saying.
5468403	5472084	They have like the X-Men in there, so I don't understand how that's Avengers, but whatever.
5472224	5475105	They were involved in Wolverines and every team in the Marvel Universe ever.
5476005	5476345	It's true.
5477045	5478706	Hey, he's got to work.
5479466	5482187	He even hung out with Power Pack.
5482607	5485367	Hey, time for a total tangent where I derail the show.
5486328	5488068	I finally saw the Avengers this weekend.
5488450	5488911	Wasn't it good?
5489011	5489872	Did you save for the whole thing?
5489892	5490473	It was pretty good.
5490493	5491914	The whole thing?
5491954	5496961	No, we thought once we saw the dude, we thought it was over.
5497061	5497341	No.
5497401	5502087	And then we realized in the car on the way home, wasn't Jamie talking about a scene with blah, blah, blah?
5502628	5503529	Oh, God damn it.
5503549	5504891	There must have been more after the...
5505191	5515178	This is why you always, always, always, always, always stay through the entire credits of a Marvel movie because they will fuck with you.
5515458	5519701	One does not simply leave a movie before the end of the credits.
5519721	5520801	Okay, I made a mistake.
5520861	5521902	It's on YouTube.
5522302	5524264	That means we're going to go back and see it.
5525646	5530551	Rayman Legends was another game that they showed off and that was a sequel to Rayman Origins.
5531512	5531973	Pretty awesome.
5531993	5539922	It's going to have 5 player co-op with the Wii U and also the Pro Controller and Wiimote are supported and the gameplay looks just
5540522	5540923	Awesome.
5541243	5545168	Just really, really cool stuff that they've got going there with that.
5546670	5547070	Very cool.
5547991	5560346	One of the games that I thought was a joke when they were showing it originally on the Wii U pre-E3 conference, which was a zombie game that this really dorky guy was just kind of being all cliche about and like,
5560706	5561507	I need help!
5561847	5562988	Help me, internet!
5563048	5565871	I need to know how to beat this boss!
5565891	5568153	That commercial is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
5568193	5569254	But it's a real game.
5570115	5572277	Zombie U is the name of it.
5572337	5573899	It's a fucking stupid name.
5574279	5580986	It was originally Killer Freaks from Outer Space, which was going to be a neat looking game that had almost like evil rabbits looking characters.
5581426	5582888	But now it's a generic zombie shooter game.
5583648	5603684	but they're going to have some interesting uses of the Wii controller and honestly to me this game looks like it's going to be another Red Steel which some people may like Red Steel but Red Steel ended up being one of those games hey it looked pretty cool at E3 and then when it came out it was not very cool.
5604164	5605765	It was just kind of ehhh.
5607006	5608850	But, um, we'll see.
5609010	5610853	I mean, um, zombie game, neat.
5611515	5615502	And then, um, of course, they talked a little bit about, um, Far Cry 3, which...
5617706	5621968	Oh, that trailer they showed was a bit graphic.
5622268	5623769	It was just, boobies!
5623869	5625210	Hey, boobies!
5625490	5628111	And apparently, you know, I know Bobby was talking a little bit about it.
5628192	5634355	And I even asked him, like, hey, were you watching this online or were you watching this on, like, Spike or G4 or something like that?
5634395	5636956	Did they censor those fucking tits on TV?
5637396	5638477	Nope, they did not.
5638657	5641138	So that's a little... Boobie soft.
5641178	5642759	That's a little problem, yes.
5642899	5643659	And boobie soft.
5643899	5644820	I'm sad I missed it.
5645000	5647061	Boobysoft hashtag was launched from there.
5649702	5652424	By the way, I love Aisha Tyler.
5653284	5655766	And I think it's great that she got to emcee.
5655846	5659227	It's funny because what do her and Joel McHale have in common?
5660068	5662689	They've both hosted The Soup on E!
5663410	5664750	Aisha Tyler was the host before.
5666411	5666831	I love her.
5666871	5667512	I think she's great.
5667552	5668612	She's got a podcast too.
5669012	5669353	Girl...
5670534	5673438	I almost said Girls Gone Wow, but that's not her show.
5673919	5674761	That's not her show.
5675081	5678447	It's Girl on Guy, I think is the name of the show, and it's pretty good.
5678567	5679449	Alan's a really big fan.
5679469	5682073	But she's actually a gamer, so that's kind of cool.
5682173	5684117	She is, and she has a big lady boner for Halo.
5685652	5686273	I like her a lot.
5686934	5687374	She's funny.
5687414	5688075	I've met her.
5688095	5689557	I would love to have her on the show.
5690358	5693481	I know that will never happen because she does the talk on CBS.
5694022	5696385	But I would just love to chat with Aisha Tyler.
5696465	5696985	She was funny.
5697246	5698387	I met her in person once.
5698767	5700469	I don't know.
5700550	5700650	It's...
5702455	5706557	She was not that annoying, but the other guy, oh my fucking god.
5706977	5708238	Why was he there?
5708418	5709758	He was so fucking annoying.
5709798	5710979	And the banter was just annoying.
5711459	5715761	And then finally, they were talking a little bit about their service that they've got.
5716381	5726266	They have some free games that you can play, including they've added Trials Evolution and Beyond Good and Evil HD, I Am Alive, and some more stuff to their free play service.
5726286	5728167	So that's pretty awesome that they've got that as well.
5728927	5730528	Watch Dogs Watch Dogs
5749258	5750019	That game looked rad.
5750179	5751220	And it looks fantastic.
5751240	5752081	I did watch that.
5752161	5752902	That looked rad.
5753042	5753903	And you know what?
5753984	5758108	Most people were going around saying Ubisoft won E3.
5758168	5759250	I mean, whatever the hell that means.
5759850	5761332	Congratulations, you win an E3.
5761652	5762894	I think they did pretty good.
5763074	5766238	Based on that, almost single-handedly, that.
5767158	5768880	That had more people talking than anything else.
5769040	5770120	That was an amazing game.
5770160	5782208	It's basically this kind of futuristic game where you play this guy who has hijacked control of, it's in the future, Chicago, and basically this computer runs the whole city.
5782349	5782709	Everything.
5782929	5786912	Every telephone network, street lights, whatever.
5786992	5792755	He has this almost like a magic phone that he can dial in and hack anything.
5792775	5796318	You find out information about people and it's just this whole espionage.
5797138	5798379	Stealth kind of action game.
5798419	5800201	And there's a shooter element in there as well.
5800761	5803223	And just the integration with your phone.
5803363	5805584	It's supposed to kind of use the smart glass stuff.
5806705	5807586	Really cool looking thing.
5807626	5812189	Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Nintendo, but A, was that game announced for Wii U?
5812209	5812429	Nope.
5812509	5813330	Because I don't think it was.
5813550	5816212	And B, I think that's a real problem.
5817193	5818394	That's a real problem.
5818434	5825078	When more people are talking about somebody else's game that's not coming to your system more so than your brand new system.
5825339	5825819	That is very...
5825879	5826800	DarkSakura, Loki,
5845180	5849922	However, to be fair, yet, we never know what might ultimately pan out before the launch.
5850702	5852202	It may not be a launch window.
5852222	5855023	Remember, Reggie was focusing on launch window games.
5855183	5856103	This may not be until 2013.
5856143	5857924	Well, this definitely isn't a launch window.
5858004	5858924	That could be the problem.
5859144	5860405	Well, here's the other thing, too.
5862125	5864586	Shadow Next Gen says it wasn't announced for any system.
5864626	5865987	It wasn't announced for 360 or PS3 either.
5866327	5870508	The press site they have listed for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
5870928	5872449	Everyone thinks it's for Next Gen, though.
5872769	5872909	And I...
5873889	5874390	It could be.
5874570	5876311	It looks very next-gen, that's for sure.
5876951	5883016	Another game that was not at Ubisoft at all, which is kind of surprising, was Rainbow Six Patriots.
5883056	5883576	Where was that?
5883777	5884637	That was just missing.
5885398	5890662	So who knows where that's been, but I don't know.
5891883	5893624	Pretty exciting lineup.
5893784	5894705	Let's quickly do EA.
5894725	5897206	We're running long for Part A, but we knew we would.
5897267	5897507	It's E3 week.
5898446	5900968	EA, real quick, they had lots of sports games to show off.
5901008	5905311	Of course, brand new Madden now.
5905391	5906952	It's a brand new engine that's going to be running.
5906972	5910834	The new Infinity Engine has really awesome physics and stuff, so that looks pretty cool.
5912135	5913636	They talked a little bit about some new games.
5913696	5916498	Dead Space 3, which is kind of a duh that's coming out in February.
5916558	5918919	Need for Speed Most Wanted being rebooted by Criterion.
5918959	5921421	Looks like Burnout with cops.
5921461	5923082	Burnout Paradise with cops, great.
5923943	5925724	SimCity that's going to be now online online.
5926204	5927685	Only, which is kind of annoying.
5928425	5928906	Boo.
5929446	5931867	That decision is going to tank that franchise.
5932068	5932388	Watch.
5932788	5941513	Because what they're saying, and Bobby went into this a little bit on his show tonight, and I totally am agreeing with his sentiment, is that it's getting away from that whole sandbox thing.
5941533	5945495	Remember how you could unleash Godzilla and a nuclear strike and all that on your city?
5945836	5947857	And then, okay, just go back and load your save file.
5948097	5948958	You can't do that.
5949358	5951279	When it's online only, there's no save files now.
5951499	5952960	People like doing that in The Sims.
5953360	5955281	Why would you do that to your franchise?
5955381	5958242	I think that is a really bad decision.
5959383	5959743	Watch.
5959923	5961284	It worked for Diablo.
5961404	5964885	It's not going to work for UEA.
5965846	5974830	Diablo being online only, not that everybody's okay with that anyway, but so many people were already playing that game online that it wasn't a deal-breaker.
5975470	5997208	But SimCity, you don't play that online, ever And it's sad too because that's a game that I would like to play offline And it looks like an amazing game, it's just Unless you do have a local file Because for some online franchises they do pull your data off a local file So that could work But, not likely
5997828	6003653	I don't think that they're going to because Diablo 3, if you think about it, could have done that as well but they didn't go that route.
6004173	6006676	I think they just shot the franchise in the foot with that decision.
6006796	6007096	Watch.
6007857	6008617	They can always change it.
6008637	6009238	They've got time.
6009658	6010319	I don't think they're going to.
6010359	6014202	I think the whole thing is they're trying to combat piracy and they think that online only is the way to go.
6016820	6017580	I don't know.
6017961	6020103	Once again, you're hurting the legitimate users of it.
6021263	6022725	Medal of Honor Warfighter looks amazing.
6022925	6025307	Very realistic-looking game.
6025347	6026788	Crysis 3 is just kind of weird.
6026908	6030731	I don't understand why I need to use a bow and arrow in this game, but neat.
6030911	6033533	I mean, it's a beautiful-looking game, that's for sure.
6035575	6038217	SimCity Social for Facebook they announced, which...
6039258	6039578	Cool.
6040679	6044842	Battlefield 3, of course, the Battlefield 3 Premium service, they announced that.
6045783	6051167	It's out on PS3 first, and then PC and Xbox, kind of opposite of Call of Duty Elite.
6052387	6054889	Star Wars Old Republic is sort of going free-to-play.
6055009	6060033	They're going free-to-play up to level 15, and they're going to also be adding new content as well.
6062353	6066715	Also Madden NFL kind of jumping on the social bandwagon that they have with FIFA.
6067475	6069535	And they actually have some interesting stuff now.
6069575	6073016	The new game has like a fake Twitter feed that's on there.
6073236	6078797	It comments on your performance and stuff like you're having real fans comment on your game, which is kind of cool.
6078817	6079738	They've got that going.
6080158	6084399	Plus a lot of other presentation perks that they added with that.
6085559	6113425	and last but not least the big one EA has secured the UFC franchise so that's going to be coming to EA now and they bought it from THQ for an unsaid amount of money and basically the reasoning behind that was UFC 3 which was the last UFC game to come out from THQ didn't make their money so they have to cut it and that's what they did they cut the franchise and sold it to EA
6114685	6118446	Although I'm worried now that if it's going to be like EA Sports MMA, which is kind of terrible.
6120246	6120807	All right.
6121407	6122367	Well, thank you.
6122527	6124808	That was a lot of news from E3.
6125468	6129569	But I think we kind of covered it all there and gave our feedback as well as you guys there in our chat room.
6129729	6131109	And we do have some more to talk about.
6131129	6132270	We're not done with the show yet.
6132350	6134190	We're going to get into some of the little stuff in the next half.
6134230	6137331	What's kind of sad that we didn't see was No Dead Rising 3 announcement.
6138447	6139407	That is interesting.
6139448	6140548	That didn't end up happening.
6140868	6141609	Why do you think that is?
6142209	6146451	Maybe it's one of those things, you know, like I've been hearing from a lot of different developers and publishers.
6146951	6147972	It's not ready to show.
6148072	6149212	They're not ready to show it yet.
6149332	6151113	Or they're not ready to talk about that yet.
6151153	6152914	Which is the whole excuse behind Last Guardian.
6153254	6154255	Yeah, Last Guardian.
6155695	6157836	Capcom had a few things that they were showing off.
6157876	6158937	Obviously, Street Fighter...
6159945	6180881	you know I don't really well Street Fighter X Tekken for the Vita and then they also had Lost Planet 3 which was a big thing Devil May Cry they're kind of focusing on those franchises if you think about it those are coming out quarter one so this might be a fourth quarter game might be something for next E3 or maybe something that they announced at Tokyo Game Show who knows so it may just not be ready yet hmm interesting
6181761	6187005	Alright, well, we're running a bit long, but we do have a few more segments we want to get in here before we get to Part B tonight.
6187025	6188146	Some people prefer it long.
6190048	6195993	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out a little sooner than any of the games we just talked about.
6196984	6203046	This week, we don't have a whole ton, but we've got Lollipop Chainsaw on PS3 and 360, and that's sometimes all you need.
6204787	6212810	Dirt Showdown is supposed to be coming out this week, although I'm not sure if it's actually going to be coming out on Tuesday because they're having production problems, but sometime hopefully this week.
6213090	6213791	That's on PS3 and 360.
6215171	6217932	And then not a whole lot else.
6218312	6224555	If you're a fan of the Nickelodeon series iCarly, there's a Groovy Foodie game coming out on Nintendo DS.
6225175	6229359	on the Vita, getting a couple games, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and Gravity Rush.
6230039	6233001	Gravity Rush looks pretty awesome, so hopefully that'll be pretty cool.
6233462	6237345	And then, I believe that's it.
6238274	6239475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6257193	6260315	Persona 4 The Golden comes out in Japan this week.
6260635	6263557	There's a whole little accessory set as well that you can get for the Vita.
6263577	6270081	There's also a Super Monkey Ball game called Tokumori Asobita comes out this week as well on the PlayStation Vita.
6270541	6272983	I have a feeling more people will be crazy about the Persona 4.
6273463	6275084	I know there's a lot of fans of that here in the U.S.
6275905	6285755	Going to the PlayStation 3, Lollipop Chainsaw in Japan as well, and also a game called Lord of Sorcery, as well as some new joystick adapters coming from Hori.
6285775	6288578	Is that Lord of Sorcery from Sony?
6288799	6291001	I believe that is just Sorcery here.
6291261	6292683	It is from Sony.
6293544	6295226	And that's a Move integrated game.
6296107	6300151	FIFA 12 gets a price reduction as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
6300612	6304276	Quickly taking a look at the Xbox 360.
6305177	6314268	Akai Katana Shin gets a price reduction this Friday as well as Shatos gets a price reduction as well and Lollipop Chainsaw on the 360 as well.
6314488	6315129	And that's Japan.
6315389	6315810	DarkSakura?
6316530	6323114	Well, we have a few things in the UK and I would tell everybody if my thing would pull up.
6323234	6323695	There we go.
6324735	6330159	We have coming up on the 13th, Doctor Who, The Eternity Clock and Gravity Rush.
6331220	6341046	And then on the 15th, we have Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, Heroes of Ruin, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier and Lollipop Chainsaw.
6342768	6354743	and that would do it for the UK alright well let's go way back back past E3 and past what's coming out this week and go way back in time to when things were a little bit simpler
6357403	6360145	Back when you had to read about E3 and Nintendo Power.
6360885	6363307	Okay, maybe not that long ago, but still pretty far back.
6363347	6369130	It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week, where DarkSakura's gonna go into the gaming vault and pull out an old-ass video game.
6369150	6374713	She thinks, hey, while you guys are waiting for all this stuff to come out, respect a classic.
6375234	6378356	This is one literally from the vault, which is how I decided.
6378916	6383559	I picked a box of PS games, and this was the second one on them.
6384099	6386081	and what is this week's classic game of the week?
6386242	6398315	Policenauts Policenauts is one of the cinematic adventure games that was done by Hideo Kojima it has yeah it was a Konami game the old Konami logo
6399896	6401277	Aw, I miss that.
6402517	6412720	It was initially released for the PC-9821 in 1994, and then they remade versions for the 3DO, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn in 96.
6413760	6419421	It has never officially been released outside of Japan, although they were going to localize it on the Saturn.
6420062	6425203	And then on August 24th, in honor of the 46th birthday of Hideo Kojima,
6425683	6426364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6440982	6453008	It's a very interesting game because it really refers back to different references like to Lethal Weapon and Urashima Taro, which is an old Japanese tale.
6454048	6462172	The game is about a detective who travels to a space colony to investigate his ex-wife's murder and her new husband's disappearance.
6463453	6476264	So it is first person point and click interface and you play as the protagonist Jonathan Ingram who is a police not basically former police officer trained to be a police officer in space.
6477685	6487814	With the console you use the mouse but on the Saturn version you can use the light gun for shooting parts of the game so it's actually a little bit more rich in terms of play.
6490697	6510215	but on the other consoles it's basically point and click first person shooter type stuff and you know with random saves and everything and it actually has an easter egg that if you've got a save file of Tokimeki Memorial it refers back to it so pretty funny
6511176	6514759	And of course that came up in Metal Gear Solid where it read your save files on your PlayStation card.
6515520	6519182	Oh, you are a careful man who saves often.
6520703	6531852	So basically, again, like I said, Jonathan Ingram is a police knot who is assigned to Beyond Coast, which is the first functional space colony in 2013.
6531912	6534434	So next year, we're apparently colonizing space.
6535274	6542901	So he goes to see what happened to Lorraine, who was his ex-wife, and her husband's vanished, so he has to find out what's going on.
6542941	6549246	So he works with his buddy from the LAPD, Ed Brown, who is helping him with the investigation.
6551227	6570156	and so it really is just that point-and-click now for different versions that came out I did mention it originally was on the NEC PC 9821 and it was one CD-ROM that had an installation floppy disk and the cutscenes were rendered were rendered in hand-drawn pixel art instead of full-motion video
6573057	6577959	It also is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games.
6578719	6580980	Then it came out on the 3DO on September 29th, 1995.
6581660	6584041	It was two CD-ROMs and had animated cutscenes.
6584061	6585561	It was CG animation.
6586442	6588322	All the graphics were completely redrawn for it.
6588822	6592844	PS version came out in January 1996 on two discs.
6593304	6594344	That's the version I have.
6594424	6596605	Actually, I have the Best Hits version of that, just to say.
6598045	6600006	Then it came out on the Sega Saturn on September 13th, 1996.
6600066	6602327	And it used, like I said, the light gun.
6603088	6615573	Other versions that have been out is that there was the Policenauts Pilot Disc for 3DO that had a playable demo of the backstory of the game, featurettes, and information on the voice actors and developers.
6615653	6619695	Then there was the Policenauts Private Collection that came out on the PlayStation February 9th, 1996.
6620555	6639786	that a lot of the same content and an earlier version of the game script the PlayStation 1 has been reissued twice there is the Konami the best version which is the one that I have and then it came out for the PlayStation store making it downloadable for PlayStation Portable and for PS3
6641427	6655019	there was a plan to localize it on the Saturn there actually is cover art that exists for this and there's a fan translation that was done for the PlayStation which you can actually use through what's the word I'm thinking of?
6655039	6664066	Emulator and I've seen a bunch of it through that I've played through half of it in Japanese with a copy of that script so
6665467	6675290	There was also a soundtrack that was released, and then Policenauts FN, which is arranged versions of the music from the soundtrack.
6676151	6683593	And there was the MIDI Power Pro 3, so there was a MIDI arrangement of Policenauts music, and the Snatcher Policenauts music disc.
6684013	6687074	It was called Music Collection of Hideo Kojima Black Disc.
6687815	6689015	And there you go, Policenauts.
6692320	6693421	Oh, if I may say so.
6693761	6697162	There's also references to Policenauts and Snatcher in the Metal Gear games.
6698383	6700304	When it detects your save files and all that?
6700624	6700964	Well, no.
6702765	6704266	In fact, here's an obvious one.
6704746	6711909	There's a scene where Otacon is flashbacked to being a big nerd.
6712530	6717072	And there's scenes from Policenauts and Snatcher in his flashbacks.
6717994	6722077	BaconBits in our chatroom asks, is there an official release on the US PlayStation Network?
6722177	6722337	No.
6722477	6722617	Nope.
6722817	6723698	But maybe someday.
6724578	6726159	Bug them enough.
6726399	6732523	However, you can find Policenauts, I think, relatively inexpensive if you're getting the re-release.
6734324	6736706	And again, you can play it on an emulator with an English patch.
6737006	6737206	Right.
6737466	6738807	So if you want to go to the trouble.
6738967	6742149	Or if you happen to be able to read and understand Japanese, you can play it on a PS3.
6742739	6744080	And there's the way I played it.
6744240	6748882	I sat down with a freaking script that gave me my options.
6749362	6750543	It was a pain in the ass.
6750963	6751483	But you did it.
6751543	6752183	But I did it.
6753584	6758786	We beat the freaking Rurouni Kenshin game, the RPG, with a copy of the script.
6759767	6761247	And we beat Grandia.
6761267	6764829	We played through half of Grandia with my friend Krista there because she could read everything.
6765869	6768230	I will tell you this right now.
6768731	6771132	My Japanese reading is like a literate five-year-old.
6772114	6774588	Seriously, I know maybe 30 kanji.
6774769	6775634	That's it.
6777117	6777637	Keep trying.
6777798	6779198	You might get up to a six-year-old soon.
6779218	6780119	Maybe when I move.
6781180	6781440	All right.
6781920	6782580	We're going to take a break.
6782600	6784161	We're almost two hours with no break here.
6784181	6789504	And I need to go check into the show tonight at vognetwork.com and get my VOG points so I can get more loot.
6790185	6791565	And hopefully you guys will do the same thing.
6791686	6793927	Or you might join us in the VOG Network Clubhouse.
6793987	6796048	Again, just search for VOG in the PlayStation Home.
6796328	6797929	And there's VOG Network all in caps.
6798189	6799770	I think we're going to fill this place tonight.
6799830	6801971	Blender's already like, do we need a second clubhouse?
6803413	6803873	We might.
6804754	6811142	So anyhow, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back in a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6817000	6822764	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 460 for this June the 10th of 2012.
6823184	6826226	We are live at vognetwork.com.
6826266	6830648	Be sure to check into the show, get your points, and maybe some hidden loot there.
6831829	6834831	Also, we're live in the PlayStation Network Clubhouse.
6834851	6837032	This is where most people have left, honestly.
6838613	6841535	We need to convince Sony somehow to give us more than 30 people.
6841895	6842235	Yeah.
6842695	6861682	to get in that clubhouse but I was checking out Blender put in all these little like arcade games you can play and I was playing Electro Kid which I didn't realize I mean I knew there were some mini games like I remember there was like a Arkanoid clone breakout type thing that was kind of basic and some other little things that were in there when home first launched like that Electro Kid I was just playing was kind of like a old school 8-bit platformer
6862222	6862923	I was like, wow.
6863463	6865104	I'm kind of behind the times on home.
6865124	6867126	Do they have the Namco games or something that you could do?
6867206	6873411	Well, they tied into the... All it would do is a launcher for the Namco collection game.
6873431	6873891	Oh, that's lame.
6874172	6875553	Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.
6875633	6877274	But still kind of neat.
6877394	6879856	And it looks like they are building more and more games into home.
6880196	6881477	So that's pretty cool.
6881577	6883199	So I was checking that out a little bit during the break.
6883839	6883959	Also...
6886041	6886642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6904615	6906656	Thank you for watching!
6925282	6927064	I got my start on college radio too.
6927344	6934152	I used to DJ for KCSE 95.5 in Chico, California even though that wasn't a real radio frequency.
6934472	6935754	You had to have this little thing.
6935794	6937135	It was cable radio.
6937475	6939438	You had to hook up the cable to your radio.
6940118	6940399	Yeah.
6943104	6943725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6960416	6989407	also at vognetwork.com be sure to participate in the forums we are running forums again they look very generic right now but I know that's on the plate for Bobby to expand this week Bobby has been working non-stop on the site you have to remember VOG Network has only been up in its full form for a week and for a while about a month before that he was coding the version that you saw on Friday when it launched and he's been still coding non-stop that week and I'm always like Bobby you should like take a break Bobby you should go to Disneyland like I did Bobby you should like get away from your computer he's like
6989927	6990788	We gotta do a mobile site.
6991268	6993590	We gotta do this other thing, you know, things I can't talk about.
6993610	6994811	We gotta do this other thing, this other thing.
6994831	6995531	And I'm just like, Bobby.
6996492	6998413	So he's working very, very hard behind the scenes.
6998753	7001115	I know, DarkSakura, you did some of the graphic stuffs.
7001695	7002916	So some of the pretty colors.
7003377	7004577	And there's other things coming up.
7004758	7005218	That's right.
7005758	7006419	Content-wise.
7006979	7009181	That directly involves our listeners.
7009761	7011062	But should I?
7011682	7012043	I should.
7012203	7012823	Drop a hint.
7013744	7015105	VOG10 and VOGBLOG.
7015936	7017438	E3 Rapid Fire News
7031136	7035441	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7051898	7064880	and so there is currently a beta right now which they have not accepted me very disappointed there but that will be hopefully very soon we'll get to play the full thing and I will definitely be picking it up and I may actually get into a game that's not you know
7065856	7067237	Minecraft for a little bit.
7068097	7069178	Yay.
7070038	7073520	There is a sequel announced to Dead Rising, Dead Rising Riptide.
7074061	7079724	It is coming out soon, probably this fall, I imagine.
7081125	7082005	Consoles and PC.
7082385	7088389	Doesn't really say when, but there's supposed to be an extensive reveal this summer, so probably fall.
7089429	7105801	and last but not least was a game that wasn't shown during the press conferences but Project P100, a Wii U launch title which is going to be coming to us from Platinum Games and it kind of looks like a cross between Beautiful Joe and Pikmin
7107506	7116330	and you basically play like these superheroes that get other superheroes and other citizens to kind of form together to attack monsters that are attacking Earth.
7116750	7121092	I saw somebody in chat, and I'm sorry I forget who, said that that was their game of the show.
7121473	7123053	So some people are already excited about this.
7123754	7124274	It's pretty cool.
7126345	7126926	WarioWare WarioWare
7148727	7167029	Anyhow, the description says Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action Game in Wario features a collection of games that use only the Wii U gamepad controller The games retain the original flair and character of the micro games from the WarioWare series So it sounds like it's maybe a more fleshed out version of WarioWare which could be very interesting
7167589	7173570	some games called Arrow and Ski and Shudder sound a lot like, you know, one word WarioWare games.
7173590	7175230	Yeah, unfortunately it's not WarioWare.
7175390	7179051	I mean, if it was WarioWare... It's not, but it sounds like it kind of might be.
7179111	7181412	Like it might be the spiritual successor, you know that term?
7181752	7183052	I don't want a spiritual successor.
7183072	7184632	I want an actual successor.
7184652	7187873	Screw the spiritual successor stuff.
7187893	7189313	We don't need a spiritual successor.
7189853	7192014	That's if your franchise didn't do very well.
7192054	7194254	This is WarioWare that we're talking about.
7194828	7195549	That's kind of cool.
7210690	7222364	That is kind of cool, you know, and I realize especially she's a good role model for women because she's in there doing a boy sport that has a lot of, you know, and she's, well, you're kind of giving me stank face a little bit.
7222685	7225588	No, well, I hate the term men's sport when...
7226889	7227410	I know.
7227630	7229111	It's driving a car.
7229451	7232973	I don't like it either, but let's say male dominated.
7233154	7233674	Okay, that works.
7233854	7234174	All right.
7234294	7241499	And she kind of kicks a lot of ass and has done very well for herself being a spokesperson for various sites and so forth.
7241739	7243220	And now she's going to be playable in a video game.
7243800	7244481	So that'll be pretty cool.
7246279	7249441	Clover Nikon in our chatroom says, I want Alex Kidd to be playable.
7249861	7251743	How about the return of Alex Kidd?
7251923	7253083	Where the hell has he been?
7253364	7255145	We need Alex Kidd in Shinobi World 2.
7255865	7256465	Dream on.
7256605	7260488	I remember the first game had a lot of old Sega characters.
7260668	7263149	I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.
7264310	7265671	There are some Danica haters.
7265911	7267972	Cue the Danica haters in our chat room.
7268532	7276595	Hey, you want to talk about a franchise that could, you know, or a company that could use one of those, like, oh, hey, our mascots are fighting in a battle royale type thing.
7276815	7278376	Sega would be pretty amazing.
7278556	7278956	I would.
7279757	7280717	Didn't they do something like that?
7280757	7281277	I thought they tried.
7281297	7282758	Yeah, they had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
7283898	7284559	No, I'm sorry.
7284579	7285259	That was Ubisoft.
7285419	7286359	Let me read the haters.
7286700	7287240	It's the internet.
7287260	7288140	There's always going to be haters.
7288180	7291942	DJ Morpheus says, great, another avenue that shows Danica can't drive.
7292662	7294103	Blender says, Danica sucks.
7294263	7294663	I'm ho.
7295904	7299165	So every fandom has their haters.
7299245	7299485	All right.
7301275	7303156	Thank you for watching.
7303416	7304516	See you next time.
7328266	7330568	Maybe they can get hired at EA.
7331428	7333390	That's the tiny little silver lining in this.
7333870	7334310	We'll see.
7335311	7336812	Moving on to some more rapid fire news.
7336852	7337373	DarkSakura.
7338253	7339574	Let's see what we've got.
7340435	7344077	Well, first of all, the Humble Indie Bundle 5 has three new additions to it.
7344177	7350122	If you pay above the minimum, which is right now at $8.14, you get Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Lone Survivor.
7353884	7362649	Now, I think this is pretty cool, you know, for the Minecraft fan in the room, that Marcus Pearson actually paid $9,999.99.
7362689	7363830	Cool.
7370512	7370692	Yeah.
7371453	7374215	And next up, Portal 2 in motion.
7374395	7376477	It actually is going to use the PlayStation Move.
7377698	7378238	And you know what?
7378338	7380400	I don't give a crap about that because I play it on the PC.
7382222	7383923	Well, it's basically the stuff that they had.
7383943	7389988	Remember that was, I think it was like Sixth Sense or N-Sense or some weird like...
7390508	7419791	it uses the same from the Razer Hydra yeah Razer Hydra I was just gonna keep naming random names yeah you know the motion controller sucks or well not suck but no one's buying it for the you know right so why not recycle the content here I just it pissed me off because Sony showed that in one of their little compilations of footage and we were like holy shit a new portal game holy shit yay yay yay and then it's oh it's move DLC whatever right DLC is DLC I guess I don't give a shit I guess
7420743	7422505	and well, how about Sony stuff anyway?
7422845	7423605	Tokyo Jungle.
7423926	7424486	We're getting it.
7424526	7425127	We're getting it.
7425167	7426628	We don't have to import it.
7426748	7428049	I can be a gazelle.
7428329	7432092	This is the game we lost our shit on last week and said it should be the new President Cat.
7432112	7433093	Well, that didn't take long.
7433433	7434955	They are bringing it to North America.
7435055	7435715	Yay!
7436976	7443979	Well, in fact, this actually was... I'm trying to find the guy's name.
7445059	7450601	Scott Road, who was the Sony VP of Product Development and Worldwide.
7452021	7454362	He says, it'll ship here, it'll ship everywhere.
7455443	7458484	And to him, I'm going to read this directly from the article.
7458804	7464446	To him, Tokyo Jungle's worldwide release is emblematic of Sony's crazy innovative approach.
7465966	7471788	He says the game is just wacky but in a good way because we like to show that there's still an art form and you can still experiment.
7473368	7475409	I want the hell out of this game.
7475869	7476369	Just saying.
7476469	7476709	I know.
7476729	7477629	I kind of want it too.
7477989	7478589	It's going to be awesome.
7478789	7480330	I'm lusting in my heart after it.
7481170	7481550	All right.
7482150	7483791	And lusting in your heart is lusting for real.
7485111	7489872	Well, now we're to the part of the show where we're going to get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
7491453	7492533	It's Radio Quote Room.
7493175	7495096	What the hell is a foogle you might be asking?
7495136	7497117	Well, it's Facebook and Google Plus combined.
7497277	7498977	You get a foogle.
7499337	7502078	We ask a question on Facebook and Google Plus and you guys answer it.
7502799	7504019	And we read some of the answers.
7504039	7505360	There's a lot of answers tonight.
7505420	7506120	I can't read them all.
7506140	7506580	I just can't.
7506960	7509221	We read some of the answers here live on the show.
7509261	7512162	But if you want to see all the answers, check us out on Google Plus.
7512622	7513683	The link is on our website.
7513703	7516424	This is because you can't get a short URL on Google Plus yet.
7516804	7521388	You just go to OrangeLawnTrader.com and in the upper right hand corner is a box that says Extended Play.
7521448	7523750	Just click on that Google Plus logo and you can add us there.
7524330	7528594	And yes, there are people using Google Plus because we got a couple responses over there.
7528954	7535960	Tonight we have Michael D. answering our question of the week which was What, in your opinion, was the highlight of E3 this year?
7536361	7538963	What is the thing you are looking forward to most of all?
7539723	7543086	And Michael D. says from the press conferences Oh, excuse me, he did sign it.
7543126	7543867	Techness, my bad.
7544187	7549270	Technus says, from the press conferences, I'd say what Ubisoft announced pretty much blew the big three away.
7549690	7556353	They had a great combination of going in strong with their existing IPs and finishing with Watch Dogs, a game that sounds as amazing as it looks.
7556854	7560295	I would also like to mention that the tech demos for the new next-gen engines, i.e.
7560415	7565218	Unreal Engine 4, CryEngine 3, Final Fantasy tech demo, look extremely impressive.
7565598	7567339	Overall, I was pleased with this E3.
7567599	7572582	Except for Microsoft, in which I ask, please stick to the game, save the multimedia info for CES.
7574603	7578768	Good point there about the tech demos for the next-gen stuff.
7579289	7580831	Some of that stuff was really impressive.
7580871	7583955	And finally, you know, just when you think the graphics can't get any better...
7584790	7585350	There they go.
7585811	7586351	They get better.
7587792	7595037	Lastly, going to a comment from Robaba on Google Plus says, I think the understated highlight was Smart Glass.
7595558	7598740	If they use its potential, it will pretty much derail the Wii U tablet controller.
7598980	7603023	Don't get me wrong, I want the Wii U to succeed, but it will have to be truly awesome to be successful.
7603363	7609087	I'm still waiting for the delay in release to 2013 because their marketing should be almost full swing by now to release in the fall.
7609688	7611829	Predicting that Wii U may just delay.
7612089	7613711	I don't think Nintendo can afford it.
7614031	7614411	Their stock
7614411	7615212	I just don't like too many shooters.
7628206	7631209	Let's go to Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7631229	7639496	Picaruno answered and said, probably going to get some shit from someone for this, but apart from Assassin's Creed 3, none of the games on offer wowed me.
7639897	7643660	Wonder Book is a great idea, but its implementation on the PlayStation 3 is stupid.
7644080	7645502	It would sell a lot better on iOS.
7646479	7647801	Here's what I'm going to say about Wonderbook.
7647881	7649784	It's going to bomb as bad as I have judgment.
7662060	7663882	Also, where the fuck were the Vita games, Sony?
7665364	7668447	Flaco Jones says... Again, the thing that most excited you about E3.
7668467	7669208	Redertainment says...
7680660	7682882	Quantic Dreams Beyond Two Souls stood out for me.
7682922	7683782	I loved Heavy Rain.
7683883	7685744	I bought a PlayStation Move just to play again.
7686104	7689187	When I saw Beyond Two Souls, I made a mental note to buy this game.
7689507	7693630	Then I made a note on my Droid that reads, buy Beyond Two Souls the day that it comes out.
7693870	7696272	That's two people in a row excited about Beyond Two Souls.
7696492	7701196	Metal Gear Solid game, or it's not Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising game actually is pretty awesome.
7702154	7706798	Shane from Horde House commented and said, I'd have an addition to my previous statement, which was about Mass Effect 3.
7707158	7713943	I'd say Mass Effect 3, Wii U, Beyond Two Souls, here it is again, Watch Dogs, and Last of Us were the only things I cared about at E3.
7714084	7715825	I'm super hyped for those games.
7715885	7721209	Yes, completely forgot about Last of Us, one of the big games that they showed, and that was one of their two IPs that they introduced.
7721309	7723010	But granted, we knew about that one already.
7723371	7723651	Yeah.
7724091	7725572	The Last Ofus.
7725633	7727194	I'm sad it's no longer the Last Ofus.
7728550	7737277	TigerCaw says, I think the highlights for this year's E3 was Ubisoft with their accidental nip slips up courtesy of Far Cry 3 and the unveiling of the new game Watch Dogs.
7737638	7742021	The new game from the creators of Heavy Rain called Beyond Two Souls during the Sony press conference.
7742502	7744283	As for Nintendo, Zombie Reggie.
7744784	7745224	That is all.
7748033	7751015	Did you happen to watch the video of the pre-E3 conference?
7751376	7751916	A little bit.
7751976	7757300	What the fuck is up with Miyamoto holding a banana?
7758300	7759841	A bunch of bananas for no reason.
7759861	7760842	He wanted to be a gif.
7761803	7763684	Ronnie B says, I agree with Picaruno.
7763724	7767507	Assassin's Creed 3 and the concept for Beyond were the only games that stood out for me, really.
7767567	7768928	I hate what they've done with Dead Space.
7769708	7772833	Stan says, hate on me all you want, but Pikmin 3 looks so fun.
7773213	7776478	I almost went out and bought Pikmin 1 and 2 just from watching 3's trailer.
7776718	7781565	Well, now would be a great time to rebuy 2, because didn't the new control version come out, Loki?
7781686	7782527	Is that out here in the States?
7782547	7784329	Pikmin 2, yeah, just came out today.
7784510	7785010	There you go.
7786592	7800408	Acidic Vampire says I'm stoked for South Park RPG, Tomb Raider, Beyond Two Souls, The Last of Us, Pikmin 3 and Dead Space 3 Oh and the upcoming PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 with a gimmicky controller aka the Wii U Actually I'm not enthralled by it
7801929	7804951	RedTheHaze says Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising.
7805071	7806912	Screw the haters saying that they're similar.
7807252	7811375	They should shut up about games that aren't out and that they haven't played before.
7811555	7816497	Oh, and the Ellen Page waifu simulators, which is the new emerging video game genre.
7817338	7820740	That's because Ellen Page is heavily inspired in The Last of Us, right?
7820780	7822721	In one of the characters based off her?
7823081	7823381	Sort of?
7823501	7824942	One of the characters looks like her.
7826900	7829684	Alright, let me do one more comment here.
7830124	7830885	Actually, two more.
7831246	7837474	Critical Myth said, Highlight was the Square Enix next-gen demo, but for right now, I'm most looking forward to The Last of Us.
7838315	7839998	At least we have a good idea when it's hitting the shelves.
7840058	7841440	And lastly, from DarkCharger,
7842020	7843721	Nothing particularly stood out.
7844662	7847984	E3 this year is about the whole show being greater than the sum of its parts.
7848345	7857011	Despite the lack of a single bombshell, the many games, mostly third parties, were enough to keep it not only my attention, but have me checking the calendar for several important releases.
7857391	7863475	Perhaps entering E3 with tempered expectations ensures that I, or the gamer in general, always wins.
7864356	7866657	Interesting final note, but a good one I think.
7867678	7869139	Thank you for watching!
7888510	7890272	I think a lot of pressure would be off.
7907688	7910570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7928866	7929988	and it's going to be interesting.
7930608	7937118	I'm really curious to see what happens because, you know, when the Wii first came out, there was a lot of us going, what the hell is that name?
7937679	7940062	But it worked, so we'll see.
7940183	7940864	And the Wii U.
7943423	7944304	Hey, you know what?
7945004	7948586	At the very least, we still have the Kung Pao jokes.
7948786	7956809	And any attention given back to Kung Pao is more attention and possibility for a sequel to that movie.
7956849	7958170	Shadow Next Gen brings up a good point.
7958210	7960891	The DVD format on the 360 is becoming a serious issue.
7962192	7965373	Maybe it can't afford to be DVD only much longer.
7965753	7969595	I mean, I guess there is always digital, but it's not really going to help.
7971196	7974718	I think that there's always a possibility that they'll have game installs.
7975119	7980362	They have it on the PlayStation 3, so just have it now where it comes with chips on three disks, but you only need one.
7980962	7981943	You can install the other two.
7982123	7986086	But technically, you can buy an Xbox 360 without a hard drive, so that shit shouldn't be required.
7986846	7988267	Technically, it still has four gigs.
7989027	7990909	That's not enough for some games.
7991549	7991909	I don't know.
7992149	7992450	All right.
7992730	7994131	Let's move on with some more stories.
7994151	7997032	We're going to get to the mailbag of the FU's of the week, and of course, your phone calls.
7997052	7998734	But let's try to get through these stories kind of quick here.
7998894	7999134	Loki.
7999894	8001455	Alright, so real quick.
8002155	8010298	Apparently Vivendi is looking to sell part or all of their stock in Activision.
8010318	8017200	And of course Vivendi owns 61% of the controlling stake in Activision.
8017960	8046378	and apparently they're holding a meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss the potential for the sale of part or all of its holdings and basically I think they're trying to drum up some more money and basically they're saying some people believe that Vividi is worth more if it's split up into various parts and the potential split doesn't really mean anything for Activision other than a lot of shares on the market all at once.
8048809	8061413	so yeah I don't really think it means a whole lot other than you know one company is not really going to own anything although it is kind of sad when you think about Vivendi did purchase all these other companies when they bought Activision and
8062583	8064444	It seems like a weird time to sell it off.
8085498	8085898	Get rid of it.
8086018	8092160	Maybe they're a little worried about some of this Diablo 3 fallout, and maybe they're worried about the next WoW expansion, and maybe this new Blizzard product.
8092620	8094600	I'm focusing on Blizzard, but I can't help myself.
8095020	8096941	I don't think that's... I think they just want money.
8097961	8098901	Sell off some shares.
8098921	8099481	And who doesn't?
8100081	8100561	Retire.
8100982	8111304	Well, Sega doesn't want money, clearly, because they took Hatsune Miku Project Diva F for the Vita to E3 to show it off, and then said, oh, it's not coming out in North America.
8111824	8112765	Which is very weird.
8112965	8113905	It's very weird.
8114045	8117007	Usually games don't show up at E3 that aren't coming out in North America.
8117387	8122089	But according to a Sega rep, it was a sneak peek of a game coming to Japan.
8122389	8125251	There are many Project D.Va fans out there, like DarkSakura.
8126211	8128733	So it is disappointing to hear that this will not be coming out.
8128953	8130673	However, Vita is region free, right?
8130714	8131094	That's true.
8131234	8133255	So you could always just import it.
8133275	8135516	So maybe this is all hint, hint, hint.
8135676	8136757	It's not coming to America.
8137137	8137917	Hint, wink.
8138778	8139138	Import.
8140357	8141458	Let's go to the mailbag.
8141538	8149120	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here on the show.
8149260	8150881	DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag.
8151221	8155963	Head first again at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and pick out some of our favorite emails to read right now.
8156303	8158525	Well, I'm going to read all the ones that are in there.
8158565	8159305	They're not very long.
8160206	8162007	Hey OLR, quick question for all three hosts.
8162067	8166930	Of all the games you saw presented at this year's E3, which ones are you planning to buy on day one, if any?
8167631	8172754	And honestly, I'm interested in Beyond Two Souls, and I want to play Tank, Tank, Tank.
8174055	8176356	Because I'm sorry, that game is freaking addictive as hell.
8177357	8179799	Otherwise, I'm not super interested in hardly anything, so...
8181538	8202993	I'm a little behind still I feel but I definitely want that new Tomb Raider game I'll probably end up getting the Wii U I don't know to be determined that Ubisoft game Watch Dogs looks really good too I might check that out Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U
8204758	8213349	Borderlands 2 for sure, South Park, The Sick of Truth, and... Oh yeah, I totally want that South Park game too.
8213529	8213629	And...
8217432	8219252	I don't really know, those are the only two that jumped out right now.
8219533	8221633	Grand Theft Auto V, whenever the hell that fucking comes out.
8221833	8222813	Yeah, where was that?
8223173	8223974	Eh, it's not ready yet.
8224394	8224874	Jerks.
8224894	8230155	They probably think, hey, well, Take-Two's not really at, you know, they aren't really at E3.
8230175	8231755	Their booth always has an electric fence.
8231875	8235736	And so they probably, you know, maybe it's just not ready to show off yet.
8235756	8239197	Because, I mean, if you think about it, it's probably about a year away from being released, so...
8241300	8241760	Sincerely, Osfer P.S.
8241800	8245121	All my love goes to the Krogan, but I guess I can spare some for my fellow Mass Effect gamers
8263848	8267770	You know, actually, speaking of titties, Far Cry 3 actually looks pretty awesome.
8267910	8269490	I actually may pick that up day one.
8269890	8271611	You know what game looked ridiculous?
8272271	8277493	Alan made me watch the trailer last night, that Hitman Absolution.
8277553	8278874	Okay, well, the trailer was ridiculous.
8278894	8282895	The trailer was totally ridiculous with the stripper nuns and guns.
8283315	8285676	They're trying to think, like, this is all the things that boys like.
8285896	8296797	don't forget exploding toilets well even like a lot of people in the industry are just like what the fuck was that trailer that just makes no sense the game looks pretty good anyhow
8299162	8326130	Robert M here you guys mentioned Retro City Rampage's Meat Boy minigame on last week's pre-taped hate that word taped show last month's Nintendo Power had a feature on the game for WiiWare including Explosion Man minigame as well not sure how that works license wise I get the impression that this will join Meat Boy and Spelunky as unreleased especially this late in the Wii's life cycle for what other consoles is it scheduled?
8327290	8349096	As for the voice of Geeks Network, how practical do you expect it will be for shows doing video content, under Sedation Live in particular, to have a video podcast feed?
8349737	8354118	I know when he was doing Friday Night Gaming, Bobby said such a feed would be three gigabytes an episode.
8356317	8361760	Yeah, the problem is you have to compress the video and then it's tricky.
8361960	8363421	It's tricky to do something like that.
8365042	8369684	You know, yeah, video podcasts are hard and there haven't been a lot of successful ones that are over.
8369944	8372545	I mean, most of them are like five minutes long.
8372685	8379269	That's how they deliver the video podcast because five minutes worth of HD video is like our three-hour show.
8379289	8380909	They're about the same size.
8380950	8383851	There's plenty of them that you just post them to YouTube.
8384091	8384851	Yeah, that's true.
8385992	8390534	I think Travis has been putting clips on YouTube and so forth, and I'd certainly encourage him to continue doing that.
8390574	8397737	But for now, I think him particularly is very about getting people in for the live experience.
8398317	8404080	So I don't think he's going to take a whole lot of effort to try and get the video up when he is putting the audio out there at least.
8404900	8405600	And I will say this.
8405640	8406921	Give mad props to Travis.
8407441	8426020	He's got that shit on same day turnaround now Like forever we were like Travis get season 5 up Travis get season 5 up He's worked out a system where he's on same day turnaround now So props to him I think that is important too I finally saw the disco thing Disco disco Good lord It made me glad I didn't have a webcam at the time
8428142	8429463	Oh, God, did he put that on YouTube?
8429843	8430564	I don't think so.
8430584	8432806	I don't know.
8432866	8433406	I didn't look.
8434667	8435247	I will say this.
8435708	8441132	We are looking at doing more type of like vlog content because like Travis did that studio tour that went up during the week.
8441252	8446576	And I'm going to do one that's a little more talking head, but I've got one coming up in the next week.
8448437	8449118	Should I spoil it?
8449898	8450379	Spoil!
8450880	8451561	I'll say this much.
8451581	8452182	I'll drop a hint.
8453123	8457250	I'm going to explain why I am not doing a particular podcast.
8457650	8463199	People have been asking me to do a podcast on a certain topic and I'm going to explain in depth why that's not going to happen and sorry.
8464902	8465022	Mm-hmm.
8467508	8468508	So to continue with the email.
8469149	8471409	As for the Voice of Geeks Network, how... Oh, never mind.
8471429	8472029	I already read that.
8472109	8472409	Blah.
8472830	8474890	Next email.
8475050	8475610	Hey, guys.
8475850	8476831	God, you're sexist.
8477291	8477471	Sorry.
8478691	8483312	So I just finished watching the E3 press conferences.
8483713	8492095	While I was really looking forward to what Microsoft and Nintendo had to offer and didn't really expect much from Sony, I ended up liking the fact that Sony focused on games for the most part.
8492635	8498898	I was really considering the Wii U since I thought it would be next-gen system that would get all the new games that other systems shared.
8499278	8500298	Plus Mario and Zelda.
8500398	8506741	Unfortunately, after their press conference, it seemed like they were focusing too much on the gimmicks and the multi-console games were all out of date.
8507661	8509122	So I guess I'll have to pass on that.
8509682	8513565	I did think the new Kinect features and the smart glass that Microsoft presented were cool.
8514026	8522252	However, when it comes to games, I just don't care about getting into Halo or Gears of War after all this time, and they didn't offer anything new game-wise.
8522833	8524794	Sony still won me over with their exclusives.
8525015	8528437	I loved Heavy Rain, so I will be buying Beyond right away.
8529298	8535203	The Last of Us looked like a great way to tell a different kind of story with the already proven Uncharted game engine.
8535643	8542476	And while I don't care much about God of War or PlayStation All-Source It's All-Stars, not All-Source All-Source?
8544340	8546544	It's the amazing game where you fight STDs
8548789	8549429	That is important.
8549530	8550930	Oh God, it's Herpes Man.
8551331	8551831	Power up.
8552391	8553011	Bed sores.
8553632	8555433	Herpes Man versus Mrs. Gonorrhea.
8555553	8556453	Ringworm gun.
8557894	8558655	Ringworm gym.
8558955	8560136	No, ringworm gun.
8561536	8561816	Anyway.
8563577	8564398	All stars.
8565579	8569441	It's still nice that Sony is delivering for fans of those types of games as well.
8570141	8573542	I just wish Wii U wasn't trying to ram this new controller down our throats.
8573602	8574503	More like up your ass.
8576043	8579365	Seriously, it's not just swallow it, it's take it as a suppository, too.
8580505	8588688	I had high hopes when I saw the Pro Controller that there would be an alternative, but they aren't even getting the awesome-looking Watch Dogs game.
8589168	8590429	At least not when it comes out.
8590469	8594771	That means no Mario or Zelda for me, as long as they keep pushing gimmicky controls.
8594791	8595651	And that's from FlacoJones.
8596364	8597184	Here's the other thing, too.
8597705	8607368	Once again, it gets me thinking about the Wii U. Their biggest features that they were pimping out... This system can be played when someone wants to watch TV.
8608608	8610109	I just don't understand that.
8610829	8613830	This system is supposed to be so awesome that you want to play it on your TV.
8614250	8616691	And I know a lot of people probably have multiple TVs they can play it on.
8616991	8620592	I don't understand why that's necessarily a feature that we need to be pimping out.
8620933	8621513	And, once again...
8622213	8626215	Just like the Wii was, they're pimping it as like this party environment.
8626255	8631557	That all these party games, you know, like Just Dance has this, you know, Puppet Master mode.
8631657	8632117	Hey, guess what?
8633078	8637720	I hardly ever have people over to my house to play games nowadays because I have a kid.
8638000	8643082	I can't just be getting the party going and, you know, oh, hey, we gotta be quiet because we have the kid there.
8644444	8645525	I don't have that.
8645766	8651294	The fact that New Super Mario Bros.
8651795	8659206	U or Rayman Legends has five-player co-op, I can't get two-player co-op in my household, let alone five people.
8659833	8665557	BlackWolf says, you know, if they didn't spend all that time discussing the new controller, we would have been like, wait, why did you not give us more information on the controller?
8687270	8689051	No, we wouldn't have.
8689211	8689812	Yes, they would have.
8690412	8691113	I agree with them.
8691633	8693234	Unless you're just in the same boat that I am.
8693674	8694095	Don't care.
8694615	8696636	What more information did we get about their controller?
8697837	8703721	The quote-unquote final design and the whole fact that you can use two of them now, which was a big thing people were bitching about last year.
8703741	8704402	That's not important, though.
8704422	8709345	But if you think about it, that's not important because we didn't see any games that used two of them, so who knows how that's going to be utilized.
8709445	8710486	And we already saw the final design.
8710506	8711326	It got leaked out already.
8712287	8715269	So what did we need to know about the controller that we didn't know already?
8715509	8716149	Back to the email.
8716169	8716990	Can I read the last email?
8718359	8719080	Greetings, OLR.
8719100	8720702	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8721222	8723285	I thought I'd say hi and keep up the good work.
8723585	8725968	Your show helps make my Mondays bearable at work.
8726748	8729011	I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions of E3.
8729411	8729912	One last thing.
8729992	8736299	I just bought my first smartphone and was wondering if there are any apps and or games do you think I'd be crazy not to get?
8736459	8738101	Peace and chicken grease, Serious Turtle.
8738441	8738742	Yes.
8740575	8742538	We need to know what kind of phone you have too.
8742598	8743519	We don't know what kind of phone.
8743539	8745802	There's a big difference between Android and iOS.
8746183	8747665	There's some games that are between both.
8749587	8751430	I like Cut the Rope.
8752972	8753593	And Temple Run.
8753653	8755235	I'm so addicted to Temple Run recently.
8755975	8759716	I got Bubble Bobble, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble, best move.
8760277	8761957	Played the crap out of it.
8762317	8775302	And seriously, it is, you know, that, I actually really liked Espagobluta 2, and I really, you know, as far as, you know,
8776414	8777375	I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy
8803712	8804552	Both are worth getting.
8804833	8805073	Absolutely.
8805093	8806654	Robot Unicorn Attack, Peggle.
8806734	8807854	Plants vs. Zombies.
8807874	8809295	Beat Hazard is on iOS now.
8809615	8811816	Plants vs. Zombies I don't really like so much on the iPhone.
8812256	8813797	It would need a larger thing.
8814758	8819280	R-Type actually, believe it or not, R-Type is one of the few shooters that works very well on the iPhone.
8820801	8821641	I'm just seeing what else I have.
8821741	8824743	As far as regular apps, I've got Facebook.
8825143	8826424	For Twitter I use Echo Phone.
8827004	8828525	I paid for Echo Phone and it's worth it.
8828685	8829585	If you're on iOS, Flipboard.
8829826	8830386	Flipboard.
8831764	8835449	Um, I have the Tumblr app, Goodreads, because I like to share my books.
8835529	8837552	The Steam app, AIM, Pinterest.
8837572	8839395	You know, I've got all the usual stuff.
8839555	8841117	And then... Xtube?
8841157	8841978	What's that, Jamie?
8842119	8842599	Just kidding.
8843618	8854802	I've also got a program that when I go to eat out I use called Check Please that actually splits your meal, includes or disincludes tip and lets you go up to 30% tip.
8854923	8855983	Ah, downloading that right now.
8856683	8862686	QR Reader because of all the stuff using QR codes now and actually a really neat little clock program called Nuka.
8863226	8870789	Nuka does all these interesting different digital watches and the Nuka app is actually pretty fun to play with and has neat timers and everything and
8871989	8874211	I have Secret Garden that Ikuma JP did.
8875451	8877032	I use Shazam all the time.
8877132	8879073	You're not going to go through all seven pages of your phone, are you?
8879093	8879353	No, I'm not.
8879373	8880274	I'm just picking the best ones.
8881414	8882595	I have the Kindle app.
8882695	8889998	I love Shazam because I go to Pinkberry and like the music, so I'll tag the music at Pinkberry and then I usually go and download albums.
8890399	8892940	If you're playing Mass Effect 3, get the data pad.
8893540	8894801	There's just lots of good stuff.
8895961	8900484	When you go to Disneyland, use Mouse Wait so that you know how long you have to wait for
8901164	8921321	Space Mountain but really those are just some good ones and that was the last email awesome just root your phone and download them all for free alright let's move on with the FUs of the week because some things at E3 might have made us angry or maybe stuff IRL we're going to find out right now
8937133	8943740	I'm not really upset about anything except for my nail polish deciding that it all wouldn't come off tonight and my nails are kind of brittle.
8946793	8949896	Uh, fucking to my throat for being sore.
8949916	8951778	It's not really, I don't know, it's like a weird thing.
8951798	8954960	I don't know if it's allergies or if it's cold or strep throat or what.
8955301	8960305	But for, like, the last two weeks, my throat's just been, like, I'll get sharp pains every now and then.
8960645	8965250	And you might, I feel really raspy right now because I talk a lot, you know?
8965270	8967872	Um, but, like, I'll just all of a sudden I'll be, like, talking and I'm like...
8971493	8983636	I like to keep all my body parts intact, even the unnecessary ones.
8985056	8985836	They are necessary.
8985856	8988137	They do serve a purpose until they get infected.
8990437	8992858	You know, I still have everything I was born with except for my wisdom teeth.
8994275	8994835	Lucky you.
8995255	8996316	I'm missing a gallbladder.
8996376	8997536	I'm missing wisdom teeth.
8997596	8998876	Anyway.
8998976	8999416	Moving on.
9000497	9004758	My FU of the week goes to, believe it or not, this is going to shock you, Disneyland.
9005378	9005638	Yep.
9005878	9007958	Disneyland on Wednesday was a fucking hot mess.
9008219	9008939	Oh, my gosh.
9009499	9015580	I guess all those people were there for the Cars Land preview, the cast members, and that must have been all the veteran cast members because the noobs were running the place.
9016281	9019941	And, yeah, just so crowded, especially for a Wednesday.
9020021	9021342	And I get that it's summer.
9022182	9027465	But I've gone E3 week the last like three years and I've never had an experience as terrible as last week.
9027505	9029425	Like every other year has been relatively good.
9029505	9030026	Okay, Rob.
9030146	9031126	I don't know because I didn't get to go.
9031466	9033787	How bad did the Mad Tea Party blow?
9034048	9037269	I didn't, it wasn't running weeknights, but I did see the decorations.
9037469	9038710	The decorations look great.
9038750	9040891	They spent a lot of money on them, which kind of pissed me off.
9041031	9042431	My friends were there this past weekend.
9043012	9045413	They said it was the worst thing to ever happen.
9046133	9046613	That's too bad.
9046873	9047053	Yeah.
9047813	9049554	It was basically, what did he call it?
9049594	9050894	The mad suck party or something?
9050994	9051835	The mad flop party.
9052095	9052995	That was a mad flop party.
9053015	9054215	I like to call it the mad flop party.
9055195	9065318	But yeah, the one thing that bugged me most of all is that Disney don't give celebrities the royal treatment and shut down the entire fucking ride just because one celebrity wants to ride it.
9065658	9074483	They need to... I'm not saying... Look, I get if you want to have the little ushers, bring them up the exit and give them a little bit of special treatment, but you don't stop the entire fucking ride because the celebrity's on it.
9074563	9076384	I don't care if it's Barack Obama.
9077164	9078025	I don't care who it is.
9078065	9078745	That is kind of lame.
9079086	9080786	You don't stop for everybody else.
9081347	9083148	Who was the celebrity?
9083308	9085069	David Beckham and his wife, Posh Spice.
9085669	9086430	Lame.
9087470	9090473	Yeah, they could do it at least for like a real celebrity like Neil Patrick Harris.
9092915	9094377	Anyhow, that just kind of ticked me off.
9094757	9103745	So, meanwhile, let's get back into... I know, I know, I just did not have a good experience on Wednesday and that ticked me off because it was like Extifer and Matt's first experience at Disneyland.
9104106	9106728	And they enjoyed themselves because we had a really good time on Monday.
9106748	9107989	It wasn't nearly as bad.
9108430	9111012	We got to fit in a lot of the good stuff, but Wednesday was a mess.
9113614	9115135	I could go on and on, but I won't.
9115775	9118316	So meanwhile, Loki, let's get back into the gaming news.
9119116	9122938	Twitter topics, a few, and then Skype line most of all in a little bit.
9123138	9131541	So one of the rumors that we were supposed to get out of E3 was that one of these streaming companies is supposed to be partner of a console, but we didn't see that.
9131681	9135083	No on live or no Gaikai teaming up with consoles, but...
9136083	9147247	OnLive did say that they are going to be teaming up with smart TV manufacturers including LG smart TVs with Google TV and internet browsers as well.
9148227	9163713	They're going to be allowing the online servers to be used in browser which is kind of neat and of course if you have one of those smart TVs you can download an app that will allow you to stream stuff and then you just have to buy the controller as well.
9166038	9166598	That's kind of neat.
9167019	9169160	I mean, I don't know.
9169180	9174602	I haven't seen smart TVs, you know, take off yet, but I mean, I'm sure in the future we're going to see that.
9174743	9179545	I mean, everything's fucking connected to the internet now, so pretty cool.
9179785	9182186	And of course, one of the games they're showing on there is Borderlands and it looks sexy.
9183487	9189271	Nintendo is working on the system to figure out how Wii owners are going to transfer their content to the Wii U
9207043	9222923	designer Katsuya Iguchi said we are readying the system yes to transfer saves and everything you've bought so the good news is if you bought virtual console stuff and WiiWare stuff they're going to transfer over to the Wii U and it doesn't sound like they're going to charge you more for it or try to sell it to you again
9225026	9225727	Yay!
9225987	9226568	Oh, that's good.
9226868	9227749	That is very good.
9228009	9229451	Have a cookie, Nintendo.
9229631	9233875	I wonder if it's being done with the friend code, because that would be tied to the console.
9234075	9234496	Who knows?
9234676	9234976	Who knows?
9235397	9240762	Now, while there's good news, we have to, of course, follow that up with a little bit of WTF news.
9241463	9245027	That whole Miiverse thing, it came out after the show that...
9245507	9248768	Miiverse, which will allow you to kind of like post messages.
9248788	9251609	It's kind of like the Nintendo Social Network, I guess, for lack of a better term.
9252409	9256010	Satoru Iwata said there will be filtering on the Miiverse content.
9256310	9258811	The first will be automatic content filtering.
9258871	9265573	So if you post something that's like, fuck you and your fucking dog, it's going to hit that filter because it says the F word and won't post.
9265973	9271515	However, the second, there will be a moderator reading all posts before they're published.
9273888	9285335	That seems crazy, but yes, live people will be screening all the messages and they say it may take about 30 minutes between the time you post something and the time it's actually visible because of that delay.
9285716	9289878	Lastly, users can also flag if something is missed, which we know will happen at some point.
9290999	9293803	That is extreme.
9294103	9298449	I get that it's kind of like a forum so you can post stuff.
9298589	9300311	There should be moderators for that stuff.
9300351	9300872	That's fine.
9302214	9307881	I have a problem with them going all 1984 and just let's monitor every single thing.
9308214	9314377	And also, being an adult owning a console, I don't give a fuck if the word fuck is in, you know, something.
9314677	9317899	If they're like, fuck this boss, I hate it, I fucking died nine times.
9318399	9319360	That's acceptable to me.
9319520	9323662	I'm not a fucking little child, I don't need to be, oh, let's start.
9323682	9324422	But that's you.
9324462	9325583	Little children will be using it.
9325763	9327244	I understand that, but you know what?
9327464	9332968	They have wonderful parental technology that you can block this stuff.
9333368	9336630	So you can put content filtering for those age groups if you want.
9336650	9338411	They'll figure out how to override by themselves.
9338671	9341593	Well, then you've got to be smart in your fucking kids.
9341693	9343835	Well, maybe this system will get overridden too.
9344455	9347998	I want to be able to go post in Loki's Miiverse, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
9348378	9351420	That's what Xbox is for, Rob.
9353317	9355419	No, that's for saying far worse words.
9355679	9357720	Okay, Frisbee, everyone learn Leet.
9357781	9360322	By the way, probably moderators will know Leet.
9360363	9361904	Let's go on a little tangent here.
9362244	9363125	What about FIFA?
9363625	9365066	FIFA and the whole Kinect thing?
9365146	9367348	If you fucking swear, you get flagged.
9368249	9369510	That shit is funny.
9369930	9371131	I'm sorry, that is funny.
9372903	9374104	No, that's funny.
9374365	9378708	Like, to me, the whole fact that the Kinect will pick it up if you're saying like, fuck you, flag.
9379149	9379849	That's funny.
9380250	9381811	If you don't like it, unplug the Kinect.
9381971	9386535	But if they have that technology, why don't we apply it to the goddamn Xbox Live service?
9386555	9388397	Because that's a little too big brother.
9388857	9397341	And if I want to say, like, if we're playing Mass Effect Online and I want to be like this fucking Banshee bitch, Kinesma D, you know, then I should be able to say that.
9397361	9398482	Well, I should be able to swear on my TV.
9398642	9399902	But then again, here's the thing.
9399942	9405945	If I were to ever play FIFA, which is not going to happen, I'm not going to fucking use Kinect.
9406725	9407506	Fuck that shit.
9409887	9411328	All right, that's my Wii U news.
9413209	9413929	Esperanto?
9416548	9416948	You know what?
9417048	9418889	Actually, that's a great idea.
9419049	9419490	You know what?
9419830	9425813	The average person actually can look at a page written in Esperanto and figure out what it says because that's the purpose of the language.
9426513	9435017	Anyone who knows any little bit of Latin, which just about every English speaker does know a little bit of Latin and Greek is part of the basis of our language and the romance languages.
9435978	9437818	No Esperanto.
9438119	9440360	I've read a page in Esperanto and I've never learned it.
9440520	9441360	How do I say fuck you?
9441380	9442761	You fucking fucking Esperanto.
9443987	9444590	I don't know.
9445574	9446457	I'm going to look it up, actually.
9447341	9448526	Well, read a story first.
9449537	9451318	Oh yeah, that.
9452638	9453798	EA's being bitches.
9454859	9456239	That's my official title of this.
9456639	9465742	They're not going to copy Steam's 75% off sales because they think it cheapens the IP and they don't want to copy that practice.
9466762	9470463	There's a quote from David DeMartini, the origin boss.
9471524	9474725	Obviously, they think it's the right thing to do after a certain amount of time.
9474905	9477966	I just think it cheapens your intellectual property.
9480307	9482768	Honestly, Steam is successful.
9483468	9484428	It clearly works.
9484928	9488150	And people are still forking out the money to buy the games.
9488850	9493432	So what about it is cheapening the IP if it's bringing it to a wider audience?
9493612	9496413	And it's not like Steam's just going, okay, we're going to charge less for your game.
9496453	9501995	They're coordinating with these different developers and publishers and saying, okay, hey, we want to mark it down to...
9502595	9524101	drive up some you know business and you drive up some sales for you guys as well as maybe bring a little bit of you know exposure to your product and then EA saying ah fuck it we don't care you know well you know what no one has to purchase stuff through Origin just saying you know there are other services out there so if you don't want to put your stuff on sale then fine someone else will
9524605	9529029	Well, and here's another thing that he's saying is what Steam does might be teaching the customer.
9529109	9536314	I might not want it in the first month, but if I look at it in four or five months, I'll get one of those weekend sales and I'll buy it at that time at 75% off.
9536635	9542199	What he's not realizing is that people who are into the game will buy it when it comes out.
9542299	9544921	They don't care about waiting for a sale.
9544981	9546443	They'll get it when it comes out.
9547083	9556226	You know, when Portal 2 came out, now true, I didn't buy it for myself because I knew I was getting it for Christmas slash Hanukkah slash Kwanzaa slash Festivus, whatever.
9556666	9557087	Which I did.
9558227	9560808	But I was all hot and bothered to buy it when it came out.
9561308	9565309	You know, so I've bought, like I bought Fractal when it came out.
9565670	9567590	You know, I've bought tons of games when they've come out.
9568130	9572012	Even though I knew, like for example, okay, here's a good example of
9573633	9574514	Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
9575816	9577357	No, not Marvel vs. Capcom.
9577678	9579500	Yeah, I bought it right when it came out.
9579520	9580781	Well, Dan bought it right when it came out.
9581202	9585286	As soon as Ultimate Marvel, and we knew Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 would be out, and guess what?
9585326	9586167	We bought that too.
9587709	9589371	If someone wants it, they don't care.
9589491	9590252	They're going to go get it.
9590731	9596453	The sheer amount of games I've purchased on Steam, well, mostly through the Humble Indie Bundles, but I have not played most of them.
9597333	9603935	And I have a lot of people, you know, my co-workers and stuff that buy stuff on Steam that say, yeah, I'll see this game for like five bucks.
9603975	9607616	I'm like, fuck, I'm going to pick that up because I may play it eventually.
9607956	9614578	So there's a lot of really quick, just spontaneous purchases because of these sales.
9614678	9615799	And I think it's, you know...
9616679	9623704	Sure, keep your game at $20 and someone may pick it up or drop it to $5 and you make a ton of money.
9623724	9624745	It's the check stand purchase.
9625085	9628267	You know when you're in line at the grocery store and go, oh man, I love Twix!
9629027	9629768	Two for a buck!
9629828	9632850	And it's usually a lot of these independent games that most people aren't aware of.
9633971	9635812	Yeah, sure, I'll try it.
9636012	9637673	If it's a buck, if it sucks, whatever.
9637733	9639995	I've paid five bucks for a game.
9640535	9642897	I've played The Binding of Isaac for like five minutes.
9644137	9645859	Oh, which was another game I played this week.
9645919	9646119	Oops.
9646919	9658048	Um, but you know, it's good, it's something I can go back, you know, if I'm feeling kinda, eh, I'm bored, I don't have anything to do, then I can go in and play Cave Story, which I, you know, bought on the Hundle Indie Bundle before too.
9659149	9668317	So, it's, he's not, he's using business, the business mentality and not real world common sense.
9668357	9668517	Well,
9669317	9670218	The end of story.
9670458	9674399	Origin is not as big of a deal as Steam is at the end of the day.
9674659	9676160	What brought people into Steam?
9676580	9677240	Those sales.
9678221	9678581	Duh!
9678821	9681122	Well, and here's another thing that he says.
9681622	9687144	We don't believe in the drop it down, spring it up 75% off approach, which is not necessarily what Steam is doing.
9687944	9691126	But we've got something else that we do believe in that we'll be rolling out.
9692206	9693287	I don't know what that is.
9693347	9697450	And honestly, I don't care because I'm only going to ever play one game on Origin if I have to.
9697550	9698691	Buy 10, get one free.
9698991	9703994	And they're stupid anyways because they're like, oh, we don't believe in marking stuff down and bringing it back up in price.
9704014	9705375	You clearly don't believe in making money.
9705575	9718103	Well, apparently you have no idea what your, you know, iOS team is doing because there's a lot of EA games that go down the 99 cents when those properties are like $7 or whatever.
9718144	9718764	Well said.
9719264	9721366	So it's like, I mean, hey, you,
9722266	9723667	Alright, two more stories and then the Skype line, Loki.
9741815	9742095	XBOX GOLD
9765154	9767455	Apparently you can enter different tournaments.
9767535	9770296	Some are free, some are with a paid entry.
9770896	9774958	And you can compete in a variety of different games through their service.
9774978	9778319	I think they actually do this right now through their website, Virgin Gaming.
9778339	9783901	But I guess right now they're going to be partnering with EA Sports, 2K Sports, and Ubisoft.
9785121	9789643	And they're going to have different matchmaking stuff and also...
9792245	9794454	I don't know, some different services.
9798250	9801831	Pay to Have Game is their tagline for Virgin Gaming.
9802891	9804211	It'll be interesting to see what it is.
9805111	9812873	I'm curious on how that's really going to work and how we can leverage it to have tournaments for OLR and VOG Network and so forth.
9813053	9824215	Too bad they didn't do this shit back in the day when Grand Theft Auto wasn't modded the fucking hell because I kicked a lot of ass in vanilla Grand Theft Auto and episodes from Liberty City.
9824235	9825415	Well, there's always Grand Theft Auto 5.
9826235	9828178	There is, and I will fucking own that shit again.
9828218	9828698	Get ready.
9829359	9830000	I am ready.
9830601	9831502	Your body is ready.
9831622	9838512	I need to play Max Payne 3 because that's supposed to be pretty awesome, but Grand Theft Auto 5, I will dedicate my life to that game.
9838922	9840743	All right, let's move on to one last story here.
9840863	9844946	I want to end on a good note with the stories tonight, and this is a great note.
9844986	9858896	We talked a little bit last week about Curt Schilling's studio and all the closures and all that, but Big Huge Games, one of the studios that was closed in that whole 38 studios debacle from a couple weeks ago, has basically been...
9859716	9861698	Gobbled up by Epic Games.
9861959	9866584	And this is good news because Epic Games is going to open a brand new studio called Epic Baltimore.
9866984	9869567	And it's made up of the folks from Big Huge Games.
9870148	9874032	I think that's quite awesome that basically they've helped them find jobs.
9874073	9878357	Of course, not everybody's going to go because some people might decide to do something else.
9878458	9880400	But most of them sounds like are going over to this.
9880820	9884623	The official quote on this from Epic Games President Michael Capps, quote,
9907498	9908499	So there they go.
9908659	9910260	They are going to be working on a big IP.
9910701	9911802	Who knows what it is?
9912082	9919828	It won't be Reckoning 2, though, unless Epic ends up buying that IP, because I believe the state of Maryland owns that now.
9920409	9921549	Or Rhode Island, excuse me, Rhode Island.
9921589	9924752	Also, their thing was, we make IP, we don't buy IP.
9925252	9926633	So they're not going to buy the IP.
9927794	9932078	Blackwolf ventures a guess that Epic Baltimore could be making Infinity Blade for consoles.
9932970	9938034	That is a pretty big Epic IP that wouldn't surprise me.
9938314	9947081	You know what would fit right with Epic in that it's something that kind of got canceled a long time ago even though it looked really awesome?
9947441	9949903	Project Offset would have been fucking amazing.
9950143	9956985	It was that first person fantasy RPG game that was like a first person shooter almost, but with giant dragons and shit.
9957025	9957966	It looked really amazing.
9958506	9962267	That would be cool, like a project offset game, but developed by Epic.
9962307	9966569	Like an RPG fantasy game, but like Gears of War, I guess.
9966969	9968250	Let's open up the Skype line.
9968310	9972913	It is open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9972973	9975575	Certainly you have something to say about the news tonight.
9975635	9979938	So give us a call and we will talk E3 or whatever it is that's on your mind tonight.
9980298	9984581	In the meantime, quickly, let's try to fit in a couple last minute stories here, Loki.
9985815	9989416	Um, so yes, let's, uh, I don't have anything pulled up again.
9989496	9989896	Oh, you don't?
9989916	9990316	That's all right.
9990616	9991256	I can go to Twitter.
9991457	9992037	Let's go to Twitter.
9992317	9993477	All right, let me go to Twitter real quick.
9993517	9994197	Let me bring it up.
9995738	9997178	Because I wasn't prepared for that either.
9997758	9998238	That's okay.
9998298	10001479	All right, we do have some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
10002099	10003280	Oh, and how convenient.
10003340	10004320	Skypline's already going off.
10005720	10007221	Now you have some time to pull up the other stuff.
10007521	10008581	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
10008601	10009001	Who's this?
10009661	10010301	It's Shane.
10010421	10011782	Hey, Shane.
10011822	10012362	How you doing?
10012870	10015491	I can't wait to talk to you when you're on drugs.
10038776	10042340	I know, that will be why you should tune in to Horde House on Tuesday.
10042420	10045764	Which, by the way, gets... Well, they don't hear it on Tuesday.
10045804	10046745	They hear it on Wednesday.
10046765	10047646	I meant Wednesday.
10047787	10048107	Live.
10048708	10049128	Not live.
10049609	10049929	Damn it.
10050229	10050830	Premiered.
10051150	10051851	It's new for us.
10051931	10053873	Should I just hang up and we could start this over?
10054614	10060240	premiered at VOGnetwork.com on Warcraft Wednesdays and then on the podcast feed Wednesday night.
10060320	10062462	All right, anyhow, they don't need to know it's taped Tuesdays.
10062843	10063824	All right, so Shane.
10063964	10064765	What are you talking about?
10064785	10065926	It's not taped on Tuesdays.
10065946	10066466	That's right.
10066526	10068629	It's taped really quickly live.
10068649	10068909	All right.
10068989	10072132	Shane's been playing guru for me in private messages.
10072613	10073674	Oh, for Mass Effect?
10073934	10076677	So that I actually will not go to Noveria first.
10078931	10079551	It's what I do.
10080212	10083513	To what did you want to call on the show about tonight, Shane?
10083593	10084294	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
10084614	10085054	No, wait.
10085134	10086435	I don't want to hear what you have to say.
10086815	10088015	I want to talk about your corgi.
10088756	10089696	I want to talk about your corgi.
10090657	10093218	Yes, my corgi that I will have this weekend.
10094098	10095319	So he's not your corgi yet.
10096099	10096920	He's my corgi.
10097740	10099261	You put a deposit down on the corgi.
10099601	10099841	Yes.
10100682	10102643	That specific one that I showed you a picture of.
10102923	10106244	The corgi can't exactly help you recover from surgery.
10106284	10107485	In fact, that might make things worse.
10109211	10110492	Probably, but I don't care.
10110993	10113214	I'm going to share with everyone what I shared with Shane earlier.
10113374	10113554	What?
10113714	10114695	You know what Corgi means?
10115135	10116356	Sheepdog in Welsh.
10116797	10117597	So you're getting a sheep.
10117957	10119298	Wait a minute, but you're afraid of sheep.
10119699	10121500	Then it will run it away, clearly.
10121540	10122841	That's what sheepdogs are for.
10122861	10123922	They herd sheep.
10124522	10125343	Away from me.
10125563	10125863	Yes.
10126343	10127124	Alright, fair enough.
10127544	10129506	Alright, okay, now I'll hear what you have to say.
10129546	10131327	What did you really want to call in about tonight?
10131787	10136571	I just wanted to gloat because clearly I won that list list from a couple weeks ago.
10138161	10139041	What makes you say that?
10139141	10142103	The segment on the show where we come up with a definitive list, yes.
10142623	10151446	Yeah, and we had to say what we wanted on Wii U. And of everything we all said, me talking about Mass Effect was the only thing that came true.
10153171	10155512	Well, congratulations, Shane.
10155572	10158414	You get a no prize.
10158434	10160275	Yeah, you get a new version of Mass Effect on the Wii.
10160295	10160415	I know.
10160435	10161655	Shane can have a Raspberry.
10164317	10168439	I can someday give you a free piece of loot on vognetwork.com.
10168539	10169259	How's that sound?
10169679	10171440	No, I want something worth something.
10172441	10173001	Hey, now.
10173421	10173901	Hey, now.
10174002	10176763	Don't devalue the loot at vognetwork.com.
10177043	10180964	I can't sell it or make money off of it.
10181164	10185325	You can soon post it on your profile like you're supposed to be able to do at home.
10185345	10187225	Do I have a profile?
10187385	10192246	Yeah, you can have one night alone with Caden.
10192346	10192846	How about that?
10195387	10195907	I don't know.
10197587	10198528	You're like, just one?
10204014	10214305	What if they decide in Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U, they're just going to not have Kaden in it because they're just going to say, you know what, we're going to just go with this storyline from the first game.
10214805	10218990	What if, because it's on a Nintendo console, they cut out all the sex scenes?
10219450	10219630	Oh.
10219650	10219690	Oh.
10221792	10223394	Oh, I don't know if I could get it then.
10224699	10227201	I'm still waiting for the Garrus nookie, so.
10227321	10229003	You have to wait till, well, I shouldn't spoil.
10229023	10229363	I know.
10229383	10230504	It's in the second one.
10230604	10231005	I know.
10231105	10231485	All right.
10231926	10235309	So in the first one, I've decided that I am going to bang the hell out of Kayden.
10236530	10237771	Just out of support for Shane.
10237791	10238051	Good.
10238331	10238892	Thank you.
10240794	10242215	That's the right way to play the game.
10242235	10243496	Because Ashley's a bitch.
10244577	10244897	Yes.
10245918	10246479	I've taught you well.
10246499	10247219	I don't like her.
10248961	10251043	I like Tali, but she's kind of dumb.
10253294	10279743	the other thing I was calling in about because I care so other people should care the new DJ Max game on Vita while it doesn't have a release date I guess PentaVision confirmed that there will be a collector's edition in America and they announced three of the licenses already which are just songs from the previous games but it's still something important because we actually get a real honest to goodness K-pop license
10280379	10280983	Oh, that's cool.
10281043	10283377	So what bands are we expecting to see under the...
10286709	10307398	Right now we've only got a K-pop group called Kara with their song Step from Technica and then a guy named Mr. Funky who does a lot of music for the later DJ Maxx games with Rockstar and Signalize by Paul Bazooka who again does a lot of music for the later games.
10307738	10311280	But what's interesting is that I don't know where Step is from.
10311300	10313221	I know it's from a Technica game but
10313701	10318744	Rockstar and Signalize are both from the latest Technica game that came out, Technica 3.
10319524	10325287	So we might see more transplants from current music instead of stuff from way back when.
10326668	10327468	That makes me happy.
10328949	10331370	That sounds like it would be worthy, I believe.
10332438	10336641	Yes, I just need to know how many hundreds of dollars I'm going to spend on this collector's edition.
10337061	10338762	Because that will happen.
10339042	10342064	It'll probably only be like $10 or $20 more than retail.
10343185	10344386	Yeah, probably.
10344846	10346567	And it won't come with anything that's worth anything.
10346788	10348108	Like, they haven't in a while.
10348188	10351791	I used to get awesome puzzles and face masks.
10352091	10356574	And in the last one, I got a CD and a crappy book.
10357455	10357675	So...
10358100	10358960	Might not actually be worth it.
10358980	10360121	I'll just download the game instead.
10361261	10361941	All right, Shane.
10361961	10363422	We got to let you go so we can get more calls.
10364322	10364722	Whatever.
10364823	10365223	That's fine.
10365463	10365803	All right.
10365943	10367003	Talk to you later in the week.
10367664	10367884	Okay.
10368024	10368764	Good luck with surgery.
10369224	10369644	Thank you.
10369784	10371845	Bye.
10371865	10375366	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10375847	10376447	Sorry about that, guys.
10376467	10378648	We just had Bugmageddon here in the studio.
10380269	10381691	I don't know why, like tons of bugs.
10381711	10382793	They just love the light.
10383594	10387459	And Alan's trying to do laundry outside and had to run in and all the bugs followed him.
10387579	10388100	It's gross.
10389041	10390403	Raid everywhere.
10391817	10393098	1-877-KAMOLR 1-877-KAMOLR 1-877-KAMOLR
10414025	10416106	They got Gabe Newell in there.
10416406	10420927	Apparently, he is quite handy with blacksmithing.
10421848	10427370	And so, of course, he was in there to poke fun at the fact that Half-Life 3 is not out and he was... Jerk.
10427430	10429030	He was forging a new crowbar.
10429330	10429590	All right.
10429931	10430631	Let me go to the phones.
10430651	10431711	We got another call on the line.
10431771	10432832	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10432872	10433272	Who's this?
10434072	10436093	Chugga-chugga-choo-choo, motherfuckers.
10436133	10436993	It's Drew Salley.
10437273	10437893	Hey.
10438173	10440094	Hey, and you can say that word on this show.
10440174	10440574	I'm sorry.
10440594	10441595	You got that right, man.
10441635	10442695	I'm so sick of being...
10443799	10445100	held back on Bobby's show.
10446180	10448801	Hey, he's just taking the Nintendo approach.
10448861	10449361	It's all right.
10449901	10450241	Oh, fuck.
10450261	10450682	I love this.
10450862	10456143	You guys, I love this new Nintendo approach with the moderating everyone's shit.
10456243	10462186	Listen, I know most people are complaining about this bullshit that they're going to monitor everything before you post it up or whatever.
10462526	10464506	I'm thinking cha-ching, cha-ching, motherfuckers.
10464866	10465987	I just sent my resume off.
10466047	10469108	I could probably weed through that shit at home all day.
10469768	10478193	Maybe there will actually be some type of Nintendo reality show where people audition to be one of the moderators and they'll call it The Moderator.
10479134	10480435	Oh, that's a genius idea.
10480595	10481996	And it'll be on the Nintendo Network.
10482936	10486178	Sounds like something a Japanese company would do for sure.
10486358	10487179	And you could compete.
10488379	10489200	Fucking right I can.
10489260	10491341	I mean, friggin' right I can.
10491721	10495484	Alright, so what are your thoughts on E3 this week, Jim Salley?
10496411	10498132	It was all next to nothing.
10498773	10505237	Every time I watch E3, I don't want to say I'm depressed afterwards, but I feel like I was let down the last couple of years.
10505998	10508299	You wouldn't say you're depressed because you look for the cyanide?
10510100	10512002	No, I didn't make the Kool-Aid.
10512042	10513623	I did make Kool-Aid with Vodka in it.
10513903	10517005	Because I thought we were going to get some crazy shit to see, but nope.
10517645	10518506	We didn't get nothing.
10519631	10521272	That Wii U is pretty weird, though.
10521592	10522313	It's strange.
10522513	10524934	What about the stuff that everybody's going crazy about?
10524974	10527856	What about the Watch Dogs and the Beyond Two Swords?
10528957	10531018	Ah, that's all garbage to Jim Sally.
10531058	10535360	Listen, if it's not Halo 4, it's everything else.
10535600	10536661	That's all I'm going to say.
10537001	10537822	So you're a Halo 4 fan?
10539260	10540321	Who isn't a Halo game?
10540521	10541641	Who doesn't love Halo?
10541881	10551386	Well, I have fallen out of love with Halo a bit since all the stuff after 3, but I will say Halo 4 looks pretty darn interesting.
10551646	10553387	What do you think about the different look?
10553427	10554687	It has kind of a different look to it.
10554727	10555308	What do you think of it?
10556988	10559189	I think it's about time we change it up a little bit anyway.
10559209	10562871	I was getting kind of drab before, almost redundant before.
10563671	10565332	So why not change it up a little bit?
10565372	10566713	I'm really concerned, though, with the...
10568317	10570918	I wonder how well they'll do, because Bungie kind of babied us.
10571678	10572898	They did it right for a long time.
10573138	10574958	So do you think the change in studio was a good thing?
10577299	10580079	Yeah, because to be honest with you, I don't think Bungie could keep it up.
10580439	10586861	They said it themselves that they were getting kind of sick of, I don't want to say sick, but they were getting kind of bored with doing Halo, right?
10586901	10594382	And if they're not going to have that same drive to build the great Halos like they did in the past, then it is time to pass the torch on to someone new.
10596096	10597237	I can agree with that.
10597798	10601502	It actually has to do with anything that one is working on.
10601582	10604025	If you don't have the enthusiasm, it's going to show in the end product.
10605386	10606087	Exactly, right?
10606107	10610532	Which is why we see a lot of Obsidian games when they know they're only getting the sequel, right?
10610552	10614416	They just pump it out as quick as they can because they just need to get their money and they want to be done with it.
10614837	10615217	They don't care.
10615257	10615938	They want to move on.
10616779	10616979	Yeah.
10617802	10618202	It's sad.
10618242	10619682	It was an error though, man.
10620783	10624443	So what else does the Jim Sally train want to share with us tonight here on OLR?
10624523	10626284	Is Loki there or is he eating pizza right now?
10626364	10626764	I'm right here.
10627704	10629844	Listen, I'm really ashamed of myself.
10630505	10631485	I'm going to admit this to you.
10632205	10642007	But I've been at the very last mission of Grand Theft Auto 4 for about a year and I can't fly a fucking helicopter to save my life.
10642907	10643367	That's alright.
10643387	10644667	Their controls are kind of terrible.
10645168	10647048	Is there like a cheat though or something I can do?
10647148	10647388	Like
10648777	10651178	To control the helicopter better?
10651198	10654980	I don't know, like a helicopter doesn't die mode or something?
10655760	10661462	Well, you can put in your god mode code and just bring up your phone.
10662183	10665184	And then when you have the phone up, you can just keep hitting the health.
10665684	10666264	It's the...
10667805	10677010	GTA 555-0100 is the number and then basically you just keep hitting that and you'll keep replenishing the health on the helicopter.
10677951	10684354	Really though, it's difficult to keep shooting down the bad guy in the game.
10684474	10690818	So really my best bet is to go get a kid from the elementary school to come over and just do it for me.
10691863	10694046	But I have to type that in as I'm falling to my death?
10704881	10726869	No, no, you just type it into your phone beforehand so you have that cheat up and then you bring it up on your cheats menu in the phone and then you can just keep hitting A over and over or X or whatever and just, you know, each time you hit it it'll recover the health in your helicopter or you can just wait until your helicopter starts smoking or whatever and just hit that and it'll replenish the health on the helicopter.
10729530	10730770	You're my best friend.
10731437	10731978	Loki.
10733639	10734219	There you go.
10734380	10735140	Friends are made.
10735180	10737862	And now you have something to do right after the show.
10738143	10739904	Right after the show, baby.
10739944	10741566	GTA 5, 5, 5.
10742066	10742386	All right.
10742707	10744768	Jim, Sally, I got to let you go so we can get into some more calls.
10744788	10746129	But thanks so much for stopping in tonight.
10746149	10747230	Okay, man.
10747310	10749312	I just want to dedicate this call to my buddy Birdman.
10749813	10758480	Listen, Bird, if you've been drinking too much and I got to call your brother to come over and take you home at the party, then maybe you've had too many beers, Birdie, or not enough.
10759477	10778932	And don't drink and drive, ever Don't drink and drive, that's why I called your brother You drunk fuckbird Jesus Christ, man Don't drive your car to my house and drink a six pack of beers Get the fuck out of here, bird, go with your brother I love you, Sky Alright, love you too, take care Thanks, Loki No problem Oh, I see how it is
10779651	10784018	I was going to say bye, Darky, but I guess not now.
10784338	10785220	Bye, sweet Darky.
10785260	10785780	Heart face.
10786121	10786642	Little bum.
10786942	10788865	I made the little bum thing for you with a three.
10789947	10791108	With a number three.
10791589	10792651	I'm hanging up now.
10792771	10793813	Bye, Jim Sally.
10794233	10795255	Everybody look at my bum.
10799431	10802354	That was a great note to end on.
10802374	10807058	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10807118	10809381	If you think you can follow that call, good luck to you.
10811334	10814816	Meanwhile, I'm going to try to do Twitter topics here.
10814916	10817057	Every time I've done it, though, I've been derailed, though.
10817458	10819159	But we'll go to a couple tweets here.
10819979	10827924	Tigerclaw305 sent us a tweet about Nexon pays $685 million for 14.7% of NCSoft.
10828484	10830665	NCSoft, they've made games like Guild Wars.
10830725	10831886	I know it's one of their big titles.
10832106	10834588	ION, they've done a couple other MMOs as well.
10835248	10838130	They are now the largest shareholder in NCSoft.
10838530	10839490	So there you go.
10840691	10841131	Very cool.
10841151	10845772	That's part of a two-year agreement between these two South Korean gaming companies.
10846772	10851314	So we'll see what is born of that partnership later on.
10851734	10857255	TigerClaw sent us another tweet about Kojima seeing social and core games converging together.
10858356	10861557	And this is kind of some of what she saw in some of the Nintendo's presentation.
10861597	10863077	That's what Kojima said.
10863437	10865958	In an interview with CVG, he said, quote,
10866878	10896345	I don't think social and core games are separate both will evolve together and at some point I feel the social side of things will converge with the core gamers I think in the future maybe Metal Gear will change in certain ways to integrate social aspects if you look at other games on the market now you can see it's already happening so Metal Gear may at some point get involved how do you guys feel about that do you think he's on to something there or do you think maybe too far casual Metal Gear game
10898028	10899029	Yeah, I don't know about that.
10899089	10900890	That's very interesting.
10903092	10908876	I mean, I thought what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network did was already kind of social.
10908937	10911398	And not that it's always showing the best parts of society.
10911919	10914961	But, you know, I kind of thought that was the social gaming.
10915281	10918504	Because what used to be social gaming, arcades.
10918944	10921826	And look what Xbox Live and PlayStation Network has done to arcades.
10922046	10922227	I don't...
10922927	10923347	I don't know.
10923447	10927570	I don't think... I mean, when I hear this, I think Facebook games.
10927970	10930671	And there's very few Facebook games I get excited about.
10930751	10931472	Very, very few.
10931512	10934313	Although I will say, you don't know Jack is pretty fucking awesome on Facebook.
10934393	10934814	Just saying.
10938897	10939117	Actdeft
10956855	10971626	The Noobuo Summer Bundle Kickstarter So it's a Kickstarter that he's linked us to It's music inspired by video games And it's a Kickstarter They're trying to raise $8,000 And why are they doing this?
10971706	10975929	Well they're trying to do video game music information in English and Japanese
10976409	11002089	A two CD original and arranged soundtrack album for the browser game Roko-Chan And doing some different design work there Proceeds of the Kickstarter will benefit the bundle's eight participating musicians And will be the first source of funding for the Roko-Chan team So I guess it's kind of like a little bit of a startup company here Slash get a cool little soundtrack album I will say this though, some of the albums that are included in this Super Meat Boy Choice Piano Cuts
11002469	11031612	Splatterhouse Volume 1, Volume 2 and Splatterhouse Butchered so if you're a Splatterhouse fan also in there in the arranged pack looks like our friend MegaRan who was on the show a few weeks ago is involved there with Black Materia the remixes as well as some stuff by Metroid Metal so those are some groups you should know of so go on to Kickstarter and search for N-U-B-U-W-O N-U-B-U-W-O N-U-B-U-W-O there it is that's it for tweets the phone ain't going off so I'm thinking the show's about over
11033530	11035871	Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight to our little program.
11055655	11060477	There's an app in the App Store, and it's also, it's iOS and it's Android, called Stitcher Radio.
11060997	11065579	And you can give us thumbs up and likes and stuff, and there actually is like a chart that ranks shows.
11065619	11068860	And I think last I looked, we were number 40 or something in games.
11068880	11070521	And we can go a little higher, right?
11070581	11072382	Give us some thumbs up.
11072582	11074403	Stitcher's free, so go get it.
11074443	11075283	Give us some thumbs up.
11075783	11076723	It's on the web, too.
11076763	11080225	I'll have to get the link for the website or Tiger Claw will beat me to it in about five seconds here.
11080525	11083286	We could definitely use your thumbs up and your likes over there on Stitcher Radio.
11083306	11084427	We'd really appreciate that.
11086268	11087148	Or just tell a friend.
11087188	11091530	Word of mouth is how we spread the good word of Orange Launch Radio and grow the OL Army.
11092590	11096452	Before we conclude tonight, though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11096772	11098053	Dark Sakura, we'll start you tonight.
11098093	11098573	Ladies first.
11098653	11099814	I'm changing the fortune cookie.
11100979	11101760	You can't do that.
11101800	11102360	Yes, I can.
11102520	11103061	All right, fine.
11103081	11103922	You can change the fortune.
11104943	11106003	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11106604	11108446	I have to get off Kickstarter.
11108506	11109727	It's dangerous.
11110107	11111028	Spending too much money?
11111108	11112009	Well, no.
11112089	11117033	I've been luckily not spending too much money, but I'll talk to you after about stuff.
11118663	11118983	I don't know.
11119484	11122446	I'm just seeing some of these ideas that people come up with.
11122506	11123346	It's just like, really?
11123486	11125087	No, we're not doing a Kickstarter.
11125408	11126949	No, no, no, no, no.
11127049	11128530	Not at all.
11129610	11130091	Not at all.
11130111	11131892	That's definitely not what I'm getting at.
11132873	11140698	My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to eating what's in that crock pot right over there in the corner of the room.
11141398	11145741	And all those bugs can go die of raid poisoning.
11146702	11147382	Stupid bugs.
11148430	11148890	That's it.
11149150	11149631	We're done.
11149791	11150411	We're out of here.
11150771	11154993	Thank you everybody so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll see you again next week.
11155394	11167080	We didn't mention it all tonight surprisingly just because E3's kind of dominated everything but I will mention now we are two weeks away from the 10 year Orange Lounge Radio anniversary show if you can believe it.
11167580	11168320	That's a long time.
11168420	11169301	Two weeks away.
11171008	11172709	Are you going to be here?
11173169	11173670	Yeah, I'll be here.
11173830	11174230	Okay.
11174250	11175431	There was a week you weren't going to be here.
11175531	11176331	That was supposed to be this week.
11176511	11177512	Oh, but you made it anyway.
11177612	11177732	Yeah.
11177972	11178392	Oh, hooray.
11179153	11179413	All right.
11179493	11179733	Great.
11180093	11181554	So are you really giving me the webcam?
11182075	11184456	Yes, I'm giving you the... Well, technically, that was from AkumaJP.
11184496	11187698	So AkumaJP gave you, then gave me, then gave you back the webcam.
11188058	11188198	Cool.
11188218	11189719	All right.
11190179	11190560	That's it.
11190800	11191180	We're done.
11191200	11191660	We're out of here.
