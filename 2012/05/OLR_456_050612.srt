00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Today, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:31,680
a reality, and we talk to video game hip hop artist, Megaran.

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,320
We are live with episode number 456, yes that's 456, of our show on this May the 6th, that's

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
5-6, 2012.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,100
A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show.

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,220
and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,660
Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,600
To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Man, to paraphrase I should say, but Mani isn't dead,

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
but Mani is life.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,640
Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Man?

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,760
He was the leader of the Disco Boys.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,080
That was Eddie Izzard?

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
that movie when I saw it.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
That movie was great.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,680
It was okay, but I saw it so long ago.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,260
Avengers, Avengers, Avengers.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,640
The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only tech master, Loki.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,280
I have also not seen the Avengers.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,320
I have not seen the Avengers, I'm like the one person in the world.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,660
You both are lame.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
We are lame.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,800
Well I'll explain my reasons in a minute, but first I have to plug the ever present

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,720
fourth guest on our show, The Chatters.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,440
That's right, head on over to vognetwork.com, you can't miss it, we're a brand new start

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,840
up network at VOG, so our chat is right there in the middle of the screen, and you can join

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,800
our chat room and chat with us, and you might have heard on tonight's show, we have an interview.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm excited, we haven't had an interview in a long time, and I was thinking about this

32
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,500
last week, I was like, can either of you name who the last person was on the show and when?

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,800
We had like a legit interview going on on the show.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
I don't remember.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I could not remember.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
What about Snake360dude?

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
No, it wasn't Snake360dude.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
It wasn't Snake360dude.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,840
No, it wasn't Snake360dude, it was the guy that was behind Technokitten Adventures.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,360
That was a year ago, it was Technokitten Adventure.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,280
Well we talked to him again, didn't we?

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,960
No, I don't think so.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,200
Because he has Nyan Cat Adventures, which is the same thing.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Anyway, he sold it off to an iPhone developer.

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
And we had the Orange Lounge game.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Mmhmm.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Yeah.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
Well I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
And he was on the show.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
But I wasn't technically on the interview, because he did, you know, was he plugging

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
the new game?

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,800
Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Where is the new game?

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Where is it?

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on.

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
You know what?

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,920
Beggars can't be choosers.

58
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Let him take his time.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,520
Alright, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like,

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,440
hey guys, who do you want us to interview on the show?

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Like within reason.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,800
You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-Aime, okay, we're not a television

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
network or something.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
We're not going to get those folks.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,440
And so we kind of fielded some of the responses.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,400
And one idea that I really liked was getting Mega Ran on our show.

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,060
Now if you guys don't know Mega Ran, he also goes by Random, and he does this like video

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,320
game hip hop music.

69
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,200
And I know some of you guys are probably sitting at that going, what, what?

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Video game hip hop?

71
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
What is that?

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
It's awesome.

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
This is what it sounds like.

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm only going to tease you a little bit with this.

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Check out this.

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:44,160
That song is called Splash Woman, and you can like hear it in the background, like that

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
riff.

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,200
And then he's kind of, you know, has some verses that he's laying down about Splash

79
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Woman or his Splash Woman.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
It's brilliant.

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I love it.

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,360
Anyway, I can't play the whole thing.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,200
I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing

84
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
there, iTunes or whatever.

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,920
But that's one of his like bigger, well-known songs, Splash Woman.

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
That was amazing.

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got, you got to do more.

88
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,040
So he's got like a Mega Man 9, he's got a Mega Man 10, and we're going to ask him about

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
some of his other projects.

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
He's not just a Capcom guy.

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
He's got Final Fantasy.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,200
We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact.

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,320
So if you're a Mega Ran fan who saw the shout out on Twitter and all that, it was waiting

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,280
for him to come on the show, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here.

95
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,720
But join our chat room because we are a live show.

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview.

97
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,840
And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com.

98
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,720
But when we get going, when we get Random on the phone, you can ask those questions.

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
All right.

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,200
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Hope you'll join us live sometime even if you missed our action-packed show tonight.

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,400
Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually

105
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,480
like to kind of have a kickoff topic and we kind of got into it a little bit already,

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,200
but everybody's talking about everybody, everybody in the geek world talking about the Avengers.

107
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,920
Dark Sakura, I know you were there.

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,320
I know you went and saw the Avengers movie.

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
You're a comic fan.

110
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
You're a Marvel fan.

111
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Ed Joss.

112
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
What?

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Ed Joss.

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Oh, Ed Joss Whedon.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
You're a Joss Whedon fan.

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
How was the Avengers movie?

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,840
Oh my God.

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
It was beautiful.

119
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,400
And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today, I've had allergies.

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I went to see it.

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,320
I loaded myself up on Sudafed and Allegra and ate Ricolas and Junior Mints the entire

122
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,760
time, which are an odd combination, but oddly work.

123
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,920
And I was just like, oh, Hawkeye, this is the Hawkeye movie.

124
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Why is he evil?

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,480
Not to spoil, but I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass, I mean, please.

126
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,400
I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me.

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Anyway.

128
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
In full 3D?

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,720
Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie.

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
All right.

131
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,080
I have a new ship.

132
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,480
I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because, oh my God.

133
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,160
Aren't there, I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites, but I think I read something

134
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,200
about, cause you know, I read all that trash.

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,880
I think I read something, something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson.

136
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,540
They've been flirty.

137
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,240
Like there's pictures of them on the red carpet, flirty.

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
So you know what?

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,340
If I get pretty, I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett

140
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Johansson.

141
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,760
So, you know, and it's all because of him is the whole reason I want to see that Mission

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,160
Impossible movie, him and Simon Peck because hello.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Um, so yeah, I can say first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss

144
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
death.

145
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I will not tell you who.

146
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,920
And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,960
No, don't spoil.

148
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man.

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Like I did with Wash.

150
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,980
Okay.

151
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
And stay during the credits.

152
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Yes.

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Oh my God.

154
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
What was that?

155
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
What was that?

156
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,960
So one does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits.

157
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Exactly.

158
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
Cause now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the cause you know, there's that like that

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,200
lovely designed a bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who

160
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,720
is in it, who were in it, sorry.

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,200
And then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil,

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,880
but if nobody gets it, please ask me.

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,480
I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants.

164
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,720
And then, but the very end of the movie and really listen very carefully to the dialogue

165
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
right before the credits.

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,120
That's all I'm having to say.

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Tiger claw on our chat and chat chatters.

168
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Don't spoil.

169
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Don't do it.

170
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,560
If you spoil your getting kicked to the private messages, take your spoil into the private

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
messages.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
Uh, just double click on some of these names and you can private message him.

173
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Uh, and you can, you can talk a double click on dark soccer.

174
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
I will gush you all.

175
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
You're in the show.

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay.

177
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Talk to her.

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,000
Um, I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,720
Let's go to the chat room real quick at vog network.com a tiger.

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner.

181
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
He's taken over the born movies, the Matt Damon, born conspiracy, all that stuff.

182
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Yeah.

183
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Those board movies are pretty awesome.

184
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Actually.

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm, I'm excited about that.

186
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
How do you think so?

187
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm better than Matt Damon.

188
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
I mean, come on.

189
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
It's Matt Damon.

190
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,720
I just didn't care about the board movies.

191
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
SSJ 100.

192
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
Matt says I give it to Joss Whedon.

193
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts.

194
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
I think there were a lot of people.

195
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,160
Did you hear this?

196
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,320
Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter,

197
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but two, 200 million

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
plus for the weekend.

199
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,440
And a, this is the, this is the other real telling thing.

200
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,040
Um, hunger games beat that.

201
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
No, no.

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Hunger games didn't beat it either.

203
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,080
A, I mean, hunger games was huge, but didn't beat it.

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,440
A plus cinema score that in cinema score.

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie.

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,220
I actually pulled for them once.

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,800
They were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was, but

208
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,680
they pulled me on it and they actually take, you know, they grade it a plus rating from

209
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
cinema score.

210
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,360
That's, that's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, Hey,

211
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
this movie doesn't suck.

212
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Go see it.

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,980
And, uh, going to some other chats, uh, panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right in the VOG

214
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,920
network chat room said Avengers did something amazing.

215
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,100
They combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it because hello.

216
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Who else could do that?

217
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,080
But the Joss, I'm sorry.

218
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,320
So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say everybody was characterized perfectly.

219
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,400
The interaction was perfect.

220
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,160
And um, for those of you who read ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first.

221
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,960
It really does seem like it's based a bit more off of ultimates with a good splash of

222
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,160
six one six universe in it.

223
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,380
So yeah, it, it, um, it's really good.

224
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,680
And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks, although I'd pay to see that.

225
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,200
I would pay for that Star Wars slash, you know, Avengers movie.

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is and it's not a spoiler,

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,180
but it, cause they did the first half of it in the trailer is this whole scene where Iron

228
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,000
Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the party to you.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,880
Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,040
her face saying, I don't see how this is a party.

232
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
That's the best line in the whole movie.

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.

234
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,360
It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day and they're making

235
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,800
an Avengers video game.

236
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,400
So well, actually I was going to ask, where is the video game?

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
It is coming.

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,000
It's strike while the iron is hot.

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,080
I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always rush the game out.

240
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Okay.

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Perfect.

242
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,520
Let's have a sub plan better.

243
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,280
It would have been out for the movie, but I'm willing to do something like ultimate

244
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,840
Alliance honestly, cause that was both.

245
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,680
The second one did the whole civil war thing and it was kind of crap, but the first one,

246
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
I love the gameplay in both of the games.

247
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
They were just fantastic.

248
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,680
I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in ultimate Alliance style.

249
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
All right, so go into our chat room.

250
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,760
There is a hater.

251
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,580
We do have a hater in the chat room.

252
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,280
You know that every, every big fandom is going to have its haters.

253
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,120
Rama's in the chat room saying, fuck Joss Whedon, James Cameron will come back strong

254
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
with avatar too.

255
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah.

256
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,580
Cause he came out strong with avatar one.

257
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,320
That was some cheesy piece of shit.

258
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Uh, okay.

259
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Look low key.

260
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Okay.

261
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah.

262
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Cause everybody bought into, Oh my God, I have to see this in 3d.

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,820
My eyes will be blown out of my head.

264
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,440
It was just such a terrible story and just wasn't bad.

265
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
It was terrible.

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,840
In one of those movies, you want, I don't want to admit they like just like guys, guys,

267
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,080
guys, man, man, please, no, don't worry about ripoffs and who's going to come out on top.

268
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,640
There hasn't been a real original idea since the sixties.

269
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,300
Maybe they're all going to take your money.

270
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Let's be real.

271
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,960
One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative

272
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,700
deal the fuck with it.

273
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,720
They're going to make Titanic more 3d it's what's going to happen.

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,200
Deal with it.

275
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Falling sunglasses.

276
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,280
A technist in our chat room says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel

277
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,960
or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good.

278
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
What do you think?

279
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Agreed.

280
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,240
And honestly, given the big spoiler, not spoiler, I should say, but the big preview of the next

281
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,960
movie, Joss has to do it.

282
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,040
There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and, and please forgive me for saying

283
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,080
this, Chris Claremont, please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers.

284
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,600
They'll just have Treyarch do it and then they'll add zombies.

285
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,320
I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that and yeah, he did

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,040
kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont

287
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,200
was the man.

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
He's the one who gave us dark Phoenix.

289
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,240
He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel

290
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
bin and made it the top a player it is now.

291
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,400
So now I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward

292
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
to a lot.

293
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Like, you know, the Avengers.

294
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,360
I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but you know, I'm into it.

295
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,640
I liked the, the Iron Man movie was good and all the movies are good.

296
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
I'll go see it.

297
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I just don't want to see it opening weekend.

298
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
I don't, I knew the crowds are going to be insane.

299
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,360
One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget Joss Whedon also wrote comics.

300
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,120
He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out.

301
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,640
But there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to.

302
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,300
One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care.

303
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,240
I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week.

304
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I want to see it.

305
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,840
And I know people are like, it looks stupid.

306
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
What's it?

307
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,480
The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival, but that's what made

308
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,640
it awesome.

309
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,880
And like if, if they, I'm a little worried cause I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot,

310
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,840
but if they did it right, it's, it's going to be a fun time.

311
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
So I'm looking forward to that cautiously.

312
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,200
And Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.

313
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
Just Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.

314
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Helena Bonham Carter.

315
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,880
Also a flaw free goddess.

316
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,920
Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about.

317
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I know, right?

318
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
With Michelle Pfeiffer.

319
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Amazing.

320
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'll see anything to her in it.

321
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,200
I have that on HD DVD.

322
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,440
I sat through an Oprah book of the month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer cause I

323
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,240
love her that much.

324
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,680
And hello, the best, the only Catwoman, which leads me to, I am still excited a lot about

325
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,560
this Batman movie, really, really excited about the third Batman movie.

326
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,800
You know, I'm kind of two thoughts about that one, but you know what preview I saw that

327
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,400
I will be there to see because I love the original so much.

328
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,280
Frankenweenie I'm serious.

329
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,200
That looks adorable and I freaking love Frankenweenie so shut up.

330
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Don't judge.

331
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I see you judging.

332
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm judging a little bit.

333
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Stop judging me.

334
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
All right.

335
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Video games back.

336
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah.

337
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
As much as we love to talk movies and all that.

338
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
We got it.

339
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
It's all about the Tron series starting in June.

340
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
We can all agree on that.

341
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Tron is King.

342
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Yes.

343
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
A couple of weeks away.

344
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Disney XD.

345
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I am there.

346
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Finally.

347
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
OLR Avengers assemble.

348
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Tron.

349
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Woo.

350
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Okay.

351
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
OLR is assemble.

352
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
All right.

353
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Thank God.

354
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
We agree on something.

355
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
As long as I get to be Hawkeye.

356
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
All right.

357
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
There's no Hawkeye in Tron.

358
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
You fool.

359
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,400
There should be Hawkeye in Tron.

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You know?

361
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, I have to say, I have to say.

362
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
We got to get to games.

363
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
We got to get to games.

364
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
You know why?

365
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
You know why?

366
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
There were all these Disney trailers before.

367
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,640
There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel.

368
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,480
But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers.

369
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Duntron style.

370
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Yes.

371
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I saw that.

372
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
It was amazing.

373
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Yeah.

374
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
They were epic.

375
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I loved them as Marvel.

376
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
But anyway.

377
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Okay.

378
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
All right.

379
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

380
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Join us in our chat.

381
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Vognetwork.com.

382
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
We're getting into.

383
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
The Spider-Man trailer was good.

384
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
What was your gaming week?

385
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
What kinds of games did you play this week?

386
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet

387
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,040
was just, has been crap all week and it's the last week before finals.

388
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,640
I've also had a crap ton of design work to do.

389
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
So Mass Effect came out of the box.

390
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Oh my gosh.

391
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
I didn't get played, but it got opened.

392
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
You tease.

393
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,200
I know.

394
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,960
And yes, Frankenweenie really.

395
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Frankenweenie's awesome.

396
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Shut up.

397
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Zombie dogs.

398
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Anyway.

399
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:43,240
Uh, I, I actually did play through some Portal 2 and I played a little bit of WoW, but like,

400
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,400
okay, this is what was so stupid.

401
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
All right.

402
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,160
I get in queue and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me fart angry

403
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
farts.

404
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Okay.

405
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,020
I was trying to play WoW and I was in queue and then while, and then I didn't realize

406
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,260
how close I was to a level.

407
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,080
So I did a cooking daily level got kick out of queue.

408
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,240
Oh shoot.

409
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,480
You know, at 13 minutes of waiting in queue.

410
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,280
So I get kicked out, whatever.

411
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,840
So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily.

412
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,720
Um, so then I get back in another queue and we all get in and everything's happy.

413
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
We're in there.

414
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Yay.

415
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Queue.

416
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
And then, Oh, I'm going to leave.

417
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Log off.

418
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Fine.

419
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Offline.

420
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
What?

421
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Everybody leaves the party.

422
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,080
As soon as I get my quest, I'm like, all of you suck.

423
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
And I just logged off for the day.

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,120
Die in a hundred fires.

425
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,920
May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.

426
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,540
You didn't even get, I, I was here, I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and

427
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,720
your anger rant about children's week.

428
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,520
And speaking of things that he's saving that for the FUs of the week, because I cannot

429
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,040
get my Drake this year because of children's week whores.

430
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,080
She just wanted her virtual pony.

431
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,440
Bring your child to your virtual world.

432
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,920
Your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little

433
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,160
five year old wander behind you while you're in the firelands.

434
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
She's right.

435
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
That's what it is.

436
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,440
It's like, I was telling, that seems very unsafe.

437
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,240
I was telling Becky and Becky doesn't really, she's not really into well, she doesn't play

438
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
it.

439
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Nothing to that.

440
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
I was telling her about children's week and her reply was, Oh my God, that's fucked up.

441
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,100
And it is the best place to, when you had to do the five dailies thing, the fastest

442
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,000
place to get it done is firelands if you're 85.

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,480
So you just run them through, Oh, this thing is setting you on fire.

444
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,800
Oh, you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going,

445
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,000
this is cool.

446
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement.

447
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,680
Yes you do.

448
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
Called bad example.

449
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes you do.

450
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That was great.

451
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,360
And then you give them a gun and a kite.

452
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,080
I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday.

453
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,400
Actually, it's kind of disturbing.

454
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,760
And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron.

455
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,800
She has to deal with you now.

456
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
You're not my problem.

457
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,080
So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem.

458
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,880
Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe or is it just like, no, they just have

459
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,600
to follow you because they're, they're lonely orphans cooped up in the orphanage all day

460
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
and they want to get out and see the world and children's week is a time for them to

461
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
do that.

462
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,840
Oh, and one of the achievements is you have to hearth back while you have your orphan

463
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
with you.

464
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,080
So you leave your orphan behind in another town across the world, like no child left

465
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,840
behind or something like that.

466
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh my God.

467
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,640
And of course I have the stupid human kid following me around.

468
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,720
If I do this crap next year, cause I get, I do want the pets and I did get my pet, but

469
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,600
if I do this next year, then I'm gonna get the drawn eye kid.

470
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,960
You know, the only children in the game that I like is that little bloodthirsty blood elf

471
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
kid that hangs out with all the orcs.

472
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
You know what I'm talking about?

473
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,920
I have to kill this guy for my daddy and I like the gem and the holograms wandering around

474
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
dark wind fair.

475
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,440
Uh, Ziba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for dark soccer.

476
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Just stop playing.

477
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Wow.

478
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Then shut up.

479
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Picaruna wants me to be on hard house.

480
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,580
Rob, we can arrange that.

481
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,840
You should come back on hard house.

482
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I love it.

483
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
All right.

484
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,120
Hoard house.com is the spinoff show all about work.

485
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,160
All right.

486
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Other games.

487
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Loki.

488
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I know you got something else to talk about.

489
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,560
Uh, yeah, I don't play a while.

490
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,560
So um, I play Call of Duty, my warfare three and honestly that's, it's all I really played

491
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,240
this week because I only played it at work and um, you know, the rest of the time I've

492
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,200
been working on my portal to papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, I'm about 99%

493
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,860
done with the body of the portal turret.

494
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,240
Did you see that amazing portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a

495
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
cake falling through the portal?

496
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Yeah.

497
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Oh yeah.

498
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
You gotta see it.

499
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
It's great.

500
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
I'll find it and link my tumblr.

501
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone should be looking at my tumblr.

502
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,040
Uh, kurotsubasa.

503
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,720
You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guests to

504
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,960
make Iran and the Fugu question we're going to get into is, you know, creating art inspired

505
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
by video games.

506
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
What is it about?

507
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,280
And you're, you're basically making art based on portal to granted it might be on a template

508
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,320
that's already out there or whatever with your own flare.

509
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,200
But what is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real

510
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
world?

511
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Because they're funny.

512
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,280
They're funny little things.

513
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some.

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
Um, and I don't count the, the stuffed ones cause they look stupid.

515
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,800
But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA for example, made a full size

516
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,840
portal turret that talked in like, you know, shut air stuff, BBs or something like that.

517
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,040
I would probably buy two or three.

518
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Um, but I don't know.

519
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,320
I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it cause it was a cheap project.

520
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,540
Um, although now I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want it to look a little bit better.

521
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:50,440
So now I have to use Bondo and Plex or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a

522
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,440
load of fun except it's not.

523
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Um, so I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.

524
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Uh, we'll see.

525
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,880
But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now.

526
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,760
You know, I did a portal turret in, uh, uh, Maya as my final projects.

527
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Yeah.

528
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I remember seeing that.

529
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Um, I don't know.

530
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,280
It was just fun.

531
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
So that's what I did.

532
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,680
I've been looking at, um, getting portal two for, well, redeeming my copy of portal two

533
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,080
on steam that I have for my PS3.

534
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,360
Um, I still have to do that or look at it or whatever.

535
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever.

536
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,600
I mean, it's so cheap now.

537
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm sure I can get it, you know, a few bucks.

538
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,240
And then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too, because of all the like cool mods that

539
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
they have.

540
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,900
Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation three just because I'm missing out on all

541
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,480
these darn mods.

542
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,840
I thought Sony said they were, I, maybe I was just hallucinating, but I thought Sony

543
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,680
said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation three.

544
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Yeah.

545
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Well, what did they ever do?

546
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,640
This steam stuff for, you know, portal to nothing.

547
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,360
I mean, it's, I don't know.

548
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,100
So I may do that.

549
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,240
And then, um, I mean, I guess I played a little bit of the perfect strangers adver game thing.

550
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
That was kind of fun.

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,080
I actually played it a few times because I liked watching the, or reading the dream board

552
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,280
that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and, uh, you know, stuff

553
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
of that nature.

554
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
It was kind of funny.

555
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,040
Um, yeah, that's pretty much all I played.

556
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,320
Um, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it.

557
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,480
I kind of wish I'd, I did want to play some Skyrim this week.

558
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I, if I dive back in, I'm going to be, that's

559
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,560
going to be another, like three months of my life.

560
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,840
Well, it's going to be more than three months because by the time I get to about three months,

561
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,160
they'll release the expansion.

562
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Just over from there.

563
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,320
That's why I was like, Oh no, Skyrim online or not.

564
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Skyrim.

565
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Well, the other scrolls online.

566
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm like, ah, crap.

567
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Well, I'm going to have to play this, aren't I?

568
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,240
And then, uh, I started reading up on it and I was like, well, maybe not.

569
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,880
All right.

570
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,440
Um, my gaming week, um, not a lot of new stuff.

571
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I did play Mass Effect.

572
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I did.

573
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Yes.

574
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I played a lot of Mass Effect.

575
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Let's get that out of the way.

576
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,640
Uh, Mass Effect three, I'm playing more, lots of side missions, working on the main missions.

577
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,800
I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys, but

578
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,920
it was, uh, I'll just say some, something involving the Citadel happened and it was

579
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
pretty awesome.

580
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Um, and then, uh, multiplayer.

581
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
That's the, that's the thing that gets me.

582
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,720
I am really into multiplayer in this game, which you guys have to understand.

583
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,360
I don't really play a lot of Xbox live games online, especially things that are kind of

584
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,600
like shooters, although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter, but it's, it's,

585
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
it's a shooter.

586
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,620
It's like a shooter RPG hybrid, more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG,

587
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,620
I guess.

588
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,200
But my point is I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox live outside of arcade games

589
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,720
and music games like rock band that I've played online that I truly enjoyed.

590
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
Like I, one of the last ones is like Halo two, you want to go that back that far with

591
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,160
your pink guy, but I, yep, my red, but I love Mass Effect three online and I think a big

592
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,280
part of that and the community's great.

593
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,500
I mean, sometimes I hear random people like yelling at people across the room in their

594
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,560
own house, but you don't hear the same stuff like, you know, F you and you know, the racial

595
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,360
slurs and the, you know, um, sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated

596
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
with Xbox live.

597
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,600
I don't hear it in Mass Effect three.

598
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,360
Oh, that would be kind of funny though.

599
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,000
Like, you know, cause I'm assuming it's basically co-op against, you know, the enemy.

600
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It'd be funny.

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,240
It would be funny to have people that are racist against the enemies, you know, that's

602
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
just Ashley.

603
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,560
But anyway, if you were, if you're a Mass Effect player, you'll get that joke.

604
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,580
But anyway, uh, yeah, the fact that it's co-op I think really leads to a different kind of

605
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,000
community for the game.

606
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,560
And you know, I, I'm sure it's not perfect.

607
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,760
Every community has their, you know, dumb asses, but this game's pretty awesome so far

608
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
from my experience.

609
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,780
And I'm, I'm, uh, motivated to continue to play it online.

610
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,460
I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits

611
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,560
and doing all that stuff.

612
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,040
So, uh, yeah, Mass Effect good times.

613
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,120
So I'll Mass Effect three gets a big endorsement for me.

614
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Um, I haven't gotten to that ending yet.

615
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,480
I still am not spoiled on the ending yet.

616
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it, but let me tell you what, I've been

617
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
on this Mass Effect bang bandwagon.

618
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,260
I just started back in February and I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect one, 40 hours

619
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,660
of Mass Effect two, maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC.

620
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,440
And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect three.

621
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,920
That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played.

622
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,200
The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob

623
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,420
what was a great experience.

624
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,940
I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up or, you know, kind of say

625
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,640
that was shitty, you know, or compare it to the ending of the Sopranos, which wasn't that

626
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
great either.

627
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,280
But that's, you know, I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of

628
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Mass Effect three.

629
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
It's so terrible.

630
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,120
And the ending just ruined it for me.

631
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,240
So I'm going to our chat room at chat, excuse me, almost at the old one going to shit, vog

632
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
network.com.

633
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,160
Uh, tiger class says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kayden.

634
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,920
Techness says Mass Effect two was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect

635
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
game.

636
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,880
But the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is.

637
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,120
I, however, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat.

638
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,320
So I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side.

639
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect three, all that crap out of the

640
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,560
way, all that crap out of the way.

641
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
So all right.

642
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,000
Uh, one of the game, I, uh, Mega Rants coming on in just a minute, we got to call him, but

643
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,160
I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week, a new game Fez on Xbox

644
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,600
live arcade, because everybody's telling me, Rob, this is like an eight bit looking game

645
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
with great music.

646
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
It's a puzzler.

647
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
It is right up your fucking alley.

648
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Go play this game.

649
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
You play Fez now.

650
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Fez is cool.

651
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Fez is cool.

652
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I like it.

653
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Sorry.

654
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Doctor Who reference.

655
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, I see.

656
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Uh, well whatever.

657
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Doctor, Doctor Who reference or not.

658
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
It's a pretty fun game.

659
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,160
Uh, quickly, the concept, it's the 2d world that you're in getting turned into a 3d world.

660
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,080
So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2d

661
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,240
scroller is suddenly like has four different sides cause you don't really go up or down.

662
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,760
So it's just like the four sides of a cube and you know, you kind of, you get puzzles

663
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,400
out of that where you might have to climb up a vine on one side of the cube to get the

664
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,840
gem that's on another side of it.

665
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,600
The puzzles in the beginning are pretty simple, but from what I understand, there are some

666
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,520
killer hard puzzles that they call the anti cube puzzles and they're buried in things

667
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,160
like random QR codes that might be on the wall.

668
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
I've unlocked an anti cube.

669
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,360
I actually got the anti cube before I got a regular cube.

670
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Here's a hint.

671
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,720
Read the achievements.

672
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,680
How to unlock an anti cube is in one of the achievements.

673
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,320
Minor spoiler, but whatever.

674
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,520
It's a gamer tip.

675
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Take that.

676
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,280
Um, so a lot of depth to it and I thought I saw Pete Caruno and somebody in our chat

677
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,240
said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight cause I was trying to get one of those

678
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,120
freaking cubes and Fez to unlock.

679
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,120
So apparently there's, it's like Castlevania Symphony of the night where there's like a,

680
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,600
a pretty easy game in the beginning.

681
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,780
And then once you, just when you thought you beat it, there's that twist of, Oh crap.

682
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,640
Now I have to do it all again, but it just got like 11 billion times harder.

683
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
All right.

684
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,800
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

685
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
And Hey, how about that?

686
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,720
It is just about time for us to go to the phone and bring onto the program.

687
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,360
Mega ran video game, hip hop artist, he goes by random as well.

688
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,800
I like mega ran cause you know, mega man and all that stuff.

689
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,400
And obviously that was a lot of what he became famous for, but airman can't be beaten.

690
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
But uh, yeah, you know, we played a clip from a splash woman earlier.

691
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,180
We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview.

692
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,040
Just a talented guy really into the art and he, you know, he's made it like a Bobby joked

693
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
on his show earlier.

694
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,160
He got on sports center with a rap about Jeremy Lin.

695
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,080
So it's not, it's not just restricted to video games.

696
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,520
So, and I understand even better.

697
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,320
This guy is a teacher during the day.

698
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,760
He's a teacher IRL as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side.

699
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,760
So I want to talk to him about his art and I want to open it up to you guys for your

700
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,780
questions on vog network.com.

701
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,840
So let's get random on the show right now.

702
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,080
I've punched in his number and we're giving him a call.

703
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,480
It is live radio.

704
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,720
Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message just like the phone getting forwarded

705
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,680
to an automatic voicemail.

706
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,980
Let's try it one more time.

707
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,480
Maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick.

708
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:52,160
It is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail.

709
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,520
Let's try it one more time here.

710
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,280
Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

711
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:06,240
Boy, I think, I think, uh, I think he might be on the other line or something right now.

712
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
So all right.

713
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
That's all right.

714
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
These things happen in live radio.

715
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,920
We'll try him again in about three minutes.

716
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,880
So, uh, if you're a friend of MEGA's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to

717
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
get through.

718
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
All right.

719
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,680
Uh, meanwhile, let's, uh, let's go to our first news story tonight.

720
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,000
Uh, Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to MEGA, okay.

721
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's fine.

722
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,120
Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls online.

723
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,800
It's being developed by ZeniMax online, not necessarily Bethesda, but you know, it's owned

724
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,760
by the same company and, uh, it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series.

725
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,320
It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with, um, some of the places being

726
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,320
locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on.

727
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,040
But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh,

728
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,880
elsewhere and that kind of stuff.

729
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,520
Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like,

730
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,680
the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of

731
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
the game.

732
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,240
At least some of the screenshots, uh.

733
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,360
One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third person perspective.

734
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,640
Now, I know that's an option in, like, the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third person

735
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,760
perspective, but I really like the first person aspect of it and I understand that the reason

736
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,440
that they wanted to go that route is because, you know, it'd be less of a learning curve

737
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,080
for people that are from, you know, other MMOs.

738
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,800
The problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to, kind of, World of Warcraft

739
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,320
and that's kind of, ehhhh.

740
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,360
Well, you know what they did is apparently they licensed BioWare's Star Wars The Old

741
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,660
Republic engine to do it.

742
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,840
That's what I'm hearing.

743
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,140
And it's kind of, I mean, I'm not shade in the BioWare game, I mean, Star Wars was alright,

744
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,000
but it's like, I like Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine.

745
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean, it's weird.

746
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yeah.

747
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, I have no problem with them doing, like, a third person's perspective or even, like,

748
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,760
having all those options, but at the same time also allow people to play the same way

749
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,400
you would play, like, a regular, you know, like, Skyrim or Oblivion or something like

750
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,800
that, like, from a first person perspective without, you know, necessarily the hotbar

751
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
and that kind of stuff.

752
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Um.

753
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I don't know.

754
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,220
Some of the other, uh, features that they're talking about also, they're gonna have, um,

755
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,800
you know, PVP battles also, some 100 vs 100 instances, in fact, one of them they explained

756
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,080
is you take over Cyrodiil's Imperial City and the winning faction, um, I guess, uh,

757
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,620
the greatest champion of the winning faction gets installed is the Emperor.

758
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,800
Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is, uh, 35 after right now and, you know, it is

759
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,500
live radio and, you know, he could be anywhere right now.

760
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,000
He could be, he could be in the basement writing his next hit and the cell signal might not

761
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
be catching.

762
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,720
Let's see if maybe he's, uh, come to the surface.

763
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm gonna try to get through again real quick here.

764
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
Your call has been-

765
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,600
Oh, boy, that's really not good.

766
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Alright.

767
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,280
Let's, uh, let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that.

768
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Alright.

769
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,560
And then, um, let's see.

770
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,880
They also, uh, you know, they're showing off some of the different, uh, kind of artwork

771
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
for the game.

772
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,640
A lot of it's still very early, um, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game.

773
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,920
I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing, um,

774
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,920
but then again, I guess I got used to it with, you know, Final Fantasy XI and that kind of

775
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
stuff.

776
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,880
Um, and then some other stuff, not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online, but Skyrim,

777
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,200
um, one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard, well that's been officially

778
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,440
announced now that Dawnguard will be the first, um, expansion to Skyrim and it'll be coming

779
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,280
out this summer and, of course, being, um, talked about during E3, um, and, you know,

780
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,200
the rumors, of course, um, that it's gonna feature, you know, uh, you know, crossbows

781
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,480
and, um, some other types of characters and races and stuff in there.

782
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,360
So, very interesting, um, might even be cool if they have, like, some of the, uh, because

783
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,200
remember when they had, like, this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's

784
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,120
like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit that, for Skyrim,

785
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
go!

786
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,160
And then they had, like, you know, spear throwing and, um, I wanna say that, like, the kill

787
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,440
cameras for Magic and stuff like that came out of that and, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure

788
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,880
crossbows probably will come out of that as well, so it would be neat to see some more

789
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
of that stuff in there.

790
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,240
I mean, they seem pretty creative, so, um, looking forward to that.

791
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,440
Um, and of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but, uh,

792
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,200
the Kinect update finally came out now for Skyrim for the Xbox 360 and they have 200

793
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,360
voice commands added in there as well.

794
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,200
Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC, but apparently there

795
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
are-

796
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,440
That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming foosurada!

797
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,640
Uh, apparently there's already mods available that have it.

798
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,860
And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those

799
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
voice mods to work.

800
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,360
You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange, but, you know, whatever, that's how

801
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
they did it.

802
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,640
All right, I'm gonna try again here, guys.

803
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,040
Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right

804
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
now.

805
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,280
Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen.

806
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
You know, it's live!

807
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,900
Anything can happen live!

808
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,320
He did know what time we were gonna-

809
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,280
He did, and I- well, he's in Arizona, but they're on the same time as us right now.

810
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,600
Arizona's a funky state, because sometimes during the year they're like an hour ahead

811
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
and sometimes they're not.

812
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,320
Because Arizona does things their way.

813
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,240
That's right, their way or the highway.

814
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,880
But yeah, I used world clock to make sure everybody was on board with 630, but you know,

815
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
he's got a big project right.

816
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,680
He just did some Kickstarter thing that, you know, made a ton of money, and there- probably

817
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,040
I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to, you know, do some voices

818
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,480
for his project right now, so he's just- I guess he's just a little busy right now.

819
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,760
So we will keep trying here in just a little bit.

820
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,520
But uh, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO.

821
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,920
I'm not, it's just because, you know, I had imagined, you know, okay, it's basically gonna

822
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,220
be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're gonna have,

823
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,900
you know, a lot of players running around and it's gonna be all time real.

824
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,320
That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, an MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like.

825
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,440
And then it was like, okay, it's gonna be a third person perspective.

826
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Well, that's alright.

827
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, that's gonna have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs.

828
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,480
It's like crap, you know, so basically you're doing- you're copycatting everything that

829
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,800
other MMOs are doing, because you wanna, you know, draw more people to it so that they're

830
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,720
not afraid of it, instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get

831
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,520
the people that play your games normally to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter

832
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,440
since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot

833
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,640
of people that play, like, you know, World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with,

834
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,480
oh, it's first person perspective.

835
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
That's a little bit fresh.

836
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,040
It's a little different of an idea.

837
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

838
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
click, click, oh, dead.

839
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,320
Alright, go, next game, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead, okay, I

840
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,880
mean, it just sounds really boring.

841
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,200
That's why I don't play MMOs.

842
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,520
Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right?

843
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,880
That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action,

844
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,120
it's hard to judge it, right?

845
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,480
I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right?

846
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:51,040
Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now.

847
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Right.

848
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay, alright.

849
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,800
Um, well, um, I guess let's try Mega again, it's been 10 minutes, I, I, unfortunately,

850
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,160
it's um, deducting money from the Skype thingy every time I try, it's like, I can't afford

851
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,640
too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything

852
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I can.

853
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,480
I feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's

854
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
try it right now.

855
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,720
We're going to try one more time to get through here, after all it is live radio.

856
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Yeah.

857
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Oh, it's been forwarded.

858
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,000
Oh my gosh, is the phone even on?

859
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,800
Mega's phone may just not be on, maybe he was trying to nap, he's just so tired that

860
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
the darn phone isn't even on.

861
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,840
I think I'm going to send a tweet.

862
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,240
I actually already did, so we'll see.

863
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,960
I tweeted him, so hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops, yeah, there's this

864
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,380
one place in my house I was, I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal and I was standing

865
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,960
in it, so there it is.

866
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,320
Well, we do have more stories.

867
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,600
That's right, we do have some more stories we can go over, so I think we'll go ahead

868
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,560
and get to that.

869
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,480
Dark Sakura, why don't you read one for us?

870
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Sure.

871
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,880
How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie?

872
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,560
Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie.

873
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,960
They had somebody lined up, they had one Carlos Fresnadio and he walked out saying that the

874
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,960
video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating.

875
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,160
So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it who wants to make it really scary, but the studio

876
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,880
doesn't want to pay for it really.

877
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,960
He wants to do a rated R version, not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less.

878
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,320
I mean, basically the quote was the little sisters and injections and the whole thing.

879
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,720
I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later you're still shivering

880
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
and going Jesus Christ.

881
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,080
I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that?

882
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,540
Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little

883
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,840
girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people.

884
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,680
And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this, this might be pushing

885
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
it for some people.

886
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,760
We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's

887
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
fine.

888
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,440
I mean, I would see it.

889
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,320
I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play

890
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
it while he was playing it.

891
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Right, right.

892
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,480
So yeah, of course I don't mind stuff like that.

893
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,760
I mean, it's not the human centipede, so, so that's good.

894
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Oh my God.

895
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,400
My friend is so excited about the third one.

896
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Oh God.

897
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
They're making a third one.

898
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Yeah.

899
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I going, speaking of movies that have no hundred and 50 people, movies with no redeeming qualities

900
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,400
whatsoever and her grandmother love the human centipede.

901
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,520
That's like the grandma's watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape.

902
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
You've met my friend Carly.

903
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Yeah.

904
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Yeah.

905
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
It's her.

906
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, I don't know her grandma, but she's sick.

907
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You're German.

908
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
What's that have to do with anything?

909
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
I don't know.

910
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,480
You know, Germans are all sick people.

911
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,240
No, it's just very strong stomach.

912
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Very stoic.

913
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
A hundred and 50 people.

914
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Really?

915
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
It's going to be low key.

916
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,480
You should, you should audition for the part of one of the victims.

917
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,400
I don't think that they're casting it's going to be CG.

918
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,760
You know that, but anyway, I would see this.

919
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,600
I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede

920
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
movies.

921
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Just saying.

922
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Absolutely.

923
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,840
And then seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's

924
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,000
just a hundred person train?

925
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,280
I mean, seriously, I think that's going to happen.

926
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,600
I actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway, was watching bad

927
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,640
porn with, you know, perhaps, perhaps.

928
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
I don't know.

929
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
I don't know.

930
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
All right.

931
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,960
Um, here's what I'm going to do guys since it's six 45 and it's 15 minutes after the

932
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,120
time we scheduled a mega ran, I'm going to give it one more try, but this will be the

933
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,760
sixth try.

934
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys, cause that's six

935
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through.

936
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,120
So let's all, let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about mega ran and

937
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,920
maybe he'll get through this time.

938
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,680
So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network.

939
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,560
I better, you know, I, that's killer.

940
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
That's killer.

941
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,120
I'm going to, I'm going to do that whole like panicking thing.

942
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,040
Like am I calling the right number?

943
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,600
Did I put the right number into Skype and it's duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

944
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
duh, duh.

945
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Yep.

946
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
It's the same, right?

947
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
That's that.

948
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
That's the number.

949
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
You should leave him a message.

950
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
You see, let's leave a message.

951
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,080
I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it

952
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
here.

953
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,520
So why don't I go grab my cell phone?

954
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,560
I'm going to give mega ran a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going

955
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,800
to say, call it whenever you're ready.

956
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
That's a great idea.

957
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,400
That way you make a ramp fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight.

958
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
So I'm going to go do that right now.

959
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,120
And I realized I'm, I owe you guys a story, but maybe, maybe Loki will cover it for me.

960
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,640
I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers, Loki, maybe you could cover the story for

961
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
me.

962
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,480
And I'm going to go give mega ran a call on my personal line.

963
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
All right.

964
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,920
So you know how they have, you know, lay away and stuff like that.

965
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,080
Um, well, Microsoft want to kind of wants to do something similar to that for their

966
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,840
Xbox 360.

967
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,600
They are, there is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized

968
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,320
connect bundle available, um, starting next week.

969
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,680
And what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying

970
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,160
like a cell phone or a cell phone plan.

971
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,920
You get the cell phone at an increase, you know, a very big discount.

972
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,560
And then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly

973
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,040
fees, you know, and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200.

974
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,560
Or, you know, it's when they normally costs about 600 or 700 without the contract.

975
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,100
So that's going to be something similar with this.

976
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,500
Basically the Verge is saying that the bundle is going to be $100 upfront and you're going

977
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,640
to pay $15 a month each month for two years.

978
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,000
And it's also going to include, uh, the Xbox live gold service.

979
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,200
So it would be a way to kind of get people in the door, um, to, you know, buying a system

980
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,680
and being able to play with it for a couple of years, um, without having to drop, you

981
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,080
know, $400 right away.

982
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,720
Now you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you,

983
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,020
you know, bought it outright.

984
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,360
But I think that's more of a convenience.

985
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,480
I mean, cause you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like

986
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,000
that for a cell phone.

987
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,520
So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more, um, about $460 after

988
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,320
the end of the, um, service agreement.

989
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,280
Um, the good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems because

990
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,640
some of those old systems might last two years.

991
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,780
But uh, I don't know.

992
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,080
It's an interesting idea.

993
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,560
I could work, um, especially if you get people to do it.

994
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,840
I'm just going to, I don't know.

995
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,160
It'll be interesting to see how, how that works out.

996
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,560
You know, people paying $15 a month, but I guess that's not too much.

997
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,860
I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches.

998
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,080
So if you can spare a couple of lunches a month, I mean you can be playing an Xbox games

999
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
for a couple of years.

1000
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,440
It's an EAD I guess.

1001
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Okay.

1002
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,120
I'm back from making that phone call.

1003
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,800
So I'll guys, I'll let you guys know what happens.

1004
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,280
I really apologize to the Mega Ran fans.

1005
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
These things happen.

1006
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
It's live radio.

1007
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,560
It legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now.

1008
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,560
Just unplanned.

1009
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,240
You know, haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll

1010
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,200
be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at.

1011
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,920
And then suddenly, Oh, no cell signal that could be happening with me.

1012
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,000
I have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you know, you have to re reboot

1013
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,520
it every once in a while because you know, people try calling you for days and you're

1014
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,800
like, well, my cell phone's been on this entire time and no calls and he rebooted.

1015
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,920
And you're like, Hey, why do I have all these missed calls?

1016
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Exactly.

1017
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,240
So, uh, you know, again, Mega Ran fans who might be tuned into OLR for the first time

1018
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
trying to hear this interview.

1019
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,680
I just, you know, I want to say that we're not, we're not, we're not, uh, pulling a fast

1020
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
one on you.

1021
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,480
We are legit trying to get through.

1022
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,520
We had things set up.

1023
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,920
You'll notice Mega retweeted it.

1024
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,040
So, you know, he knew about it.

1025
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,160
It's just, you know, these things sometimes happen.

1026
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,560
I'm hoping I gave him the number to call right through to the show.

1027
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,660
Uh, and, uh, so maybe he'll just pop up during the show.

1028
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,660
So we'll see.

1029
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,080
So, uh, we'll let you know.

1030
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,280
All right.

1031
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,120
Anyhow, um, back to the Xbox story and the, uh, $99 Xbox.

1032
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,760
So I just want to point something out with this.

1033
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:33,120
When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year, and if

1034
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,760
you forgot what that's all about, cause you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12 month

1035
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,360
agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo three for free and you get a mount

1036
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,360
and you get into the beta and all this stuff.

1037
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,360
One little thing.

1038
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Yeah.

1039
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,200
Finals week is not the best week to launch this game.

1040
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
Okay.

1041
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,840
Um, I said back when that happened, I said, Hey, uh, you know, it's just a matter of time

1042
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,680
before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone

1043
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,760
contracts style agreements.

1044
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,740
Now granted, I didn't think about the system element.

1045
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:15,520
I had thought, Oh, well sign up for two years of Xbox live gold and get free halo maps or

1046
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,960
a free game or something like that giveaway and all this.

1047
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,640
Um, and here we are.

1048
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,440
We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing.

1049
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,280
Now coming to consoles, let me take it a step further.

1050
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,240
This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further.

1051
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,960
We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out, not just the

1052
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,920
Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it in the PlayStation four, whatever they end

1053
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,600
up calling that these systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive

1054
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,260
as hell.

1055
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:57,400
I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation three

1056
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,280
when it first rolled out.

1057
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,120
Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price?

1058
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
Yes.

1059
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,480
And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation four

1060
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:18,880
for $199 with a two year PlayStation plus agreement.

1061
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
You know what?

1062
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,100
If the thing is, um, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this,

1063
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:31,400
this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know, Xbox live gold.

1064
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,640
So $15 a month.

1065
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,920
Yeah, it's more per year, but it's not that bad.

1066
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,080
$15 is not bad.

1067
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,800
Hell, I pay $15 for use in an access every month and I don't even remember.

1068
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,000
I forget that even habits and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.

1069
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It got charged.

1070
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,520
So $15 a month is not a big deal.

1071
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,680
Just those little things that add up though, man, that in this economy, that's the stuff

1072
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,380
that can really get you because it's like, you know, Oh, maybe I'll pay $15 for this

1073
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,600
credit monitoring or I'll pay $20 a month for this Disneyland annual pass or a, you

1074
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,480
know, 20 bucks for my 24 of our fitness membership and all that stuff starts to add up.

1075
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,440
So, but it's an, it's an easy thing to fall for though.

1076
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Think about it.

1077
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,200
If you own an iPhone and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else.

1078
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,880
If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill.

1079
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,440
It's basically the iPhone tax.

1080
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
Yeah.

1081
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
And you know what?

1082
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,680
I don't care because my phone is sexy.

1083
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,400
Yeah, it's, it's a hell of a phone.

1084
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,200
And I have to say for everyone who's saying Diablo three and well to quote, Vogonator

1085
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,440
kiss outside in any sense of social life.

1086
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
Goodbye.

1087
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,880
Just saying been playing well and Diablo three beta and the wow beta and I work full time

1088
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,140
and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what?

1089
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,200
I still got for pink berry and get laid.

1090
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,580
Just saying it's possible and I'm going to Disneyland.

1091
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,240
So just saying that was a great way to cap it all off by the way.

1092
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,320
Just saying it's possible.

1093
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,400
Time management, learn those skills.

1094
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,640
And you have the show and I have the show.

1095
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Yes I do.

1096
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,900
And potentially I would another little project with the lovely cell that I'll kind of don't

1097
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,900
buy the horn.

1098
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,000
You can chew, but I do love me some sill.

1099
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
All right.

1100
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,400
Go into our chat room at vog network.com.

1101
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,800
Uh, it's right.

1102
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Penaxium.

1103
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,960
I am a time management pro, uh, shadow next gen says the PlayStation four will not be

1104
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
$699.

1105
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,880
I was just throwing it out there.

1106
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
What is an iPhone?

1107
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,880
A little iPhone?

1108
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,760
What does the iPhone cost unsubsidized?

1109
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,960
If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost?

1110
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,380
I'll tell you because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the

1111
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,920
unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up.

1112
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
$699.

1113
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah.

1114
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,600
I've been a place, I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone and

1115
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,100
it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone four S, but an Android it's a, was a Samsung

1116
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:05,960
galaxy two or Samsung was a galaxy S two or something like that.

1117
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:13,320
Um, and luckily I bought my news, so I got it for about $300, but I mean it's still fucking

1118
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
expensive.

1119
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
All right.

1120
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,480
I'm looking through some more comments.

1121
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,680
Our chat room at vog network.com, uh, let's see.

1122
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,680
Ross deal.

1123
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,920
UT says, of course the PlayStation four won't be $699.

1124
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,620
Sony learned that mistake.

1125
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,620
Think about what I'm saying though.

1126
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,620
Ross deal.

1127
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,960
UT here's a way for them not to make that mistake yet still charge that price.

1128
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Think about it though.

1129
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,720
And because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more

1130
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,120
than, you know, recouping like two or $300.

1131
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,280
That's recouping like double that you're talking, you know, $50 a month payments.

1132
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,360
That's a still a little bit much, uh, what up G in our chat room at, uh, vognetwork.com

1133
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
says.

1134
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,120
Then again, they kept the Vita price at two 49, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped

1135
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
the three DS price.

1136
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,440
That's a good point.

1137
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,360
They released the Vita cheaper and a lot of people thought they would and it sounded great

1138
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,520
and then no, the DS is now cheaper.

1139
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
I don't know.

1140
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,360
It wasn't that bad cause they had, they added, they couldn't drop the price of the system

1141
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,480
anymore, but they added value to it by including a eight gig memory card.

1142
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
So that wasn't so bad.

1143
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
The Vita is still a sexy piece of hardware.

1144
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,320
I mean, I mean three DS is too, I'm not knocking it, but you know, the three DS doesn't do

1145
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,320
Skype.

1146
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,320
It does.

1147
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,060
The Vita does the web a little better.

1148
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,420
You know, there's some things that the Vita does have on the three DS right now.

1149
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,240
Although I will say three DS has some pretty must have games right now.

1150
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,800
I own them both.

1151
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,320
Ross deal UT in chat says sky will the rent to own crowd be big enough?

1152
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
I don't think so.

1153
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,720
Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone.

1154
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,800
iPhone's the biggest phone out there.

1155
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,720
Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal and I bet

1156
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,080
Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation four sold as iPhones.

1157
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,080
And what are iPhones?

1158
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,160
They're subsidized by contract.

1159
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,720
Hmm.

1160
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
It could happen.

1161
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,560
All right, anyhow, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release

1162
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,840
dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you.

1163
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,180
There's not much this week.

1164
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,960
It's it's really sad.

1165
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,320
This week you're basically looking at two things.

1166
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,200
You've got this really cheap ass game.

1167
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,080
Um, it's like this foreign one action pack from South peak.

1168
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,880
It's for games that were a PlayStation, never games you've probably never, ever heard of.

1169
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,240
Um, that's on PS three this week and then also another PS three game star Hawk will

1170
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,240
be out this week.

1171
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,560
That's actually a pretty decent one.

1172
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Um, so that's coming out as well for PS three, nothing else.

1173
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,560
Wow.

1174
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,680
That's a pretty quick week.

1175
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,600
What's the next like big, big title coming out?

1176
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,080
Uh, would it be the week after Max Payne three?

1177
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,400
Oh yeah, that's right.

1178
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,640
Three and herp derp Diablo three, Max Payne three, the rise of Bruce Willis.

1179
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,840
I always forget because you know, with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually

1180
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,600
save the money to buy Diablo three, which is kind of nice.

1181
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,080
Well then, you know, beyond that, uh, there's another $15 a month thing I pay for.

1182
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,920
Well also was it the game of Thrones games going to be coming out, um, next week as well.

1183
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,960
The week after next as well.

1184
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,160
One does not simply pre-order the game of Thrones games.

1185
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
It should be good.

1186
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,400
I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books.

1187
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,880
I mean, at least he wrote the story for it and it's got characters that aren't, it's

1188
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:26,800
kind of like the, um, the enter, enter the matrix of the game of Thrones series.

1189
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,760
It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they kind of, they're probably

1190
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,120
going to cross into the series.

1191
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:40,920
So all right, well I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but I'm like a lot

1192
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
of things on this show tonight.

1193
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
It just doesn't want to work.

1194
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,400
So maybe we can go to Europe real fast.

1195
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,400
Well maybe we can.

1196
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,400
It's, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly.

1197
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,600
Um, on May 9th in the UK we have Datura, which I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes

1198
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,520
me think of all of the times I read clan of the cave bear cause that's what they called

1199
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,160
like this one urban, anyway.

1200
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,260
On the 11th we have Starhawk and Street Fighter cross Tekken for PC and then that's it for

1201
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,260
this week.

1202
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,600
I mean there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really

1203
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
it for this week.

1204
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Hey, great.

1205
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,320
I've got Japanese release dates for you, but remember that whole golden week we were talking

1206
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
about last week?

1207
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
It's over.

1208
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,080
Well it's over, but you can still kind of feel its impact on the release dates and you

1209
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,120
know a lot of the whole economical things that go into why there's no games coming out

1210
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:37,040
in the US right now are also playing out in Japan because on the Nintendo 3DS, nothing.

1211
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,200
Going to the Vita, nothing.

1212
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,840
How about on the Playstation 3?

1213
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,280
Starhawk is a release you have to look forward to this week.

1214
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,080
Starhawk comes out on May 10th in Japan, so there is that.

1215
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,880
And lastly going to the Wii or the 360, nothing on the Wii, but of course things on the Wii

1216
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,880
are dying down.

1217
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,080
Xbox 360 doesn't have anything this week either.

1218
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,320
El Shaddai next week, but, oh that's even an Encore edition, that's just a price reduction,

1219
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,760
but yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are.

1220
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,120
You get a chance to check that out in Japan.

1221
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,840
That's it for Japanese releases.

1222
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,520
Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1223
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,960
Alright.

1224
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:24,140
Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops and, you know, we talked about the

1225
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,120
rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that, apparently they were correct.

1226
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,360
I honestly thought it was called Eclipse, and actually it is technically called Eclipse.

1227
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,960
That was the internal name for the game, as I found out.

1228
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,800
So there's a little truth to that.

1229
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:47,280
But yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th, and of course on Playstation

1230
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,280
3, Xbox 360 PC confirmed.

1231
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something

1232
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
like that.

1233
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,480
But of course all that stuff will be announced later on.

1234
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,840
It looks pretty interesting.

1235
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:05,780
The game itself is actually going to be taking place in the future, you know, over the course

1236
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780
of a couple decades.

1237
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:12,080
It's actually going to take place partly in the 80s, and then it's going to jump all the

1238
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,240
way up through 2025.

1239
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:24,480
And kind of talking about some of this unmanned warfare stuff, a lot of the drones and that

1240
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
kind of stuff.

1241
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,040
So basically the enemy takes over that and starts attacking LA and the US, and it's up

1242
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,240
to real men, real soldiers on the ground to take out the enemies.

1243
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,120
And so a very interesting looking thing, some of the new stuff that they're going to be

1244
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:49,240
adding to the actual campaign of the game, including some branching missions and these

1245
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:57,040
new type of missions called strike force, where it's almost a little bit open world.

1246
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:03,160
I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff, where you kind of have a point A, point

1247
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,980
B, but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things.

1248
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,080
So that sounds kind of interesting, and then of course they're going to be adding the standard

1249
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,480
multiplayer stuff, and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as

1250
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,160
well.

1251
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,560
I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it.

1252
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,980
After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet.

1253
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,840
So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up, and actually it kind of makes

1254
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,200
me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing

1255
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,280
that as well.

1256
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,000
So you think that there's actually going to be money made off of sales of the old copy

1257
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
then, huh?

1258
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,120
Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game.

1259
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,240
And then of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 day 1 preorders were actually

1260
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:52,120
higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 preorders, so it's off to a good start.

1261
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,120
Sounds that way.

1262
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Hey, guess what guys?

1263
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,280
I have some great news.

1264
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,000
Guess who just called me?

1265
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Random.

1266
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Awesome.

1267
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,120
So, he said, he apologizes.

1268
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,520
This has happened to you, right?

1269
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,520
The phone died.

1270
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,720
So you had to go plug in, but we're going to get him on now.

1271
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,240
Thank you guys for being patient, and those of you that left, well, tough cookies.

1272
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,600
For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing, you need to hear Random or MegaRan

1273
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,040
right now.

1274
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,040
Hello?

1275
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,200
Hey, is this MegaRan?

1276
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,240
Yes, it is, how are you?

1277
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,240
What is up?

1278
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,560
It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, here with DarkSakura and Loki.

1279
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,560
How's it going?

1280
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,960
The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live.

1281
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,440
How you doing?

1282
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,680
Sorry, I'm good, I had an adventurous day, sorry I'm late, sorry.

1283
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
That is oka-

1284
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:48,400
My flight was delayed, and the phone died, and all types of other things, but I'm here.

1285
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,400
You could file that under, you know, Fashionable Superstar.

1286
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,760
Yeah, that is A-okay, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity, is when you're

1287
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,040
showing up fashionably late.

1288
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,680
These things happen, don't even worry about it, we're good, I'm just happy that you're

1289
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,680
here on the air.

1290
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,760
And hey, if you guys have a question for Random, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you

1291
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,640
can ask that question in chat right now, but while you guys get those questions out there,

1292
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,720
I got some questions for Random that I want to ask.

1293
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,760
Now Random, some of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio, you know, they might

1294
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,400
be gamers, but they might not know about you.

1295
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,560
So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated?

1296
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:40,440
Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all

1297
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,480
of those things together, you know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture

1298
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,120
and history, and I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty

1299
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,520
cool music.

1300
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:58,920
A lot of it is video game based, what I do is I like to use the traditional sounds from

1301
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,800
video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that,

1302
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:11,000
and then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game,

1303
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,800
sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes, and I put it all together

1304
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,280
and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Ran.

1305
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,420
That's awesome, and if you want to check out the music, of course you can visit Random

1306
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,600
or Mega Ran at his website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for

1307
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,760
download, and some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little

1308
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,360
bit, so free is awesome, thank you for providing that.

1309
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,360
So I have a question.

1310
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Free is always good.

1311
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,360
Questions, yeah?

1312
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,360
Yeah, Dark Sakura.

1313
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,360
What do you teach?

1314
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:51,040
Oh, I taught middle school, I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing, and history,

1315
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,160
social studies, stuff like that, to middle school kids.

1316
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,200
You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects, ever.

1317
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,600
I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend.

1318
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Oh my, totally.

1319
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:10,120
Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so, up until this past

1320
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,840
year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time, and there

1321
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,160
I am, so far I feel good.

1322
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,200
That sounds awesome.

1323
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,900
That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love, because Random, I gotta

1324
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,800
tell you, I'm a teacher too, I'm a different type of teacher, I'm a corporate trainer,

1325
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,920
so I teach people in my company, and that's my day job, but I've had this podcast with

1326
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,640
my buddies for ten years, and I'd love to be able to quit, as much as I love my day

1327
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,560
job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time, but you're doing it, you're

1328
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,440
living the dream, and that's awesome.

1329
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,280
Yeah, and I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do

1330
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,520
in teaching as well in music, so there's always lessons and things, I love history, I love

1331
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,000
poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff with my favorite books, I will talk

1332
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,600
about them and rap about them, so it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as

1333
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,440
well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it, I was already doing what I loved,

1334
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,200
it was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's

1335
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,200
all.

1336
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,680
What was the first video game that inspired you to take it to music?

1337
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,920
Was it Mega Man, or was there something else that maybe people don't know about?

1338
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:26,000
What was the first video game that inspired you, like, this game is so awesome, I've gotta,

1339
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,840
it really takes a special kind of game to take that extra step and make that fan creation

1340
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,680
for it, whether it be a podcast or a website or a rap song.

1341
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,680
What was the first for you?

1342
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,680
That's true.

1343
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:41,320
Oh, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that I first

1344
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,560
decided or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies

1345
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,560
2.

1346
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:53,560
Now, Goonies 2 had a really cool, it was a good game, it had a really cool soundtrack,

1347
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:00,440
and I had a Casio keyboard, and that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay

1348
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:10,000
on my keyboard, I still remember it, but I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard,

1349
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,320
and so not knowing, you know, when I'm, I don't know, 10, 11, 12 years old, that I was

1350
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:19,280
actually making what is now considered to be fan art, but it was just me playing it

1351
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,040
by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create.

1352
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,280
I didn't necessarily do anything with that, but that was the first time that I ever experienced

1353
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,200
a movie, not movie, but video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want

1354
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,080
to try to create my own version of it.

1355
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,880
Goonies 2 is an incredibly underrated 8-bit game, you know, looking back, and I am totally

1356
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,880
with you, that game had a lot more depth than a lot of people gave it credit for, especially

1357
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,280
for being a loose movie tie-in.

1358
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh yeah, I really loved that game, I had a huge plenty of hours of fun on that game.

1359
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,560
Let's talk about other games that have really inspired you music, now I know a lot of folks

1360
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,640
may know you through the Capcom stuff, you know, Splash Woman was huge for you, you had

1361
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,200
the Mega Ran 9, Mega Ran 10, but it's not just Capcom games, you have this Black Materia

1362
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,600
album that's out, you have a regular version, you have a remixed version, it's Final Fantasy

1363
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,840
7, which is kind of a polarizing game in the fan community.

1364
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,400
Some people love Final Fantasy 7, some people are sick of hearing about it.

1365
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,320
What is it about Final Fantasy 7 that moved you to dedicate two albums to it?

1366
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:30,900
Well, Final Fantasy 7 was a huge game for me, I was pretty much out of gaming when it

1367
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:36,800
came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school, I didn't have time

1368
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,800
for games anymore, I didn't have a system, until I watched one of my friends or suitemates

1369
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,880
play it, and I was completely hooked, I saw some of the summons and just watched about

1370
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:54,360
an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined roleplaying games to me, because

1371
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:00,840
the 3D aspect and the character development was just so awesome, so I wound up getting

1372
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,760
the Playstation almost flunking out of school playing this game, I mean, it's something

1373
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,600
that completely enveloped me, so it's a huge part of my childhood, so that's what made

1374
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,360
me go back, because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable

1375
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,720
to me, that it changed the game to me, that was my introduction, well kind of reintroduction

1376
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:30,040
to gaming, and so that was the game that got me back into console gaming, so I feel like

1377
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:35,440
I owe a lot to it, so I decided to do a little homage to it, called Black Materia, luckily

1378
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,440
a lot of people liked it, came out last year, and kind of took off a little bit, that might

1379
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:46,400
be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music, it's because the demand

1380
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,480
for it and for performances after that just became too much to handle with a full time

1381
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,560
job, so it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood.

1382
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,280
But you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the

1383
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,960
only one out there that has such, some memories tied to that game, I know that was a huge

1384
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,040
game for me in college, I probably failed a class or two because of Final Fantasy VII,

1385
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:18,760
but it was so worth it, which maybe I shouldn't be telling a teacher.

1386
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,760
Final Fantasy VII came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a Playstation, my

1387
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,160
roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a Playstation, I had a SNES, I was

1388
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:34,600
still playing Chrono Trigger, but I played the stew out of that and did time the nights

1389
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,320
of the round with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing, did go long enough for me to make a

1390
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,320
sandwich.

1391
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,320
Wow.

1392
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,320
It's true.

1393
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,240
Alright, let me ask, let me ask, we only have so much time with Random Tonight, I want to

1394
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,440
ask him about another game series, because this is one, this is a very recent addition

1395
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:59,920
to your website at Mayoran.com and I was, in a way I was not surprised at all to see

1396
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,920
this, I wasn't, I wasn't, Journey, a hip hop excursion, you were recently plugging this

1397
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,880
on your website, oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either,

1398
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,320
but the way you translated this into hip hop is something else, tell me more about the

1399
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,680
process of creating Journey, a hip hop excursion.

1400
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,600
Oh man, that was a lot of fun, I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched

1401
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:28,680
and moved by the Journey video game, I was told and emailed constantly about playing

1402
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,840
this game, but I just didn't have enough time, and people were like, you gotta play it, you

1403
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,040
gotta play it, you're gonna love it, and I'm like, yeah, that's all I need is another game,

1404
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:40,880
I have games here that are unopened, that I haven't been able to get to yet, but I don't

1405
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,440
have time, and they're like, no, that's the best thing about it, it's just, it's an hour

1406
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:50,280
long experience, you just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it, and so I did, I played

1407
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,760
it, and I was instantly inspired, I mean, it's a great game, it's so cool how they just

1408
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:02,040
created the entire scenario, I mean, there's no dialogue, you're basically creating your

1409
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:08,160
own story and synopsis, and it's just such an experience, I don't even know any other

1410
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:13,360
way to describe it except an experience, because it just kinda immerses you, so when I wound

1411
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:20,200
up playing the game through Think Twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack, and then

1412
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:25,240
I had a whole day, I think I was just, I was trying to raise funds with Kickstarter, and

1413
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,640
we had got to a really, a certain level, I think it was maybe 10,000, and usually when

1414
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:36,440
I get to round numbers, I try to give a, some sort of a surprise gift for the support, so

1415
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,760
as I was playing the journey soundtrack, I said, well, why don't I work on making some

1416
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:45,940
hip hop beats, so the entire day, I sat down, I use a program called Reason, so what I do

1417
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:50,400
is just take the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little

1418
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,240
bit, stretch them out, slow them down, go through them, add some drums, take out some

1419
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:01,960
things, you know, bring them back in later, and wound up creating some really cool beats

1420
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:07,920
with the very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel, and that was really what I wanted

1421
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,120
to create, so it came out pretty well, I really like it, I still listen to it a lot.

1422
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:17,720
It's great, and you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right?

1423
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,920
I saw that tweet on your website, it's awesome.

1424
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,360
Yeah, that was pretty cool, Austin Wintory actually listened to it, and told me he liked

1425
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,240
it, told me it was a great job, and I'm like, wow, that's pretty cool, I mean, you gotta

1426
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:34,720
love Twitter for that reason, just that everything is so accessible, everybody's one click away,

1427
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,820
and I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey

1428
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:45,720
remixes that they contacted him about it, like, hey Austin, have you heard this?

1429
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:50,680
And so that's kind of what made him respond, and so that was really cool, like, props from

1430
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,840
the man himself, you really can't beat that.

1431
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,560
And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing, because this whole interview

1432
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,380
tonight is being brought to you by Twitter, you know, we say we are the show where every

1433
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,800
gamer has a voice, and we went to Twitter, and we said, hey tweets, who do you want to

1434
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,800
see on the show?

1435
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,640
And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on, and here we are,

1436
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,640
here we are.

1437
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,120
Yes, I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen.

1438
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,120
That's right.

1439
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,520
Now, you brought up Kickstarter a minute ago, and I kind of wanted to go in that direction,

1440
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,460
because you know, Kickstarter's been a very big thing, it's been this buzzword in our

1441
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:32,360
community for, you know, a few months, and it's been big for you too, and I know you've

1442
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,640
done a couple projects on there, and this most recent one you did was called Language

1443
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,640
Arts.

1444
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,440
Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it, how did the

1445
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,040
community help you achieve your goals with Language Arts?

1446
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:49,280
Oh man, well, the community was just humongous, I don't, but we've done a Kickstarter in the

1447
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:56,560
past, like I said, we've done one for, actually two, we've been wanting to create vinyl for

1448
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,080
a Sam and Tom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album.

1449
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:08,120
Then we did another later for a, to play a show with London, at the London Anime Con,

1450
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:13,640
and both of those went decent, we got our goals, we didn't get necessarily way over

1451
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,240
the goal, but we did pretty well, and I decided to go back and try it again, it was one of

1452
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,440
those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy, everybody's doing it these

1453
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,440
days, like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now, video game companies

1454
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:35,080
are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now, and so I always

1455
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,160
told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea,

1456
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,680
so instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years,

1457
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:49,000
almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience, so instead of just an album,

1458
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,680
it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book.

1459
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:57,640
Now of course I can't do all that on my own without having artists and developers help

1460
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,760
me out, so I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out, so that then came

1461
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,720
Kickstarter, so I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere

1462
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:14,720
near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this, but I said we'll start small,

1463
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:27,640
and lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000, so a 516% completion rate,

1464
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,960
and just from the response has been overwhelming, I mean from Facebook, Twitter, to just the

1465
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:41,640
guys on my email list, I went out to PAX East and performed, and it was probably right before

1466
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,400
the Kickstarter really got underway, and I told a lot of people about it, and people

1467
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:50,600
were like hey I want to support, and sure enough they did, we had over 300 backers who

1468
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,200
are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comic,

1469
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,960
so I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level, and that's what hopefully

1470
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:06,240
this Kickstarter has allowed us to do, I think I want to do this in a whole new way, and

1471
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,600
this could be the album that kind of defined me, you know I've done a lot of Final Fantasy

1472
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,600
stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property, but

1473
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,240
I really want to create my own legacy, and I think this Language Arts project will do

1474
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,200
that when it's all done.

1475
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:28,200
I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal, and just kind of cool to have this comic

1476
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:35,080
book and video game and album that all tie together, yet it's not some movie franchise

1477
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,680
being turned into this, it's you, it's your story, that's awesome.

1478
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:45,640
That's what's cool about it, I wanted to make it based on my story, now granted the game

1479
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:51,520
and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and

1480
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:58,980
they are interweaving a bit, the album is much more realistic, I kind of take that hero

1481
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:05,400
and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy

1482
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:11,680
with some cool abilities, but he's for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around

1483
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:16,040
shooting beams out of his eyes, but in the game of course, you know to make things a

1484
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,680
lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it, and the comic as well.

1485
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:27,120
So if you're taking my story, and my own original story, and original characters that myself

1486
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:35,040
and the guys at J1 Studios created, and creating a universe around it, like almost a franchise,

1487
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,680
so it's really exciting.

1488
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:42,640
That is so awesome, looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at MegaRan.com,

1489
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,400
we'll have more information on that when it's out I'm sure.

1490
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,640
Random, I want to give, I know we're a little past our time here, hopefully I'm not keeping

1491
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,760
you from everything, from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1492
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,680
and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight.

1493
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,560
So Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners.

1494
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,280
All right, vognetwork.com, if you want to ask some questions in chat, let me get you

1495
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,920
an email question we got earlier in the week.

1496
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,820
This is from Will O, sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Random

1497
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:16,380
has a style that just seems effortless, and his sincerity bleeds through each track.

1498
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:20,720
He honestly seems to love what he's doing, and I just wanted to throw that out there

1499
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,400
that that's coming across, but here's the question, Random.

1500
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,480
Do you think it would be possible, do you think it would be possible to be doing what

1501
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,080
you're doing before the age of social media?

1502
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,640
How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create

1503
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
music or tour?

1504
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,160
So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could

1505
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,800
you do what you're doing without social media?

1506
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,400
Wow, I don't think so.

1507
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,280
No, I really don't.

1508
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:52,000
And this whole, the whole Mega Ran story started because of social media.

1509
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:59,320
I was contacted on MySpace in 2007 by Capcom, so if not for social media, I don't know

1510
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,960
if I'd be here, you know, so I do owe a lot to it, you know, I've been, yeah, I'm

1511
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:10,720
hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media, and I think it would make it to be

1512
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,920
a little more fun going, you know, out and doing the old school method, because I do

1513
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
that a lot.

1514
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,360
I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm

1515
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:26,480
not only, you know, all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or

1516
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:31,520
two times a week, you know, I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm

1517
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,040
out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people, so it's not just social media, but I feel

1518
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,760
like social media is a huge part of it, but like I said, I think my leg up comes from

1519
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:47,720
the fact that I'm out and about in the community, physically making appearances, as well as,

1520
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,200
you know, taking full advantage of social media.

1521
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,920
I think you're right on the money there, I think, you know, I may not be quite on the

1522
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,920
superstar level, but I think that that's really the key is you gotta interact, you

1523
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,400
know, not just online, but in person, the old school way, as well.

1524
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:07,120
M.C. Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, M.C. Lars, that he's always told me that

1525
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,620
you gotta get out and play, you know, you have to get out and play.

1526
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,800
Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you

1527
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,680
apart, so getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that.

1528
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:26,060
Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the vog, or excuse me, vognetwork.com,

1529
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,600
and I'm gonna go to a question from actdeft first, and I think this is a good question.

1530
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,840
I'll take this question to the next level.

1531
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,760
Who is Mega Ran's favorite video game music composer?

1532
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,400
Oh, man.

1533
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:49,480
I gotta say, I'm gonna go back a little bit, and I'm gonna say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro.

1534
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:56,920
He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island, and a lot

1535
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,940
of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite.

1536
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,940
You're officially my hero.

1537
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,940
He is the bomb.

1538
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,640
We know Yuzo very well.

1539
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,040
Mangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music, and of course, Actraiser.

1540
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:15,320
The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to L.A., just saying.

1541
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Yes.

1542
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,320
Oh, my God.

1543
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,320
It's amazing.

1544
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,320
Excellent.

1545
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,320
I'll be able to listen to that tonight.

1546
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,320
Excellent.

1547
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,320
Excellent.

1548
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:27,080
Let's go to another question from Brakeman, you know, because you're very well known for

1549
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,080
the Mega Man stuff.

1550
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:34,720
Brakeman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Man's favorite Mega Man theme?

1551
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:40,000
Well, I could go with the easy choice.

1552
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,440
There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves.

1553
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:48,360
So Mega Man 2, WALL-E Stage 1, everybody loves that.

1554
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,800
I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites.

1555
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,360
I love Wood Man's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2.

1556
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,080
The only one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is

1557
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,880
Bomb Man from Mega Man 1, and what else?

1558
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Crash Man.

1559
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,880
I love Crash Man.

1560
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,880
Crash Man is great.

1561
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:14,520
There's so many, and if you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never

1562
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,920
used them, or I've never intended to remake them.

1563
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,800
Crash Man, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it.

1564
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,720
You know, WALL-E Stage 1, same thing.

1565
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,800
Mega Man 3, Title Screen, same thing.

1566
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,200
It's just so great, as is.

1567
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,240
Proto Man's theme, another one I love.

1568
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:38,480
So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to touch those out of respect

1569
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,280
for how I feel about them.

1570
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:45,840
You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do them justice based on the Mega Man 9 album,

1571
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,480
but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from.

1572
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,880
I think that's great.

1573
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:54,360
Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I think I know where this guy's

1574
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:02,160
going with this name, but the name is I Far Ted, what a great name in chat, wants to know,

1575
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:08,360
is there any game that Mega Ran hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on?

1576
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
Oh.

1577
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:15,440
See, I'm afraid of questions like that, because I don't want to answer it, and then a couple

1578
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,440
things could happen.

1579
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:23,480
One, someone just takes it and does it, or two, I could never get to it, and people are

1580
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,280
like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned?

1581
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:32,120
But I will say, I have two that my eyes are on.

1582
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:41,960
The Metal Gear Solid series, and Legend of Zelda, particularly A Link to the Past, so

1583
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,680
those are what my eyes are on right now.

1584
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,800
But the next plan, though, for next year is, myself and K-Murdock, we're doing an all Sega

1585
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:56,840
album called Sega State or Sega City, and it's going to be all Sega, so from Master

1586
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:04,280
System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast, it's going to be all Sega all the time, that'll

1587
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,280
be our next one.

1588
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,760
But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do, but story-wise, that's just such

1589
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:16,360
a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that, you know, it would still

1590
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,600
be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII, which is something

1591
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,760
that took like a year to make, so.

1592
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,360
You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that, Gio Vedeo screaming, yes, Metal

1593
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,440
Gear, do it, so there you go.

1594
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,720
Now we're way over time here, and I want to get to Megurand's song here, but quickly,

1595
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,720
one last question from Dark Soccer.

1596
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,680
I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line.

1597
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,520
Oh, okay, I've taken requests before.

1598
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:50,920
Well, the official game of Orange Bound Radio is the Guardian Legend.

1599
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,360
So could we hope to have you tackle that someday?

1600
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,280
You know what, I really, you know what, I did, I did a Guardian Legend track.

1601
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,280
Really?

1602
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,840
Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song, okay, there's a song called

1603
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:13,760
Comtact, C-O-N dash tact, and it's all about com etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legends.

1604
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,760
Awesome.

1605
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,760
Okay.

1606
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,520
It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to times, what you should and shouldn't

1607
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,520
do.

1608
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
It's very useful.

1609
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,920
Is that, the Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed

1610
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,520
by Fantasy Zone.

1611
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
All right.

1612
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,280
Oh my God, those are some great games, like, I love Guardian Legends.

1613
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,160
So you were on the top of my hero list now.

1614
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, look, we got random way past time here, and you know, we got off to a late start tonight,

1615
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,160
but Random, you know, I want to really thank you for taking the time out to come on Orange

1616
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,120
Lounge Radio tonight and talk about your music.

1617
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,840
Again, if people want to know more about your music, they can check you out at Megaran.com,

1618
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,440
and you can also get the music at MegaranMusic.com.

1619
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:01,320
Random, is there anything else you want to plug here on the show, before we get to the

1620
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,320
song?

1621
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,920
Well, let's see, anything I want to plug, I don't know, follow me on Twitter, at Megaran,

1622
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:15,600
there's Megaran music on Facebook, I don't know, thanks for the support, keep listening.

1623
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,960
The Language Arts album will be out for everybody May 22nd, so mark that on your calendar, and

1624
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,240
yeah, I'll see you out in the funny papers.

1625
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,240
All right.

1626
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:29,720
Random, thanks again so much for taking the time out, and best of luck with everything

1627
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,720
in the future, all right?

1628
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:31,720
Oh, thank you, man.

1629
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,720
All right, take care, buddy.

1630
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:39,000
Hey, we're going to close out here with a track from Megaran, and this is actually a

1631
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,360
really special deal here.

1632
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,920
This is actually a duet that he did with MC Frontalot, which is pretty awesome.

1633
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:54,440
You can check this out at MegaranMusic.com, it's Random and MC Frontalot with Wake Up

1634
01:25:54,440 --> 01:26:10,760
here on Orange Lounge Radio, check this out.

1635
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:29,680
All right, I can do this, where are my glasses, come on, come on, I got to get out of here,

1636
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,680
let me get out, here we go.

1637
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:50,160
I got to get this, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1638
01:26:50,160 --> 01:27:01,660
Here we go.

1639
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:07,660
It's not all good, but I got my blessings, ma'am There's a lot to find a job, but a long

1640
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,660
one you wanna do I had a daily double and came up on two

1641
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,660
Three if you count, a loyal significant other This didn't seem half as hard when I lived

1642
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,660
with my mother But I got tired of hearing it go on and get

1643
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,660
serious Now I be flowing like regular periods

1644
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:24,660
Growing as a theorist since my years in this And I learned so much, so I think it's time

1645
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,660
to grow up Packin' my lunch Doritos and cold cuts

1646
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,660
One more pay cut and I'm gone Time to wake up

1647
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:35,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1648
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:40,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

1649
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:45,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1650
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:50,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

1651
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,660
No snooze, you wanted to be a rapper Now you got what you were after, wouldn't

1652
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,660
rather Well you know you have to grab the mic

1653
01:27:56,660 --> 01:28:00,660
And make noises into it You and the beat get intimate

1654
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,660
Send a report to the syndicate Indicating that you'll have a trap pretty soon

1655
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,660
I'm in threads, incredulous at replies Swoon, win, win, then alarm, alarm

1656
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:10,660
Oh no, I slipped into a dream Didn't get the rhyme written

1657
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,660
The rig is in to quip And there's sound check in an hour

1658
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:16,660
You know how you sometimes meet a nerd rapper Who hasn't showered

1659
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,660
That was probably me, beg your forgiveness It's only through your largess

1660
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:23,660
I'm even about to live this dream out So when I'm cussin' about my whack boss

1661
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:27,660
Old man front runnin' his sweatshop Take a sad pause, share the long tear

1662
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:31,660
Then remind, that every day I wake up There's an aid on, kindly

1663
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:36,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1664
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:41,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

1665
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:46,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1666
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:51,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

1667
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:56,660
Wake up, don't tell me it's time to wake up Snoring like a bulldozer, going like the brakes cut

1668
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:01,660
Eye boogers are starting to cake up 6.30 sharp, I gots to pick the pace up

1669
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:04,660
Get my face up off of the pillow And ain't much time for a meal

1670
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:08,660
So I grab the cake up French roast and get ghost and take lunch

1671
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:14,660
If I'm late once more, I'm gone, case shut Netflix was on, shutting the stage up

1672
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:19,660
Last night, watch Jimmy tear the stage up Hop the train, just missed the late bus

1673
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:24,660
Get a taxi, he taxed me 28 bucks Running late but maybe I can make up time

1674
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:29,660
Stay after hours and face up to the music No excuses, straight up

1675
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:34,660
I mean I came to work, what else did they want? Head straight up the hall to A1

1676
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:39,660
My secretary always had something to say but This time what she said left me straight crushed

1677
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:42,660
You do know it's Saturday right? Say what?

1678
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:47,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1679
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:52,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb

1680
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:57,660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

1681
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:19,660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb

1682
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,660
Some people shower before bed, hello? You'll have that con funk that he talks about

1683
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:40,660
Con funk, well he's already said hi on Facebook, not on Facebook, on Twitter

1684
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:43,660
Totally follow him on Twitter, he's really cool

1685
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:47,660
I wanna know, why did he tweet Anime Jam Session? He went on Anime Jam Session

1686
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:51,660
Nah, it's all good, Rama was helping me screen the questions actually so he does get props

1687
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:57,660
Listen to Anime Jam Session, this is a good show And I don't know how I missed the Guardian Legend one

1688
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:01,660
He's got a lot, he's got a lot

1689
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:06,660
That is going to be on my iPhone soon

1690
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:10,660
Alright well if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music

1691
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:13,660
That particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free

1692
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:16,660
MegaRanMusic.com, go get it, MegaRanMusic.com

1693
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:23,660
And thanks again, right on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it, right on to the management for setting that up

1694
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,660
And for Random for appearing on our show tonight

1695
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:33,660
And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan Language Arts video game and comic project Kickstarter

1696
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:39,660
We will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD

1697
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:43,660
As well as a signed comic to a lucky listener

1698
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,660
Look at you

1699
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:48,660
I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes by the way

1700
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:55,660
Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while but for those of you that are sticking around

1701
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:59,660
I knew some people would just be here to listen to MegaRan and then hit the road

1702
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:01,660
Which I understand, it's all good

1703
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:07,660
But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B

1704
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,660
So just stay tuned, I'll get into that in a little bit

1705
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,660
It's not as good as what Loki just talked about but it's still pretty cool

1706
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Alright, we got to get back into some news

1707
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,660
We're running late now but that's alright, it was worth the wait

1708
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,660
I don't remember how much of the Black Ops story we tackled

1709
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,660
We were done with the Black Ops

1710
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:23,660
We were done with the Black Ops story

1711
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:27,660
Alright, so let's move on to one more story and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week here

1712
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,660
This has to do with streaming service Gaikai

1713
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:34,660
You might have heard of this, they're the ones that I believe were streaming the stuff on YouTube and some other places

1714
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,660
They're kind of that competitor for OnLive of sorts

1715
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:42,660
Well Gaikai is getting together with Wikipad to make a game streaming tablet

1716
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:48,660
It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console quality gamepad controller

1717
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,660
There's pictures of this on the internet

1718
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:56,660
Just imagine the most giant stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life

1719
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,660
Where you slammed an iPad in the middle

1720
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,660
That's what this thing looks like

1721
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:04,660
Honestly it looks a lot better than the one that Razor was looking at making

1722
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:09,660
Yeah, yeah, so now apparently Wikipad isn't super popular yet

1723
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,660
They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show

1724
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,660
But they've already gone through some changes with it

1725
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:17,660
It's got a 10.1 inch screen and a quad core processor now

1726
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,660
Optional 3G for mobile

1727
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,660
But here's the other thing, it ain't out yet

1728
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:23,660
So it's one of those things that is coming soon

1729
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,660
Gaikai is out there though if you want to check that out

1730
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:29,660
And it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it

1731
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,660
That's pretty big for a portable system

1732
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,660
But I'd say if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere

1733
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,660
Yeah, and people carry tablets too

1734
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,660
And it's streaming gaming

1735
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,660
So if you think about it, you're able to play console type games

1736
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,660
Because the same stuff that OnLive is doing

1737
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:48,660
Like Saints Row the Third or something of that quality

1738
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,660
Through this pad

1739
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:55,660
And the controls look pretty similar to a current gen console

1740
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,660
So I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that

1741
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,660
I'd rather have an iCade than an iPad

1742
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,660
Just saying

1743
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:03,660
Well isn't an iCade a device for an iPad?

1744
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,660
Yeah

1745
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:07,660
I'd rather have that, I'm fine with it

1746
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,660
Or MAME on an Android, I mean what's the difference really

1747
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:13,660
Well look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler

1748
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:17,660
We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags

1749
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:21,660
No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges

1750
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,660
Hooked up to either a modem or your cable

1751
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,660
A portable console

1752
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,660
We didn't even have that over here

1753
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,660
We had a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter

1754
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,660
And plugging your Nintendo into it

1755
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,660
Which some guy we knew had in his car

1756
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,660
A Playstation in the car

1757
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:39,660
We did that in middle school with a camp TV

1758
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:41,660
That ran on D cells

1759
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,660
We're going to go to a classic time

1760
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:45,660
When things were a lot simpler

1761
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:49,660
And take a look at the classic game of the week

1762
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,660
Dark Soccer is going to dip into the video game vault

1763
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,660
And find a game that she thinks

1764
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:55,660
Hey, you kids ought to be playing this video game

1765
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:57,660
You know, Random got the jump on you though

1766
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:59,660
With the Goonies 2 nostalgia

1767
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,660
But this one's pretty good too

1768
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,660
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1769
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,660
A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers

1770
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,660
And I'm not going to spoil why

1771
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,660
Galaga!

1772
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,660
Yes, Galaga

1773
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,660
Also known in Japan as Gyaraga

1774
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,660
Which is...

1775
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,660
Freaking intro music

1776
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:21,660
Pew! Pew pew pew!

1777
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,660
It's the game of pew pew is what it is

1778
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:29,660
Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan

1779
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,660
And published by Midway in North America in 1981

1780
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:35,660
It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979

1781
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,660
Why I didn't do Galaxian?

1782
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:39,660
I don't know, I wanted to do Galaga

1783
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:41,660
So whatever

1784
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:45,660
Anyway, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen

1785
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,660
You go back and forth

1786
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,660
You don't get to go up or fly around

1787
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,660
It's a simple, fixed shooter

1788
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:55,660
And the enemies fly at you in formation

1789
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:59,660
And you have to pew pew them all before they pew pew you

1790
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,660
And once they're all vanquished

1791
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,660
Then you move on to the next stage

1792
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,660
Yahoo! Alright

1793
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:09,660
Galaga was pretty, pretty popular

1794
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,660
As I'm sure you all know

1795
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,660
So we have many different sequels to Galaga

1796
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:15,660
And many versions of Galaga

1797
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,660
At any rate, Galaga for me was just the coolest

1798
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:29,660
You could let your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing

1799
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:33,660
And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode

1800
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:35,660
Which was always super cool

1801
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:41,660
It also had a few features that improved over Galaxian

1802
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,660
Like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time

1803
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,660
Your hit miss ratio, and the challenging stage

1804
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:52,660
And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus

1805
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:57,660
And like I said, you also could get captured

1806
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:02,660
It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up

1807
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,660
You could shoot it and get it down

1808
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:10,660
And then there are actually full on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured

1809
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,660
That's how a lot of people play

1810
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:19,660
It also had a bug that was called, actually the bug would make your attackers stop firing bullets

1811
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,660
It was actually a coding error

1812
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:25,660
I just want to say the double, the whole two ships tied together thing

1813
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,660
That's like the only way I can be decent at this game

1814
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:30,660
I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can

1815
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,660
Like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion

1816
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,660
Well a lot of people based their strategy around it

1817
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:41,660
Like I said, there's also a split screen bug that was like Impact Man

1818
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:44,660
It's not quite the same thing

1819
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:47,660
It's similar to the split screen bug in Impact Man

1820
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:51,660
Where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0

1821
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,660
And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine

1822
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,660
It could cause the game to stall

1823
01:37:56,660 --> 01:38:00,660
And it means it has to be either reset or power cycled so that you can start a new game

1824
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:04,660
So in the series of Galaxian

1825
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,660
And I'm going to start with Galaxian

1826
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:16,660
You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig

1827
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:23,660
Galaga Legion in 2008, Galaga Legion DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011

1828
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:28,660
Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave and Busters in Milpitas

1829
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:34,660
They used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set

1830
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:37,660
Which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in

1831
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,660
With the 3 screens, now it's like some

1832
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,660
I don't think I ever saw that, but that sounds amazing

1833
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,660
The thing is still there

1834
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:44,660
Wow

1835
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,660
But the game is in it, they put another one

1836
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,660
When you go back to the far back where they have the giant crane

1837
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:54,660
And the thing that's to the left of it that you walk inside

1838
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,660
That was the Galaxian machine

1839
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,660
So, just saying

1840
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:02,660
As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out

1841
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:07,660
There's been the Atari 7800, the Famicon version, Game Boy

1842
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:10,660
And also it was bundled with Galaxian

1843
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:14,660
There was a GameTap, MSX, the MSX version is actually really good

1844
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:18,660
Of course NES because the high we had a Famicon version

1845
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,660
The Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 color computer

1846
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:24,660
Which I played Galagon on it

1847
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,660
That was the game, it was a clone called Galagon

1848
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,660
And I played Stu out of this

1849
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:32,660
Because my friend had one of these things

1850
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:35,660
It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version

1851
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,660
Xbox Live Arcade

1852
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:41,660
IOS is the Galaga Remix which had the original on it

1853
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:44,660
Nintendo 3DS which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions

1854
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,660
And Roku

1855
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:50,660
There has also been several versions of Namco Museum

1856
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,660
Which are really way too many

1857
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:57,660
We have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance

1858
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:00,660
And Windows, there were two versions of each

1859
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:04,660
PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

1860
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:08,660
And the Wii, which I have most of those

1861
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:12,660
Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3

1862
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,660
Is the game with the OLR cameo

1863
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,660
Which makes it double awesome

1864
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,660
That is the double awesome version, of course I had to

1865
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,660
You gotta get that one out there

1866
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,660
Jeez Rob

1867
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:27,660
There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version

1868
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:29,660
Of Tekken in 1995

1869
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,660
You could play it as it loaded

1870
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:35,660
In Point Blake 2 there were Galaga Challenge Stages

1871
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:39,660
In the 20 year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit

1872
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:42,660
That had Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga

1873
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,660
There was that

1874
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:48,660
The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too

1875
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:52,660
It was even available on Palm Devices and Pocket PC

1876
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,660
So Galaga really has an amazing legacy

1877
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,660
Hold on

1878
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,660
Sorry, my allergies are flaring up everybody

1879
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,660
You alright over there?

1880
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,660
That's why I sound like a 12 year old boy

1881
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:07,660
At any rate, there were remakes

1882
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,660
There was Galaga Arrangement

1883
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:12,660
Which was part of the Namco Museum compilation

1884
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,660
Galaga Destination Earth, it came out in 1998 for Windows

1885
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,660
PlayStation and the Game Boy Color

1886
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:22,660
Galaga Remakes came out in 2007 for the Wii

1887
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,660
And you use your Wii remote as a gun

1888
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:30,660
And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space

1889
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:33,660
The video ran out so we have to hear that opening theme one more time

1890
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:49,660
There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, Galaga 88

1891
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:52,660
Were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app

1892
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:54,660
Called the Galaga 30th Anniversary

1893
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,660
That was done by Noki Bandai

1894
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:59,660
Basically the app had Galaxian as a free game

1895
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:03,660
And then they had to pay for a complete set for 8 bucks

1896
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,660
But it had Galaga points

1897
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:09,660
So you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs

1898
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,660
Including the original art

1899
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,660
Their world record for Galaga

1900
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,660
Now keep in mind, this is twin galaxy stuff

1901
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:20,660
It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krogman of Boca Raton

1902
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:21,660
Florida

1903
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:24,660
And the rapid fire setting

1904
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:27,660
And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida

1905
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:31,660
And it was also in this class of 81

1906
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:33,660
Fast shot world record settings

1907
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:37,660
Were both by John Krenkel of Battle Creek, Michigan

1908
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:42,660
And I remember actually seeing some of the people who had the earlier ones

1909
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,660
In King Fong

1910
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,660
They had people just playing

1911
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,660
The high score people gathered back together

1912
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:52,660
When what's his face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score

1913
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:57,660
Galaga, actually

1914
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:01,660
There was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM

1915
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,660
For him to practice for war games

1916
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:09,660
Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game

1917
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:15,660
And basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions

1918
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:21,660
There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game

1919
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:24,660
I have the Pac-Man one of those, just saying

1920
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:29,660
And because the place I'm reading is not updated since

1921
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:33,660
Galaga made an appearance in the Avengers

1922
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:36,660
Just saying

1923
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,660
But you'll say no more

1924
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,660
But I'll say no more

1925
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,660
Cause that guy over there is playing Galaga

1926
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,660
He didn't think I'd notice, but I did

1927
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:44,660
Alright, is that it?

1928
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,660
That's the quote

1929
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:47,660
Classic game of the week

1930
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:52,660
Galaga, available everywhere, but most notably the arcade

1931
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,660
Because shield helicarriers have joysticks, just saying

1932
01:43:55,660 --> 01:44:01,660
But we would prefer that you play the arcade version or the Playstation Network version that has the OLR cameo

1933
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:02,660
Yes

1934
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:03,660
So that's important too

1935
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:06,660
Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize

1936
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,660
A no prize, my favorite kind of prize

1937
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,660
Alright, we're running way long for part A

1938
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,660
I wonder why, perhaps the longer we

1939
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:15,660
No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki, I'm allergic to California

1940
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:16,660
It was worth it

1941
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,660
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys

1942
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:22,660
We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

1943
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,660
Don't go anywhere, we got more coming up in part B

1944
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:33,660
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

1945
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:37,660
Live on the VOG Network, voice of Geeks Network on this

1946
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:39,660
May the 6th of 2012

1947
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:43,660
We are live with the 456th episode of our show

1948
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,660
You guys missed a fun part A

1949
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,660
Little worried there at the beginning

1950
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:50,660
Little worried there when things were delayed with our interview

1951
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,660
But it was well worth the wait

1952
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:55,660
Random aka Megaran telling us a lot about inspiration

1953
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:59,660
We just kind of geeked out with him a little bit about old games that are awesome

1954
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,660
And that's the best kind of interview

1955
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:02,660
I want the Sega album

1956
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,660
I know right, sounds awesome

1957
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,660
I've got sonic boobs today ok

1958
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:10,660
We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show

1959
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,660
But you're wearing this shirt

1960
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,660
I paid $10 for it

1961
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:20,660
It's a Sonic shirt and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is

1962
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:21,660
Yeah

1963
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,660
So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies but

1964
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,660
Can't help it, triple D, hi

1965
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,660
Picks or it didn't happen

1966
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,660
I put picks up

1967
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,660
On Orange Lounge Radio.com? Oh awesome, alright there you go

1968
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:35,660
And the other can of Vimto that I drink

1969
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,660
This is pretty, I've never had Vimto before

1970
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:39,660
Which our European listeners should know of

1971
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:42,660
I've never had Vimto before but I'm having a Vimto light and it's really good

1972
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,660
I've never had Vimto light before, I like the regular soda

1973
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:48,660
It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one

1974
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,660
It's just with sugar

1975
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:53,660
It tastes a little bit like Hansen's black cherry, a little bit

1976
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,660
It's black currant and raspberry soda

1977
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,660
Ok I can see that

1978
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:00,660
But I like the regular Vimto, I always drink it at a touch of Britain

1979
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:04,660
And when I went to the Iraqi Deli today to get some shawarma

1980
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,660
Because shawarma, there's a good place two bucks down

1981
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,660
Which you won't get yet

1982
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:14,660
I went and got, I saw they had Vimto light

1983
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,660
So I bought a couple of cans of it

1984
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,660
And it is pretty delicious

1985
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,660
Although I have to say I do prefer the regular Vimto

1986
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,660
It's not bad, I drink that

1987
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:24,660
It's good stuff, alright anyway

1988
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:25,660
Babylon Market

1989
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,660
By the way we do have somebody staying up late

1990
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,660
Listening to us all the way from the UK

1991
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,660
Pekor Uno is with us saying I don't like Vimto

1992
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:33,660
I prefer Robina, I don't know that word

1993
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,660
Robina is not bad

1994
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:40,660
But I tried, it's this, I like

1995
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:44,660
Tizer, I think is what it's called, T-I-Z-E-R

1996
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:48,660
I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good

1997
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:51,660
Like a grapefruit soda, it's pretty good

1998
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:55,660
Alrighty, you said you got that shirt at Kmart

1999
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,660
I want to get that out too

2000
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,660
Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock

2001
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,660
By the Genesis ad it's coming

2002
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,660
You know Genesis does what Nintendon't

2003
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:08,660
But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart

2004
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:11,660
Is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood

2005
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,660
And Shermy needed stuff to pee on

2006
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,660
So I got Shermy stuff to pee on

2007
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:18,660
And I needed Sudafed

2008
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,660
As you can all tell by my 12 year old boy puberty voice

2009
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:26,660
So, just saying

2010
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:32,660
So Kmart have that many copies of In the Groove there, huh?

2011
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,660
They had a Mario shirt that I wanted

2012
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,660
Alright

2013
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:39,660
But when I saw Sonic, had to get it

2014
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,660
The Sega fangirl and you had a squee

2015
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:44,660
Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news

2016
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,660
A few quick news stories for you guys

2017
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:51,660
So Saints Row the Third, of course they had this April Fools joke

2018
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:55,660
Testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing

2019
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:00,660
Where it was Saints Row the Third enter the dominatrix

2020
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:03,660
And everyone's like, wow that would be pretty cool

2021
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,660
And so they're like, ah we fooled you

2022
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,660
Because it's real and it's coming out

2023
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:11,660
So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole

2024
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:14,660
I don't know, copycat of

2025
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:17,660
You know, Rockstar Games route

2026
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:21,660
Where they're releasing this episode

2027
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:24,660
Kind of expansion thing that's playable on its own

2028
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,660
So this actual game will be coming out

2029
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:30,660
The enter the dominatrix as a standalone expansion pack

2030
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:34,660
It's a physical disc, it'll cost you 30 bucks

2031
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:37,660
On PS3 and 360 and probably PC as well

2032
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:41,660
It's going to give you, they're going to have like

2033
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:43,660
Superpowers in there and stuff

2034
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:46,660
Even though technically those were in the last expansion

2035
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:49,660
But they only locked them to a certain mission on there

2036
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:53,660
Which everyone was like, why the fuck did you lock these onto a certain mission

2037
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,660
Instead of just allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want

2038
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:00,660
Because I mean it is after Saints Row and it's not really realistic anyways

2039
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:05,660
And apparently the whole premise of enter the dominatrix

2040
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:09,660
Which is, other than being a complete ripoff of the Matrix

2041
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,660
Because you know that's current

2042
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:16,660
And so basically the Saints leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord

2043
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:20,660
Named Zinyak and his benevolent race

2044
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:26,660
And apparently they're trying to grab up all resources or something

2045
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:31,660
And also I guess there's some character named Paul

2046
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:34,660
Who's supposed to play some role in there

2047
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:35,660
Hey Paul

2048
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:36,660
You rock Paul

2049
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,660
And I don't know

2050
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,660
Stay awesome Paul, it's all for you

2051
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:42,660
It's all about Paul

2052
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,660
I'm a huge Paul fan

2053
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:47,660
Paul, I live for Paul in Saints Row the Third

2054
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,660
Who the fuck is Paul

2055
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,660
I don't know who the fuck Paul is

2056
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:51,660
Honestly

2057
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,660
That was a movie

2058
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
Well I know Paul was a movie

2059
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:59,660
And that was probably funny

2060
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:03,660
But it's just this whole Saints Row the dominatrix thing

2061
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:09,660
It's neat and the whole thing it's supposed to be this virtual reality thing

2062
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,660
So it's going to be similar to the Deckers missions almost

2063
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:17,660
But at the same time I'm like, dude your DLC sucked so fucking bad

2064
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:24,660
Do I really want to play this $30 expansion of shit that should have probably been unlocked anyways

2065
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,660
With a DLC that I didn't buy because it was so shitty

2066
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:31,660
It's like at the rate it's going right now

2067
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:38,660
$7 DLC each was about an hour and a half worth of content

2068
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,660
What is this game?

2069
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:42,660
It would be like two hours long, an hour and 45 minutes

2070
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,660
I mean I just

2071
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:46,660
I don't know

2072
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:51,660
I mean I kind of wish it was good but I'm just on the fence

2073
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,660
I don't know

2074
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,660
So we'll see it's coming out this fall

2075
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:57,660
Maybe I'll pick it up because there's nothing else coming out

2076
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,660
But I'm going to wait for reviews

2077
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:02,660
This is not a day one thing for me for sure

2078
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:05,660
Burned once, that was enough

2079
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:08,660
So Adidas, my coach

2080
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:11,660
Was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ

2081
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:17,660
Also maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion on the Saints Row because they're in a little financial trouble

2082
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:22,660
Well apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time

2083
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:28,660
So now my coach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games

2084
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:31,660
They have taken over the publishing rights for it

2085
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:36,660
So it'll be launching this summer apparently

2086
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,660
So I'll have to check that out

2087
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,660
Maybe

2088
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:41,660
I'm sure you have it on pre-order

2089
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,660
Oh yeah, you know me and exercise

2090
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:47,660
And last but not least, a game I actually took up a lot of my time this week

2091
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,660
Perfect Strangers

2092
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:52,660
It was an advert game

2093
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:58,660
I mean it says right on the bottom the guy responsible for this actually does advert games for a bunch of different things

2094
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,660
And he's done some pretty good stuff

2095
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:02,660
You know what, it was a well fucking done advert game

2096
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:03,660
It was excellent

2097
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:07,660
And I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out

2098
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:13,660
And of course it's advertising the release I guess of the episodes on iTunes

2099
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,660
Which hey, it worked

2100
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:18,660
It was unaware that the episodes were even out there on iTunes

2101
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:22,660
I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game

2102
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,660
Oh I never forget that show

2103
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,660
But yes, it's a pretty fun game

2104
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:28,660
Definitely worth checking out

2105
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:33,660
If you want to check out the game which is entitled Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now

2106
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:39,660
Which happens to be the theme song of the series and is actually what you play through

2107
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:43,660
Just go to Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now dot com

2108
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:47,660
And check it out, it's a great time

2109
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,660
Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?

2110
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,660
You know I watched some clips of him the other day

2111
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,660
One kind of was asking myself the same question

2112
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:58,660
I know he was in Langoliers and he got mauled at some point

2113
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,660
I don't really know

2114
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:04,660
The last thing I probably saw him was Beverly Hills Cop 3

2115
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:07,660
And Mark Lynn Baker, whatever else did he do?

2116
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:12,660
Other than being like a dead on ringer for the critic

2117
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:14,660
I don't know

2118
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,660
Let's just, let's just bask in the

2119
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,660
Did you ever see Second Sight?

2120
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,660
Let's bask in the awesomeness for a minute

2121
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:31,660
Sometimes the world looks perfect

2122
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:34,660
Nothing to rearrange

2123
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:35,660
I feel inspired

2124
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,660
The Mustang!

2125
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,660
I forgot he drove a Mustang

2126
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:43,660
Look at that, we just gave these guys a free commercial

2127
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,660
But it was pretty fucking awesome

2128
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:47,660
I did see Second Sight, Rob

2129
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,660
That movie was funny

2130
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,660
Because he was addicted to goobers

2131
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:53,660
Alright, let me get some stories for you guys

2132
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,660
But first, a PSA from our chatroom at vognetwork.com

2133
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,660
Pete Garudo is telling us all

2134
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,660
You Don't Know Jack on Facebook is now open to all

2135
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:03,660
I know what I'm doing after the show tonight

2136
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:05,660
Shane, I gotta cancel Mass Effect multiplayer

2137
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:07,660
You Don't Know Jack is on Facebook now

2138
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:09,660
I don't even know if he's listening

2139
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:12,660
Alright, let's get to some other quick news here

2140
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:14,660
Family Guy

2141
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,660
I don't know if they've done a lot of games for Family Guy

2142
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,660
I can't remember if there's been any others

2143
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,660
One, and it was not good

2144
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:22,660
That's right, that was the year they had Adam West at E3

2145
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,660
It wasn't good

2146
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:27,660
It wasn't good and they did an IOS game and it wasn't very good either

2147
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,660
Well maybe this will redeem it

2148
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,660
But we'll see

2149
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:34,660
September 25th, Family Guy Back to the Multiverse

2150
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,660
PlayStation 3 and 360

2151
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:39,660
According to some Amazon stuff that leaked earlier today

2152
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:41,660
And even earlier on our Twitter

2153
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:46,660
Wink Wink, Activision is involved, I bet this will be an E3 showing

2154
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,660
Uh, probably

2155
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,660
And now, see I actually had to look it up

2156
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,660
Because I haven't watched Family Guy in a few years

2157
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,660
Mainly because I do this show

2158
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:56,660
It happens to be on the same time

2159
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:58,660
And also because it's not being funny after a while

2160
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:01,660
But, you know, I'll give it a chance again

2161
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:03,660
Don't remind the listeners that Family Guy is on

2162
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,660
It's not funny, that's what I was trying to say

2163
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:07,660
You're not missing anything

2164
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,660
So, um, I had to look at what the Multiverse thing was

2165
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,660
And I guess it was one of these episodes that they did

2166
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:13,660
Where it's like, oh hey, we're in real, you know

2167
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:15,660
Real life Family Guy

2168
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:17,660
It's kind of like one of those episodes

2169
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:19,660
Like, what if, blah blah blah

2170
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:21,660
You know, it's

2171
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:23,660
So that's what that is, I don't know

2172
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,660
Hopefully it'll be as good as the Simpsons game

2173
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:27,660
I mean, that was pretty good

2174
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,660
That's true, that's true

2175
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:31,660
Alright, also, if Family Guy isn't your kind of cartoon

2176
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,660
Maybe you're a little more old school

2177
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,660
Maybe you'll be excited about this

2178
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:37,660
The worlds of Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo

2179
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:39,660
Are lighting in a free to play

2180
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:41,660
Online game

2181
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,660
Cartoon Universe

2182
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:45,660
It's a browser based online adventure

2183
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:47,660
You could say it's for kids

2184
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:49,660
But you know there's going to be some adults to check this out too

2185
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:51,660
It's coming from WB Games Montreal

2186
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,660
Cartoon Universe

2187
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,660
It is kid friendly

2188
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:57,660
It's Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo

2189
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:59,660
You make your own toon avatar

2190
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:01,660
You play puzzles and mini games

2191
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,660
Meet new friends

2192
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:05,660
And experience the joy of exploring a place

2193
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,660
So, very cool

2194
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,660
There's supposed to be popular characters

2195
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,660
From both the franchises in there

2196
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,660
But no playable version of this

2197
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,660
Yet, I guess there's a beta

2198
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,660
I'm sorry, there is a beta version I guess that's out there

2199
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:19,660
But I think it's really bugged

2200
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:21,660
From what the early reports are saying

2201
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:23,660
But it is a beta

2202
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:25,660
But you can check that out

2203
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:27,660
cartoonuniverse.com

2204
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,660
NA for North America

2205
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:31,660
Pink Textures

2206
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:33,660
It looks cute, but

2207
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:35,660
I'm going to play MMO, I'm going to play Star Trek

2208
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:37,660
Or DC Universe or something

2209
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:39,660
Lastly, for those of you guys

2210
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,660
That aren't cool enough to go to E3 anymore

2211
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:43,660
Like, you know, us

2212
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,660
At least you can feel like

2213
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,660
You're there by sitting on the couch

2214
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:49,660
With your bon-bons and your popcorn

2215
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,660
Which you can't even have if you actually go to the real thing

2216
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:53,660
Because they don't allow that stuff in these

2217
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:55,660
Conference centers

2218
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:57,660
And watch the E3 Presser on

2219
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,660
Xbox Live or Spike TV

2220
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:01,660
The Microsoft

2221
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:03,660
Press Conference will be live

2222
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,660
On Xbox Live and Spike TV

2223
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:07,660
I will be spending

2224
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:09,660
My time doing what I normally do

2225
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:11,660
During these press conferences, which is kicking back

2226
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,660
In the conference room at work

2227
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:15,660
Eating a bowl of popcorn while watching this stuff

2228
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,660
Well, you know, I have E3 week

2229
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:19,660
Off anyway, and I'm at the point where I've been

2230
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:21,660
At my job ten years and I get so much

2231
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,660
Time off a year for being there that long

2232
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:25,660
That I just take E3 week off to

2233
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,660
Have it off, and you know

2234
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,660
It's not a bad idea, I should do that

2235
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,660
Another thing, I may actually

2236
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:33,660
This year have to move

2237
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:35,660
Our studio may be moving by the way

2238
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:37,660
I may be moving that week

2239
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,660
So I may miss out on

2240
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,660
Some of this, we'll see

2241
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,660
But regardless, for the rest of you guys

2242
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:45,660
You can watch that live as it unfolds

2243
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:47,660
I can't imagine it's gonna be

2244
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,660
Any different for Sony and Nintendo

2245
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:51,660
It's just, you know, maybe they'll be on G4

2246
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:53,660
Or PlayStation Home

2247
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:55,660
Or, you know, they'll be available

2248
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:57,660
As well

2249
01:57:57,660 --> 01:57:59,660
They'll be on G4, so it's like

2250
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:01,660
Now Spike has more gaming cred

2251
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,660
Than G4, which, yeah, I can see that

2252
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,660
Funny how that works

2253
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,660
Funny how that works

2254
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:09,660
Alright, anyhow, a few more stories for you guys

2255
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,660
Than the Frugal Question of the Week

2256
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,660
Oh yeah, me, huh

2257
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:15,660
Well, there is going to be Cave Story Plus

2258
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,660
On the 3DS eShop soon

2259
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,660
But it's not gonna be

2260
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:21,660
The Cave Story 3D, it's a separate one

2261
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,660
All it is, is an update for the 3DS

2262
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:25,660
In fact, Tyrone Rodriguez

2263
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:27,660
The CEO of Nicholas said

2264
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:29,660
That he really wanted it just to be

2265
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:31,660
The update, so neither game would interfere

2266
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:33,660
With the other if you happened to delete one

2267
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:35,660
That's a little weird, isn't it?

2268
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,660
That you would make a second, like, remake

2269
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,660
Of your game? Well, Cave Story

2270
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:41,660
3D is a separate game from

2271
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,660
Cave Story Plus

2272
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:45,660
They're two different games, so

2273
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:47,660
Yo dawg, I heard you like Cave Story

2274
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,660
So we put some Cave Story in your Cave Story

2275
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:51,660
And

2276
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,660
For our listeners in the UK

2277
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,660
The UK Pride Xbox Connect bundle

2278
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,660
Will be available in May

2279
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,660
And I kinda want it

2280
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,660
But, not really

2281
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:03,660
It's going to be a

2282
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:05,660
249 pound 99 pence

2283
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,660
So, there you go

2284
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,660
There's also going to be

2285
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:11,660
A

2286
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:15,660
A skin available

2287
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:17,660
Jella Skins is gonna make

2288
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:19,660
A pattern

2289
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,660
For 30 bucks

2290
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:23,660
And they also, though, do have

2291
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:25,660
A Stars and Stripes bundle for

2292
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:27,660
The American audiences, or anyone who happens to want

2293
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,660
An American flag on their

2294
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:31,660
Game, or something

2295
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,660
Or the Confederate flag

2296
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:35,660
I'm sure they have the Confederate flag too, you know

2297
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:37,660
Oh, shush

2298
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:39,660
And then Ratchet and Clank HD trilogy

2299
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:41,660
Has been pushed back in Europe

2300
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:43,660
It will be pushed

2301
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:45,660
From the 16th of May until early

2302
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:47,660
June, Insomniac has announced

2303
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,660
The end

2304
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:51,660
The end

2305
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:53,660
Let's go to the

2306
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:55,660
Fugal question of the week

2307
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:57,660
Except, I'm failing

2308
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,660
And I did this last week too, didn't I?

2309
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:01,660
It's something about the network change

2310
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:03,660
I don't have the music

2311
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:05,660
Up for this segment

2312
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:07,660
But every week we go to our Facebook

2313
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,660
At facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

2314
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:11,660
Or our Google Plus

2315
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:13,660
Yes, we're on Google Plus

2316
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,660
With all the Google employees that are still there

2317
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:17,660
There are some very loyal Google Plus listeners

2318
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:19,660
And I get it

2319
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:21,660
Facebook does some real dumb shit

2320
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:23,660
Did you hear about now what they're doing?

2321
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:25,660
I get why people want to run off to Google Plus

2322
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:27,660
The whole messenger thing will now

2323
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:29,660
Have this actual Facebook

2324
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,660
Messenger app

2325
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:33,660
Look this up on the internet

2326
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:35,660
If you don't believe me

2327
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:37,660
The Facebook Messenger app on the iPhone

2328
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:39,660
Will now send your location

2329
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:41,660
With the messages that you send

2330
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:43,660
You can turn that off

2331
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:45,660
To be fair, you can't turn that off

2332
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:47,660
But you know it will be on by default

2333
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:49,660
Because nobody at Facebook knows

2334
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:51,660
What opt-in is all about

2335
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,660
And the other thing with this is that

2336
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:55,660
Return receipts

2337
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,660
You can now request a return receipt

2338
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:59,660
For when somebody has read your message

2339
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:01,660
You can't turn that off

2340
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:03,660
So if you don't want someone to know you read their message

2341
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:05,660
Too bad

2342
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,660
That would be great for the stalkers that Facebook message you

2343
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:09,660
Well, I'm sure you could use a third party app

2344
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,660
For that

2345
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,660
I don't know the specifics of how it worked

2346
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:15,660
But when I read that I was like grrr

2347
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:17,660
More importantly though, Ronma and Chad

2348
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:19,660
Has informed us that Bronson Pinchot

2349
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,660
Actually has a reality show on DIY

2350
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:23,660
I was unaware of this

2351
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:25,660
It sounds interesting

2352
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:27,660
I'm sure it's not

2353
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:29,660
And by the way, Rob

2354
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,660
I don't use the messenger anyway

2355
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:33,660
I always have it linked me as offline

2356
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:35,660
I'm just saying

2357
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,660
I don't know the specifics

2358
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:39,660
But I look at this and I raise my eyebrow

2359
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,660
Right

2360
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:43,660
Anyway, let's go on to happier topics

2361
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,660
I make everyone get AIM

2362
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:47,660
We're going to go on to happier topics

2363
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,660
And things that don't piss me off

2364
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:51,660
And that is the FUGO Question of the Week

2365
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:53,660
Every week we ask you a question

2366
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:55,660
At our Facebook and our Google Plus

2367
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:57,660
Facebook.com, social media, radio

2368
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,660
I'm repeating myself

2369
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,660
So let's get to some of the answers

2370
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:03,660
I love this question of the week

2371
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:05,660
Not just because I thought of it

2372
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:07,660
But because the interview we had tonight and everything

2373
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:09,660
How inspired you to create something

2374
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:11,660
Artistic in the real world

2375
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:13,660
For example, art, music, a website

2376
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:15,660
Anything creative

2377
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:17,660
What did you create and why did the game

2378
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:19,660
Inspire you to do this

2379
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:21,660
So Shane from Warthouse started us off

2380
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:23,660
Sorry I'm too busy writing my

2381
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,660
Male Shepard Caden fanfic

2382
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,660
To answer this question

2383
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:29,660
I've written fanfiction

2384
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:31,660
Really? For what game?

2385
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,660
For a number of games

2386
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:35,660
I did Metroid

2387
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,660
Back in the day

2388
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,660
Just old stuff

2389
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,660
The last thing I did was for Digimon

2390
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,660
Of all things

2391
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,660
Nice

2392
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,660
I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto

2393
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,660
And I was inspired to try to figure out

2394
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,660
What the song

2395
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,660
From DJ Hero 2 would sound like

2396
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:55,660
The mashup between piano

2397
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,660
And Shout

2398
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:59,660
So I did that

2399
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,660
And I've done fan art

2400
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:03,660
Remember I did my Portal

2401
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:05,660
To enter it for my final project

2402
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:07,660
In 3D class

2403
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,660
Alright let's get to some more of the answers over on Facebook

2404
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,660
We have an answer

2405
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,660
From Johnny B

2406
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,660
Johnny Cage's

2407
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:17,660
Ball Busta Move

2408
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,660
Inspired me to create an athletic cup

2409
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,660
Attached with nails and screws

2410
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,660
I advertise this tool of protection

2411
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,660
For men, women, and everyone in between

2412
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,660
For a commercial project

2413
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,660
In film school

2414
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,660
Unfortunately this anti-hipster cup

2415
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,660
Was the class's top prize

2416
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:35,660
To be aired on local access

2417
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:37,660
But it did earn me an A in the class

2418
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,660
C, video games can help you

2419
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,660
Get good grades in school

2420
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,660
I think it's funny

2421
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,660
But hey I have a tip for you

2422
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,660
This is not a well known fact

2423
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,660
About Rob Roberts

2424
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:51,660
But before there was Orange Lounge

2425
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,660
Before there was

2426
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:55,660
Under Sedation Live

2427
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:57,660
Before there was Rob on college radio

2428
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,660
There was Rob on local public access

2429
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:01,660
I had a TV show

2430
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,660
When I was in high school

2431
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:05,660
You will never see the tapes

2432
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,660
I'm gonna make sure those

2433
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:09,660
Fuckers are destroyed

2434
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,660
Oh well I've seen some of it

2435
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:13,660
I don't even know where the tapes are

2436
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,660
I honestly don't

2437
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:17,660
It is fantastic

2438
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:19,660
It was fantastic

2439
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:21,660
Seriously I'm being serious here

2440
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:23,660
If shit like

2441
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:25,660
Tim and Eric's awesome show

2442
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:27,660
Great Job can do as well as it does

2443
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,660
That public access show could have been a hit

2444
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,660
Yeah you know it's a shame

2445
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:33,660
I lost touch, well we're

2446
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:35,660
Facebook friends but my friend Shannon

2447
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,660
Who was like my bestie in high school

2448
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:39,660
Did a comedy show on public access

2449
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,660
And I'll tell you what

2450
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:43,660
Kids in high school are such

2451
02:04:43,660 --> 02:04:45,660
Cock head bastard fucks

2452
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,660
Like you know we used to get

2453
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,660
Like the guys before us

2454
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:51,660
Did this very conservative

2455
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,660
Slanted show because they learned that

2456
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:55,660
From their parents called

2457
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:57,660
I'm gonna name names because I'm 33

2458
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:59,660
And I don't give a fuck anymore

2459
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,660
It was a show called Open Debate

2460
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,660
And these guys

2461
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:05,660
Would just sit there, they fucking would razz

2462
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,660
Our show that was coming up

2463
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:09,660
Like live on their show and the callers

2464
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,660
Would call in and like talk about what

2465
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:13,660
A fag I was on

2466
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:15,660
Public access TV

2467
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,660
I got bullied on television

2468
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:19,660
You guys but it gets better don't worry

2469
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,660
All I'm saying

2470
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:23,660
Is you need to put claws in your will

2471
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:25,660
That stuff gets released when you die

2472
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:27,660
Unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of

2473
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:29,660
Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately

2474
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,660
Probably died with her as well

2475
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:33,660
I'm just saying

2476
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:35,660
Alright

2477
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,660
Anyway let me get to the rest of the

2478
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:39,660
Questions here on Facebook I didn't mean to get on the

2479
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:41,660
Tangent but I just wanted to

2480
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:43,660
You know in the 10 years we've been doing

2481
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:45,660
Orange Lawn's radio I never talked about

2482
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,660
How much I hated those fuckers on

2483
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:49,660
Open Debate and I don't know what

2484
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:51,660
They're doing now but if there's any justice

2485
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,660
In the world janitorial work

2486
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,660
Jizz mopping I

2487
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,660
I don't want to belittle janitors

2488
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:59,660
Because janitors do an important

2489
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:01,660
Job

2490
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:03,660
Anyhow

2491
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:05,660
Hey Port Chop

2492
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:07,660
Answered our question on Facebook

2493
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:09,660
Not so much create but

2494
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:11,660
Adapted the Final Fantasy soundtracks

2495
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:13,660
Inspired me to adapt some of their songs

2496
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:15,660
On guitars such as Eternity Light

2497
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:17,660
Waves and Aerith's theme

2498
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:19,660
The game's music always impressed me and was very

2499
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:21,660
Memorable which made me want to learn these songs

2500
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:23,660
For myself as a result of this

2501
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:25,660
Nobui Matsu is also my favorite composer

2502
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:27,660
That's almost if you think about it

2503
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,660
That's almost the same story that Random told

2504
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:31,660
About Goonies 2

2505
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:33,660
I have to say

2506
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:35,660
Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major

2507
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:37,660
Very cool and I met him remember

2508
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:39,660
I do remember that

2509
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,660
I love this answer

2510
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:43,660
From Stan H on Facebook says

2511
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:45,660
Playing Journey as I type this

2512
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:47,660
I want to knit the scarf and be crazy

2513
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:49,660
Long

2514
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:51,660
It was a Journey joke I love it

2515
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:53,660
Lastly from Paul W

2516
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:55,660
Is it weird that when you first

2517
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:57,660
Said oh yeah he did a

2518
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:59,660
Remix thing based on Journey that I thought

2519
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:01,660
Of Journey the arcade game

2520
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:03,660
I was worried

2521
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,660
People would think that

2522
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:07,660
Look

2523
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:09,660
One more answer here from Facebook

2524
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:11,660
And then I got one on Google

2525
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:13,660
Paul W says back when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade

2526
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:15,660
During the NES and Sega Master System days

2527
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,660
I would create my own illustrations of enemies

2528
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:19,660
Bosses when instruction manuals for game

2529
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:21,660
Were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent

2530
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,660
These were new creations I had

2531
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:25,660
Imagined for sequels to games such as

2532
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:27,660
Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast

2533
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:29,660
I think a lot of us did that kind of crap

2534
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:31,660
As a kid Paul because like I can tell you

2535
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:33,660
I'm sure you must have done this too

2536
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:35,660
And everybody that was you know

2537
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,660
Grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this

2538
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:39,660
Did the RPG on the notepad

2539
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:41,660
Where you drew the dungeon

2540
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:43,660
And like you'd make your friends go through the dungeon

2541
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,660
It was like you wrote your own video game

2542
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:47,660
On paper so it makes sense

2543
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,660
I used to have a tablet of that stuff

2544
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,660
And I'm so sad that I lost it

2545
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:53,660
This is why we're friends because I knew you were that kid

2546
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,660
I didn't even have to ask

2547
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:57,660
We would have been playing that game when we were in the same school

2548
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,660
Basically I was inspired by Contra

2549
02:07:59,660 --> 02:08:01,660
I used to love drawing mazes

2550
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:03,660
And so that's what I'd do I'd create mazes

2551
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:05,660
And then there were mazes with cannons in them

2552
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:07,660
And then mazes with spikes and cannons

2553
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:09,660
And alien monsters and stuff like that

2554
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:11,660
So it was kind of like that

2555
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:13,660
It was like bullet hell but on paper

2556
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,660
Alright

2557
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:17,660
Let's get to the one answer here on Google Plus

2558
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:19,660
Jim H

2559
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:21,660
You go Jim's the loyal Google user

2560
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:23,660
Here it is sort of embarrassing to admit

2561
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:25,660
This but in my documentary class in film school

2562
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:27,660
I made a one minute doclet about my

2563
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:29,660
Holy Priest character in Warcraft

2564
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:31,660
I actually got an A on the project

2565
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:33,660
And had to answer questions from my instructor

2566
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:35,660
Like have you ever let another player

2567
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:37,660
Die on purpose? Great story

2568
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:39,660
Love it

2569
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:41,660
I'm sure the answer was yes

2570
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:43,660
Alright

2571
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:45,660
There it is that's it for the foogle question of the week

2572
02:08:45,660 --> 02:08:47,660
Let's get back into some news

2573
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:49,660
Loki

2574
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:51,660
Alright so this is a little interesting

2575
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:53,660
EA is putting out an indie bundle

2576
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:55,660
And now of course it's getting a little bit of shade

2577
02:08:55,660 --> 02:08:57,660
Because EA is not exactly an indie company

2578
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:59,660
But the titles that are being included

2579
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,660
Warp, Shank, Shank 2

2580
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:03,660
Gatling Gears, Deathspank

2581
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:05,660
and Deathspank

2582
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:07,660
The Thong of Virtue

2583
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:09,660
And ironically enough

2584
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:11,660
It's actually being released on Steam

2585
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:13,660
As part of Steam Play

2586
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,660
And

2587
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:17,660
They're also having some other

2588
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,660
Indies that are

2589
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:21,660
Available as well

2590
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:23,660
I guess Deathspank titles are currently

2591
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,660
$7.50 individually

2592
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,660
And then EA's rest, their indie titles

2593
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,660
Are $5 each

2594
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,660
And those are PC only

2595
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,660
Where as the Deathspank titles are PC and Mac

2596
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,660
And

2597
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:37,660
And

2598
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:39,660
Interesting enough though

2599
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:41,660
They've also gotten some

2600
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,660
Hate from

2601
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:45,660
Just this guy that put out a game called

2602
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:47,660
Minecraft

2603
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:49,660
That's right Notch

2604
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:51,660
Basically saying

2605
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,660
What's a Minecraft?

2606
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:55,660
Basically EA is releasing

2607
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:57,660
How do you mine fish?

2608
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:59,660
So EA is releasing an

2609
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:01,660
Indie bundle

2610
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:03,660
I'm not sure

2611
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:05,660
How that works EA

2612
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:07,660
Stop attempting to ruin everything you bunch of cynical

2613
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:09,660
Bastards

2614
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:11,660
Oh tweet drama

2615
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:13,660
Well it's going down on Twitter

2616
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:15,660
Y'all

2617
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:17,660
You know what though it did strike me as really funny

2618
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,660
That the EA Indie bundle was on Steam

2619
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:21,660
And not on Origin

2620
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:23,660
Cause no one buys

2621
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:25,660
Anything on Origin

2622
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:27,660
I think it was a very interesting way for

2623
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:29,660
EA to like very subtly shade Steam

2624
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:31,660
The whole thing was a setup

2625
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:33,660
No I think it was a trap

2626
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:35,660
I think it was because they thought they would get more sales

2627
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,660
From Steam sadly enough

2628
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:39,660
Because there was even

2629
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:41,660
And it didn't make our

2630
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:43,660
Show roll here but there was a thing that

2631
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:45,660
Origin put out like a survey

2632
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:47,660
Saying okay

2633
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:49,660
What would you like to see us approve

2634
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:51,660
On Origin because

2635
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:53,660
Kind of almost admitting

2636
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:55,660
That it hasn't been that great

2637
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,660
So what would you guys like to see

2638
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,660
Us do

2639
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:01,660
To fix it

2640
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:03,660
Close it down and put the games on Steam

2641
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:05,660
They're not going to do that

2642
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:07,660
Although you know what

2643
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:09,660
Competition is healthy for the industry

2644
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:11,660
So you know I don't want Steam to be the one and only

2645
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:13,660
But you know I don't know if EA should really

2646
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:15,660
Be given their own store but I will say this

2647
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,660
You know despite the cynical bastard I am and all this

2648
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,660
I will say something nice about Origin this week

2649
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:21,660
I did play

2650
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:23,660
And I didn't talk about this in my gaming week but I did play

2651
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:25,660
That Mass Effect 3 data pad game

2652
02:11:25,660 --> 02:11:27,660
That helps you with your galactic readiness

2653
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:29,660
Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry

2654
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:31,660
Last week because I said that you have to

2655
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:33,660
Play multiplayer

2656
02:11:33,660 --> 02:11:35,660
And I downloaded that thing

2657
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,660
Well it does turn out and I do stand corrected

2658
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:39,660
Thank you Chat Room that's the perk of doing a live show

2659
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:41,660
That you can download this Mass Effect data pad

2660
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,660
And raise your galactic readiness

2661
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:45,660
Rating in a

2662
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:47,660
I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much

2663
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:49,660
One of those like Facebook-y type of games that

2664
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:51,660
You know you send your ship out and wait

2665
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:53,660
Three hours and you can check on it and what have you

2666
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:55,660
And it helps raise your galactic readiness

2667
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:57,660
And I got to say the way that all ties together

2668
02:11:57,660 --> 02:11:59,660
And how you do that on your iPhone

2669
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:01,660
Yet it impacts

2670
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:03,660
What happens on the Xbox

2671
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,660
And you can check your multiplayer

2672
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:07,660
Unlocks on the PC

2673
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:09,660
That kind of synergy is neat

2674
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:11,660
It is neat

2675
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:13,660
And it's done

2676
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:15,660
It's done well

2677
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:17,660
So I will tip my hat

2678
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,660
Slightly to that

2679
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:21,660
I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs

2680
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:23,660
Left and right wherever they can get it

2681
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:25,660
But as far as the free stuff that's there

2682
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:27,660
It's pretty cool

2683
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:29,660
I will say that nice thing

2684
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,660
About Origin but as far as the EA&D bundle

2685
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:33,660
On Steam

2686
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,660
You know what

2687
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,660
I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought

2688
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:39,660
It would be a clever thing and

2689
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:41,660
Probably didn't go through all the necessary

2690
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:43,660
Checks and now they're paying for it in the media

2691
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,660
Just like everything else

2692
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:47,660
Guess what else EA paid for

2693
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:49,660
In the media this week

2694
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,660
A big snafu in their rock band

2695
02:12:51,660 --> 02:12:53,660
IOS game

2696
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,660
A big pop up

2697
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:57,660
Showed up when logging into rock band on the iPhone

2698
02:12:57,660 --> 02:12:59,660
Or the iPad this week that said

2699
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:01,660
On May 31st rock band will

2700
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:03,660
No longer be playable on your device

2701
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:05,660
Thanks for rocking out with us

2702
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:07,660
And everybody was like what

2703
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:09,660
The fuck

2704
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,660
I bought this game and I bought the DLC

2705
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:13,660
It's on my phone and EA is just gonna fucking shut it off

2706
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,660
Yank pull the plug

2707
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:17,660
Pull it from my phone can't play it anymore

2708
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,660
And while that little pop ups going on

2709
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:21,660
It's still being currently sold on

2710
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:23,660
Their on IOS's app store

2711
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,660
Blows your fucking mind

2712
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,660
Right well before you all

2713
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,660
Yell this out in chat there was a

2714
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:31,660
Follow up to it not only did Harmonix

2715
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:33,660
And John Drake you gotta love

2716
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:35,660
John Drake he's a

2717
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:37,660
Great industry guy and he's very

2718
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:39,660
Active and out there in the community

2719
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,660
And he basically washed his hands of the whole

2720
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,660
Thing and he's like uh

2721
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:45,660
We were not the

2722
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:47,660
You know we were not the publishers of this

2723
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:49,660
We're working to understand what's up

2724
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:51,660
ASAP

2725
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:53,660
Well came out later in the week

2726
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:55,660
EA came out and said that prompt

2727
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:57,660
Was made in error

2728
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,660
And we will give you more information

2729
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:01,660
Soon they said quote we apologize

2730
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:03,660
For the confusion this caused we're

2731
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:05,660
Working to clarify the issue that caused

2732
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:07,660
The error and we'll share additional

2733
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:09,660
Information as soon as possible

2734
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:11,660
Clarify the issue fire the employee you know

2735
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:13,660
Yeah because

2736
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:15,660
They didn't like that how did this happen

2737
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:17,660
The cat did not sneak

2738
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:19,660
In in the middle of the night and type

2739
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:21,660
Dear rockers on may 31st

2740
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:23,660
Rock me that was an intentional

2741
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:25,660
Message especially the thanks

2742
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:27,660
For rocking out with us

2743
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:29,660
Thanks for paying us money

2744
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:31,660
But your game is no longer gonna work now here's

2745
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:33,660
My thought I have a random ass theory and this

2746
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:35,660
Ties back into mass effect

2747
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:37,660
You know they announced this mass effect free

2748
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:39,660
DLC that's coming out in the summer but they

2749
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:41,660
Put an expiration date on it saying you

2750
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:43,660
Can get it free until

2751
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:45,660
2013 or 2014 something like that

2752
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,660
And BioWare said note

2753
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:49,660
We don't plan to ever not

2754
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:51,660
Make it free but EA's

2755
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:53,660
Policies require us to set an expiration

2756
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:55,660
Date and you know

2757
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:57,660
As long as they don't have to honor it

2758
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:59,660
And also speaking of mass effect

2759
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:01,660
When I bought mass effect 2 brand

2760
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:03,660
New mind you I had a coupon

2761
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:05,660
In the box for an online pass

2762
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:07,660
Expires February

2763
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:09,660
1st 2012 and it was

2764
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:11,660
Like mid February by the time

2765
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:13,660
I was ready to play it it still redeemed

2766
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:15,660
But that expiration date was

2767
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,660
There and I was about ready to go through the fucking

2768
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:19,660
Roof cause I bought that new

2769
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:21,660
Just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass

2770
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:23,660
I almost went through the roof it did work

2771
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:25,660
But this makes me wonder EA

2772
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:27,660
Has this crackhead policy

2773
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:29,660
Of having expiration dates

2774
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:31,660
Why do they have expiration dates?

2775
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:33,660
That's a great fucking question that I would like

2776
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:35,660
EA to answer

2777
02:15:35,660 --> 02:15:37,660
See I don't understand why they have expiration dates

2778
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,660
I don't understand like

2779
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:41,660
They'll do that you know on certain things

2780
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:43,660
Like for example Ultraviolet you may notice

2781
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:45,660
With a lot of the you know DVD's

2782
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:47,660
And Blu-rays that are out there now

2783
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:49,660
Come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy

2784
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:51,660
That you can redeem you know

2785
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:53,660
By a certain date and I'm wondering

2786
02:15:53,660 --> 02:15:55,660
If it's just because they don't want to keep those copies

2787
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:57,660
Up on their servers for you know

2788
02:15:57,660 --> 02:15:59,660
Forever or something

2789
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:01,660
It doesn't even make any sense because you can

2790
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:03,660
Once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection

2791
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,660
You can always stream it

2792
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:07,660
I just don't understand why on a paid

2793
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,660
App they have it that it can

2794
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:11,660
Expire like that and that that right there

2795
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:13,660
Is a perfect example of why

2796
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:15,660
Going digital only is a

2797
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:17,660
Bad fucking idea

2798
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:19,660
Because what's gonna stop EA or

2799
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:21,660
Any company from going yeah we just want this game

2800
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:23,660
To work anymore boom done and

2801
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:25,660
That's it you have no recourse

2802
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:27,660
And really Rockband is

2803
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:29,660
On your phone and you play you don't

2804
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:31,660
I mean I understand if they're shutting

2805
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,660
Down the online music store

2806
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:35,660
Or they're shutting down the multiplayer

2807
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:37,660
Or whatever but how can they

2808
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,660
Stop the entire app including

2809
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:41,660
Single player from working

2810
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,660
How very dare you EA

2811
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,660
Or if it's a free app

2812
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:47,660
I can see okay maybe this is gonna

2813
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:49,660
Expire and a new one's gonna come out

2814
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,660
There was a Disney Tron app that did that

2815
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:53,660
But it was free but here's the thing though

2816
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:55,660
And this is kind of pointed out as well

2817
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,660
They did something similar with Tetris

2818
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:59,660
Tetris for example it expired

2819
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:01,660
And stopped working and guess what

2820
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,660
Oh they sold a new version of Tetris

2821
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:05,660
You can buy it again

2822
02:17:05,660 --> 02:17:07,660
What makes you think that they might not

2823
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:09,660
Try this again well yet PopCap

2824
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:11,660
Who is now owned by EA

2825
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:13,660
PopCap did it a little better

2826
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:15,660
Because they turned Bejeweled 2

2827
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:17,660
They spun off Bejeweled Blitz

2828
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:19,660
Into it's own game but they made it free

2829
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:21,660
And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop

2830
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,660
Working you know you still got that

2831
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:25,660
Even though they have Bejeweled 3 they just

2832
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,660
They kind of push people to go get Bejeweled 3

2833
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:29,660
But they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working

2834
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:31,660
At least I don't think and I don't want to check

2835
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:33,660
On my phone but I just I think PopCap

2836
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:35,660
Didn't screw it up the way

2837
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:37,660
That EA did

2838
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:39,660
You know if they're like well we have a policy that we have to have

2839
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,660
Expiration dates why the fuck

2840
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,660
Why do I care about your goddamn policies

2841
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:45,660
Where is this explained that this might

2842
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:47,660
Expire somewhere it there's no

2843
02:17:47,660 --> 02:17:49,660
Terms of service as far as

2844
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:51,660
I'm aware

2845
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:53,660
Bobby wants me to remind you guys and I even

2846
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:55,660
Told Bobby I'd plug this and then promptly

2847
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:57,660
Forgot

2848
02:17:57,660 --> 02:17:59,660
That we do if you are a steam

2849
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:01,660
User and you are playing games online

2850
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:03,660
In the community we now have a

2851
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:05,660
VOG network community there is no

2852
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:07,660
L army but you know we've been trying to push things

2853
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:09,660
To the VOG network too steam

2854
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:11,660
Community.com slash groups slash

2855
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:13,660
VOG network if you want to join us there

2856
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,660
And when the full I joined when the full

2857
02:18:15,660 --> 02:18:17,660
VOG network launches

2858
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:19,660
Soon I can't tell you when

2859
02:18:19,660 --> 02:18:21,660
But it'll be sooner than you think

2860
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,660
We'll have a link to that a little more directly

2861
02:18:23,660 --> 02:18:25,660
And yes I am still able to play Bejeweled

2862
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:27,660
2 on my phone

2863
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:29,660
There it is there's the music

2864
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:31,660
I'm just

2865
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:33,660
It doesn't

2866
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:35,660
Surprise me that they would be the ones behind this

2867
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:37,660
Yep

2868
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:39,660
Alright we're gonna go to the

2869
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:41,660
Mailbag dark soccer left the room

2870
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:43,660
She'll be back in a minute here nope here she comes

2871
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:45,660
Every week you guys send us emails

2872
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,660
I'm allergic to mail

2873
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:49,660
M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L

2874
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:51,660
Both

2875
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,660
Alright mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place

2876
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:55,660
To send us your emails and dark soccer

2877
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:57,660
Might read them

2878
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:59,660
Dark soccer hopefully you have some emails

2879
02:18:59,660 --> 02:19:01,660
For us tonight

2880
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:03,660
Alright first one Robert M here I'll skip the silliness

2881
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,660
And irrelevance to simply state

2882
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:07,660
That I just picked up Bastion on Steam

2883
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:09,660
Now that the Mac version is on there

2884
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:11,660
And was $6 mid week

2885
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:13,660
I mid downloaded this time so I can't say if it's

2886
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:15,660
An imperfect but competent port

2887
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:17,660
Like Super Meat Boy say but I'm looking forward

2888
02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:19,660
To it speaking of

2889
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:21,660
I know that content downloading from the store on PSB

2890
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,660
If interrupted will have to start completely

2891
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:25,660
Over which seems unfortunate for a portable

2892
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:27,660
Even considering its age

2893
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:29,660
Does the Vita have this issue or can software

2894
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:31,660
Be loaded a little at a time

2895
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:33,660
I don't know

2896
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:35,660
Hey Vita people will it work

2897
02:19:35,660 --> 02:19:37,660
Will it blend

2898
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:39,660
Are you even listening

2899
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:41,660
I was kind of tuning out

2900
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:43,660
Sorry

2901
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:45,660
Who wants to know if you can download incrementally

2902
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:47,660
On the Vita or will you have to start over like on the

2903
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:49,660
PSP

2904
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:51,660
Download incrementally

2905
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:53,660
If you're in download or whatever

2906
02:19:53,660 --> 02:19:55,660
Or if you like happen to turn your system off

2907
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:57,660
Or something like that it will restart where it's at

2908
02:19:57,660 --> 02:19:59,660
Yeah and doesn't the Vita really encourages you

2909
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:01,660
To put it to sleep not to turn it off

2910
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:03,660
You sleep it and while it's sleeping

2911
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:05,660
It'll download your shit which is good

2912
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:07,660
Yeah in fact I keep forgetting

2913
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:09,660
That I have mine in sleep mode like in my bag

2914
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:11,660
And then the battery is dead

2915
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:13,660
Exactly that's why I was like oh shit

2916
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:15,660
It charges again

2917
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,660
It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP

2918
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:19,660
They sell one

2919
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:21,660
Oh do they of course they do

2920
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,660
But I love that 3DS dock

2921
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:25,660
It makes it so great to remember to charge it

2922
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:27,660
And it's just a cheap piece of plastic but it works so well

2923
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,660
By the way I almost skipped

2924
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:31,660
This email because it said oral advertising

2925
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:33,660
But I saw who sent it

2926
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:35,660
Dearest members of the online

2927
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:37,660
Video game radio Caspoon Didocracy

2928
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:39,660
You thought it was some French spam

2929
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:41,660
We get inundated with French spam

2930
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,660
I don't understand

2931
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:45,660
This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD

2932
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:47,660
Collection being released on Vita

2933
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:49,660
The very possibility of a collection of games

2934
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:51,660
Such as this being released on the Vita

2935
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:53,660
Brought the following questions to my mind

2936
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:55,660
Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3?

2937
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:57,660
Staycare Entertainment

2938
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:59,660
This message has been brought to you

2939
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:01,660
By oral advertising sent from my iPad

2940
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:03,660
Well you don't even get

2941
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:05,660
All three games

2942
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:07,660
You only get two of the three

2943
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:09,660
Metal Gear Acid 3

2944
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:11,660
Who are you going to have to blow to get that?

2945
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:13,660
Probably Kojima

2946
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:15,660
And from what I understand he's not too into the blow

2947
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:17,660
You'd have to get his ass

2948
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:19,660
I would see Acid 3 more on

2949
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:21,660
The 3DS

2950
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:23,660
Because remember they had the whole

2951
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:25,660
Remember that really weird

2952
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:27,660
There was a Metal Gear

2953
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:29,660
There also is a

2954
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,660
Metal Gear something

2955
02:21:31,660 --> 02:21:33,660
I can't remember if it came out or not

2956
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:35,660
They were demoing one a long time ago

2957
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:37,660
A Metal Gear something on 3DS

2958
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:39,660
It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D

2959
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:41,660
Snake Eater

2960
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:43,660
Snake Eater

2961
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:45,660
So

2962
02:21:45,660 --> 02:21:47,660
Yes? That was it

2963
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:49,660
Hey guys this is Honey Badger

2964
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:51,660
AKA Blade 3

2965
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:53,660
Okay I have to stop and apologize

2966
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,660
Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night

2967
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:57,660
While I was drunk off

2968
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:59,660
Cheap Sangria

2969
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:01,660
Off my Ghetto Sangria made from Menneshevitz

2970
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:03,660
So I'm sorry

2971
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:05,660
I was a little drunk

2972
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:07,660
I just wanted to say the listeners will support you

2973
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:09,660
No matter what changes you make

2974
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:11,660
Also I have a question for you all

2975
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:13,660
But I think Loki may have the most

2976
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:15,660
Input. How close are we

2977
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,660
To having essentially gaming computers

2978
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:19,660
And fancy cases that are just

2979
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:21,660
Locked down by Microsoft or Sony

2980
02:22:21,660 --> 02:22:23,660
Basically where does the line between high end

2981
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:25,660
Console and gaming PCs start

2982
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:27,660
Well pretty much that's

2983
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:29,660
What they are now anyways I mean it's just

2984
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:31,660
Gaming PCs but it's proprietary boards

2985
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:33,660
And what not

2986
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:35,660
And specialized chips that are made

2987
02:22:35,660 --> 02:22:37,660
Specifically for the systems

2988
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:39,660
I wish it was a little bit more like

2989
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:41,660
Gaming PCs but I understand why they have

2990
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:43,660
Limitations but it would be

2991
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:45,660
Kind of cool like if for example

2992
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,660
You can have an Xbox 360

2993
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:49,660
And be able to upgrade the RAM in it

2994
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:51,660
Like say okay all the games have to

2995
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:53,660
Run with this amount of RAM but if you want

2996
02:22:53,660 --> 02:22:55,660
The games to run a little bit smoother you can add extra RAM

2997
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,660
Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space

2998
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,660
I'd be worried though about those minimum system

2999
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:01,660
Requirements slowly bumping up you know

3000
02:23:01,660 --> 02:23:03,660
It's the one thing that makes people a little leery of

3001
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:05,660
PC gaming

3002
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,660
Nowadays I mean I know but you know

3003
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:09,660
Then it's the video card then it's you know

3004
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:13,660
The operating system that your thing is running

3005
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:15,660
Then it's the space on your hard drive

3006
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:17,660
Then you know

3007
02:23:17,660 --> 02:23:19,660
Then one thing it's another

3008
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:21,660
So next email

3009
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,660
I just wanted to say real quick though since that was from Honey Badger

3010
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:25,660
I love that name by the way because it always makes me think it is

3011
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:27,660
It's the Honey Badger watch it run in

3012
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:29,660
Slow motion

3013
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,660
It's pretty bad ass look

3014
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:33,660
It runs all over the place

3015
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:35,660
I wish

3016
02:23:35,660 --> 02:23:37,660
Listen to Orange Dolls Radio

3017
02:23:37,660 --> 02:23:39,660
Don't fuck your shit up

3018
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:41,660
If you're not you're a bitch

3019
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,660
And by the way just to clarify

3020
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:49,660
I did not mean to insinuate

3021
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:51,660
That Kojima is gay he has not come out

3022
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:53,660
But if he was it would be okay

3023
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:55,660
It would be fine by us

3024
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:57,660
The more the merrier

3025
02:23:57,660 --> 02:23:59,660
Two emails left

3026
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:01,660
Hey guys it's Jim Sally

3027
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:03,660
Do I have to do the choo choo noise?

3028
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:05,660
I live in Canada sorry

3029
02:24:05,660 --> 02:24:07,660
And work as a party train conductor

3030
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:09,660
Recently me and my wife started shopping

3031
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,660
For Robot Butler but we can't decide

3032
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,660
What features we want

3033
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:15,660
Wait a minute he really is a train conductor?

3034
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:17,660
I think he's full of shit

3035
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:19,660
Let me finish the email

3036
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:21,660
A party train conductor

3037
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:23,660
A party train

3038
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:25,660
Legit my dad for many years

3039
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:27,660
He recently retired

3040
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:29,660
But for about 45 years

3041
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,660
He worked for the railroad

3042
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:33,660
And he was a train conductor

3043
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:35,660
So when I hear that I perk up

3044
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:37,660
So I'm just saying

3045
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:39,660
Chichi

3046
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:41,660
I empathize with the train people

3047
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,660
She loves data from Star Trek

3048
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:45,660
But I'm more of an R2D2 kind of guy

3049
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:47,660
Which fictional robot would you like to have

3050
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:49,660
In your real life?

3051
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:51,660
Anyway I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides

3052
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,660
On the Sally Express

3053
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:55,660
Love you and good night Jim Sally

3054
02:24:55,660 --> 02:24:57,660
Edie cause she's hot

3055
02:24:57,660 --> 02:24:59,660
Mass Effect reference that's all I have

3056
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:01,660
On the brain recently

3057
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,660
I think

3058
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:09,660
You know maybe the

3059
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:11,660
The gigalobot from

3060
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:13,660
Artificial intelligence

3061
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:15,660
Does a cylon count?

3062
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:17,660
As a robot because

3063
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:19,660
I don't want to

3064
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:21,660
I don't want to spoil but there's a certain

3065
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:23,660
Cylon that's really hot

3066
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:25,660
What? Are they full on robots

3067
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:27,660
Or are they cybernetic?

3068
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,660
Um

3069
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:31,660
Cause I could say Angelica Houston from Captain EO

3070
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,660
That's a great choice

3071
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,660
But she's cybernetic

3072
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:37,660
So are the borgs, the borg don't count

3073
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:39,660
You know what? It's our show

3074
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:41,660
We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please

3075
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:43,660
And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO

3076
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:45,660
Yes

3077
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:47,660
I want Angelica Houston

3078
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:49,660
To service me

3079
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:51,660
And I want a certain

3080
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:53,660
Unsaid very hot cylon

3081
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:55,660
That was revealed in the third season

3082
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,660
Finale and we'll just leave it at that

3083
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:59,660
So what about you Loki?

3084
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:01,660
I want a portal turret, it's technically a robot

3085
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:03,660
Then I'm gonna

3086
02:26:03,660 --> 02:26:05,660
Change mine to GLaDOS

3087
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:07,660
I want to be her when I grow up

3088
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:09,660
And die

3089
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:11,660
Okay the last email

3090
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:13,660
You know what?

3091
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:15,660
I'll french fry you bitch

3092
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:17,660
Bitch I will

3093
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:19,660
Come back and julienne you

3094
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:21,660
I will take you to In-N-Out and watch

3095
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:23,660
Them put you in the blender

3096
02:26:23,660 --> 02:26:25,660
Anyway

3097
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:27,660
You know what Rob?

3098
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:29,660
What?

3099
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:31,660
Aw I'm getting applause

3100
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:33,660
Howdy OLR

3101
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:35,660
I wanted to say

3102
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:37,660
I wanted to call in

3103
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:39,660
But something came up as usual

3104
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:41,660
Therefore I'm writing you folks instead

3105
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:43,660
I was having a discussion with

3106
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:45,660
We're getting the manual work I see

3107
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,660
I was having a discussion with a friend

3108
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:49,660
About the future of Nintendo

3109
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:51,660
He came to a conclusion that Nintendo

3110
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:53,660
Might be better off if they gave up

3111
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:55,660
On hardware and focused entirely on making

3112
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:57,660
Good games. What do you think?

3113
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:59,660
Would Nintendo be harmed by dropping hardware

3114
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:01,660
Or is Mario still Mario regardless of what system

3115
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:03,660
It's on? It comes from Panaxium

3116
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:05,660
So you mean you want them to be Sega?

3117
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:07,660
Yeah

3118
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,660
It's a great thing

3119
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:11,660
For the fanboys to fantasize

3120
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:13,660
About. Ain't gonna happen

3121
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:15,660
Ain't gonna happen

3122
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,660
Not for a long time

3123
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:19,660
That will happen over Miyamoto's

3124
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:21,660
Dead body. Literally

3125
02:27:21,660 --> 02:27:23,660
Like

3126
02:27:23,660 --> 02:27:25,660
It's

3127
02:27:25,660 --> 02:27:27,660
It's a Japanese company

3128
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:29,660
And there's a lot of

3129
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:31,660
I don't want to sound rude or mean

3130
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:33,660
But just look at the history

3131
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:35,660
There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that

3132
02:27:35,660 --> 02:27:37,660
That they know what the people want

3133
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:39,660
And that's not the way they want to go down

3134
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:41,660
And if you wanted to look for another example

3135
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:43,660
What I'm talking about

3136
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:45,660
The history of this show. We talked a lot about Konami

3137
02:27:45,660 --> 02:27:47,660
And I had this conversation

3138
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:49,660
With a friend just the other day

3139
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,660
Konami

3140
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:53,660
Konami should've had

3141
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:55,660
Konami had every right to be the kings

3142
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:57,660
Of music games in America

3143
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:59,660
As well as Japan

3144
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:01,660
But they fucked it up

3145
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:03,660
By not taking the risks

3146
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:05,660
They did for a little while when there was a guy in America

3147
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:07,660
Influencing a lot

3148
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:09,660
But then that guy wasn't around anymore

3149
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:11,660
And music games and Konami fell the fuck apart

3150
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:13,660
Case in point. Rock Revolution

3151
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:15,660
I think Nintendo will die trying to stay

3152
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:17,660
First party

3153
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:19,660
Well it's easy to dismiss Nintendo

3154
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:21,660
But don't forget

3155
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:23,660
How fucking huge the Wii was

3156
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:25,660
Don't count it out

3157
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:27,660
The 3DS should've failed

3158
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:29,660
But it didn't

3159
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,660
Nintendo brought it back

3160
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:33,660
So write off the Wii U if you want

3161
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:35,660
I'm as skeptical as the rest of you

3162
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:37,660
But Nintendo kinda seems

3163
02:28:37,660 --> 02:28:39,660
To know how to make it work

3164
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:41,660
Granted it could end up being a Nintendo 64

3165
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:43,660
Or a GameCube

3166
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:45,660
But neither of those systems exactly killed

3167
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,660
Nintendo. It would have to take

3168
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:49,660
Something of Virtual Boy proportions on the Wii U

3169
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:51,660
To actually kill Nintendo

3170
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,660
And make them go third party

3171
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,660
So I'll sit here and fantasize with you about Mario

3172
02:28:55,660 --> 02:28:57,660
On the Playstation. I just think realistically

3173
02:28:57,660 --> 02:28:59,660
It ain't gonna happen for a very

3174
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:01,660
Long time. Off topic

3175
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:03,660
Here I wanted to mention something since I was browsing

3176
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:05,660
Through the Playstation store

3177
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:07,660
I find it a bit ironic that the full game

3178
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:09,660
Of Ridge Racer

3179
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,660
Happens to be under the demo section

3180
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:13,660
What?

3181
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:15,660
Isn't that a little funny?

3182
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:17,660
Is it really? Yes it is

3183
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:19,660
I gotta pull that down right now. Are you sure?

3184
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:21,660
No, no. The paid

3185
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:23,660
The one you have to pay $25 for

3186
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:25,660
But it's filed under demo

3187
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:27,660
I thought you meant it's free. I was like, you screwed up again?

3188
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:29,660
No, no. Meaning it's filed

3189
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:31,660
Under demo

3190
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:33,660
Because there's no content to it

3191
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:35,660
I think that's funny

3192
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:37,660
Alright

3193
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:39,660
Is that it for email? Are we done?

3194
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:41,660
Yes. Alright. Mailbag at

3195
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:43,660
OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us

3196
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:45,660
Emails for a future week

3197
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:47,660
In the meantime, it's time to get renty

3198
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:49,660
Yeah, Fuse of the Week

3199
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:05,660
Fuck Children's Week

3200
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:07,660
Fuck all the Zorphins

3201
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:09,660
Fuck their candy

3202
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:11,660
Fuck their kites

3203
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:13,660
Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake

3204
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:15,660
I don't care anymore

3205
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:17,660
I had the three holidays left

3206
02:30:17,660 --> 02:30:19,660
There's three

3207
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:21,660
Children's Week has fucked it for me

3208
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,660
Burn in hell

3209
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:25,660
And your Matron

3210
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:27,660
Fuck her too

3211
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:29,660
Loki

3212
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:31,660
F you to my ceiling fan in my living room

3213
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:33,660
For breaking

3214
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:35,660
My wife decided to turn the fan on high

3215
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:37,660
To cool off, or to dry the

3216
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:39,660
Floors that she had recently mopped

3217
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:41,660
And the switch broke

3218
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:43,660
So we couldn't shut it off

3219
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,660
So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan

3220
02:30:45,660 --> 02:30:47,660
To shut it off

3221
02:30:47,660 --> 02:30:49,660
Manually

3222
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:51,660
But it gets hot in here now

3223
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:57,660
F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland

3224
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:59,660
In a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go

3225
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:01,660
And my friend's graduating and I'll

3226
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,660
Get to miss it, but

3227
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:05,660
And F you to Jamie because she'll be

3228
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:07,660
Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me

3229
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:09,660
That's true, hooray

3230
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:11,660
F you to poop

3231
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:13,660
Unless it was a really good meal

3232
02:31:13,660 --> 02:31:15,660
She has been a little drippy lately

3233
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:17,660
Oh great, can't wait

3234
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:19,660
You're disgusting

3235
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:21,660
Alright, just a few more stories

3236
02:31:21,660 --> 02:31:23,660
For you guys

3237
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:25,660
And then we're going to open up the skype line

3238
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:27,660
Just for a little bit tonight guys

3239
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:29,660
We're running a little late because of the interview earlier

3240
02:31:29,660 --> 02:31:31,660
I think it was worth it, don't you?

3241
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:33,660
Just a few more stories for you guys, Loki

3242
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:35,660
Oh wait, quickly, quickly

3243
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:37,660
I want to say this

3244
02:31:37,660 --> 02:31:39,660
Because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole

3245
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:41,660
Nintendo and some folks brought up the iPhone

3246
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:43,660
And I must say

3247
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:45,660
Among all other things

3248
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:47,660
I would see Nintendo going to a place

3249
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,660
Like iOS first

3250
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:51,660
Before straight up Microsoft and Sony

3251
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:53,660
Type properties, why?

3252
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:55,660
Because the investors have already been pressuring them to do it

3253
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:57,660
And we have seen

3254
02:31:57,660 --> 02:31:59,660
Team Pokemon put something

3255
02:31:59,660 --> 02:32:01,660
One of those teams

3256
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:03,660
Put something out on the iOS

3257
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:05,660
Platform already

3258
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:07,660
I could see something like that happening

3259
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:09,660
Long before the

3260
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:11,660
Sony and Xbox thing

3261
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:13,660
That was something that was brought up in chat

3262
02:32:13,660 --> 02:32:15,660
What was it?

3263
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:17,660
Legend of Zaku said iPhone

3264
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:19,660
Enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that

3265
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:21,660
Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories

3266
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:23,660
Alright, let's talk about the dark side of

3267
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:25,660
Kickstarter

3268
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:27,660
So there was this Kickstarter for

3269
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:29,660
A game titled Mythic

3270
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:31,660
The Story of Gods and Men

3271
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:33,660
Which is an RPG from this company

3272
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:35,660
Called Little Monster Productions

3273
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:37,660
It was, of course

3274
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:39,660
This already sounds a little bit

3275
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,660
Outlandish, but it said

3276
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:43,660
To rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim

3277
02:32:43,660 --> 02:32:45,660
Built together by a team of

3278
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:47,660
Former Activision Blizzard developers

3279
02:32:47,660 --> 02:32:49,660
And the project was asking

3280
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:51,660
For $80,000

3281
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:53,660
It raised $5,000

3282
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:55,660
Up until a couple

3283
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:57,660
You know, days ago

3284
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,660
Basically what happened was

3285
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:01,660
They actually cancelled the funding

3286
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:03,660
Altogether

3287
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:05,660
And that's because

3288
02:33:05,660 --> 02:33:07,660
Apparently all their assets that they were showing

3289
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:09,660
On the site were stolen

3290
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:11,660
Apparently

3291
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:13,660
All the artwork for the

3292
02:33:13,660 --> 02:33:15,660
Game that was supposedly being made

3293
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:17,660
Was stolen off of different people's

3294
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:19,660
Deviant art sites

3295
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:21,660
Also

3296
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,660
Some of the

3297
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:25,660
I guess pretty much all of the

3298
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:27,660
Rewards were stolen from

3299
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:29,660
Another Kickstarter page

3300
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:31,660
The Banner Saga

3301
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:33,660
And

3302
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:35,660
Of course it made it to Reddit

3303
02:33:35,660 --> 02:33:37,660
And people were warning them online

3304
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:39,660
And of course Little Monster Productions

3305
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,660
Responded to the scam saying

3306
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:43,660
It seems we've been subjected to

3307
02:33:43,660 --> 02:33:45,660
False claims of ownership rights

3308
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:47,660
To our concepts

3309
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:49,660
The game itself is well in progress

3310
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:51,660
And it's not a scam of any kind

3311
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:53,660
Thank you for understanding

3312
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:55,660
If you have any further questions feel free to ask

3313
02:33:55,660 --> 02:33:57,660
And then of course since then

3314
02:33:57,660 --> 02:33:59,660
The Kickstarter

3315
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:01,660
Account's been deleted and

3316
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:03,660
They've kind of disappeared and vanished away

3317
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:05,660
With all that money

3318
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:07,660
Well no, technically not

3319
02:34:07,660 --> 02:34:09,660
Because they have to hit their funding goal

3320
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,660
Of $80,000 in order to keep that money

3321
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:13,660
So the $5,000 that was contributed

3322
02:34:13,660 --> 02:34:15,660
Or put down actually didn't go anywhere

3323
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:17,660
It went back to the people that

3324
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:19,660
Never left the people that put it down

3325
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:21,660
I still think it's a wake up call

3326
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:23,660
I mean Kickstarter has really

3327
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:25,660
Taken off

3328
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:27,660
Everybody wants a piece of it

3329
02:34:27,660 --> 02:34:29,660
For some people it's like an ATM machine right now

3330
02:34:29,660 --> 02:34:31,660
And it's a tricky thing

3331
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:33,660
I still can't wrap my head around

3332
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:35,660
How I really feel about Kickstarter because

3333
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:37,660
There's some things like

3334
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:39,660
What Random was talking about earlier

3335
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,660
And I saw a great piece

3336
02:34:41,660 --> 02:34:43,660
On the internet this week, an awesome piece about

3337
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:45,660
Amanda Palmer's

3338
02:34:45,660 --> 02:34:47,660
Kickstarter

3339
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:49,660
And basically the gist of the article is

3340
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:51,660
This is why Amanda Palmer gets to do

3341
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:53,660
A Kickstarter and you don't

3342
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:55,660
And I thought it was kind of a really neat article

3343
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:57,660
It was really good

3344
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:59,660
I just

3345
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:01,660
If you're gonna get into the

3346
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:03,660
Kickstarter thing, that's cool

3347
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:05,660
But play smart

3348
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:07,660
And this story is a great example

3349
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:09,660
Of why, because it really seems like there's some people out there

3350
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:11,660
Just donating to everything and anything

3351
02:35:11,660 --> 02:35:13,660
Hey it's your money, spend it on what you want

3352
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:15,660
It can be dangerous and this is why

3353
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:17,660
Educate yourself

3354
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:19,660
Make sure that you're aware

3355
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:21,660
Of who you're

3356
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:23,660
Donating to

3357
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:25,660
I also really think

3358
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:27,660
This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter

3359
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,660
Kickstarter needs to allow the person

3360
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:31,660
And maybe they do

3361
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:33,660
To be fair, maybe they already do this

3362
02:35:33,660 --> 02:35:35,660
And I just never see people do it

3363
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,660
And maybe people should be encouraged to do it more

3364
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:39,660
To set a limit

3365
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:41,660
On how much money is gonna be raised

3366
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:43,660
Because you know

3367
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:45,660
When I see certain Kickstarters

3368
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:47,660
That ask for thirty thousand

3369
02:35:47,660 --> 02:35:49,660
And I can't even put my head around what you do

3370
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:51,660
With thirty thousand dollars

3371
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:53,660
And get a hundred and twenty thousand dollars

3372
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:55,660
It's like

3373
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:57,660
Well they keep changing

3374
02:35:57,660 --> 02:35:59,660
They're allowed to I guess change their

3375
02:35:59,660 --> 02:36:01,660
Goals I guess on their

3376
02:36:01,660 --> 02:36:03,660
What they're gonna do

3377
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:05,660
I don't know

3378
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:07,660
As a consumer I want to know where every dollar is going

3379
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:09,660
You know

3380
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:11,660
As an investor

3381
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:13,660
And when you invest in a company

3382
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:15,660
There's these things called investor and shareholder

3383
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:17,660
Meetings where you talk about the company

3384
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:19,660
And the progress and where the money is going

3385
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:21,660
But really all that you are guaranteed out of that

3386
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:23,660
Is basically what you

3387
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:25,660
Slot you fit into

3388
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:27,660
As far as the rewards go

3389
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:29,660
That's all you're guaranteed

3390
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:31,660
And that's my problem with Kickstarter

3391
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:33,660
Well then don't donate the stuff that you're

3392
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:35,660
Unaware of

3393
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,660
But I will admit there are some Kickstarters

3394
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:39,660
And like the star control thing we talked about last week

3395
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:41,660
I have to admit I kind of want that cartridge

3396
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:43,660
That sounded pretty fucking awesome

3397
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:45,660
And you know I hear about people like

3398
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:47,660
Random and certainly

3399
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:49,660
The pink elephant in the room

3400
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:51,660
There's other Kickstarters that you know

3401
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:53,660
Obviously we're well aware of

3402
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:55,660
You know and I wish success for them

3403
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:57,660
But it's

3404
02:36:57,660 --> 02:36:59,660
It's just

3405
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:01,660
There's just something about it

3406
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:03,660
Like I just feel like the other shoe is gonna

3407
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,660
Drop on Kickstarter any day now

3408
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:07,660
It's gonna burst

3409
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:09,660
I don't know if I want to be there when it does

3410
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:11,660
Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer

3411
02:37:11,660 --> 02:37:13,660
Anyway

3412
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:15,660
Well I mean not everything gets

3413
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:17,660
Not everything gets you know

3414
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:19,660
Funded I mean there was the

3415
02:37:19,660 --> 02:37:21,660
Kickstarter for

3416
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:23,660
It was a sequel to

3417
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:25,660
Oh god I don't remember now what it's called

3418
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:27,660
It was a PSP game it wasn't very popular

3419
02:37:27,660 --> 02:37:29,660
But they were trying to get a sequel for it

3420
02:37:29,660 --> 02:37:31,660
And that fell through

3421
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:33,660
But there is some interesting

3422
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:35,660
Things on there and this is another one of those

3423
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:37,660
There's a

3424
02:37:37,660 --> 02:37:39,660
MMO on

3425
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:41,660
There if you can even call it

3426
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:43,660
It's called Class Realm it's being developed

3427
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:45,660
By

3428
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:47,660
Some people I want to say

3429
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:49,660
They're in the education

3430
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:51,660
System to

3431
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:53,660
Basically motivate

3432
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:55,660
Their students to read more

3433
02:37:55,660 --> 02:37:57,660
Participate in discussions more and study more

3434
02:37:57,660 --> 02:37:59,660
As well as learn

3435
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:01,660
And you know it's called Class Realm

3436
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:03,660
And it's kind of interesting

3437
02:38:03,660 --> 02:38:05,660
He says my kids are

3438
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:07,660
They're the best promoters

3439
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:09,660
As they're going around telling other students

3440
02:38:09,660 --> 02:38:11,660
How great it is and in my classroom the other kids

3441
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:13,660
Come in from other classes from math and science

3442
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:15,660
And they see the Class Realm

3443
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:17,660
Stuff on my wall and they want to do it

3444
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:19,660
And other teachers

3445
02:38:19,660 --> 02:38:21,660
Also have been hugely supportive and basically

3446
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:23,660
What he's trying to do is he's creating this

3447
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:25,660
Class Realm thing that's both free and paid

3448
02:38:25,660 --> 02:38:27,660
As well you can do the free

3449
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:29,660
Sharing the tools with the other

3450
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:31,660
Teachers and then the paid one

3451
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:33,660
You get additional things

3452
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:35,660
We covered this a few weeks ago

3453
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:37,660
It's pretty cool

3454
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:39,660
It's actually launched now and he's taking

3455
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:41,660
Donations and stuff

3456
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:43,660
You can pledge towards it

3457
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:45,660
I think it's kind of neat

3458
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:47,660
Alright

3459
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:49,660
Well let's move on to another story here

3460
02:38:49,660 --> 02:38:51,660
We talked about harmonics earlier

3461
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:53,660
In the show and I want to talk about them

3462
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:55,660
Again because everybody's kind of wondering

3463
02:38:55,660 --> 02:38:57,660
What are they going to do next? Obviously they have

3464
02:38:57,660 --> 02:38:59,660
The Xbox Live and Playstation Network thing

3465
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:01,660
That's coming but you know that can't be

3466
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:03,660
The only thing they've been working on for the past few years

3467
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:05,660
Well some rumors are leaking

3468
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:07,660
Out about what we might see very soon

3469
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:09,660
According to some different job listings

3470
02:39:09,660 --> 02:39:11,660
That were spotted harmonics

3471
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:13,660
Is looking for a narrative content

3472
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:15,660
And level designers

3473
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:17,660
And one software engineer

3474
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:19,660
They're going to be doing a project that's called

3475
02:39:19,660 --> 02:39:21,660
Quote a unique

3476
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:23,660
Motion gaming IP

3477
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:25,660
Hmmm

3478
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,660
It seeks an accomplished narrative designer

3479
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:29,660
To incorporate creative storylines

3480
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:31,660
Into gameplay on a unique

3481
02:39:31,660 --> 02:39:33,660
Motion gaming IP

3482
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:35,660
Could it be Dance Central 3

3483
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:37,660
Or is this something brand brand new

3484
02:39:37,660 --> 02:39:39,660
Dance Central 2 kind of tried

3485
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:41,660
To do the story thing but it was a little

3486
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:43,660
Silly but you don't expect much out of a music

3487
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:45,660
Game. Could harmonics be doing

3488
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:47,660
Something, I mean maybe it's Dance Central 3

3489
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:49,660
Maybe it's something totally

3490
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:51,660
Different. They said unique

3491
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:53,660
Yeah they did say unique

3492
02:39:53,660 --> 02:39:55,660
I mean harmonics

3493
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:57,660
Everything they put out has been pretty good

3494
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:59,660
Except for that free thing but

3495
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:01,660
Harmonics does a pretty darn good job

3496
02:40:01,660 --> 02:40:03,660
Even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy

3497
02:40:03,660 --> 02:40:05,660
But it was really an interesting little tool

3498
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:07,660
I'm really curious to see what they bring

3499
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:09,660
With this

3500
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:11,660
I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it

3501
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:15,660
But we'll see

3502
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:17,660
How about some other news

3503
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:19,660
Well

3504
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:21,660
Sega is making

3505
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:23,660
A kind of a console

3506
02:40:23,660 --> 02:40:25,660
For you to pee on

3507
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:27,660
It's called a Dreamcast

3508
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:29,660
Just kidding

3509
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:31,660
I love the Dreamcast

3510
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:33,660
It's a urine powered

3511
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:35,660
Video game system for Japanese toilets

3512
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:37,660
That's to be installed

3513
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:39,660
In bars and it

3514
02:40:39,660 --> 02:40:41,660
Measures

3515
02:40:41,660 --> 02:40:43,660
Urine speed but two different

3516
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:45,660
Effects

3517
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:47,660
And Hiroyuki Tanaka

3518
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:49,660
Who is a Sega spokesman

3519
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:51,660
It gives customers something to talk

3520
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:53,660
About when they come back from the bathroom

3521
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:55,660
It

3522
02:40:55,660 --> 02:40:57,660
It's basically called the toilet

3523
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:59,660
Toilet

3524
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:01,660
I get it

3525
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:03,660
It gives men

3526
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:05,660
Incentive to pee in the urinal

3527
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:07,660
To play mini games

3528
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:09,660
Instead of on the floor

3529
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:11,660
And it makes cleaner restrooms

3530
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:13,660
And

3531
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:15,660
Tanaka says

3532
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:17,660
We live in a day and age where you have to give

3533
02:41:17,660 --> 02:41:19,660
Incentive for grown men

3534
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:21,660
Please

3535
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:23,660
Don't go pee pee on the floor

3536
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:25,660
And they've had good feedback

3537
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:27,660
From customers that says toilet cleanliness

3538
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:29,660
Has improved

3539
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:31,660
Now get the price on this one Rob

3540
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:33,660
There's 130 units out there

3541
02:41:33,660 --> 02:41:35,660
At 150,000 yen

3542
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:37,660
A pop

3543
02:41:37,660 --> 02:41:39,660
Now just to be clear we have heard

3544
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:41,660
About this system before

3545
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:43,660
Cause there was the whole toilet jokes

3546
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:45,660
I've watched an informative video on this before

3547
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:47,660
But what Jamie's talking about is that

3548
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:49,660
Now Sega's putting it out there where it's

3549
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:51,660
Really accessible where anybody can get this

3550
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:53,660
You can get this for your personal bathroom if you want

3551
02:41:53,660 --> 02:41:55,660
If you're like into water sports or something weird

3552
02:41:55,660 --> 02:41:57,660
Well to clarify

3553
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,660
There's been a trickle of information

3554
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:01,660
About this

3555
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:03,660
The hardware itself is

3556
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:05,660
140,000 which is about

3557
02:42:05,660 --> 02:42:07,660
1700 bucks

3558
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:09,660
The mini games are

3559
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:11,660
10,000 yen a piece which is 125 dollars

3560
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:13,660
And you can get

3561
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:15,660
A 10 yen coin box

3562
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:17,660
That's 25,000

3563
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:19,660
So that you can pay to

3564
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:21,660
Pee I guess

3565
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:23,660
312 bucks pretty much

3566
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:25,660
For the box

3567
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:27,660
That's a terrible idea, pay to pee

3568
02:42:27,660 --> 02:42:29,660
And they have home options

3569
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:31,660
It'll be on Spirit Airlines

3570
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:33,660
Next week

3571
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:35,660
And now they have home version options

3572
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:37,660
Where you can pay

3573
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:39,660
2,000 dollars to

3574
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:41,660
Pay to pee in your own house

3575
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:43,660
But you can

3576
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:45,660
GioVidea who is a lady is in our chat room

3577
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:47,660
At vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households

3578
02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:49,660
Badly

3579
02:42:49,660 --> 02:42:51,660
Yes and in college restrooms

3580
02:42:51,660 --> 02:42:53,660
But this honestly

3581
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:55,660
What do ladies have?

3582
02:42:55,660 --> 02:42:57,660
We can pee

3583
02:42:57,660 --> 02:42:59,660
Maybe not directionally pee like men

3584
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:01,660
Cause you know it's really hard to aim when

3585
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:03,660
You know it's close to the hoo-ha

3586
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:05,660
But why take the fun out of trying?

3587
02:43:05,660 --> 02:43:07,660
We should have like poop pressure games

3588
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:09,660
Ew

3589
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,660
Ew

3590
02:43:11,660 --> 02:43:13,660
Ew

3591
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:15,660
Ew about the pee too

3592
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:17,660
At least pee is sterile

3593
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:19,660
Going to our chat room

3594
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:21,660
I really don't want to talk about this story anymore

3595
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:23,660
But I really need to

3596
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:25,660
You're the one who gave it to me

3597
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:27,660
The show where every gamer has a voice

3598
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:29,660
BlackWolf in our chat room at vognetwork.com

3599
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:31,660
Says sign in the men's bathroom

3600
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:33,660
Of the LAN center I did Friday night gaming at

3601
02:43:33,660 --> 02:43:35,660
You claim to have good aim

3602
02:43:35,660 --> 02:43:37,660
Now's your chance to prove it

3603
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,660
Okay

3604
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:41,660
When I was at the University of South Alabama

3605
02:43:41,660 --> 02:43:43,660
In the humanities building

3606
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:45,660
On the second floor in the ladies bathroom

3607
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:47,660
There was a little poem

3608
02:43:47,660 --> 02:43:49,660
Written on the wall in the stall

3609
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:51,660
That I would usually use

3610
02:43:51,660 --> 02:43:53,660
If you must pee upon the seat

3611
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:55,660
Wipe it off and keep it neat

3612
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:57,660
There was also

3613
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:59,660
Now get this

3614
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:01,660
A toilet seat cover that I saw

3615
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:03,660
On the top it says we aim to please

3616
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:05,660
You lift it up

3617
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:07,660
Please

3618
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:09,660
I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms

3619
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:11,660
We need to talk about this for a minute

3620
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:13,660
Because we don't pee all over everything

3621
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:15,660
I was at a gas station

3622
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:17,660
Driving to LA and I was at the gas station at

3623
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:19,660
3.30 in the morning because you know nature called

3624
02:44:19,660 --> 02:44:21,660
And I had to go but the men's restroom was closed

3625
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:23,660
So there was not a soul

3626
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:25,660
In this place so I said to my friend

3627
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:27,660
I said Victoria I want you to stand outside this door

3628
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:29,660
And if a woman comes don't let them in

3629
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:31,660
So I went in the women's restroom

3630
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:33,660
And you know I open the door and I'm like

3631
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:35,660
There's like flowers and shit in here

3632
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:37,660
It smells all

3633
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:39,660
perfume-y

3634
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:41,660
Like what the hell is this strange new

3635
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:43,660
world

3636
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:45,660
The only time I've seen like a nice bathroom

3637
02:44:45,660 --> 02:44:47,660
At this is like when you go to the steak house and have a nice

3638
02:44:47,660 --> 02:44:49,660
Dinner like those are the only men's restrooms

3639
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:51,660
That get decorated where maybe like the little

3640
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:53,660
Hand towels are in a basket

3641
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:55,660
But fucking flowers and shit

3642
02:44:55,660 --> 02:44:57,660
At a gas station

3643
02:44:57,660 --> 02:44:59,660
Check who owns the gas station

3644
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:01,660
I have been in some pretty

3645
02:45:01,660 --> 02:45:03,660
Shithole gas station bathrooms

3646
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:05,660
For women so do not

3647
02:45:05,660 --> 02:45:07,660
Even go there it was

3648
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:09,660
The chevron

3649
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:11,660
On the way back from Pensacola

3650
02:45:11,660 --> 02:45:13,660
That's right when you get back into Mobile off the

3651
02:45:13,660 --> 02:45:15,660
Causeway ugh never go there it's

3652
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:17,660
Awful

3653
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:19,660
Alright we're gonna move on

3654
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:21,660
To some other stories quite quickly

3655
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:23,660
But I do want to point out cause everybody

3656
02:45:23,660 --> 02:45:25,660
In chat was like how many listeners did you lose

3657
02:45:25,660 --> 02:45:27,660
During that segment we gained

3658
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:29,660
One suckas

3659
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:31,660
You got told

3660
02:45:31,660 --> 02:45:33,660
When in doubt potty jokes

3661
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:35,660
Alright moving on

3662
02:45:35,660 --> 02:45:37,660
We should talk more about that stuff

3663
02:45:37,660 --> 02:45:39,660
Let's talk about Microsoft

3664
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:41,660
Coming soon to the VoG network

3665
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:43,660
Poo poo pee pee show

3666
02:45:43,660 --> 02:45:45,660
I'm kidding I'm kidding

3667
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:47,660
Microsoft has patented

3668
02:45:47,660 --> 02:45:49,660
Some sort of arm band

3669
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:51,660
That has

3670
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:53,660
EMG sensors as well as other

3671
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:55,660
Electrodes in there

3672
02:45:55,660 --> 02:45:57,660
Basically what it does is it monitors your muscle

3673
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:59,660
So for example

3674
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:01,660
You know they would have it programmed

3675
02:46:01,660 --> 02:46:03,660
To where like if you made a fist or something like that

3676
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:05,660
That your character would make a fist

3677
02:46:05,660 --> 02:46:07,660
Kind of like an extension to like

3678
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:09,660
The motion tracking and stuff

3679
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:11,660
And you know I guess it could be

3680
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:13,660
Applied to other

3681
02:46:13,660 --> 02:46:15,660
Parts of your body like your leg or something like that

3682
02:46:15,660 --> 02:46:17,660
But it is kind of interesting

3683
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:19,660
That they're gonna have some

3684
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:21,660
Potentially gonna have some sort of device

3685
02:46:21,660 --> 02:46:23,660
That allows you to track yourself a little

3686
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:25,660
Better

3687
02:46:25,660 --> 02:46:27,660
Pretty soon

3688
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:29,660
I'm just worried about how far those things

3689
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:31,660
Are gonna evolve

3690
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:33,660
It is a device

3691
02:46:33,660 --> 02:46:35,660
That you wrap around an appendage

3692
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:37,660
So the TTP for that

3693
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:39,660
How soon?

3694
02:46:41,660 --> 02:46:43,660
If you don't know what that is

3695
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:45,660
Just move right along

3696
02:46:45,660 --> 02:46:47,660
Alright a moment

3697
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:49,660
Of silence please because

3698
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:51,660
Like when I heard

3699
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:53,660
This news this week

3700
02:46:53,660 --> 02:46:55,660
I almost wanted to call

3701
02:46:55,660 --> 02:46:57,660
The hotline

3702
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,660
And send some help

3703
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:01,660
Over to one of our authors

3704
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:03,660
OrangeLawnTrader.com's house

3705
02:47:03,660 --> 02:47:05,660
To make sure he was okay

3706
02:47:05,660 --> 02:47:07,660
La Munana

3707
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:09,660
In North America and Europe

3708
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:11,660
Has been cancelled on WiiWare

3709
02:47:11,660 --> 02:47:13,660
And Dark Tetsuya

3710
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:15,660
Bless his heart

3711
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:17,660
Was really excited about that game

3712
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:19,660
Like really excited about that game

3713
02:47:19,660 --> 02:47:21,660
And it was in development

3714
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:23,660
And in development

3715
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:25,660
And finally they just said

3716
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:27,660
Fuck it we're not releasing

3717
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,660
It on the Wii now there is some

3718
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:31,660
Good news it is coming out on the PC

3719
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:33,660
So you know maybe it'll be on Steam

3720
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:35,660
Or something like that but uh

3721
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:37,660
It was cancelled they did uh

3722
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:39,660
I thought that was already on PC

3723
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:41,660
Uh I think this is like a

3724
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:43,660
Plus version or like an enhanced version

3725
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:45,660
Of the game that's coming out

3726
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:47,660
You know we were waiting on it for two years and basically

3727
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:49,660
At the end of the day they just came out and said

3728
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:51,660
WiiWare ain't profitable anymore

3729
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:53,660
That's what everyone's been saying

3730
02:47:53,660 --> 02:47:55,660
That's something they need to fix

3731
02:47:55,660 --> 02:47:57,660
And a lot of that is Nintendo shitty guidelines

3732
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:59,660
Where it's like you have to sell so many units before

3733
02:47:59,660 --> 02:48:01,660
You even get like a check

3734
02:48:01,660 --> 02:48:03,660
Keep that up and you won't have anybody but

3735
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:05,660
Yourselves publishing on

3736
02:48:05,660 --> 02:48:07,660
That service

3737
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:09,660
So uh

3738
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:11,660
You know just uh a moment

3739
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:13,660
Rest in peace La Munana

3740
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:15,660
On the Wii

3741
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:17,660
I mean at least it'll be coming out on the platform

3742
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:19,660
It's a cute game I was interested in it

3743
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:21,660
Why can't they put that on like you know Xbox

3744
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:23,660
Indie games or how we'll get that on like

3745
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:25,660
You know Xbox Live Arcade or something like that

3746
02:48:25,660 --> 02:48:27,660
Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it

3747
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:29,660
But it seems like they don't like to talk much

3748
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:31,660
Uh

3749
02:48:31,660 --> 02:48:33,660
Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show

3750
02:48:33,660 --> 02:48:35,660
Why Nintendo fails at digital distribution

3751
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:37,660
Sj100Matt says but then again

3752
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:39,660
It was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people

3753
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:41,660
Are not placing the blame on the makers

3754
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:43,660
Of La Mulana but they are placing the blame

3755
02:48:43,660 --> 02:48:45,660
Squarely at Nintendo's feet

3756
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,660
And uh I can't say I disagree with

3757
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:49,660
Shall we open up

3758
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:51,660

Rama just announced that he's a classy whore

3763
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:01,660

If you want to give our show a call

Or your opinion on what have you

3770
02:49:13,660 --> 02:49:15,660
Sadly Random is long gone now

3771
02:49:15,660 --> 02:49:17,660
He's off to work on something else

3772
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:19,660
We can't let you ask him a question but uh

3773
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:21,660
We can talk about what he talked about

3774
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:23,660
In the meantime do we have any last minute stories here in studio

3775
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:25,660
I'm going to fire up the Twitter and see if anyone

3776
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:27,660
Sent us anything to talk about on

3777
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:29,660
Twitter.com slash OLR

3778
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:31,660
But first

3779
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:33,660
I want my lungs to step in

3780
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:35,660
Oh never mind a call is coming in

3781
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:37,660
Look at that saved from last minute stories

3782
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:39,660
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

3783
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:41,660
It's that classy whore Rama

3784
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:43,660
Hi ho

3785
02:49:43,660 --> 02:49:45,660
Who am I?

3786
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:47,660
Hey ho what's up?

3787
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:49,660
Not too much

3788
02:49:49,660 --> 02:49:51,660
Porkchop wants to talk about poop

3789
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:53,660
I do have some things I want to cover before I get out of here

3790
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:55,660
And start off my hellish work week

3791
02:49:55,660 --> 02:49:57,660
Yep

3792
02:49:57,660 --> 02:49:59,660
Alright first things first

3793
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:01,660
As per orders of the great mighty powerful Rob

3794
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:03,660
I went to Chinatown Fair

3795
02:50:05,660 --> 02:50:07,660
Yeah I'm curious to hear what you thought about

3796
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:09,660
Chinatown Fair because what I read on Twitter

3797
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:11,660
Was interesting

3798
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:13,660
Uh oh

3799
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:15,660
That sums it up right there

3800
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:17,660
I

3801
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:19,660
I wasn't

3802
02:50:19,660 --> 02:50:21,660
I wasn't expecting this

3803
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:23,660
I really wasn't and I'm posting

3804
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:25,660
A link to the complete total

3805
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:27,660
Of eight photos I took

3806
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:29,660
There because all I needed was eight

3807
02:50:29,660 --> 02:50:31,660
Photos

3808
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:33,660
I mean

3809
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:35,660
It's not even trying

3810
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:37,660
To be a Dave and Busters

3811
02:50:37,660 --> 02:50:39,660
Wannabe

3812
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:41,660
It's like

3813
02:50:41,660 --> 02:50:43,660
The kid brother little bastard

3814
02:50:43,660 --> 02:50:45,660
Of Dave and Busters that nobody

3815
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,660
Talks to

3816
02:50:47,660 --> 02:50:49,660
Chuck E. Cheese?

3817
02:50:49,660 --> 02:50:51,660
Not even

3818
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:53,660
Not even

3819
02:50:53,660 --> 02:50:55,660
There's some ski ball and the spinny wheel for tickets

3820
02:50:55,660 --> 02:50:57,660
And a basketball thing

3821
02:50:57,660 --> 02:50:59,660
Terminator salvation is cool

3822
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:01,660
Guitar Hero arcade some people like

3823
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:03,660
If you notice over in the corner

3824
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:05,660
I only got one

3825
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:07,660
But right next to that one big screen TV

3826
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:09,660
There's another big screen TV

3827
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:11,660
That's not even on

3828
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:13,660
And

3829
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:15,660
Damn you have HDMI cables hooked up

3830
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:17,660
For the console

3831
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:19,660
Hey they got a Plinko game

3832
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,660
I didn't know they made those for the prices

3833
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:23,660
Oh Rob you and Plinko

3834
02:51:23,660 --> 02:51:25,660
I mean it looks like a lot of

3835
02:51:25,660 --> 02:51:27,660
Ok it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember

3836
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:29,660
Got replaced with ticket spitters

3837
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:31,660
Welcome to every other arcade in America

3838
02:51:31,660 --> 02:51:33,660
I mean it's sad but that's what's happened

3839
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:35,660
I know but I wasn't

3840
02:51:35,660 --> 02:51:37,660
Expecting something like this

3841
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:39,660
Though I mean

3842
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:41,660
From

3843
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:43,660
When I spoke to one of the guys who told me

3844
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:45,660
About this he flat out said

3845
02:51:45,660 --> 02:51:47,660
The new owner has no clue as to what

3846
02:51:47,660 --> 02:51:49,660
He's doing and he's trying to convince

3847
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:51,660
The owner to get in some actual

3848
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:53,660
Good games

3849
02:51:53,660 --> 02:51:55,660
Ok well that you know and it is

3850
02:51:55,660 --> 02:51:57,660
New arcade so let's give

3851
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:59,660
I mean yes it's an old arcade

3852
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:01,660
But it's new owners or whatever let's give

3853
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:03,660
Them a chance

3854
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:05,660
That's what everybody was saying because at first we're all

3855
02:52:05,660 --> 02:52:07,660
Outside sitting on the

3856
02:52:07,660 --> 02:52:09,660
Stoop bad mouthing

3857
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:11,660
And cursing up a storm about

3858
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:13,660
This and then we're like you know

3859
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:15,660
We'll give them about

3860
02:52:15,660 --> 02:52:17,660
30 days just to see

3861
02:52:17,660 --> 02:52:19,660
Yeah go back in a month and see what

3862
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,660
Changes if anything and if nothing changes

3863
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:23,660
Well then shit they didn't learn anything

3864
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:25,660
Um you know give it

3865
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:27,660
A chance

3866
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:29,660
We're trying and we're looking we're walking

3867
02:52:29,660 --> 02:52:31,660
Like the first thing we started

3868
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:33,660
Raging about the fact that there's a pump it up machine

3869
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:35,660
Because nobody plays pump it up

3870
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:37,660
It's funny in the picture that's the

3871
02:52:37,660 --> 02:52:39,660
Only machine I see a crowd around

3872
02:52:39,660 --> 02:52:41,660
That's the sad part

3873
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:43,660
It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets

3874
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:45,660
Well there was a

3875
02:52:45,660 --> 02:52:47,660
Terminator salvation machine I saw there too

3876
02:52:47,660 --> 02:52:49,660
And a couple others I mean

3877
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:51,660
Super bikes too

3878
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:53,660
Hey you know what Chinatown fair looks like

3879
02:52:53,660 --> 02:52:55,660
Right now Roseville Golfland

3880
02:52:55,660 --> 02:52:57,660
Welcome to my world

3881
02:52:57,660 --> 02:52:59,660
The funny thing is that's the first thing

3882
02:52:59,660 --> 02:53:01,660
That came to mind I'm like

3883
02:53:01,660 --> 02:53:03,660
Maybe

3884
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:05,660
I think this is it maybe we were on the same

3885
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:07,660
Wavelength at that time for that five

3886
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:09,660
Seconds Rob I'm so glad that the east

3887
02:53:09,660 --> 02:53:11,660
Coast now has a place where video games go to

3888
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:13,660
Die congratulations

3889
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:15,660
Yes

3890
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:17,660
We'll take that with a badge of honor

3891
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:19,660
Alright

Still in disgust from Chinatown fair

3896
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:29,660
I'm going to pretend I never

3897
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:31,660
Saw that. Alright go take a shower

3898
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:33,660
Alright

02:54:01,660 --> 02:54:03,660
Miyamoto's DS patent

3914
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:05,660
That will offer upgraded

3915
02:54:05,660 --> 02:54:07,660
Tourist hunting techniques

3916
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:09,660
That sounds kind of interesting I hadn't

3917
02:54:09,660 --> 02:54:11,660
Heard about this uh apparently

3918
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:13,660
If this

3919
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:15,660
Is a real deal

3920
02:54:15,660 --> 02:54:17,660
There could be some type of advancement in GPS

3921
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:19,660
Technology in tourist heavy areas

3922
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:21,660
Like museums and haunted house type

3923
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:23,660
Places and I'm imagining things like Disneyland

3924
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:25,660
Uh this patent would have a system

3925
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:27,660
Where an overhead grid

3926
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:29,660
Of infrared positional information

3927
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:31,660
Transmitters reads a user's

3928
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:33,660
DS to light up floor patterns

3929
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:35,660
And potential walkways

3930
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:37,660
The user can pick which route they'd like to take

3931
02:54:37,660 --> 02:54:39,660
Reading tourist facts along the way

3932
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:41,660
That sounds kind of interesting

3933
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:43,660
I guess the 3DS I didn't realize this already

3934
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:45,660
The 3DS will give guided tours

3935
02:54:45,660 --> 02:54:47,660
Of the Louvre in France

3936
02:54:47,660 --> 02:54:49,660
And it's really a pretty good

3937
02:54:49,660 --> 02:54:51,660
The Louvre

3938
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:53,660
Yo no speak French-o

3939
02:54:53,660 --> 02:54:55,660
Um it's doing a pretty good job I guess

3940
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:57,660
From what they say

3941
02:54:57,660 --> 02:54:59,660
That's kind of interesting it's an interesting use of the technology

3942
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:01,660
Technically

3943
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:03,660
There's iPhone apps and stuff

3944
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:05,660
That do all that but this

3945
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:07,660
Is a different way of implementing that technology

3946
02:55:07,660 --> 02:55:09,660
That you know would be pretty stable

3947
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:11,660
So sounds

3948
02:55:11,660 --> 02:55:13,660
Very interesting to me

3949
02:55:13,660 --> 02:55:15,660
Let's go to the phones and take another call

3950
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:17,660
Hi you're on orange country who's this?

3951
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:19,660
What's up buddy?

3952
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:21,660
Nothing much just trying to reiterate what

3953
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:23,660
Rama has said about CF

3954
02:55:23,660 --> 02:55:25,660
I heard it from my sources a few

3955
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:27,660
You know a couple of days before

3956
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:29,660
It opened that it was going to be radically different

3957
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:31,660
Like nothing

3958
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:33,660
It wasn't going to be anything near what

3959
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:35,660
The old CF was

3960
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:37,660
And I guess

3961
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:39,660
In a way it's

3962
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:41,660
You know I got to give them the benefit of the doubt that

3963
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:43,660
Sure they may have like a

3964
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:45,660
Rocky and

3965
02:55:45,660 --> 02:55:47,660
Some uneven open just for the fact that it's

3966
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:49,660
It's out of place for what

3967
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:51,660
People would normally

3968
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:53,660
Refer to as CF

3969
02:55:53,660 --> 02:55:55,660
But then again if the owner doesn't like

3970
02:55:55,660 --> 02:55:57,660
The owner doesn't make a change

3971
02:55:57,660 --> 02:55:59,660
Quickly then he's going to lose

3972
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:01,660
These folks for quite a while

3973
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:03,660
Because they're going to go to Brooklyn to next level arcade

3974
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:05,660
Where the remnants of CF

3975
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:07,660
Who used to run the place are

3976
02:56:07,660 --> 02:56:09,660
Pretty much alive and you know thriving there

3977
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:11,660
Especially the fighting community

3978
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:13,660
Let me play devil's advocate

3979
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:15,660
For a minute here because this is a question

3980
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:17,660
I should have asked on the last call

3981
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:19,660
Yeah they might lose the fans that used to go

3982
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:21,660
But is it possible that they'll gain fans

3983
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:23,660
I mean arcades do this for a reason right

3984
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:25,660
Yeah but it might be a demographic

3985
02:56:25,660 --> 02:56:27,660
That doesn't

3986
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:29,660
Doesn't like bode well

3987
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:31,660
For that area

3988
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:33,660
I mean the way I describe a CFer

3989
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:35,660
Is someone who's basically male

3990
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:37,660
About 20ish

3991
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:39,660
Into video games very competitive

3992
02:56:39,660 --> 02:56:41,660
So that type of demographic

3993
02:56:41,660 --> 02:56:43,660
Pretty much held that place together

3994
02:56:43,660 --> 02:56:45,660
For the last years

3995
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:47,660
Of its old existence

3996
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:49,660
Because

3997
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:51,660
It was mostly fighting games and to an extent

3998
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:53,660
Our community

3999
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:55,660
The DDR community

4000
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:57,660
So to have something that barely

4001
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:59,660
Resembles that and

4002
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:01,660
Something where the old guard of CF

4003
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:03,660
You know are pretty much

4004
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:05,660
At their own place right now that caters

4005
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:07,660
To that demographic it's like you're not going to

4006
02:57:07,660 --> 02:57:09,660
It's not going to do any justice right away

4007
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:11,660
If it's basically

4008
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:13,660
If that old location has

4009
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:15,660
Nothing more than just

4010
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,660
You know just like a mini D&B

4011
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:19,660
I mean that's

4012
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:21,660
Pretty much what I'm getting at

4013
02:57:21,660 --> 02:57:23,660
You have so much space

4014
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:25,660
That they crammed with arcade machines

4015
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:27,660
Left and right

4016
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:29,660
Like just about every place

4017
02:57:29,660 --> 02:57:31,660
Wall to wall just literally just covered in arcades

4018
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:33,660
And now they're just like

4019
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:35,660
There's not that many at the moment

4020
02:57:35,660 --> 02:57:37,660
But as I said I give them the benefit of the doubt

4021
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:39,660
So unless this new owner

4022
02:57:39,660 --> 02:57:41,660
Doesn't like

4023
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:43,660
Doesn't like

4024
02:57:43,660 --> 02:57:45,660
Unless this owner actually does

4025
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:47,660
Something in terms of writing

4026
02:57:47,660 --> 02:57:49,660
This course and trying to draw more people

4027
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:51,660
In there in order to stay alive

4028
02:57:51,660 --> 02:57:53,660
Let me ask this question though

4029
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:55,660
Is it maybe already a lost cause?

4030
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:57,660
It depends

4031
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:59,660
How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money

4032
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:01,660
I know of another place

4033
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:03,660
Like out in Queens in the city

4034
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:05,660
Peter Pan Gaines

4035
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:07,660
Is similar but it's more

4036
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:09,660
Lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere

4037
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:11,660
It's like the only

4038
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:13,660
In other words New York's only 2DX machine

4039
02:58:13,660 --> 02:58:15,660
Is out there as well as like

4040
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:17,660
An unlocked X2

4041
02:58:17,660 --> 02:58:19,660
But it has redemption games

4042
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:21,660
But the thing is that these redemption aren't just like

4043
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:23,660
Some Mickey Mouse prizes

4044
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:25,660
They're like real big ticket items like iPads

4045
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:27,660
And coupled with the fact that

4046
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:29,660
It's on a strip mall

4047
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:31,660
Which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood

4048
02:58:31,660 --> 02:58:33,660
So it's partly

4049
02:58:33,660 --> 02:58:35,660
What CF is but it's like

4050
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:37,660
What CF is right now is at an infancy of what

4051
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:39,660
Peter Pan Gaines is already at

4052
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:41,660
So it's at a point where

4053
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:43,660
Unless they start drawing in something

4054
02:58:43,660 --> 02:58:45,660
That will keep whales

4055
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:47,660
Like myself

4056
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:49,660
They'll draw them in there

4057
02:58:49,660 --> 02:58:51,660
In other words you'll have a clientele

4058
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:53,660
That will constantly spend money there

4059
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:55,660
And will keep your place alive

4060
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:57,660
They're just doomed to failure

4061
02:58:57,660 --> 02:58:59,660
They're gonna need that type of customer

4062
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:01,660
Or else they're just gonna succumb to whatever

4063
02:59:01,660 --> 02:59:03,660
They get if any

4064
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:05,660
Alright

4065
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:07,660
Well Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

4066
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:09,660
But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

4067
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:11,660
Other than

4068
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:13,660
Cheating in MLB 2K12

4069
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:15,660
I'm not a baseball fan but

4070
02:59:15,660 --> 02:59:17,660
The fact that people could game a

4071
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:19,660
Could actually exploit a game just to make money

4072
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:21,660
And 2K basically denying

4073
02:59:21,660 --> 02:59:23,660
Let them get away with it

4074
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:25,660
That the exploit was illegal

4075
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:27,660
Even though they originally said it was

4076
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:29,660
I guess

4077
02:59:29,660 --> 02:59:31,660
They have egg in their face right now

4078
02:59:31,660 --> 02:59:33,660
It's like tainted that whole competition

4079
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:35,660
They're gonna have a shitty finale

4080
02:59:35,660 --> 02:59:37,660
And they only have themselves to blame

4081
02:59:37,660 --> 02:59:39,660
Exactly

4082
02:59:39,660 --> 02:59:41,660
And they basically fell on their own sword

4083
02:59:41,660 --> 02:59:43,660
For basically denying

4084
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:45,660
That said cheat

4085
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:47,660
Was illegal even though it's technically

4086
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:49,660
Allowed

4087
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:51,660
Zaku I gotta let you go buddy

4088
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:53,660
Have a good one

4089
02:59:53,660 --> 02:59:55,660
Alright that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

4090
02:59:55,660 --> 02:59:57,660
I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through

4091
02:59:57,660 --> 02:59:59,660
The live listeners, podcasters I'm so

4092
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:01,660
Sorry but I only have one of these to give

4093
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:03,660
Away and I do want to give it to somebody

4094
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:05,660
Tonight that's stayed up with us

4095
03:00:05,660 --> 03:00:07,660
This late, don't worry Loki's competition

4096
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:09,660
He talked about that'll be open to everybody

4097
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:11,660
But we're gonna open this one up to just the live

4098
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:13,660
Listeners for right now, here's what it is

4099
03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:15,660
I've got a code courtesy of

4100
03:00:15,660 --> 03:00:17,660
Ranma for an

4101
03:00:17,660 --> 03:00:19,660
Xbox 360 avatar

4102
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:21,660
Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4

4103
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:23,660
Hoodie so if you want your avatar on

4104
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:25,660
Xbox to be wearing a hoodie

4105
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:27,660
We're gonna give one of these away and the good news is

4106
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:29,660
You can actually use this with male or female

4107
03:00:29,660 --> 03:00:31,660
There's a male code and a female code

4108
03:00:31,660 --> 03:00:33,660
So technically you get two codes

4109
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:35,660
So I'm gonna give it to one person so maybe one for you

4110
03:00:35,660 --> 03:00:37,660
And one for your SO or what have you

4111
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:39,660
All you have to do is send me a private

4112
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:41,660
Message in our chat room at vognetwork.com

4113

I don't care, tell me one reason

4118

You love vog, it can be as silly or as serious

4119

Random person

To receive a Sonic 4

4124
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:05,660
Hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks

03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:07,660
Network tonight, so there you go

4126
03:01:07,660 --> 03:01:09,660
And Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought

4127
03:01:09,660 --> 03:01:11,660
To you by Anime Jam Session, yes fair enough

4128
03:01:11,660 --> 03:01:13,660
Fair enough, check out Anime Jam Session

4129
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:15,660
At

4130
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:17,660
AnimeJamSession.com

4131
03:01:17,660 --> 03:01:19,660
Alright send those private messages into Skye right now

4132
03:01:19,660 --> 03:01:21,660
And while I collect those messages you have

4133
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:23,660
About three minutes to do that

4134
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:25,660
Loki

4135
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:27,660
So yeah

4136
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:29,660
I have to

4137
03:01:29,660 --> 03:01:31,660
I guess the last minute story

4138
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:33,660
Taito put out a game for Akira

4139
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:35,660
About 25 years ago

4140
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:37,660
On the Famicom and it's finally been

4141
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:39,660
Fan translated, so you can check that

4142
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:41,660
There's a patch available for that

4143
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:43,660
Yeah

4144
03:01:43,660 --> 03:01:45,660
So it's out there

4145
03:01:45,660 --> 03:01:47,660
Just Google it

4146
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:49,660
Yeah

4147
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:51,660
Yeah I was just gonna

4148
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:53,660
I was gonna talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing

4149
03:01:53,660 --> 03:01:55,660
This kinda sucks

4150
03:01:55,660 --> 03:01:57,660
Basically the exploit they used is they

4151
03:01:57,660 --> 03:01:59,660
Adjusted the lineup of batters

4152
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:01,660
On the opposing team

4153
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,660
And removed the best players

4154
03:02:03,660 --> 03:02:05,660
And so it made it a little bit easier to

4155
03:02:05,660 --> 03:02:07,660
Pitch a perfect game with

4156
03:02:07,660 --> 03:02:09,660
People that can't hit a ball

4157
03:02:09,660 --> 03:02:11,660
Or can't hit a ball as well as some of the other people

4158
03:02:11,660 --> 03:02:13,660
Apparently

4159
03:02:13,660 --> 03:02:15,660
Some people didn't do that

4160
03:02:15,660 --> 03:02:17,660
But

4161
03:02:17,660 --> 03:02:19,660
I guess a portion of the top

4162
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:21,660
8 did

4163
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:23,660
And that kinda sucks

4164
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:25,660
Including one actually

4165
03:02:25,660 --> 03:02:27,660
Completely admitted to doing that and

4166
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:29,660
They have evidence of that

4167
03:02:29,660 --> 03:02:31,660
2k came out and

4168
03:02:31,660 --> 03:02:33,660
Originally they were like oh well that's against the rules

4169
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:35,660
And then they're like well

4170
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:37,660
No it's not or well we

4171
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:39,660
Stand by you know

4172
03:02:39,660 --> 03:02:41,660
The people that we chose as the top 8

4173
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:45,660
So they're just kinda rolling with it

4174
03:02:45,660 --> 03:02:47,660
And I mean if you think about it

4175
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,660
They fucked up and they didn't program

4176
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:51,660
This exclusive mode

4177
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:53,660
For this the perfect pitch mode or whatever

4178
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:55,660
Perfect game challenge

4179
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:57,660
They fucked it up

4180
03:02:57,660 --> 03:02:59,660
And unfortunately

4181
03:02:59,660 --> 03:03:01,660
I guess they'll just next year

4182
03:03:01,660 --> 03:03:03,660
Patch that out but

4183
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:05,660
It is unfortunate that they don't just

4184
03:03:05,660 --> 03:03:07,660
Start the whole thing over again

4185
03:03:07,660 --> 03:03:09,660
But that's the way that is

4186
03:03:11,660 --> 03:03:13,660
Alright

4187
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:15,660
Any last minute stories? Sorry I'm not totally paying

4188
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:17,660
I'm trying to collect the vog stuff

4189
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:19,660
Alright guys we're gonna close it up

4190
03:03:19,660 --> 03:03:21,660
The contest here we go

4191
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:23,660
I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read DarkSakura

4192
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:25,660
And Loki these answers here you tell me which ones your favorite

4193
03:03:25,660 --> 03:03:27,660
I'm not gonna tell you who said it okay so here it is

4194
03:03:27,660 --> 03:03:29,660
And we'll pick a winner from this so reasons you love

4195
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:31,660
VOG here we go I love

4196
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:33,660
VOG because it supports and promotes the

4197
03:03:33,660 --> 03:03:35,660
Indie side of gaming music and geekdom

4198
03:03:35,660 --> 03:03:37,660
Because listening to

4199
03:03:37,660 --> 03:03:39,660
VOG at work makes my day enjoyable

4200
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:41,660
Because we can chant VOG at

4201
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:43,660
Wrestling events V-O-G

4202
03:03:43,660 --> 03:03:45,660
V-O-G

4203
03:03:45,660 --> 03:03:47,660
I love VOG because it's got a host who asks Jiggly

4204
03:03:47,660 --> 03:03:49,660
Kayente a question on the reunion of Drag Race

4205
03:03:49,660 --> 03:03:51,660
I love VOG because

4206
03:03:51,660 --> 03:03:53,660
I want that stupid Sonic hoodie for

4207
03:03:53,660 --> 03:03:55,660
Name Redacted because he would be so excited

4208
03:03:55,660 --> 03:03:57,660
And that would keep him quiet for the whole night

4209
03:03:57,660 --> 03:03:59,660
I love VOG because

4210
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:01,660
Every gamer has a voice

4211
03:04:01,660 --> 03:04:03,660
OLR is a great reason I love VOG

4212
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:05,660
Reason I love VOG

4213
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:07,660
OLR is on it duh

4214
03:04:07,660 --> 03:04:09,660
I love VOG because I can make the initials mean

4215
03:04:09,660 --> 03:04:11,660
Dumb stuff

4216
03:04:11,660 --> 03:04:13,660
VOG is the only live podcast network I listen

4217
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:15,660
To often and look forward to the

4218
03:04:15,660 --> 03:04:17,660
Bobby Blackwell Show and Orange Lounge Radio every week

4219
03:04:19,660 --> 03:04:21,660
It's a tough one

4220
03:04:21,660 --> 03:04:23,660
What do you guys think? You like the very first one?

4221
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:25,660
I love VOG because it

4222
03:04:25,660 --> 03:04:27,660
Supports and promotes the Indie side of gaming music

4223
03:04:27,660 --> 03:04:29,660
And geekdom

4224
03:04:29,660 --> 03:04:31,660
I could go with that alright congratulations

4225
03:04:31,660 --> 03:04:33,660
SSJ100 Matt the code's yours

4226
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:35,660
Good job

4227
03:04:35,660 --> 03:04:37,660
A winner is you

4228
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:39,660
SSJ100 Matt I'll email that to you later

4229
03:04:39,660 --> 03:04:41,660
Alright good answers though

4230
03:04:41,660 --> 03:04:43,660
Thank you for playing

4231
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:45,660
I bet one of those was Shane

4232
03:04:45,660 --> 03:04:47,660
Yes the Shane was the one with the Name Redacted

4233
03:04:47,660 --> 03:04:49,660
Because this sounded like

4234
03:04:49,660 --> 03:04:51,660
Something you would say

4235
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:53,660
I would have picked the Jiggly Kayente one personally

4236
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:55,660
But sorry I should have stated you'd have to woo the other host over too

4237
03:04:55,660 --> 03:04:57,660
Alright

4238
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:59,660
Alright

4239
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:01,660
So congratulations again SSJ100

4240
03:05:01,660 --> 03:05:03,660
Matt the code is yours

4241
03:05:03,660 --> 03:05:05,660
And honestly if I had not been aware of

4242
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:07,660
RuPaul's Drag Race Jiggly

4243
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:09,660
Kayante sounds like a flavor of a Jello

4244
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:11,660
Jiggler

4245
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:13,660
Alright

4246
03:05:13,660 --> 03:05:15,660
