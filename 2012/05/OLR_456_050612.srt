00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:23,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is a reality, and we talk to video game hip-hop artist MegaRan.

2
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:37,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live with episode number 456.

5
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's 456 of our show on this May the 6th.

6
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:49,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 5-6, 2012.

7
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,706
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show.

8
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:02,912
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.

9
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:13,801
[SPEAKER_10]: To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Men, to paraphrase I should say, but money isn't dead, but money is life!

11
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:15,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Men?

12
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,343
[SPEAKER_10]: He was the leader of the Disco Boys?

13
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:19,024
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Eddie Izzard?

14
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:22,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for that movie when I saw it.

15
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:23,607
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie was great.

16
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:26,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay, but I saw it so long ago.

17
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Avengers, Avengers, Avengers.

18
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,493
[SPEAKER_02]: The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only Techmaster Loki!

19
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:32,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I have also not seen the Avengers.

20
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:33,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You both are lame.

21
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:51,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Snake360Dude

22
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,563
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

24
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of, and he was on the show.

25
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:41,507
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wasn't taking the interview because he did, you know, was he plugging the new game?

26
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:45,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview.

27
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, where is the new game?

28
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:47,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?

29
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,157
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on.

30
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:50,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

31
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Beggars can't be choosers.

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him take his time.

33
00:02:54,421 --> 00:03:00,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like, hey, guys, who do you want us to interview on the show?

34
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, within reason.

35
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:03,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-AimÃ©, okay?

36
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not, you know, a television network or something.

37
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:07,654
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to get, you know, those folks.

38
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:13,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we kind of fielded some of the responses, and one idea that I really liked was getting

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a chick, I thought I was in love before, but I

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That song is called Splash Woman, and you can hear it in the background, like that riff.

41
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:50,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he has some verses that he's laying down about Splash Woman, or his Splash Woman.

42
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brilliant.

43
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:51,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

44
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I can't play the whole thing.

45
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:00,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing there or iTunes or whatever.

46
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,744
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's one of his bigger well-known songs, Splash Woman.

47
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:03,564
[SPEAKER_09]: That was amazing.

48
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:06,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got to do more.

49
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:07,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got like a Mega Man 9.

50
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:08,686
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a Mega Man 10.

51
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to ask him about some of his other projects.

52
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not just a Capcom guy.

53
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:12,948
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got Final Fantasy.

54
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:16,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact.

55
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a Mega Man fan who saw the shout-out on Twitter and all that, who's waiting for him to come on the show...

56
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:24,136
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here.

57
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,639
[SPEAKER_02]: But join our chat room because we are a live show.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview.

59
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com.

60
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts.

61
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we get going, when we get random on the phone, you can ask those questions.

62
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:49,780
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

63
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you'll join us live sometime, even if you missed our action-packed show tonight.

64
00:04:54,583 --> 00:05:08,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually like to kind of have a kickoff topic, and we kind of got into it a little bit already, but everybody's talking about, everybody, everybody in the geek world is talking about the Avengers.

65
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I know you were there.

66
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you went and saw the Avengers movie.

67
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a comic fan.

68
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a Marvel fan.

69
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joss.

70
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

71
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joss Whedon.

72
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a Joss Whedon fan.

73
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,664
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the Avengers movie?

74
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:22,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

75
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,408
[SPEAKER_10]: It was beautiful.

76
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,491
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today.

77
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:31,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had allergies.

78
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

79
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,038
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass.

80
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:57,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, please.

81
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:01,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me.

82
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

83
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
[SPEAKER_02]: In full 3D.

84
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie.

85
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:08,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

86
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a new ship.

87
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:33,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because oh my god aren't there I know I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites but I think I read something about because you know I read all that trash I think I read something something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson they've been flirty like there's pictures of them on the red carpet flirty so hmm

88
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:34,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

89
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:36,382
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty.

90
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett Johansson, so you know.

91
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's all because of him is the whole reason I went to see that Mission Impossible movie.

92
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Him and Simon Pegg, because hello.

93
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I can say, first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss death.

94
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:56,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I will not tell you who.

95
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,155
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye.

96
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:00,056
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

97
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:00,116
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

98
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:06,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man!

99
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I did with Wash.

100
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:09,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

101
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And stay during the credits.

102
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, oh my god.

103
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that meme you showed me earlier?

104
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,841
[SPEAKER_02]: One does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits.

105
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:36,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, because now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the, because you know there's that lovely designed bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who was in it, who were in it, sorry, and then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil, but if nobody gets it, please ask me.

106
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:41,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants.

107
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And then... By the very end of the movie.

108
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And really listen very carefully to the dialogue right before the credits.

109
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:50,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I'm having to say.

110
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chat.

111
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:53,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatters, don't spoil.

112
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,107
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spoil, you're getting kicked.

113
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your spoiling to the private messages.

114
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your spoiling to the private messages.

115
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Just double-click on somebody's name and you can private message them.

116
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can talk... Double-click on DarkSakura.

117
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I will gush to you while you're in the show, okay?

118
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:07,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to her.

119
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:08,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

120
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly.

121
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chat room real quick at vognetwork.com.

122
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:19,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner.

123
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,332
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken over the Bourne movies.

124
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:25,016
[SPEAKER_02]: The Matt Damon Bourne Conspiracy, all that stuff.

125
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Those Bourne movies are pretty awesome, actually.

126
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that.

127
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:28,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you think so.

128
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: He's better than Matt Damon.

129
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:32,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

130
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Matt Damon.

131
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't care about the Bourne movies.

132
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:38,049
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, I give it to Joss Whedon.

133
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts.

134
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:40,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were a lot of people.

135
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear this?

136
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:53,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter, you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but 200 million plus for the Avengers this weekend.

137
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-mm.

138
00:08:55,346 --> 00:09:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is the other real telling thing I thought Hunger Games beat that no, no, Hunger Games didn't beat it either I mean Hunger Games was huge but didn't beat it A plus CinemaScore and CinemaScore, those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie I actually polled for them once they were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was but they polled me on it

139
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:20,343
[SPEAKER_02]: and they actually take, you know, they grade it A plus rating from CinemaScore.

140
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, hey, this movie doesn't suck.

141
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:26,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see it.

142
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:33,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to some other chats, Panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right, in the VOG Network chat room said, Avengers did something amazing.

143
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it.

144
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,520
[SPEAKER_10]: because hello, who else could do that but the Joss?

145
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, everybody was characterized perfectly.

147
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,463
[SPEAKER_10]: The interaction was perfect.

148
00:09:52,183 --> 00:10:02,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those of you who read Ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first, it really does seem like it's based a bit more off of Ultimates with a good splash of 616 Universe in it.

149
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:07,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's really good.

150
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks.

151
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'd pay to see that, that's for sure.

152
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:17,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I would pay for that Star Wars slash Avengers movie.

153
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:24,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is, and it's not a spoiler, because they did the first half of it in the trailer.

154
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:30,730
[SPEAKER_10]: is this whole scene where Iron Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing the party to you.

155
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on her face saying, I don't see how this is a party.

156
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,672
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best line in the whole movie.

157
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,173
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.

158
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day.

159
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:47,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was an Avengers video game.

160
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:51,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I was going to ask, where is the video game?

161
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming.

162
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Strike while the iron is hot.

163
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always... Rush the game out?

164
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's perfect.

165
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:01,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have a sub-party.

166
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you'd planned better, it would have been out for the movie.

167
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I want them to do something like Ultimate Alliance, honestly, because that was both...

168
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,257
[SPEAKER_10]: The second one did the whole Civil War thing and it was kind of crap.

169
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,280
[SPEAKER_10]: But the first one, I love the gameplay in both of the games.

170
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,261
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just fantastic.

171
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:22,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in Ultimate Alliance style.

172
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,285
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so going to our chat room.

173
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:25,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a hater.

174
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a hater in the chat room.

175
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every big fandom is going to have its haters.

176
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma's in the chat room saying, Fuck Joss Whedon.

177
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,812
[SPEAKER_02]: James Cameron will come back strong with Avatar 2.

178
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:39,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because he came out strong with Avatar 1.

179
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:41,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some cheesy piece of shit.

180
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, look, Loki.

181
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

182
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:50,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because everybody bought into, oh my god, I have to see this in 3D, my eyes will be blown out of my head.

183
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just such a terrible story.

184
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't bad.

185
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It was terrible.

186
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those movies people don't want to admit they like, just like Titanic.

187
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:00,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, may I please?

188
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:01,617
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

189
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry about rip-offs and who's going to come out on top.

190
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:10,762
[SPEAKER_10]: There hasn't been a real original idea since the 60s maybe.

191
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:12,983
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all going to take your money.

192
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:13,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be real.

193
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:18,386
[SPEAKER_10]: One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative.

194
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:20,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Deal the fuck with it.

195
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,328
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to make Titanic more 3D.

196
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:23,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what's going to happen.

197
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Deal with it.

198
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:26,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Falling sunglasses.

199
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Technus in our chatroom says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good.

200
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:35,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

201
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

202
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:44,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, given the big preview of the next movie, Joss has to do it.

203
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:51,119
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and please forgive me for saying this, Chris Claremont.

204
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers.

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,780
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

206
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just have Treyarch do it, and then they'll add zombies.

207
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:08,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that, and yeah, he did kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont was the man.

208
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,753
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the one who gave us Dark Phoenix.

209
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:19,458
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel bin and made it the top A player it is now, so...

210
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:26,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward to a lot.

211
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The Avengers, I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but I'm into it.

212
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Iron Man movie.

213
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good, and all the movies were good.

214
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:32,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go see it.

215
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to see it opening weekend.

216
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew the crowds were going to be insane.

217
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:39,346
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget, Joss Whedon also wrote comics.

218
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,388
[SPEAKER_10]: He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out.

219
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,431
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to.

220
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,493
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care.

221
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week.

222
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see it.

223
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people are like, it looks stupid.

224
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:59,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival.

225
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what made it awesome.

226
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:09,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little worried because I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot but if they did it right, it's going to be a fun time.

227
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to that cautiously.

228
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,711
[SPEAKER_02]: and Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw-free goddess.

229
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:16,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw-free goddess.

230
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:17,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Helena Bonham Carter.

231
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a flaw-free goddess.

232
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about.

233
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:22,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

234
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: With Michelle Pfeiffer.

235
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:24,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

236
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:25,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see anything with her in it.

237
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I have that on HD DVD.

238
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:34,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat through an Oprah Book of the Month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer because I love her that much.

239
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:57,007
[SPEAKER_02]: and hello the best the only Catwoman which leads me to I am still excited a lot about this Batman movie really really excited about the third Batman movie you know I'm kind of two thoughts about that one but you know what preview I saw that I will be there to see because I love the original so much Frank and Weenie

240
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm serious.

241
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:01,357
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks adorable.

242
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And I freaking love Frank and Weenie, so shut up.

243
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:04,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't judge.

244
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:05,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you judging.

245
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm judging a little bit.

246
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:06,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop judging me.

247
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:14,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, as much as we love to talk movies and all that It's all about the Tron series starting in June Tron!

248
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:33,595
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all agree on that, Tron is king, yes Disney XD, I am there Finally, OLR Avengers assemble, Tron OLRians assemble Thank god we agree on something As long as I get to be Hawkeye There's no Hawkeye in Tron, you fool

249
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be Hawkeye and Tron.

250
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have to say, I have to say.

251
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry up, we gotta get to games.

252
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,506
[SPEAKER_10]: You know why there were all these Disney trailers before?

253
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,870
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel.

254
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:54,217
[SPEAKER_10]: But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers, Duntron style.

255
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:55,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I saw that.

256
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

257
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they were epic.

258
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved them as Marvel.

259
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,660
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, okay.

260
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,541
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

261
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in our chat, vognetwork.com.

262
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Spider-Man trailer was good.

263
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, games, games, games.

264
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Games hat.

265
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:09,225
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

266
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: What kinds of games did you play this week?

267
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:15,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet has been crap all week.

268
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the last week before finals.

269
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I've also had a crap ton of design work to do.

270
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mass Effect came out of the box.

271
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:24,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

272
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,973
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't get played, but it got opened.

273
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:28,153
[SPEAKER_02]: You tease.

274
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

275
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:31,814
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, Frankenweenie, really.

276
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:32,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankenweenie's awesome.

277
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:33,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

278
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:34,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Zombie dogs.

279
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:34,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

280
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:44,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did play through some Portal 2, and I played a little bit of WoW, but like, okay, this is what was so stupid.

281
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

282
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:50,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I get in queue, and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me

283
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Fart, angry farts.

284
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

285
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:58,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to play WoW, and I was in queue.

286
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:02,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I didn't realize how close I was to a level, so I did a cooking daily.

287
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:04,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Level, got kicked out of queue.

288
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:05,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shoot.

289
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,110
[SPEAKER_10]: At 13 minutes of waiting in queue, so I get kicked out.

290
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

291
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily.

292
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:34,363
[SPEAKER_10]: um so then I get back in another queue and we all get in everything's happy we're in there yay queue and then oh I'm gonna leave log off fine offline what everybody leaves the party as soon as I get my quest I'm like all of you suck and I just logged off for the day dying 100 fires

293
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Make the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.

294
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:45,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And you didn't even get... Here I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and your anger rant about Children's Week.

295
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And speaking of things... I'm saving that for the FUs of the week.

296
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I cannot get my Drake this year because of Children's Week.

297
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:56,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Whores.

298
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,079
[SPEAKER_02]: She just wanted her virtual pony.

299
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this like bring your child to your virtual world day?

300
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,725
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's bring your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little five-year-old wander behind you while you're in the firelands.

301
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: She's right.

302
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly like that.

303
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:11,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

304
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,448
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like I was telling... That seems very unsafe.

305
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:21,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I was telling Becky, and Becky doesn't, she's not really into WoW, she doesn't play it, nothing of that.

306
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I was telling her about Children's Week and her reply was, oh my god.

307
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:42,462
[SPEAKER_10]: that's fucked up and it's the best place to when you have to do the five dailies thing the fastest place to get it done is Firelands if you're 85 so just run them through oh this thing is setting you on fire oh you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going this is cool

308
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:46,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement.

309
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:46,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you do.

310
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Called bad example.

311
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you do.

312
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

313
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you give them a gun and a kite.

314
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday, actually.

315
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of disturbing.

316
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:04,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron.

317
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:05,692
[SPEAKER_10]: She has to deal with you now.

318
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:06,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not my problem.

319
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem.

320
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe?

321
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just like...

322
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:13,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

323
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:35,843
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

324
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Zeba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for DarkSakura.

325
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stop playing WoW then.

326
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:04,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

327
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Picaruna wants me to be on Horde House, Rob.

328
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We can arrange that.

329
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,524
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come back on Horde House.

330
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:09,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

331
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:14,092
[SPEAKER_02]: HordeHouse.com is the spinoff show all about Warcraft.

332
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:17,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games, Loki, I know you got something else to talk about.

333
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:37,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't play a while, so I play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and honestly, that's all I really played this week because I only played it at work, and the rest of the time I've been working on my Portal 2 papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, about 99% done with the body of the portal turret.

334
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:42,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that amazing Portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a cake falling through a portal?

335
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:43,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on my Tumblr.

336
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:44,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

337
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:44,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

338
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:44,793
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta see it.

339
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:45,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

340
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll find it and link my Tumblr.

341
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone should be looking at my Tumblr.

342
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,136
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Kuro Tsubasa.

343
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:59,803
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guest Omega Ran and the Fugo question we're gonna get into is, you know, creating art inspired by video games.

344
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:07,068
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about, and you're basically making art based on Portal 2, granted it might be on a template that's already out there or whatever with your own flair,

345
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:12,412
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real world?

346
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:13,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're funny.

347
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,135
[SPEAKER_03]: They're funny little things.

348
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some.

349
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't count the stuffed ones because they look stupid.

350
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:32,211
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA, for example, made a full-size portal turret that talked in like, you know, shot airsoft BBs or something like that, I would probably buy two or three.

351
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't know.

352
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:39,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it because it was a cheap project.

353
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:43,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, although now that I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want to look a little bit better.

354
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:53,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I have to use Bondo and Plex, or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a load of fun, except it's not.

355
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:57,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I, I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.

356
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we'll see.

357
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now.

358
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:07,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a Portal Tour in Maya as one of my final projects.

359
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:09,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember seeing that.

360
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

361
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,339
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just fun.

362
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:15,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's what I did.

363
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:23,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking at getting Portal 2 for... Redeeming my copy of Portal 2 on Steam that I have for my PS3.

364
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to do that or look at it or whatever.

365
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever.

366
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:29,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so cheap now.

367
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I can get it for a few bucks.

368
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:36,566
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too because of all the cool mods that they have.

369
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:42,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation 3 just because I'm missing out on all these darn mods.

370
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Sony said they were... Maybe I was just hallucinating but I thought Sony said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation 3.

371
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:54,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what did they ever do with the Steam stuff for Portal 2?

372
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

373
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's... I don't know.

374
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I may do that.

375
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:05,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I played a little bit of the Perfect Strangers advergame thing.

376
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:05,964
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of fun.

377
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:19,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I played it a few times because I liked reading the dream board that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and stuff of that nature.

378
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of funny.

379
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:24,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much all I played.

380
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

381
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:30,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to play some Skyrim this week.

382
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:37,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I dive back in, that's going to be another three months of my life.

383
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:44,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to be more than three months, because by the time I get to about three months, they'll release the expansion.

384
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:45,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

385
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Just over from there.

386
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was like, oh, no, Skyrim Online.

387
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Or not Skyrim Online.

388
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:50,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The Elder Scrolls Online.

389
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, ah, crap.

390
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to play this, aren't I?

391
00:23:55,227 --> 00:24:00,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started reading up on it, and I was like, well, maybe not.

392
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:02,329
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

393
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,270
[SPEAKER_02]: My Gaming Week.

394
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of new stuff.

395
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect.

396
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:09,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I played a lot of Mass Effect.

397
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get that out of the way.

398
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect 3, I'm playing more.

399
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:15,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of side missions, working on the main missions.

400
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:20,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys.

401
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say something involving the Citadel happened, and it was pretty awesome.

402
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: and then multiplayer.

403
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing that gets me.

404
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I am really into multiplayer in this game which you guys have to understand.

405
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:45,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really play a lot of Xbox Live games online especially things that are kind of like shooters although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter but it's a shooter.

406
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a shooter RPG hybrid.

407
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,436
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG.

408
00:24:49,716 --> 00:25:00,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, but my point is, I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox Live outside of arcade games and music games, like Rock Band, that I've played online that I truly enjoyed.

409
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, one of the last ones is like Halo 2.

410
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna go back that far.

411
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:32,292
[SPEAKER_02]: with your pink guy but I love Mass Effect 3 online and I think a big part of that and the community is great sometimes I hear random people yelling at people across the room in their own house but you don't hear the same stuff like FU and the racial slurs and the sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated with Xbox Live I don't hear it in Mass Effect 3

412
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:33,453
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

413
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, yeah, the fact that it's co-op, I think really leads to a different kind of community for the game.

414
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm sure it's not perfect.

415
00:25:57,434 --> 00:26:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Every community has their, you know, dumbasses.

416
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:04,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But this game's pretty awesome so far from my experience.

417
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm motivated to continue to play it online.

418
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:13,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits and doing all that stuff.

419
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, Mass Effect, good times.

420
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mass Effect 3 gets a big endorsement from me I haven't gotten to that ending yet I still am not spoiled on the ending yet I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it But let me tell you what I've been on this Mass Effect bandwagon I just started back in February And I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect 1 40 hours of Mass Effect 2 Maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect 3 That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played

421
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob what was a great experience.

422
00:26:51,532 --> 00:27:09,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up, or kind of say, that was shitty, or compare it to the ending of The Sopranos, which wasn't that great either, but I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of Mass Effect 3, it's so terrible, and the ending just ruined it for me.

423
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

424
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to our chatroom at chat.

425
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:13,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, I almost said the old one.

426
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to vognetwork.com.

427
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:19,724
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kaden.

428
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:27,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Technus says, Mass Effect 2 was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect game, but the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is.

429
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat so I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side.

430
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:57,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect 3 All that crap, out of the way All that crap, out of the way So, alright, one other game MegaRan's coming on in just a minute, we gotta call him But I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week A new game, Fez, on Xbox Live Arcade Because everybody's telling me Rob, this is like an 8-bit looking game with great music It's a puzzler, it is right up your fucking alley Go play this game

431
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,050
[SPEAKER_09]: You play Fez now?

432
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Fez is cool?

433
00:27:59,231 --> 00:27:59,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Fez is cool.

434
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

435
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Doctor Who reference.

436
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:02,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

437
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:03,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

438
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:07,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor Who reference or not, it's a pretty fun game.

439
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:13,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, the concept, it's the 2D world that you're in getting turned into a 3D world.

440
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:23,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2D scroller is suddenly like has four different sides because you don't really go up or down.

441
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like the four sides of a cube.

442
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:25,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know...

443
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,231
[SPEAKER_02]: How to unlock an antecube is in one of the achievements.

445
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Minor spoiler, but whatever.

446
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gamer tip.

447
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:01,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that.

448
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:04,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of depth to it.

449
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought I saw Picaruno.

450
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:11,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in our chat said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight because I was trying to get one of those freaking cubes in Fez to unlock.

451
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:18,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently it's like Castlevania Symphony of the Night where there's a pretty easy game in the beginning.

452
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:20,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just when you thought you beat it,

453
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:24,210
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

454
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:40,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game, hip-hop artist.

455
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:42,287
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes by Random as well.

456
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Mega Ran because, you know, Mega Man and all that stuff.

457
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, that was a lot of what he became famous for.

458
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,850
[SPEAKER_09]: But Airman can't be beaten.

459
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:53,132
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know, we played a clip from Splash Woman earlier.

460
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:55,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview.

461
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:58,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a talented guy, really into the art.

462
00:29:58,695 --> 00:29:59,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, you know, he's made it.

463
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:05,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bobby joked on his show earlier, he got on SportsCenter with a rap about Jeremy Lin.

464
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:07,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just restricted music.

465
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: to video games.

466
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:13,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I understand, even better, this guy is a teacher during the day.

467
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a teacher IRL, as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side.

468
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:24,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk to him about his art, and I want to open it up to you guys for your questions on vognetwork.com.

469
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get random on the show right now.

470
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I've punched in his number, and we're giving him a call.

471
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:31,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It is live radio, folks.

472
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:37,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything can happen, just like the phone getting forwarded to an automatic voicemail.

473
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:53,122
[SPEAKER_02]: let's try it one more time maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick it is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail let's try it one more time here

474
00:30:56,966 --> 00:31:00,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, boy.

475
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:06,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he might be on the other line or something right now.

476
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

477
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:07,233
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

478
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,534
[SPEAKER_02]: These things happen in live radio.

479
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:11,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try him again in about three minutes.

480
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you're a friend of Mega's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to get through.

481
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

482
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:20,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, let's go to our first news story tonight.

483
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:23,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to Mega, okay?

484
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:24,406
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

485
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls Online.

486
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:33,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being developed by ZeniMax Online, not necessarily Bethesda, but it's owned by the same company.

487
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:38,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series.

488
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:46,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with some of the places being locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on.

489
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:54,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh, elsewhere and that kind of stuff.

490
00:31:54,608 --> 00:32:06,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like, the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of the game.

491
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,071
[SPEAKER_03]: At least some of the screenshots, uh...

492
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:14,313
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third-person perspective.

493
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:31,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know that's an option in the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third-person perspective, but I really like the first-person aspect of it, and I understand that the reason that they wanted to go that route is because it'd be less of a learning curve for people that are from other MMOs.

494
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to World of Warcraft, and that's kind of...

495
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:38,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars The Old Republic

496
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine.

497
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's weird.

498
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,501
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

499
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:44,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is 35 after right now, and it is live radio, and he could be anywhere right now.

500
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,644
[SPEAKER_02]: He could be in the basement writing his next hit, and the cell signal might not be catching.

501
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:51,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see if maybe he's come to the surface.

502
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:54,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to get through again real quick here.

503
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:57,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy, that's really not good.

504
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,650
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

505
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:01,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that.

506
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:11,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and then, let's see, they also, you know, they're showing off some of the different kind of artwork for the game.

507
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:16,636
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's still very early, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game.

508
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing.

509
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:25,138
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I guess I got used to it with Final Fantasy XI and that kind of stuff.

510
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:53,817
[SPEAKER_03]: and then some other stuff not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online but Skyrim one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard well that's been officially announced now that Dawnguard will be the first expansion to Skyrim and it will be coming out this summer and of course being talked about during E3 and the rumors of course that it's going to feature

511
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and some other types of characters and races and stuff in there.

512
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:04,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

513
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:17,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Might even be cool if they have some of the... Because remember when they had this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit for Skyrim.

514
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:18,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Go!

515
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:27,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they had spear throwing and I want to say that the kill cameras for magic and stuff like that came out of that.

516
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:28,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

517
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure Crossbows probably will come out of that as well.

518
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:37,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be neat to see some more of that stuff in there.

519
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:42,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they seem pretty creative, so I'm looking forward to that.

520
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:51,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but the Kinect update finally came out now for the Xbox 360, and they have 200 voice commands added.

521
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:53,892
[SPEAKER_03]: added in there as well.

522
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:58,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC.

523
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming Fus Ro Dah!

524
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's already mods available.

525
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:09,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those voice mods to work.

526
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange.

527
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:14,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, whatever.

528
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,818
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they did it.

529
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm going to try again here, guys.

530
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:24,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right now.

531
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:28,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen.

532
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,091
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's live.

533
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:31,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything can happen live.

534
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

535
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:50,769
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a big project right.

536
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:54,412
[SPEAKER_02]: He just did some Kickstarter thing that made a ton of money.

537
00:36:55,653 --> 00:37:03,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to do some voices for his project right now.

538
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess he's just a little busy right now.

539
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will keep trying here.

540
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,184
[SPEAKER_02]: in just a little bit.

541
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO.

542
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:14,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

543
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because, you know, I imagined, you know, okay, it's basically going to be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're going to have, you know, a lot of players running around, and it's going to be all the time in real life.

544
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, the MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like.

545
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:35,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was like, okay, it's going to be a third-person perspective, and

546
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's all right.

547
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's going to have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs.

548
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:41,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like crap.

549
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:51,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you're copycatting everything that other MMOs are doing because you want to draw more people to it so that they're not afraid of it.

550
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:58,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get the people that play your games normally...

551
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:12,347
[SPEAKER_03]: to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot of people that play World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with, oh, it's first-person perspective.

552
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little bit fresh.

553
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:14,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little different of an idea.

554
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, oh, dead.

555
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,070
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go, next game.

556
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead.

557
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I mean, it just sounds really boring.

558
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:26,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't play MMOs.

559
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right?

560
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:36,940
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action, it's hard to judge it, right?

561
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:42,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right?

562
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:50,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now.

563
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:51,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

564
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

565
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.

566
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess let's try Mega again.

567
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been 10 minutes.

568
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:02,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's deducting money from the Skype thing every time I try.

569
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:07,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't afford too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything I can.

570
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:13,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's try it right now.

571
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try one more time to get through here.

572
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:16,650
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, it is live radio.

573
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

574
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's been forwarded.

575
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:19,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

576
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:20,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the phone even on?

577
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega's phone may just not be on.

578
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he was trying to nap.

579
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:27,902
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just so tired that the darn phone isn't even on.

580
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm going to send a tweet.

581
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:30,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually already did.

582
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

583
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:32,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I tweeted him.

584
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:35,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops.

585
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's this one place in my house I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal.

586
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:41,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was standing in it.

587
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:43,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

588
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:46,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we do have more stories.

589
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:46,577
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

590
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some more stories we can go over.

591
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:50,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we'll go ahead and get to that.

592
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, why don't you read one for us?

593
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:53,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

594
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:59,365
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie?

595
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie.

596
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:03,726
[SPEAKER_10]: They had somebody lined up.

597
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:15,929
[SPEAKER_10]: They had one Carlos Fresnadillo, and he walked out saying that the video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating.

598
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:25,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it, who wants to make it really scary, but the studio doesn't want to pay for it, really.

599
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,412
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants to do a rated R version.

600
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less.

601
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:34,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, basically the quote was, the little sisters and injections and the whole thing.

602
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:39,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later, you're still shivering and going, Jesus Christ.

603
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that?

604
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people.

605
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:54,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this might be pushing it for some people.

606
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:59,134
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's fine.

607
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:02,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I would see it.

608
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:07,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play it while he was playing it.

609
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

610
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:08,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

611
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:13,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, of course, I don't mind stuff like that.

612
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not the human centipede, so that's good.

613
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, my friend is so excited about the third one.

614
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:21,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, they're making a third one?

615
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:22,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

616
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of movies that have no redeeming... 150 people.

617
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Movies with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

618
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:32,822
[SPEAKER_10]: She and her grandmother love the human centipede.

619
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:37,045
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the grandmas watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape.

620
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:38,366
[SPEAKER_10]: You've met my friend Carly.

621
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:38,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

622
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:39,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's her.

623
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:41,853
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

624
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:02,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they're casting anybody from over here.

625
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,971
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be CG, you know that.

626
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:06,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it will be.

627
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:08,955
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, I would see this.

628
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:09,795
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the budget for CG.

629
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:14,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede movies.

630
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:15,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

631
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:16,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

632
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's just a hundred person train?

633
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:24,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

634
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:25,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's been done.

635
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway?

636
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:31,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Was watching bad porn with, you know, a chain?

637
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:31,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

638
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

639
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

640
00:42:33,245 --> 00:42:33,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

641
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:34,385
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

642
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I'm going to do, guys.

643
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it's 6.45 and it's 15 minutes after the time we scheduled MegaRan, I'm going to give it one more try.

644
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But this will be the sixth try.

645
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:49,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys because that's six times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through.

646
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:55,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about MegaRan and maybe he'll get through this time.

647
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network.

648
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:03,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I better, you know, I... Oh, that's killer.

649
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:06,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's killer.

650
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:11,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna... I'm gonna do that whole, like, panicking thing, like, am I calling the right number?

651
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:14,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I put the right number into Skype?

652
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

653
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:19,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it's the same number, right?

654
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:20,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the number.

655
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps you should leave him a message.

656
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You see...

657
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's leave a message.

658
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:28,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it here.

659
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't I go grab my cell phone I'm going to give MegaRan a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going to say call it whenever you're ready.

660
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:37,657
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.

661
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:40,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you MegaRan fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight.

662
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:47,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go do that right now and I realize I owe you guys a story but maybe Loki will cover it for me.

663
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers.

664
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:54,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, maybe you could cover the story for me, and I'm going to go give MegaRan a call on my personal line.

665
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:55,127
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

666
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:59,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know how they have layaway and stuff like that?

667
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Microsoft kind of wants to do something similar to that for their Xbox 360.

668
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized Kinect bundle available starting next week.

669
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: and what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying like a cell phone or a cell phone plan.

670
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:35,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the cell phone at a very big discount and then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly fees and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200 or one that normally costs about $600 or $700.

671
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:40,658
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Live Gold Service

672
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it would be a way to kind of get people in the door to buying a system and being able to play with it for a couple years without having to drop $400 right away.

673
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:21,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you bought it outright, but...

674
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's more of a convenience.

675
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:27,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like that for a cell phone.

676
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more.

677
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: About $460 after the end of the service agreement.

678
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: The good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems.

679
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some of those old systems might not last two years.

680
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:46,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

681
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:49,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's an interesting idea.

682
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It could work, especially if you get people to do it.

683
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see how that works out.

684
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,107
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people paying $15 a month.

685
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess that's not too much.

686
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:06,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches.

687
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:12,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can spare a couple lunches a month, I mean, you can be playing Xbox games for a couple years.

688
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an idea, I guess.

689
00:46:15,993 --> 00:46:18,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm back from making that phone call.

690
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let you guys know what happens.

691
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:22,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I really apologize to the MegaRan fans.

692
00:46:22,174 --> 00:46:22,954
[SPEAKER_02]: These things happen.

693
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:23,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's live radio.

694
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:27,215
[SPEAKER_02]: He legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now, just unplanned.

695
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at, and then suddenly, oh, no cell signal?

696
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:34,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be happening with MegaRan.

697
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:40,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you have to reboot it every once in a while because...

698
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

699
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:24,569
[SPEAKER_02]: and so maybe he'll just pop up during the show so we'll see so we'll let you know all right anyhow back to the Xbox story and the $99 Xbox so I just want to point something out with this

700
00:47:25,618 --> 00:47:33,001
[SPEAKER_02]: When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year.

701
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:43,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you forgot what that's all about because you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12-month agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo 3 for free.

702
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get a mount and you get into the beta and all this stuff.

703
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:47,887
[SPEAKER_10]: One little thing.

704
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

705
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Finals week is not the best week to launch this game.

706
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:51,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, sorry.

707
00:47:53,087 --> 00:48:04,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, back when that happened, I said, hey, you know, it's just a matter of time before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone contract style agreements.

708
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, I didn't think about the system element.

709
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:18,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I had thought, oh, well, sign up for two years of Xbox Live Gold and get free Halo maps or a free game or something like that, a giveaway and all this.

710
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:20,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are.

711
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:26,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing now coming to consoles.

712
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take it a step further.

713
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:33,217
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further.

714
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:39,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out.

715
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:45,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it, and the PlayStation 4, whatever they end up calling that.

716
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,191
[SPEAKER_02]: These systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive as hell.

717
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation 3 when it first rolled out.

718
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price?

719
00:49:04,254 --> 00:49:04,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

720
00:49:04,914 --> 00:49:12,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation 4 for $199 with a two-year PlayStation Plus agreement.

721
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,781
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

722
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this, this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know...

723
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:31,174
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Live Gold

724
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:49,717
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

725
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:09,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

726
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:13,748
[SPEAKER_02]: If you own an iPhone, and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else.

727
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill that's basically the iPhone tax.

728
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:21,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and you know what?

729
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care because my phone is sexy.

730
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:25,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a hell of a phone.

731
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:46,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say, for everyone who's saying Diablo 3 and WoW, to quote Voginator, kiss outside in any sense of social life goodbye, just saying, been playing WoW and Diablo 3 beta and the WoW beta and I work full time and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what?

732
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:47,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I still go out for pink berry and get laid.

733
00:50:50,074 --> 00:50:50,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

734
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:51,435
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible.

735
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:55,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to Disneyland.

736
00:50:56,537 --> 00:50:57,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just saying.

737
00:50:57,898 --> 00:50:59,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great way to cap it all off, by the way.

738
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

739
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,020
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible.

740
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Time management.

741
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:03,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn those skills.

742
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:07,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have this show.

743
00:51:07,723 --> 00:51:08,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have this show.

744
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:09,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

745
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:13,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And potentially another little project with the lovely Sylve.

746
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bite off more than you can chew, but I do love me some still.

747
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:22,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, going to our chatroom at vognetwork.com That's right, Panaxium.

748
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I am a time management pro.

749
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Next Gen says the PlayStation 4 will not be $699.

750
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just throwing it out there.

751
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: What is an iPhone?

752
00:51:30,694 --> 00:51:31,354
[SPEAKER_02]: A little iPhone.

753
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,876
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the iPhone cost, unsubsidized?

754
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:38,426
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost?

755
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:46,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you, because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up.

756
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:46,929
$699.

757
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:58,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone, and it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone 4S, but an Android.

758
00:51:58,154 --> 00:51:59,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Samsung Galaxy 2...

759
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:13,848
[SPEAKER_03]: or Samsung Galaxy S2 or something like that and luckily I bought mine used so I got it for about $300 but I mean it's still fucking expensive

760
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:23,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm looking through some more comments in our chatroom at vognetwork.com Let's see, RossDLUT says, of course the PlayStation 4 won't be $699.

761
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony learned that mistake.

762
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:28,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about what I'm saying though, RossDLUT.

763
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:31,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a way for them not to make that mistake, yet still charge that price.

764
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:40,947
[SPEAKER_03]: It would all depend though, because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more than recouping $200 or $300.

765
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:43,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's recouping double that.

766
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:45,711
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking $50 a month payments.

767
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,533
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still a little bit much.

768
00:52:48,714 --> 00:52:57,202
[SPEAKER_02]: WhatUpG in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Then again, they kept the Vita price at $249, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped the 3DS price.

769
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

770
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: They released the Vita cheaper than a lot of people thought they would, and it sounded great.

771
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, no, the DS is now cheaper.

772
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

773
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:13,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It still wasn't that bad because they couldn't drop the price of the system anymore, but they added value to it by including a gig memory card.

774
00:53:13,734 --> 00:53:15,274
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vita's still a sexy piece of hardware.

775
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 3DS is too.

776
00:53:16,615 --> 00:53:19,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not knocking it, but the 3DS doesn't do Skype.

777
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:23,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vita does the web a little better.

778
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,777
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some things that the Vita does have on the 3DS right now.

779
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:29,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say 3DS has some pretty must-have games right now.

780
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I own them both.

781
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross Steel UT in chat says, Sky, will the rent-to-own crowd be big enough?

782
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

783
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone.

784
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:41,763
[SPEAKER_02]: iPhone's the biggest phone out there.

785
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:46,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal.

786
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:50,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation 4s sold as iPhones.

787
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:51,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are iPhones?

788
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They're subsidized by contract.

789
00:53:54,915 --> 00:54:05,343
[SPEAKER_02]: hmm it could happen all right anyhow moving on let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you

790
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Starhawk

791
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:37,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a pretty quick week.

792
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:40,581
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next big, big title coming out?

793
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:42,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be the week after Max Payne 3.

794
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:44,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.

795
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And Diablo 3.

796
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:46,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Herp Derp Diablo 3.

797
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:48,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you mean Max Payne 3, The Rise of Bruce Willis?

798
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I always forget because with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually save the money to buy Diablo 3, which is kind of nice.

799
00:54:55,478 --> 00:55:00,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then, you know, beyond that... There's another $15 a month thing I pay for.

800
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:03,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, the Game of Thrones game is going to be coming out next week.

801
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:05,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the week after next as well.

802
00:55:05,947 --> 00:55:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: One does not simply pre-order the Game of Thrones games.

803
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be good.

804
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books.

805
00:55:14,956 --> 00:55:16,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least he wrote the story for it.

806
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got characters that aren't... It's kind of like the...

807
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Enter the Matrix of the Game of Thrones series.

808
00:55:26,753 --> 00:55:32,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they're probably going to cross into the series.

809
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:35,247
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

810
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:44,194
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but like a lot of things on this show tonight, it just doesn't want to work, so maybe we can go to Europe real fast.

811
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:47,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe we can, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly.

812
00:55:49,215 --> 00:56:00,698
[SPEAKER_10]: On May 9th in the UK, we have Datura, which, I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes me think of all of the times I read Clan of the Cave Bear, because that's what they called, like, this one herb in it.

813
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:01,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

814
00:56:02,118 --> 00:56:06,681
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 11th, we have Starhawk and Street Fighter X Tekken for PC.

815
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:08,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's it for this week.

816
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:16,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really it for this week.

817
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:17,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, great.

818
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Japanese release dates for you.

819
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:22,110
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember that whole golden week we were talking about last week?

820
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over.

821
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

822
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:41,608
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

823
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:06,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are.

824
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a chance to check that out in Japan.

825
00:57:08,979 --> 00:57:10,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for Japanese releases.

826
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

827
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

828
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:20,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops.

829
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:26,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we talked about the rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that.

830
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they were correct.

831
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:28,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly thought it was called Eclipse.

832
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually it is technically called Eclipse.

833
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the internal name for the game, as I found out.

834
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little truth to that.

835
00:57:40,736 --> 00:57:58,455
[SPEAKER_03]: but yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th and of course on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC confirmed I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something like that but of course all that stuff will be announced later on

836
00:57:58,855 --> 00:57:59,716
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

837
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:20,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Unmanned Warfare

838
00:58:35,184 --> 00:58:37,367
[SPEAKER_03]: and so very interesting looking thing.

839
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:51,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the new stuff that they're going to be adding to the actual campaign of the game including some branching missions and these new type of missions called like

840
00:58:52,325 --> 00:59:19,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Strikeforce where it's almost like a little bit open world I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff where you kind of have a point A point B but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things so that sounds kind of interesting and then of course they're going to be adding the standard multiplayer stuff and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as well

841
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it.

842
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:24,552
[SPEAKER_03]: After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet.

843
00:59:24,913 --> 00:59:26,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up.

844
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:31,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it kind of makes me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing that as well.

845
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:36,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So you think that there's actually going to be money to make off of sales of the old copy then, huh?

846
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game.

847
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:48,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 Day 1 pre-orders were actually higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 pre-orders.

848
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's off to a good start.

849
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds that way.

850
00:59:53,149 --> 00:59:53,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guess what, guys?

851
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:54,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some great news.

852
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:56,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess who just called me?

853
00:59:57,168 --> 00:59:59,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Random, awesome.

854
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said he apologizes.

855
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:04,134
[SPEAKER_02]: This has happened to you, right?

856
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone died.

857
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:08,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to go plug in.

858
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:09,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to get him on now.

859
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:11,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for being patient.

860
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:13,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And those of you that left, well, tough cookies.

861
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:16,425
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing.

862
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear Random or MegaRan right now.

863
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, is this MegaRan?

864
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:25,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

865
01:00:25,363 --> 01:00:25,843
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

866
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:26,764
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up?

867
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:30,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio here with DarkSakura and Loki.

868
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:31,325
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

869
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:34,546
[SPEAKER_02]: The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live.

870
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:36,166
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

871
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:37,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm good.

872
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an adventurous day.

873
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:40,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I'm late.

874
01:00:40,527 --> 01:00:41,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

875
01:00:41,528 --> 01:00:42,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That is okay.

876
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:48,865
[SPEAKER_06]: That is A-OK, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity is when you're showing up fashionably late.

877
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:01,934
[SPEAKER_02]: These things happen.

878
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:03,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even worry about it.

879
01:01:03,195 --> 01:01:03,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

880
01:01:03,896 --> 01:01:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just happy that you're here on the air.

881
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:12,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, if you guys have a question for Ranma, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you can ask that question in chat right now.

882
01:01:13,122 --> 01:01:17,125
[SPEAKER_02]: But while you guys get those questions out there, I got some questions for Ranma that I want to ask.

883
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:25,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Ranma, some of our listeners here at Orange Launch Radio, they might be gamers, but they might not know about you.

884
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:28,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated?

885
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all of those things together.

886
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:46,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture and history.

887
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:51,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty cool music.

888
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:54,574
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it is video game based.

889
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:57,596
[SPEAKER_06]: What I do is I like to use the traditional...

890
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:03,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds from video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that.

891
01:02:04,574 --> 01:02:14,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game, sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes.

892
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:20,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put it all together and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Man.

893
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:21,644
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

894
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:30,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to check out the music, of course, you can visit Random or Megaran's website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for download.

895
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little bit.

896
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:35,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So free is awesome.

897
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:37,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for providing that.

898
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question.

899
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:39,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Free is always good.

900
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:41,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DarkSakura.

901
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:42,831
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you teach?

902
01:02:44,831 --> 01:02:46,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I taught middle school.

903
01:02:46,172 --> 01:02:49,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing.

904
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:53,768
[SPEAKER_06]: and history, social studies, stuff like that to middle school kids.

905
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:57,070
[SPEAKER_10]: You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects ever.

906
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:01,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend.

907
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:04,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my, totally.

908
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:08,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so.

909
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:16,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Up until this past year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time and here I am.

910
01:03:16,744 --> 01:03:17,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So far I feel good.

911
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.

912
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:25,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love because Ranma, I got to tell you, I'm a teacher too.

913
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a different type of teacher.

914
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:27,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a corporate trainer.

915
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:30,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So I teach people in my company and that's my day job.

916
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've had this podcast with my buddies for 10 years and I'd love to be able to quit.

917
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,891
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I love my day job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time.

918
01:03:38,931 --> 01:03:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're doing it.

919
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:41,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You're living the dream and that's awesome.

920
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:49,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I mean, I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do in teaching as well in music.

921
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's always lessons and things.

922
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:55,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I love history, I love poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff.

923
01:03:56,224 --> 01:03:59,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of my favorite books I will talk about and rap about them.

924
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:05,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it.

925
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:06,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I was already doing what I loved.

926
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's all.

927
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:12,486
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

928
01:04:12,506 --> 01:04:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that

929
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:46,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I first decided, or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies 2.

930
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:50,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was great.

931
01:04:50,524 --> 01:04:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good game.

932
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:52,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a really cool soundtrack.

933
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:55,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a Casio keyboard.

934
01:04:55,768 --> 01:05:01,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay on my keyboard.

935
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:02,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I still remember it.

936
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard.

937
01:05:09,893 --> 01:05:23,916
[SPEAKER_06]: and so not knowing when I'm 10, 11, 12 years old that I was actually making what is now considered to be fan art but it was just me playing it by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create.

938
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:37,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't necessarily do anything with that but that was the first time that I ever experienced video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want to try to create my own version of it.

939
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:39,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I really love that game.

940
01:05:52,884 --> 01:05:54,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge, plenty of hours of fun on that game

941
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:28,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Final Fantasy VII was a huge game for me.

942
01:06:28,775 --> 01:06:30,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pretty much out of gaming.

943
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:36,196
[SPEAKER_06]: When it came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school.

944
01:06:36,256 --> 01:06:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have time for games anymore.

945
01:06:38,257 --> 01:06:45,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a system until I watched one of my friends or suitemates play it, and I was completely hooked.

946
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:51,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw some of the summons and just watched about an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined

947
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:58,556
[SPEAKER_06]: roleplaying games to me because, you know, the 3D aspect and just the character development was just so awesome.

948
01:06:59,636 --> 01:07:04,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wound up, you know, getting the PlayStation, almost flunking out of school playing this game.

949
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just something that completely enveloped me.

950
01:07:08,382 --> 01:07:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a huge part of my childhood, you know, so that's what made me go back because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable to me.

951
01:07:18,604 --> 01:07:20,664
[SPEAKER_06]: that it changed the game to me.

952
01:07:20,684 --> 01:07:24,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that was my introduction, well, kind of reintroduction to gaming.

953
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:28,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was the game that got me back into console gaming.

954
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:30,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like I owe a lot to it.

955
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:34,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided to do a little homage to it called Black Materia.

956
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:36,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, a lot of people liked it.

957
01:07:36,868 --> 01:07:40,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out last year and kind of took off a little bit.

958
01:07:40,168 --> 01:07:48,350
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music is because the demand for it and for performances after that

959
01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:52,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Just became too much to handle with a full-time job.

960
01:07:53,743 --> 01:07:57,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood.

961
01:07:58,444 --> 01:08:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the only one out there that has some memories tied to that game.

962
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:07,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was a huge game for me in college.

963
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:12,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably failed a class or two because Final Fantasy VII, but it was so worth it.

964
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:14,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Which maybe I shouldn't be telling the teacher.

965
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:15,689
Absolutely.

966
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:40,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy 7 came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a PlayStation my roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a PlayStation I had a SNES I was still playing Chrono Trigger but I played the stew out of that and did time that Knights of the Round did with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing did go long enough for me to make a sandwich

967
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:42,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

968
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:43,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.

969
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:14,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either, but the way you've translated this into hip-hop is something else.

970
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me more about the process of creating Journey, a hip-hop excursion.

971
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, that was a lot of fun.

972
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:24,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched and moved by the Journey video game.

973
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:33,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told and emailed constantly about playing the game, but I just didn't have enough time and people were like, you gotta play it, you gotta play it, you're gonna love it.

974
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:36,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all I need is another game.

975
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:40,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I have games here that are unopened that I haven't been able to get to yet.

976
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:41,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have time.

977
01:09:41,413 --> 01:09:43,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, no, that's the best thing about it.

978
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,416
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an hour-long experience.

979
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:48,497
[SPEAKER_06]: You just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it.

980
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:49,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I did.

981
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:52,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it, and I was instantly inspired.

982
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:53,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a great game.

983
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cool how they just created the entire scenario.

984
01:09:57,442 --> 01:09:59,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's no dialogue whatsoever.

985
01:10:00,765 --> 01:10:05,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You're basically creating your own story and synopsis.

986
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:06,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just such an experience.

987
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know any other way to describe it except an experience because it just kind of immerses you.

988
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:18,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I wound up playing the game through, I think, twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack.

989
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had a whole day.

990
01:10:21,196 --> 01:10:24,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was just trying to raise funds for Kickstarter.

991
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:27,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had gotten to a really certain level.

992
01:10:27,299 --> 01:10:27,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was maybe $10,000.

993
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:35,384
[SPEAKER_06]: and usually when I get to the round numbers, I try to give some sort of a surprise gift for the support.

994
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:40,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as I was playing the Journey soundtrack, I said, well, why not work on making some hip-hop beats?

995
01:10:41,068 --> 01:10:44,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the entire day, I sat down, I used a program called Reason.

996
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:58,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what I do is just pick the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little bit, stretch them out, slow them down, filter them, add some drums, take out some things, you know, bring them back in later.

997
01:10:59,307 --> 01:11:06,532
[SPEAKER_06]: and wound up creating some really cool beats with a very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel.

998
01:11:06,612 --> 01:11:08,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was really what I wanted to create.

999
01:11:08,914 --> 01:11:09,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So it came out pretty well.

1000
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:10,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like it.

1001
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:11,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I still listen to it a lot.

1002
01:11:12,056 --> 01:11:12,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

1003
01:11:12,456 --> 01:11:17,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right?

1004
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that tweet on your website.

1005
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:19,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1006
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1007
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:25,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin Winstery actually listened to it and told me he liked it.

1008
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:26,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Told me it was a great job.

1009
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, wow.

1010
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:28,808
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

1011
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you gotta love Twitter for that reason.

1012
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:32,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Just that everything is so accessible.

1013
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:33,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's one click away.

1014
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:43,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey remixes that they contacted him about it.

1015
01:11:43,252 --> 01:11:45,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey Austin, have you heard this?

1016
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:47,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's kind of what made him respond.

1017
01:11:48,094 --> 01:11:49,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was really cool.

1018
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:51,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, props from the man himself.

1019
01:11:52,055 --> 01:11:52,895
[SPEAKER_06]: You really can't beat that.

1020
01:11:53,753 --> 01:11:56,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing?

1021
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this whole interview tonight is being brought to you by Twitter.

1022
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:02,300
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we say we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1023
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went to Twitter and we said, hey, tweets, who do you want to see on the show?

1024
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:10,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on.

1025
01:12:11,147 --> 01:12:12,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are.

1026
01:12:12,588 --> 01:12:13,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are.

1027
01:12:14,173 --> 01:12:16,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen.

1028
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:17,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1029
01:12:37,172 --> 01:12:40,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it.

1030
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:43,898
[SPEAKER_02]: How did the community help you achieve your goals with language arts?

1031
01:12:44,218 --> 01:12:44,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

1032
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:47,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the community was just humongous.

1033
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... Well, we've done a Kickstarter in the past, like I said.

1034
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:53,565
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done one for... Actually, two.

1035
01:12:53,905 --> 01:13:00,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We did one to create vinyl for Forever Famicom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album.

1036
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:01,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Then...

1037
01:13:01,724 --> 01:13:07,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We did another later to play a show in London at the London Anime Con.

1038
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And both of those went decent.

1039
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,771
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our goals.

1040
01:13:11,832 --> 01:13:15,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't get necessarily way over the goal, but we did pretty well.

1041
01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:18,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And I decided to go back and try it again.

1042
01:13:18,717 --> 01:13:22,300
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy.

1043
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's doing it these days.

1044
01:13:24,461 --> 01:13:26,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now.

1045
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:32,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game companies are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now.

1046
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:38,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I always told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea.

1047
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:47,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years, almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience.

1048
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:51,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of just an album, it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book.

1049
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:54,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, I can't do all that on my own without

1050
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:58,041
[SPEAKER_06]: having artists and developers help me out.

1051
01:13:58,121 --> 01:14:01,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out.

1052
01:14:01,762 --> 01:14:03,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So that then came Kickstarter.

1053
01:14:04,383 --> 01:14:12,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this.

1054
01:14:12,424 --> 01:14:13,624
[SPEAKER_06]: But I said, we'll start small.

1055
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:20,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000.

1056
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:20,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1057
01:14:24,534 --> 01:14:27,377
[SPEAKER_06]: A 516% completion rate.

1058
01:14:27,537 --> 01:14:31,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And just from the response has been overwhelming.

1059
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, from Facebook, Twitter, to just the guys on my email list.

1060
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I went out to PAX East and performed.

1061
01:14:38,146 --> 01:14:43,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was probably right before the Kickstarter really got underway.

1062
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I told a lot of people about it.

1063
01:14:45,073 --> 01:14:46,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were like, hey, I'm going to support.

1064
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, they did.

1065
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:48,936
[SPEAKER_06]: We had over 300 backers.

1066
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,122
[SPEAKER_06]: who are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comics.

1067
01:14:55,182 --> 01:15:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level and that's what hopefully this Kickstarter has allowed us to do.

1068
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:08,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I want to do this in a whole new way and this could be the album that kind of defines me.

1069
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:16,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done a lot of Final Fantasy stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property but I really want to

1070
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal and just kind of cool to have like this comic book and video game and album that all tie together yet it's not like it's not some movie franchise being turned into this or some you know it's you it's your story that's awesome that's awesome right that's what's cool about it I wanted to make it based on my story now granted the the

1071
01:15:45,222 --> 01:15:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Game and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and they are interweaving a bit.

1072
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:56,254
[SPEAKER_06]: The album's much more, I guess, realistic.

1073
01:15:57,175 --> 01:16:08,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of take that hero and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy with just, you know, some cool abilities, but

1074
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:13,079
[SPEAKER_06]: for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around shooting beams out of his eyes.

1075
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:20,505
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the game, of course, you know, to make things a lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it and the comic as well.

1076
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:35,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's taking my story and my own original story and original characters that myself and the guys at J1 Studios created and creating a universe around it, you know, like almost a franchise, you know, so it's

1077
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:38,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so awesome.

1078
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:42,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at Megaran.com.

1079
01:16:42,582 --> 01:16:44,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have more information on that when it's out, I'm sure.

1080
01:16:45,865 --> 01:16:48,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Random, I know we're a little past our time here.

1081
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:57,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'm not keeping you from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight.

1082
01:16:57,675 --> 01:17:00,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners.

1083
01:17:00,918 --> 01:17:01,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely do.

1084
01:17:02,139 --> 01:17:05,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, VOGnetwork.com if you want to ask some questions in chat.

1085
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get to an email question we got earlier in the week.

1086
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:16,303
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Will O. Sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Ranma has a style that just seems effortless and his sincerity bleeds through each track.

1087
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:19,184
[SPEAKER_02]: He honestly seems to love what he's doing.

1088
01:17:19,204 --> 01:17:22,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to throw that out there that that's coming across.

1089
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the question, Ranma.

1090
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:31,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it would be possible to be doing what you're doing before the age of social media?

1091
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create music or tour?

1092
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:42,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could you do what you're doing without social media?

1093
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:44,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1094
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:46,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1095
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,782
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I really don't.

1096
01:17:48,822 --> 01:17:51,944
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole MegaRam story started because of social media.

1097
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:56,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I was contacted on Myspace in 2007 by Capcom.

1098
01:17:56,208 --> 01:18:00,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So if not for social media, I don't know if I'd be here.

1099
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I do owe a lot to it.

1100
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:08,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media.

1101
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:15,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would make it to me a little more fun going out and doing the old school method because I do that a lot.

1102
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:27,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm not only all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or two times a week.

1103
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:33,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people.

1104
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:37,812
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just social media, but I feel like social media is a huge part of it.

1105
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:50,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I said, I think my leg up comes from the fact that I'm out and about in the community physically making appearances as well as taking full advantage of social media.

1106
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:53,756
[SPEAKER_02]: MC Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, MC Lars, that he's always told me that you gotta get out and play, you know?

1107
01:18:53,776 --> 01:18:54,577
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get out and play.

1108
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:57,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you apart, so...

1109
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:20,399
[SPEAKER_06]: getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that.

1110
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:31,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the VOG, or excuse me, vognetwork.com and I'm going to go to a question from Actdeft first and I think this is a good question.

1111
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:33,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take this question to the next level.

1112
01:19:33,824 --> 01:19:37,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is MegaRan's favorite video game music composer?

1113
01:19:40,786 --> 01:19:41,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

1114
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:44,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, I'm going to go back a little bit and

1115
01:19:45,143 --> 01:19:47,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro.

1116
01:19:49,345 --> 01:19:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island.

1117
01:19:56,641 --> 01:20:00,705
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite.

1118
01:20:00,805 --> 01:20:01,846
[SPEAKER_02]: You're officially my hero.

1119
01:20:01,886 --> 01:20:02,847
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the bomb.

1120
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:04,248
[SPEAKER_02]: We know Yuzo very well.

1121
01:20:04,588 --> 01:20:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music.

1122
01:20:07,811 --> 01:20:09,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Actraiser.

1123
01:20:09,993 --> 01:20:15,078
[SPEAKER_10]: The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to LA, just saying.

1124
01:20:15,138 --> 01:20:15,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1125
01:20:16,339 --> 01:20:17,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, it's amazing.

1126
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:19,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1127
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to go listen to that tonight.

1128
01:20:21,994 --> 01:20:22,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.

1129
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:27,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another question from Breakman, you know, because you're very well known for the Mega Man stuff.

1130
01:20:27,919 --> 01:20:32,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Ran's favorite Mega Man theme?

1131
01:20:34,665 --> 01:20:35,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, all right.

1132
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:39,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I could go with the easy choice.

1133
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:42,111
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves.

1134
01:20:42,411 --> 01:20:46,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mega Man 2, WALL-E, Stage 1, everybody loves that.

1135
01:20:48,436 --> 01:20:50,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites.

1136
01:20:50,998 --> 01:20:55,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Woodman's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2.

1137
01:20:55,201 --> 01:21:02,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is Bomb Man from Mega Man 1.

1138
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:04,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else?

1139
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:06,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Crashman.

1140
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:07,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Crashman.

1141
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Crashman is great.

1142
01:21:09,712 --> 01:21:16,737
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many, and as you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never used them, or I've never intended to remake them.

1143
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Crashman, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it.

1144
01:21:21,735 --> 01:21:23,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, WALL-E, Stage 1, same thing.

1145
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:27,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man 3, title screen, same thing.

1146
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:31,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so great as is.

1147
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Proto Man's theme, another one I love.

1148
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to

1149
01:21:40,249 --> 01:21:48,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do him justice based on the Mega Ran 9 album, but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from.

1150
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:49,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.

1151
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:58,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I know where this guy's going with this name, but the name is iFarTed.

1152
01:21:59,066 --> 01:22:00,127
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great name in chat.

1153
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to know...

1154
01:22:02,169 --> 01:22:08,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any game that MegaRan hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on?

1155
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:16,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid of questions like that because I don't want to answer it and then a couple things can happen.

1156
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:18,954
[SPEAKER_06]: One, someone just takes it and does it.

1157
01:22:19,714 --> 01:22:25,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Or two, I could never get to it and people are like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned?

1158
01:22:25,976 --> 01:22:30,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say I have two that my eyes are on.

1159
01:22:32,048 --> 01:23:01,754
[SPEAKER_06]: the Metal Gear Solid series and Legend of Zelda particularly A Link to the Past so those are what my eyes are on right now but the next plan though for next year is myself and K Murdock we're doing an all Sega album called Sega State or Sagacity and it's going to be all Sega so from Master System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast

1160
01:23:02,332 --> 01:23:03,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be all Sega all the time.

1161
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:04,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be our next one.

1162
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:07,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do.

1163
01:23:08,235 --> 01:23:15,059
[SPEAKER_06]: But story-wise, that's just such a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that.

1164
01:23:15,559 --> 01:23:20,142
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it would still be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII.

1165
01:23:20,598 --> 01:23:22,918
[SPEAKER_06]: which is something that took like a year to make.

1166
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that.

1167
01:23:25,759 --> 01:23:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a day of screaming, yes, Metal Gear, do it.

1168
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1169
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:37,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're way over time here and I want to get to Mega Ran's song here but quickly, one last question from DarkSakura here in the studio.

1170
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:40,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line.

1171
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:42,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1172
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:44,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I've taken requests before.

1173
01:23:44,743 --> 01:23:47,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the official game of Orange Lounge Radio is The Guardian Legend.

1174
01:23:48,684 --> 01:23:48,884
Oh,

1175
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:53,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So could we hope to have you tackle that someday?

1176
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:55,855
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1177
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:57,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, you know what, I did.

1178
01:23:57,797 --> 01:23:59,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a Guardian Legend track.

1179
01:23:59,298 --> 01:23:59,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1180
01:23:59,638 --> 01:24:04,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song?

1181
01:24:04,662 --> 01:24:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there's a song called Contact, C-O-N-T-A-C-T, and it's all about con etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legend.

1182
01:24:13,869 --> 01:24:14,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1183
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1184
01:24:15,671 --> 01:24:19,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to cons, what you should and shouldn't do.

1185
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:19,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1186
01:24:22,695 --> 01:24:28,202
[SPEAKER_10]: The Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed by Fantasy Zone.

1187
01:24:29,378 --> 01:24:56,911

1215
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you should get up because you might not shower.

1216
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:26,018
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1217
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:27,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get up from playing games.

1218
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:29,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people shower before bed.

1219
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:29,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1220
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:33,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have that con funk that he talks about in the Guardian Legends song.

1221
01:30:34,521 --> 01:30:39,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he's already said hi on Facebook.

1222
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:40,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Facebook, on Twitter.

1223
01:30:40,604 --> 01:30:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, that's awesome.

1224

01:30:42,965 --> 01:30:43,785
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really cool.

1226
01:30:43,845 --> 01:30:45,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know, why did he tweet Anime Jam Session?

1227
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,227
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't on Anime Jam.

1228
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all good.

1229
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:51,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma was helping me screen the questions, actually, so he does get props and stuff.

1230
01:30:51,929 --> 01:30:52,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to Anime Jam Session.

1231
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:53,330

01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:58,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1236
01:30:58,673 --> 01:30:59,293
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a lot.

1237
01:30:59,633 --> 01:30:59,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1238
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:00,554
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a lot.

1239
01:31:01,514 --> 01:31:06,197
[SPEAKER_10]: That is going to be on my iPhone soon.

1240
01:31:06,437 --> 01:31:06,637
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1241
01:31:06,657 --> 01:31:13,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music, that particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free.

1242
01:31:13,881 --> 01:31:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Megaranmusic.com.

1243
01:31:14,982 --> 01:31:15,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it.

1244
01:31:15,642 --> 01:31:16,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Megaranmusic.com.

1245
01:31:16,743 --> 01:31:17,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks again.

1246
01:31:19,064 --> 01:31:21,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Write on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it.

1247
01:31:21,445 --> 01:31:25,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Write on to the management for setting that up and for Random for appearing on our show tonight.

1248
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:43,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan language arts video game and comic project Kickstarter, we will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD as well as a signed comic to a lucky listener.

1249
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:44,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at you.

1250
01:31:45,477 --> 01:31:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Giving.

1251
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes, by the way.

1252
01:31:50,348 --> 01:32:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while, but for those of you that are sticking around, because I knew some people would just be here to listen to Megaran and then hit the road, which I understand.

1253
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:01,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

1254
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B. So just stay tuned.

1255
01:32:09,337 --> 01:32:10,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get into that in a little bit.

1256
01:32:10,477 --> 01:32:13,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as good as what Loki just talked about, but it's still pretty cool.

1257
01:32:13,579 --> 01:32:13,799
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1258
01:32:13,999 --> 01:32:15,099
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get back into some news.

1259
01:32:15,139 --> 01:32:16,800
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running late now, but that's all right.

1260
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It was worth the wait.

1261
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:19,542
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1262
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:49,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console-quality gamepad controller.

1263
01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:50,722
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pictures of this on the internet.

1264
01:32:51,102 --> 01:32:59,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Just imagine the most giant, stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life where you slammed an iPad in the middle.

1265
01:32:59,505 --> 01:33:00,745
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this thing looks like.

1266
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:05,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it looks a lot better than the one that Razer was looking at making.

1267
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:10,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, apparently, Wikipad isn't super popular yet.

1269
01:33:10,332 --> 01:33:14,415
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show, but they've already gone through some changes with it.

1270
01:33:14,475 --> 01:33:19,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a 10.1-inch screen and a quad-core processor now, optional 3G for mobile.

1271
01:33:19,598 --> 01:33:20,319
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the other thing.

1272
01:33:20,419 --> 01:33:21,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't out yet.

1273
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:24,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of those things that is coming soon.

1274
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:29,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaikai is out there, though, if you want to check that out, and it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it.

1275
01:33:30,024 --> 01:33:35,307
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty big for a portable system, but I'd say, eh, if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere.

1276
01:33:35,367 --> 01:33:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then people carry tablets, too, and it's also streaming gaming, so if you think about it, you'll be able to play console-type games, because the same stuff that OnLive is doing, like Saints Row III or something of that quality,

1277
01:33:49,975 --> 01:33:50,916
[SPEAKER_03]: through this pad.

1278
01:33:50,956 --> 01:33:58,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and the controls look pretty similar to, you know, a current-gen console, so I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that.

1279
01:33:58,227 --> 01:33:59,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather have an IK than an iPad.

1280
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:00,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1281
01:34:01,191 --> 01:34:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't IK a device for an iPad?

1282
01:34:03,174 --> 01:34:03,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1283
01:34:04,963 --> 01:34:05,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather have that.

1284
01:34:06,044 --> 01:34:07,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine with it.

1285
01:34:07,326 --> 01:34:08,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Or MAME on an Android.

1286
01:34:08,367 --> 01:34:09,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what's the difference, really?

1287
01:34:09,689 --> 01:34:13,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler.

1288
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags.

1289
01:34:18,099 --> 01:34:23,626
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges hooked up to either a modem or your cable.

1290
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:35,796
[SPEAKER_02]: A portable console was getting a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter and plugging your Nintendo into it, which some guy we knew had in his car, a PlayStation in the car.

1291
01:34:35,816 --> 01:34:41,981
[SPEAKER_10]: We did that in middle school with a camp TV that ran on D-cells.

1292
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:52,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to a classic time when things were a lot simpler and take a look at the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to dip into the video game vault and find a game that she thinks, hey!

1293
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You kids ought to be playing this video game.

1294
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:55,992
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's moldy.

1295
01:34:56,112 --> 01:34:59,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Random got the jump on you, though, with the Goonies 2 nostalgia.

1296
01:34:59,754 --> 01:35:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one's pretty good, too.

1297
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1298
01:35:03,536 --> 01:35:08,339
[SPEAKER_10]: A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers, and I'm not going to spoil why.

1299
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:09,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga!

1300
01:35:11,161 --> 01:35:14,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Galaga, also known in Japan as Gyaraga.

1301
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:23,873
[SPEAKER_10]: which is the game of pew pew is what it is.

1302
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:32,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan and published by Midway in North America in 1981.

1303
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:35,475
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979.

1304
01:35:36,635 --> 01:35:38,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Why I didn't do Galaxian?

1305
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:39,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1306
01:35:39,256 --> 01:35:40,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to do Galaga, so whatever.

1307
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:46,511
[SPEAKER_10]: In any way, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen.

1308
01:35:46,531 --> 01:35:47,471
[SPEAKER_10]: You go back and forth.

1309
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,252
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get to go up or fly around or anything.

1310
01:35:49,313 --> 01:35:51,154
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a simple, fixed shooter.

1311
01:35:52,114 --> 01:35:58,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And the enemies fly at you in formation, and you have to pew-pew them all before they pew-pew you.

1312
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:03,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And once they're all vanquished, then you move on to the next stage.

1313
01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:03,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Yahoo!

1314
01:36:03,962 --> 01:36:04,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1315
01:36:05,884 --> 01:36:10,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga was pretty, pretty popular, as I'm sure you all know.

1316
01:36:10,607 --> 01:36:14,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have many different sequels to Galaga and many versions of Galaga.

1317
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:29,381
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, Galaga, for me, was just the coolest because you could get your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing.

1318
01:36:29,981 --> 01:36:33,904
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode, which was always...

1319
01:36:34,464 --> 01:36:35,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Super cool!

1320
01:36:37,866 --> 01:36:47,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It also had a few features that improved over Galaxium, like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, your hit-miss ratio, and the challenging stage.

1321
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:52,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus.

1322
01:36:53,952 --> 01:36:58,956
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, you also could get captured.

1323
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:02,999
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up.

1324
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:04,640
[SPEAKER_10]: You could shoot it and get it down.

1325
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:10,964
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there are actually full-on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured.

1326
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:12,886
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how a lot of people play.

1327
01:37:13,586 --> 01:37:20,251
[SPEAKER_10]: It also had a bug that was called... Actually, the bug would make your attacker stop firing bullets.

1328
01:37:20,611 --> 01:37:21,632
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually a coding error.

1329
01:37:22,273 --> 01:37:33,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say the double the whole two ships tied together thing that's like the only way I can do decent at this game I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion

1330
01:37:34,028 --> 01:37:36,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a lot of people based their strategy around it, like I said.

1331
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:42,130
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a split-screen bug that was like in Pac-Man.

1332
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:45,171
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not quite the same thing.

1333
01:37:45,271 --> 01:37:51,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It's similar to the split-screen bug in Pac-Man, where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0.

1334
01:37:52,713 --> 01:38:00,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine, it could cause the game to stall, and it means it has to be either reset or power-cycled so that you can start a new game.

1335
01:38:01,796 --> 01:38:06,879
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the series of Galaxian, and I'm going to start with Galaxian.

1336
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:13,462
[SPEAKER_10]: You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Gaplus or Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig, Galaga Legions in 2008, Galaga Legions DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011.

1337
01:38:24,927 --> 01:38:39,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave & Buster's in Milpitas, they used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set, which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in, with the three screens, and that was like some...

1338
01:38:40,732 --> 01:38:40,992
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1339
01:39:00,145 --> 01:39:10,457
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out, there's been the Atari 7800, the Famicom version, Game Boy, and also it was bundled with Galaxian.

1340
01:39:10,917 --> 01:39:12,599
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a GameTap, MSX.

1341
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:14,521
[SPEAKER_10]: The MSX version is actually really good.

1342
01:39:15,422 --> 01:39:18,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, NES, because we had a Famicom version.

1343
01:39:18,726 --> 01:39:24,828
[SPEAKER_10]: the Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer, which I played Galagon on it.

1344
01:39:25,888 --> 01:39:26,568
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the game.

1345
01:39:26,649 --> 01:39:31,810
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a clone called Galagon, and I played Stu out of this, because my friend had one of these things.

1346
01:39:33,491 --> 01:39:45,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version, Xbox Live Arcade, iOS is the Galaga Remix, which had the original on it, Nintendo 3DS, which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, and Roku.

1347
01:39:47,615 --> 01:39:52,419
[SPEAKER_10]: There has also been several versions of the Namco Museum, which are really way too many.

1348
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:58,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, like, we have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Windows.

1349
01:39:58,505 --> 01:39:59,826
[SPEAKER_10]: There were two versions of each.

1350
01:40:00,566 --> 01:40:07,112
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii, which I have most of those.

1351
01:40:09,267 --> 01:40:14,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3 is the game with the OLR cameo.

1352
01:40:14,731 --> 01:40:14,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1353
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes it double awesome.

1354
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:17,272
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the double awesome version.

1355
01:40:17,332 --> 01:40:20,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course I had to... Jeez, Rob.

1356
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:21,415
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta get that one out there.

1357
01:40:21,435 --> 01:40:23,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez, Rob!

1358
01:40:23,876 --> 01:40:29,580
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version of Tekken in 1995.

1359
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,201
[SPEAKER_10]: You could play it as it loaded.

1360
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:35,282
[SPEAKER_10]: In Point Blake 2, there were Galaga Challenge stages.

1361
01:40:36,662 --> 01:40:41,383
[SPEAKER_10]: In the 20-year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit that had Ms.

1362
01:40:41,423 --> 01:40:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man and Galaga, there was that.

1363
01:40:45,984 --> 01:40:48,685
[SPEAKER_10]: The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too.

1364
01:40:49,685 --> 01:40:53,206
[SPEAKER_10]: It was even available on Palm devices and Pocket PC.

1365
01:40:53,486 --> 01:40:56,047
[SPEAKER_10]: So Galaga really has an amazing legacy.

1366
01:40:56,207 --> 01:40:56,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1367
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, my allergies are flaring up, everybody.

1368
01:41:00,623 --> 01:41:01,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You all right over there?

1369
01:41:01,664 --> 01:41:03,326
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I sound like a 12-year-old boy.

1370
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:08,411
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, there were remakes.

1371
01:41:08,431 --> 01:41:13,474
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Galaga Arrangement, which was part of Namco Museum compilation.

1372
01:41:13,895 --> 01:41:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga Destination Earth came out in 98 for Windows, PlayStation, and the Game Boy Color.

1373
01:41:19,499 --> 01:41:22,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga Remix came out in 2007 for the Wii.

1374
01:41:23,241 --> 01:41:27,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And you use your Wii remote as a gun.

1375
01:41:27,744 --> 01:41:30,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space.

1376
01:41:31,427 --> 01:41:34,069
[SPEAKER_02]: The video ran out, so we have to hear that opening theme one more time.

1377
01:41:38,734 --> 01:41:40,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't sing.

1378
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:40,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Not with my voice like this.

1379
01:41:41,856 --> 01:41:48,379
[SPEAKER_10]: There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, sorry, Galpus.

1380
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:56,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga 88 were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app called Galaga 30th Anniversary that was done by Namco Bandai.

1381
01:41:56,863 --> 01:42:03,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically the app had Galaxian as a free game and then the main three actually had to pay for the complete set for $8.00.

1382
01:42:04,807 --> 01:42:11,170
[SPEAKER_10]: But it had Galaga points, so you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs, including the original art.

1383
01:42:12,331 --> 01:42:14,011
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a world record for Galaga.

1384
01:42:14,111 --> 01:42:16,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Now keep in mind, this is Twin Galaxy stuff.

1385
01:42:17,353 --> 01:42:21,855
[SPEAKER_10]: It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krugman of Boca Raton, Florida.

1386
01:42:22,856 --> 01:42:27,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And the rapid fire setting... And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida.

1387
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,022
[SPEAKER_10]: was used, and it was also in Ms.

1388
01:42:31,042 --> 01:42:37,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Pat Mangala, Class of 81, Fast Shot, World Records, and they were both by John Klinkel of Battle Creek, Michigan.

1389
01:42:38,707 --> 01:42:52,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, I mean, and I remember actually seeing some of the people that had the earlier ones in King of Kong, because they had people just playing, you know, the high score people gathered back together when What's-His-Face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score.

1390
01:42:53,938 --> 01:43:15,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga, actually there was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM for him to practice for war games Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game and basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions

1391
01:43:17,052 --> 01:43:21,515
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game.

1392
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:23,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the Pac-Man one of those.

1393
01:43:23,456 --> 01:43:23,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1394
01:43:25,297 --> 01:43:32,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And because the place I'm reading is not updated since, Galaga made an appearance in The Avengers.

1395
01:43:34,304 --> 01:43:34,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1396
01:43:36,929 --> 01:43:37,670
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll say no more.

1397
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:38,531
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll say no more.

1398
01:43:38,551 --> 01:43:41,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that guy over there is playing Galaga.

1399
01:43:41,213 --> 01:43:42,655
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't think I'd notice, but I did.

1400
01:43:43,736 --> 01:43:44,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, is that it?

1401
01:43:45,137 --> 01:43:45,718
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the quote.

1402
01:43:45,758 --> 01:43:47,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic game of the week.

1403
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:48,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaga.

1404
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Available everywhere.

1405
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But most notably in the arcade.

1406
01:43:52,725 --> 01:43:54,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Because shield helicarriers have joysticks.

1407
01:43:54,947 --> 01:43:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1408
01:43:56,668 --> 01:44:02,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We would prefer that you play the arcade version or the PlayStation Network version that has the OLR cameo.

1409
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1410
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:06,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize.

1411
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:07,791
[SPEAKER_02]: A no prize.

1412
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:08,572
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite kind of prize.

1413
01:44:08,832 --> 01:44:11,232
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running way long for part A. I wonder why.

1414
01:44:11,252 --> 01:44:14,053
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki.

1415
01:44:14,093 --> 01:44:15,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm allergic to California.

1416
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:16,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It was worth it.

1417
01:44:16,874 --> 01:44:18,354
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

1418
01:44:18,494 --> 01:44:22,455
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1419
01:44:22,495 --> 01:44:22,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go anywhere.

1420
01:44:23,016 --> 01:44:24,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more coming up in part B.

1421
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:40,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on the VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network, on this May the 6th of 2012.

1422
01:44:40,095 --> 01:44:43,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live with the 456th episode of our show.

1423
01:44:43,899 --> 01:44:47,143
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys missed a fun part A. A little worried there at the beginning.

1424
01:44:47,543 --> 01:44:48,424
[SPEAKER_02]: A little worried there when...

1425
01:44:49,005 --> 01:44:50,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the Sega album I got sonic boobs today, okay?

1426
01:45:07,778 --> 01:45:12,100
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show, but you're wearing this shirt.

1427
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:14,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid $10 for it.

1428
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Sonic shirt, and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is.

1429
01:45:20,704 --> 01:45:21,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1430
01:45:21,345 --> 01:45:24,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies.

1431
01:45:24,806 --> 01:45:25,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't help it.

1432
01:45:25,967 --> 01:45:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple D, hi.

1433
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:28,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Pixar didn't happen.

1434
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:29,569
[SPEAKER_10]: I put pics up.

1435
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: On OrangeLunchRadio.com?

1436
01:45:31,827 --> 01:45:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.

1437
01:45:32,247 --> 01:45:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there you go.

1438
01:45:32,987 --> 01:45:33,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.

1439
01:45:33,408 --> 01:45:35,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other can of Vimto that I drank.

1440
01:45:36,429 --> 01:45:37,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had Vimto before.

1441
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Which our European listeners should know of.

1442
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had Vimto before, but I'm having a Vimto Light, and it's really good.

1443
01:45:42,993 --> 01:45:43,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.

1444
01:45:43,353 --> 01:45:44,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never had Vimto Light before.

1445
01:45:44,574 --> 01:45:45,534
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the regular soda.

1446
01:45:45,614 --> 01:45:48,796
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one.

1447
01:45:49,416 --> 01:45:50,277
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just with sugar.

1448
01:45:50,457 --> 01:45:53,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes a little bit like Hanson's Black Cherry.

1449
01:45:53,299 --> 01:45:53,679
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

1450
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:57,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Current, Raspberry Soda

1451
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,600
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not bad.

1452
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I drink that.

1453
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good stuff.

1454
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway.

1455
01:46:24,741 --> 01:46:25,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Babylon Market.

1456
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:29,223
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, we do have somebody staying up late listening to us all the way from the UK.

1457
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:31,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Peker Uno is with us saying, I don't like Vimto.

1458
01:46:31,964 --> 01:46:32,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer Rubina.

1459
01:46:33,024 --> 01:46:33,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that one.

1460
01:46:33,564 --> 01:46:34,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Rubina?

1461
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:35,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Rubina is not bad.

1462
01:46:35,985 --> 01:46:36,285
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1463
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:43,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But I tried, it's this, I like Tizer, I think is what it's called.

1464
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:43,948
[SPEAKER_10]: T-I-Z-E-R.

1465
01:46:45,329 --> 01:46:49,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good, like a grapefruit soda.

1466
01:46:50,231 --> 01:46:50,711
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty good.

1467
01:46:52,725 --> 01:46:53,206
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

1468
01:46:54,567 --> 01:46:55,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you got that shirt at Kmart.

1469
01:46:56,068 --> 01:46:57,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get that out too.

1470
01:46:57,889 --> 01:47:01,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock because it's Kmart.

1471
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:03,394
[SPEAKER_10]: By the Genesis ad, it's coming.

1472
01:47:03,634 --> 01:47:05,055
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.

1473
01:47:05,756 --> 01:47:11,200
[SPEAKER_10]: But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood.

1474
01:47:12,021 --> 01:47:14,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And Shermie needed stuff to pee on.

1475
01:47:14,884 --> 01:47:16,885
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got Shermie stuff to pee on.

1476
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:18,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And I needed Sudafed.

1477
01:47:19,347 --> 01:47:22,769
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can all tell by my 12-year-old boy puberty voice.

1478
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,331
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just saying.

1479
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:31,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So K-More had that many copies of In the Groove there, huh?

1480
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:34,596
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a Mario shirt that I wanted.

1481
01:47:35,737 --> 01:47:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1482
01:47:36,297 --> 01:47:39,779
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I saw Sonic, had to get it.

1483
01:47:39,799 --> 01:47:41,340
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sega fangirl and you had a squeed.

1484
01:47:42,321 --> 01:47:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news.

1485
01:47:44,662 --> 01:47:46,063
[SPEAKER_02]: A few quick news stories for you guys.

1486
01:47:46,678 --> 01:47:55,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Saints Row the Third, of course they had this, you know, April Fool's joke, testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing.

1487
01:47:56,924 --> 01:48:03,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it was Saints Row the Third, enter the dominatrix, and everyone's like, wow, that would be pretty cool.

1488
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:08,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're like, ah, we fooled you, because it's real, and it's coming out.

1489
01:48:09,452 --> 01:48:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole, I don't know, copycat of...

1490
01:48:15,876 --> 01:48:17,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1491
01:48:32,054 --> 01:48:33,215
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1492
01:49:02,437 --> 01:49:11,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently the whole premise of Enter the Dominatrix, which is other than being a complete ripoff of The Matrix, because, you know, that's current.

1493
01:49:12,244 --> 01:49:21,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And so basically the saint's leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord named Zinyak and his benevolent race.

1494
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:26,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently they're trying to grab up all of Earth's resources or something.

1495
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:31,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I guess there's some character named Paul.

1496
01:49:32,477 --> 01:49:54,743
[SPEAKER_03]: who's supposed to play some role in there yay Paul you rock Paul stay awesome Paul it's all for you I'm a huge Paul fan I live for Paul in Saints Row the 3rd who the fuck is Paul I don't know who the fuck Paul is honestly that was a movie

1497
01:49:55,518 --> 01:49:59,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know Paul is a movie, and that was probably funny.

1498
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:06,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just this whole Saints Row, the dominatrix thing, it's neat.

1499
01:50:06,524 --> 01:50:12,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole thing, they say it's supposed to be like this virtual reality thing, so it's going to be similar to kind of like the Deckers missions almost.

1500
01:50:13,288 --> 01:50:18,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm like, dude, your DLC sucked so fucking bad.

1501
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:19,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I really want to play this $30...

1502
01:50:21,973 --> 01:50:22,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just...

1503
01:50:46,045 --> 01:50:47,627
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1504
01:51:04,705 --> 01:51:05,205
[SPEAKER_03]: That was enough.

1505
01:51:06,386 --> 01:51:11,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So Adidas MyCoach was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ.

1506
01:51:12,508 --> 01:51:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion of the Saints Row, because they're in a little financial trouble.

1507
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:22,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time.

1508
01:51:23,352 --> 01:51:28,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So now MyCoach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games.

1509
01:51:28,754 --> 01:51:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: They have taken over the publishing rights for it, so...

1510
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be launching this summer, apparently.

1511
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:37,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have to check that out.

1512
01:51:38,812 --> 01:51:40,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1513
01:51:40,734 --> 01:51:41,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you have it on pre-order.

1514
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:42,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1515
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:43,916
[SPEAKER_03]: You know me and exercise.

1516
01:51:44,776 --> 01:51:49,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, a game that actually took up a lot of my time this week, Perfect Strangers.

1517
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an adver... It was an adver game.

1518
01:51:53,122 --> 01:51:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it says right on the bottom, the guy that's responsible for this actually does adver games for a bunch of different things.

1519
01:51:58,906 --> 01:52:00,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's done some pretty good stuff.

1520
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:00,687
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1521
01:52:00,707 --> 01:52:02,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a well-fucking-done adver game, so props.

1522
01:52:03,009 --> 01:52:03,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It was excellent.

1523
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:23,710
[SPEAKER_03]: and um I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out um and of course it's advertising the uh release I guess of the episodes on iTunes which hey it worked I was unaware that the episodes were even out there I was unaware I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game oh I never forget that show

1524
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:26,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?

1525
01:52:51,846 --> 01:52:56,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I watched some clips of him the other day when I was asking myself the same question.

1526
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:59,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he was in Langoliers and he got mauled at some point.

1527
01:53:00,151 --> 01:53:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.

1528
01:53:01,993 --> 01:53:04,674
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I probably saw him was Beverly Hills Cop 3.

1529
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark Lynn Baker.

1530
01:53:06,516 --> 01:53:07,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever else did he do?

1531
01:53:09,437 --> 01:53:14,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than being like a dead-on ringer for the critic, I don't know.

1532
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:17,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just bask in the awesomeness for a minute.

1533
01:53:34,887 --> 01:53:35,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel inspired.

1534
01:53:35,668 --> 01:53:36,468
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mustang.

1535
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:38,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot he drove a Mustang.

1536
01:53:41,308 --> 01:53:41,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

1537
01:53:41,709 --> 01:53:44,089
[SPEAKER_02]: We just gave these guys a free commercial.

1538
01:53:44,649 --> 01:53:46,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a pretty fucking awesome show.

1539
01:53:46,289 --> 01:53:47,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I did see Second Sight, Rob.

1540
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: That movie was funny.

1541
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:48,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

1542
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:50,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he was addicted to goobers.

1543
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:54,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let me get some stories for you guys.

1544
01:53:54,092 --> 01:53:56,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, a PSA from our chatroom at vognetwork.com.

1545
01:53:57,497 --> 01:54:01,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Pete Garuto is telling us all, you don't know Jack on Facebook is now open to all.

1546
01:54:02,063 --> 01:54:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I'm doing after the show tonight.

1547
01:54:04,375 --> 01:54:06,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane, I gotta cancel Mass Effect Multiplayer.

1548
01:54:06,438 --> 01:54:07,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know Jack is on Facebook now?

1549
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:09,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if he's listening.

1550
01:54:09,761 --> 01:54:13,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get to some other quick news here.

1551
01:54:13,466 --> 01:54:14,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Guy.

1552
01:54:15,148 --> 01:54:17,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they've done a lot of games for Family Guy.

1553
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:18,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if there's been any others.

1554
01:54:18,632 --> 01:54:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: One, and it was not good.

1555
01:54:19,933 --> 01:54:22,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, that was the year they had Adam West at E3.

1556
01:54:22,396 --> 01:54:23,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't good.

1557
01:54:23,397 --> 01:54:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't good, and they did an iOS game, and it wasn't very good either.

1558
01:54:28,021 --> 01:54:30,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe this will redeem it, but we'll see.

1559
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: September 25th, Family Guy, back to the multiverse.

1560
01:54:34,888 --> 01:54:39,492
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 and 360, according to some Amazon stuff that leaked earlier today.

1561
01:54:39,732 --> 01:54:40,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And even earlier on our Twitter.

1562
01:54:42,294 --> 01:54:42,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink wink.

1563
01:54:43,054 --> 01:54:44,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision is involved.

1564
01:54:44,694 --> 01:54:46,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet this will be an E3 showing.

1565
01:54:47,856 --> 01:54:48,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1566
01:54:48,616 --> 01:54:52,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have to look it up because I haven't watched Family Guy in a few years.

1567
01:54:53,518 --> 01:54:54,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly because I do this show.

1568
01:54:54,738 --> 01:54:55,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens to be on at the same time.

1569
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:58,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because it stopped being funny after a while.

1570
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll give it a chance again.

1571
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:03,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't remind the listeners that Family Guy is on.

1572
01:55:04,525 --> 01:55:05,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true, it's true.

1573
01:55:27,998 --> 01:55:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Guy is a browser-based online adventure.

1574
01:55:46,396 --> 01:55:49,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You could say it's for kids, but you know there's going to be some adults that check this out too.

1575
01:55:49,737 --> 01:55:51,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from WB Games Montreal.

1576
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Cartoon universe.

1577
01:55:53,278 --> 01:55:54,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kid-friendly.

1578
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:56,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo.

1579
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: You make your own Toon avatar.

1580
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:05,703
[SPEAKER_02]: You play puzzles and mini-games, meet new friends, and experience the joy of exploring a place that doesn't actually exist.

1581
01:56:06,343 --> 01:56:06,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1582
01:56:06,883 --> 01:56:07,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1583
01:56:08,084 --> 01:56:14,248
[SPEAKER_02]: There's supposed to be popular characters from both the franchises in there, but no playable version of this yet.

1584
01:56:14,348 --> 01:56:15,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a beta.

1585
01:56:15,289 --> 01:56:15,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1586
01:56:15,589 --> 01:56:21,153
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a beta version, I guess, that's out there, but I think it's really bugged from what the early reports are saying.

1587
01:56:21,193 --> 01:56:23,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a beta, but you can check that out.

1588
01:56:23,574 --> 01:56:25,716
[SPEAKER_02]: CartoonUniverse.com.

1589
01:56:25,736 --> 01:56:26,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1590
01:56:26,316 --> 01:56:27,497
[SPEAKER_02]: N-A for North America.

1591
01:56:27,877 --> 01:56:28,718
[SPEAKER_02]: CartoonUniverse.com.

1592
01:56:28,738 --> 01:56:29,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink textures, Rob.

1593
01:56:29,298 --> 01:56:29,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Pink textures.

1594
01:56:30,759 --> 01:56:36,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cute, but if I'm going to play a free-to-play MMO, I'm going to play Star Trek or DC Universe or something.

1595
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:37,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1596
01:56:38,484 --> 01:56:53,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, for those of you guys that aren't cool enough to go to E3 anymore, like, you know, us, at least you can feel like you're there by sitting on the couch with your bonbons and your popcorn, which you can't even have if you actually go to the real thing, because they don't allow that stuff in these, uh...

1597
01:56:54,597 --> 01:57:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: conference centers and watch the E3 presser on Xbox Live or Spike TV.

1598
01:57:00,723 --> 01:57:05,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The Microsoft press conference will be live on Xbox Live and Spike TV.

1599
01:57:06,248 --> 01:57:15,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be spending my time doing what I normally do during these press conferences which is kicking back in the conference room at work and eating a bowl of popcorn while watching this stuff.

1600
01:57:16,218 --> 01:57:18,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I have E3 week off anyway.

1601
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:26,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm at the point where I've been at my job 10 years and I get so much time off a year for being there that long that I just take E3 week off to have it off.

1602
01:57:26,886 --> 01:57:27,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad idea.

1603
01:57:27,947 --> 01:57:28,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I should do that.

1604
01:57:28,947 --> 01:57:29,988
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

1605
01:57:30,529 --> 01:57:33,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I may actually this year have to move.

1606
01:57:34,191 --> 01:57:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Our studio may be moving, by the way.

1607
01:57:35,893 --> 01:57:39,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be moving that week, so I may miss out on some of this.

1608
01:57:40,016 --> 01:57:40,356
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1609
01:57:41,037 --> 01:57:45,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless, for the rest of you guys, you can watch that live as it unfolds.

1610
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:49,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine it's going to be any different for Sony and Nintendo.

1611
01:57:49,404 --> 01:57:56,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, maybe they'll be on G4 or PlayStation Home or, you know, they'll be available as well.

1612
01:57:56,129 --> 01:58:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Xbox used to be on G4, so it's like now Spike has more gaming cred than G4, which, yeah, I can see that.

1613
01:58:04,217 --> 01:58:05,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny how that works.

1614
01:58:05,321 --> 01:58:06,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny how that works.

1615
01:58:06,545 --> 01:58:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1616
01:58:06,765 --> 01:58:09,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys in the Fugle Question of the Week.

1617
01:58:10,596 --> 01:58:11,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, me, huh?

1618
01:58:12,456 --> 01:58:19,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there is going to be Cave Story Plus on the 3DS eShop soon, but it's not going to be the Cave Story 3D.

1619
01:58:19,898 --> 01:58:20,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a separate one.

1620
01:58:20,618 --> 01:58:22,799
[SPEAKER_10]: All it is is an update for the 3DS.

1621
01:58:23,499 --> 01:58:33,121
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, Tyrone Rodriguez, the CEO of Nicholas, said that he really wanted it just to be the update, so neither game would interfere with the other if you happened to delete one.

1622
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little weird, isn't it?

1623
01:58:35,261 --> 01:58:38,162
[SPEAKER_03]: That you would make a second remake of your game?

1624
01:58:38,422 --> 01:58:42,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Cave Story 3D is a separate game from Cave Story Plus.

1625
01:58:43,224 --> 01:58:44,025
[SPEAKER_10]: They're two different games.

1626
01:58:46,006 --> 01:58:49,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, dog, I heard you like Cave Story, so we put some Cave Story in your Cave Story.

1627
01:58:51,159 --> 01:59:00,823
[SPEAKER_10]: and for our listeners in the UK, the UK Pride Xbox Connect Bundle will be available in May and I kind of want it, but not really.

1628
01:59:01,343 --> 01:59:03,324
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be Â£249.99, so there you go.

1629
01:59:03,344 --> 01:59:04,165
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also going to be a...

1630
01:59:14,306 --> 01:59:20,832
[SPEAKER_10]: A skin available, Jealous Skins is going to make a pattern for $30.

1631
01:59:21,472 --> 01:59:31,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also, though, do have a Stars and Stripes bundle for the American audiences or anyone who happens to want an American flag on their game or something.

1632
01:59:33,162 --> 01:59:34,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Confederate flag.

1633
01:59:34,283 --> 01:59:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they have the Confederate flag, too, you know.

1634
01:59:36,528 --> 01:59:37,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shush.

1635
01:59:37,669 --> 01:59:40,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Ratchet & Clank HD Trilogy has been pushed back in Europe.

1636
01:59:41,373 --> 01:59:47,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be pushed from the 16th of May until early June, Insomniac has announced.

1637
01:59:50,102 --> 01:59:50,443
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1638
01:59:50,823 --> 01:59:51,244
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1639
01:59:52,475 --> 01:59:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the Fugle question of the week, except I'm failing, and I did this last week too, didn't I?

1640
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:00,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something about the network change.

1641
02:00:00,597 --> 02:00:11,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the music up for this segment, but every week we go to our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus.

1642
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:15,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're on Google Plus with all the Google employees that are still there.

1643
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some very loyal Google Plus listeners, though, and I get it.

1644
02:00:19,383 --> 02:00:21,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, Facebook does some real dumb shit.

1645
02:00:21,185 --> 02:00:22,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about now what they're doing?

1646
02:00:23,046 --> 02:00:24,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I get why people want to run off to Google Plus.

1647
02:00:25,427 --> 02:00:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Messenger thing will now have this actual Facebook Messenger app that's coming.

1648
02:00:31,131 --> 02:00:33,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And look this up on the Internet if you don't believe me.

1649
02:00:34,232 --> 02:00:41,497
[SPEAKER_02]: The Facebook Messenger app on the iPhone will now send your location with the messages that you send

1650
02:00:42,017 --> 02:00:43,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn that off.

1651
02:00:43,598 --> 02:00:44,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be fair, you can't turn that off.

1652
02:00:44,778 --> 02:00:50,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know it'll be on by default because nobody at Facebook knows what opt-in is all about.

1653
02:00:50,381 --> 02:00:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing with this is that return receipts, you can now request a return receipt for when somebody's read your message.

1654
02:00:57,805 --> 02:00:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't turn that off.

1655
02:00:59,606 --> 02:01:02,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't want someone to know you read their message, too bad.

1656
02:01:02,908 --> 02:01:05,409
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great for the stalkers that Facebook message you.

1657
02:01:06,846 --> 02:01:09,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure you could use a third-party app for that.

1658
02:01:10,288 --> 02:01:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

1659
02:01:11,108 --> 02:01:14,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the specifics of how it worked, but when I read that, I was like, grr.

1660
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: More importantly, though, Ranma in chat has informed us that Bronson Pinchot actually has a reality show on DIY.

1661
02:01:24,274 --> 02:01:25,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I was unaware of this.

1662
02:01:25,274 --> 02:01:26,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds interesting.

1663
02:01:26,495 --> 02:01:27,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's not.

1664
02:01:27,115 --> 02:01:30,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, Rob, I don't use the messenger anyway.

1665
02:01:30,276 --> 02:01:31,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I always have it linked me as offline.

1666
02:01:33,141 --> 02:01:39,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, I don't know the specifics, but I look at this and I raise my eyebrow and I go, do not want.

1667
02:01:42,436 --> 02:01:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's go on to happier topics.

1668
02:01:43,818 --> 02:01:45,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I make everyone get AIM.

1669
02:01:46,943 --> 02:01:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: FUGLE QUESTION OF THE WEEK

1670
02:02:06,127 --> 02:02:11,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Has a video game ever inspired you to create something artistic in the real world?

1671
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, art, music, a website, anything creative.

1672
02:02:15,552 --> 02:02:18,474
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you create and why did the game inspire you to do this?

1673
02:02:19,554 --> 02:02:21,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shane from Horde House started us off.

1674
02:02:21,935 --> 02:02:26,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm too busy writing my Mail Shepherd Caden fanfic to answer this question.

1675
02:02:27,678 --> 02:02:29,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I've written fanfiction.

1676
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1677
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: For what game?

1678
02:02:31,147 --> 02:02:34,390
[SPEAKER_10]: For a number of games, I mean, just stuff I played.

1679
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I did Metroid back in the day.

1680
02:02:37,812 --> 02:02:38,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Just old stuff.

1681
02:02:38,773 --> 02:02:43,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the last thing that I did was actually for Digimon, of all things.

1682
02:02:43,717 --> 02:02:44,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1683
02:02:44,298 --> 02:02:47,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to put together, well, I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto.

1684
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:57,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, I was inspired to try to figure out what the song from DJ Hero 2 would sound like, the mashup between piano and shout, so I did that.

1685
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:01,072
[SPEAKER_10]: and I've done fan art.

1686
02:03:02,233 --> 02:03:06,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember I did my portal turret for my final project in 3D class.

1687
02:03:06,397 --> 02:03:09,579
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get some more of the answers over on Facebook.

1688
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an answer from Johnny B. Johnny Cage's ball bust a move inspired me to create an athletic cup attached with nails and screws.

1689
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:25,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I advertise this tool of protection for men, women and everyone in between.

1690
02:03:26,034 --> 02:03:26,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny.

1691
02:03:26,795 --> 02:03:27,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, I have a tip for you.

1692
02:03:48,567 --> 02:03:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob on Public Access

1693
02:04:08,985 --> 02:04:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've seen some of it.

1694
02:04:10,387 --> 02:04:12,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you saw, I don't even know where the tapes are.

1695
02:04:12,609 --> 02:04:13,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't.

1696
02:04:13,610 --> 02:04:14,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who uses VHS tapes?

1697
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:16,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fantastic, I have to say.

1698
02:04:16,753 --> 02:04:18,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fantastic.

1699
02:04:19,976 --> 02:04:21,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I'm being serious here.

1700
02:04:22,899 --> 02:04:29,806
[SPEAKER_03]: If shit like Tim and Eric's awesome show Great Job can do as well as it does, that Public Access show could have been a hit.

1701
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:31,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's a shame.

1702
02:04:31,632 --> 02:04:32,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost touch.

1703
02:04:32,774 --> 02:04:40,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're Facebook friends, but my friend Shannon, who was like my bestie in high school, and I did a comedy show on public access.

1704
02:04:40,406 --> 02:04:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what.

1705
02:04:41,848 --> 02:04:43,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids in high school are such...

1706
02:04:44,284 --> 02:05:01,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Cockhead bastard fucks Like, you know, we used to get Like the guys before us did this very, you know, conservative slanted show Because they learned that from their parents Called, I'm gonna name names Because I'm 33 and I don't give a fuck anymore It was a show called Open Debate

1707
02:05:02,466 --> 02:05:31,537
[SPEAKER_02]: and these guys would just sit there they fucking would razz our show that was coming up like live on their show and the callers would call in and like talk about what a fag I was on public access TV I got bullied on television you guys but it gets better don't worry all I'm saying is you need to put a clause in your will or something like that that stuff gets released when you die unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately probably died with her as well I mean

1708
02:05:33,356 --> 02:05:37,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to belittle janitors Because janitors do an important job

1709
02:06:02,771 --> 02:06:03,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1710
02:06:05,213 --> 02:06:07,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Porkchop answered our question on Facebook.

1711
02:06:08,155 --> 02:06:10,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much create, but adapted.

1712
02:06:10,477 --> 02:06:17,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The Final Fantasy soundtracks inspired me to adapt some of their songs on guitar, such as Eternity Lightwaves and Aerith's Theme.

1713
02:06:17,462 --> 02:06:22,445
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's music always impressed me and was very memorable, which made me want to learn these songs for myself.

1714
02:06:22,845 --> 02:06:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result of this, Nobuo Uematsu is also my favorite composer.

1715
02:06:26,128 --> 02:06:30,291
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, that's almost the same story that Random told about Goonies 2.

1716
02:06:31,499 --> 02:06:35,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say, Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major.

1717
02:06:35,903 --> 02:06:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1718
02:06:36,483 --> 02:06:37,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And I met him, remember?

1719
02:06:38,525 --> 02:06:39,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that.

1720
02:06:41,067 --> 02:06:45,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this answer from Stan H on Facebook says, playing Journey as I type this.

1721
02:06:46,212 --> 02:06:48,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to knit the scarf and be crazy long.

1722
02:06:49,995 --> 02:06:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Journey joke.

1723
02:06:50,996 --> 02:06:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1724
02:06:52,517 --> 02:07:01,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, from Paul W. Is it weird that when you first said, oh yeah, he did a remix thing based on Journey that I thought of Journey the arcade game?

1725
02:07:03,203 --> 02:07:05,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I was worried people would think that.

1726
02:07:05,725 --> 02:07:06,005
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1727
02:07:06,565 --> 02:07:10,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, one more answer here from Facebook, and then I got one on Google.

1728
02:07:10,791 --> 02:07:21,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul W. says, Back when I was in second or third grade during the NES and Sega Master System days, I would create my own illustrations of enemies' bosses when instruction manuals for game were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent.

1729
02:07:22,225 --> 02:07:28,029
[SPEAKER_02]: These were new creations I had imagined for sequels to games such as Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast.

1730
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:36,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us did that kind of crap as a kid, Paul, because I can tell you, you must have done this too, and everybody that grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this.

1731
02:07:37,094 --> 02:07:46,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the RPG on the notepad where you drew the dungeon and you'd make your friends go through the dungeon and it was like you wrote your own video game on paper?

1732
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:46,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1733
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:50,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have a tablet of that stuff and I'm so sad that I lost it.

1734
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:53,345
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we're friends, because I knew you were that kid.

1735
02:07:53,485 --> 02:07:54,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even have to ask.

1736
02:07:54,626 --> 02:07:59,390
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it started off because I used to like, okay, basically I was inspired by Contra.

1737
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:02,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to love drawing mazes, and so that's what I'd do.

1738
02:08:02,272 --> 02:08:09,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd create mazes, and then they were mazes with cannons in them, and then mazes with spikes and cannons and alien monsters and stuff like that.

1739
02:08:09,778 --> 02:08:11,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of like that.

1740
02:08:11,879 --> 02:08:13,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like bullet hell, but on paper.

1741
02:08:15,362 --> 02:08:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to the one answer here on Google+.

1742
02:08:18,348 --> 02:08:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim H. You go.

1743
02:08:20,429 --> 02:08:21,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim's the loyal Google user.

1744
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

1745
02:08:22,589 --> 02:08:29,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of embarrassing to admit this, but in my documentary class in film school, I made a one-minute doclet about my holy priest character in Warcraft.

1746
02:08:30,092 --> 02:08:36,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got an A on the project and had to answer questions from my instructor like, have you ever let another player die on purpose?

1747
02:08:37,154 --> 02:08:37,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Great story.

1748
02:08:38,374 --> 02:08:38,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1749
02:08:39,134 --> 02:08:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the answer is yes.

1750
02:08:43,396 --> 02:08:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1751
02:08:43,676 --> 02:08:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1752
02:08:44,016 --> 02:08:45,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.

1753
02:08:45,936 --> 02:08:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back into some news, Loki.

1754
02:08:48,547 --> 02:08:51,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Warp, Shank, Shank 2, Gatling Gears, Deathspank, and Deathspank the Thong of Virtue

1755
02:09:08,602 --> 02:09:34,384
[SPEAKER_03]: and ironically enough it's actually being released on Steam as part of Steam Play and they're also having some other indies that are available as well I guess Death's Bank titles are currently $7.50 individually and then EA's rest of their indie titles are $5 each and those are PC only whereas the Death's Bank titles are PC and Mac um

1756
02:09:36,045 --> 02:09:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, interesting enough, though, uh, you know, they've also gotten some, um, hate from, you know, just, just this guy that put out a game called Minecraft.

1757
02:09:47,197 --> 02:09:51,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's right, Notch, uh, basically saying- What's a Minecraft?

1758
02:09:51,842 --> 02:09:52,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's a Minecraft?

1759
02:09:53,224 --> 02:09:56,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically said, EA's releasing- How do you mine fish?

1760
02:09:58,419 --> 02:10:02,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So EA's releasing an indie bundle.

1761
02:10:03,382 --> 02:10:05,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how that works, EA.

1762
02:10:05,403 --> 02:10:08,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop attempting to ruin everything, you bunch of cynical bastards.

1763
02:10:10,025 --> 02:10:11,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, tweet drama.

1764
02:10:12,506 --> 02:10:14,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going down on Twitter, y'all.

1765
02:10:15,067 --> 02:10:15,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1766
02:10:16,228 --> 02:10:21,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It did strike me as really funny that the EA indie bundle was on Steam and not on Origin.

1767
02:10:23,151 --> 02:10:23,731
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1768
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:50,320
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you like to see us approve on Origin?

1769
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:55,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, kind of almost admitting that it hasn't been that great.

1770
02:10:55,827 --> 02:11:00,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would you guys like to see us do, you know, to fix it?

1771
02:11:01,595 --> 02:11:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Close it down and put the games on Steam?

1772
02:11:04,419 --> 02:11:07,262
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to do that Although, you know what?

1773
02:11:07,563 --> 02:11:19,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Competition is healthy for the industry So, you know, I don't want Steam to be the one and only But, you know, I don't know if EA should really be giving their own store But I will say this You know, despite the cynical bastard I am in all this I will say something nice about Origin this week

1774
02:11:20,951 --> 02:11:27,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play, and I didn't talk about this in my gaming week, but I did play that Mass Effect 3 datapad game that helps you with your galactic readiness.

1775
02:11:27,395 --> 02:11:32,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry last week because I said that you have to play multiplayer?

1776
02:11:32,638 --> 02:11:33,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And I downloaded that thing.

1777
02:11:33,799 --> 02:11:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1778
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:44,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does turn out, and I do stand corrected, thank you chat room, that's the perk of doing a live show, that you can download this Mass Effect datapad and raise your galactic readiness rating in a...

1779
02:11:45,046 --> 02:12:11,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much one of those like Facebooky type of games that you know you send your ship out and wait three hours and you can check on it what have you and it helps raise your galactic readiness and I gotta say the way that all ties together and how you do that on your iPhone yet it impacts what happens on the Xbox and you can check your multiplayer unlocks on the PC that kind of synergy is neat it is neat

1780
02:12:12,529 --> 02:12:14,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done well.

1781
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:18,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will tip my hat slightly to that.

1782
02:12:18,911 --> 02:12:23,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs left and right wherever they can get it.

1783
02:12:23,153 --> 02:12:26,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the free stuff that's there, it's pretty cool.

1784
02:12:27,355 --> 02:12:30,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will say that nice thing about Origin.

1785
02:12:30,216 --> 02:12:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the EA Indie Bundle on Steam...

1786
02:12:34,793 --> 02:12:35,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1787
02:12:35,513 --> 02:12:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought it would be a clever thing and probably didn't go through all the necessary checks and now they're paying for it in the media just like everything else.

1788
02:12:46,417 --> 02:12:48,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what else EA paid for in the media this week?

1789
02:12:50,018 --> 02:12:53,499
[SPEAKER_02]: A big snafu in their Rock Band iOS game.

1790
02:12:54,840 --> 02:13:03,603
[SPEAKER_02]: A big pop-up showed up when logging into Rock Band on the iPhone or the iPad this week that said, on May 31st, Rock Band will no longer be playable on your device.

1791
02:13:04,023 --> 02:13:05,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for rocking out with us.

1792
02:13:05,863 --> 02:13:07,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody was like, what?

1793
02:13:08,044 --> 02:13:08,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck?

1794
02:13:09,246 --> 02:13:13,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought this game and I bought the DLC, it's on my phone, and EA's just gonna fucking shut it off.

1795
02:13:14,493 --> 02:13:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yank, pull the plug, pull it from my phone, can't play it anymore.

1796
02:13:17,117 --> 02:13:24,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention that while that little pop-up's going on, it's still being currently sold on iOS's App Store.

1797
02:13:24,588 --> 02:13:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1798
02:13:51,641 --> 02:13:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, came out later in the week.

1799
02:13:53,463 --> 02:14:00,349
[SPEAKER_02]: EA came out and said, that prompt was made an error, and we will give you more information soon.

1800
02:14:00,389 --> 02:14:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, quote, we apologize for the confusion this caused.

1801
02:14:03,452 --> 02:14:09,438
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working to clarify the issue that caused the error, and we'll share additional information as soon as possible.

1802
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:11,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Clarify the issue, fire the employee, you know.

1803
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because... Ah, they didn't like that.

1804
02:14:14,742 --> 02:14:15,803
[SPEAKER_02]: How did this happen?

1805
02:14:16,344 --> 02:14:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: The cat did not sneak in in the middle of the night and type Dear Rockers on May 31st.

1806
02:14:22,528 --> 02:14:24,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an intentional message.

1807
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:26,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the thanks for rocking out with us.

1808
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:31,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for paying this money, but your game is no longer going to work.

1809
02:14:31,362 --> 02:14:32,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's my thought.

1810
02:14:32,323 --> 02:14:34,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a random ass theory, and this ties back into Mass Effect.

1811
02:14:35,905 --> 02:14:45,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they announced this Mass Effect free DLC that's coming out in the summer, but they put an expiration date on it saying you can get it free until 2013 or 2014, something like that.

1812
02:14:46,091 --> 02:14:54,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bioware said, note, we don't plan to ever not make it free, but EA's policies require us to set an expiration date.

1813
02:14:55,257 --> 02:15:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know as long as they don't have to honor it and also speaking of Mass Effect when I bought Mass Effect 2 brand new mind you I had a coupon in the box for an online pass expires February 1st 2012 and it was like mid February by the time I was ready to play it it's still redeemed but that expiration date was there and I was about ready to go through the fucking roof because I bought that new just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass I almost went through the roof it did work but

1814
02:15:24,217 --> 02:15:29,382
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me wonder, EA has this crackhead policy of having expiration dates.

1815
02:15:29,502 --> 02:15:31,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they have expiration dates?

1816
02:15:31,084 --> 02:15:34,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great fucking question that I would like EA to answer.

1817
02:15:35,225 --> 02:15:37,366
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't understand why they have expiration dates.

1818
02:15:37,446 --> 02:15:42,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand they'll do that on certain things, like, for example, Ultraviolet.

1819
02:15:42,449 --> 02:15:51,795
[SPEAKER_03]: You may notice with a lot of the DVDs and Blu-rays that are out there now, come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy that you can redeem by a certain date.

1820
02:15:52,195 --> 02:15:56,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if it's just because they don't want to keep those copies up on their servers forever.

1821
02:15:56,858 --> 02:15:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, forever or something.

1822
02:15:58,939 --> 02:16:03,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even make any sense because once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection, you can always stream it.

1823
02:16:04,621 --> 02:16:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just don't understand why on a paid app it can expire like that.

1824
02:16:10,443 --> 02:16:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And that right there is a perfect example of why going digital only is a bad fucking idea.

1825
02:16:17,546 --> 02:16:22,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what's going to stop EA or any company from going, Yeah, we just want this game to work anymore.

1826
02:16:23,609 --> 02:16:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's it.

1827
02:16:24,209 --> 02:16:25,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no recourse.

1828
02:16:25,370 --> 02:16:37,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, Rock Band is on your phone and you don't need... I mean, I understand if they're shutting down the online music store or they're shutting down the multiplayer or whatever, but how can they...

1829
02:16:37,902 --> 02:16:41,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop the entire app, including single player, from working.

1830
02:16:41,985 --> 02:16:43,706
[SPEAKER_02]: How very dare you, EA.

1831
02:16:44,066 --> 02:16:49,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it's a free app, I can see, okay, maybe this is going to expire and a new one's going to come out.

1832
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Disneytron app that did that, but it was free.

1833
02:16:52,692 --> 02:16:55,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, though, and this is kind of pointed out as well.

1834
02:16:55,694 --> 02:16:57,656
[SPEAKER_03]: They did something similar with Tetris.

1835
02:16:57,796 --> 02:17:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetris, for example, it expired and stopped working.

1836
02:17:00,798 --> 02:17:01,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

1837
02:17:01,718 --> 02:17:03,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they sold a new version of Tetris.

1838
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:04,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy it again.

1839
02:17:05,921 --> 02:17:08,282
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you think that they might not try this again?

1840
02:17:08,442 --> 02:17:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yet PopCap, who is now owned by EA, PopCap did it a little better because they turned Bejeweled 2.

1841
02:17:15,164 --> 02:17:19,986
[SPEAKER_02]: They spun off Bejeweled Blitz into its own game, but they made it free.

1842
02:17:20,326 --> 02:17:22,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop working.

1843
02:17:22,367 --> 02:17:24,307
[SPEAKER_02]: You still got that, even though they have Bejeweled 3.

1844
02:17:24,347 --> 02:17:29,269
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of pushed people to go get Bejeweled 3, but they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working.

1845
02:17:30,129 --> 02:17:30,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1846
02:17:51,957 --> 02:17:52,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined it.

1847
02:18:15,248 --> 02:18:23,272
[SPEAKER_02]: When the full VOG Network launches soon, I can't tell you when, but it'll be sooner than you think, we'll have a link to that a little more directly.

1848
02:18:24,013 --> 02:18:26,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I am still able to play Bejeweled 2 on my phone.

1849
02:18:27,415 --> 02:18:27,735
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1850
02:18:27,755 --> 02:18:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the music.

1851
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:35,739
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't surprise me that they would be the ones behind this.

1852
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:36,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1853
02:18:37,871 --> 02:18:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go to the mailbag.

1854
02:18:40,913 --> 02:18:41,774
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura left the room.

1855
02:18:41,794 --> 02:18:42,595
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll be back in a minute here.

1856
02:18:42,855 --> 02:18:43,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, here she comes.

1857
02:18:44,356 --> 02:18:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1858
02:18:45,597 --> 02:18:46,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm allergic to mail.

1859
02:18:48,119 --> 02:18:49,500
[SPEAKER_02]: M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L?

1860
02:18:50,681 --> 02:18:51,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Both.

1861
02:18:51,422 --> 02:18:54,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, mailbag at orangeloungetrader.com is the place to send us your emails.

1862
02:18:54,744 --> 02:18:56,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura might read them.

1863
02:18:58,227 --> 02:19:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, hopefully you have some emails for us tonight.

1864
02:19:18,579 --> 02:19:27,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of, I know that content downloading from the store on PSP, if interrupted, will have to start completely over, which seems unfortunate for a portable, even considering its age.

1865
02:19:27,387 --> 02:19:31,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the Vita have this issue, or can software be loaded a little at a time?

1866
02:19:31,631 --> 02:19:32,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1867
02:19:33,052 --> 02:19:34,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Vita people, will it work?

1868
02:19:35,054 --> 02:19:35,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it work?

1869
02:19:36,735 --> 02:19:37,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it blend?

1870
02:19:38,296 --> 02:19:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you even listening?

1871
02:19:40,498 --> 02:19:41,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of tuning out.

1872
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:42,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1873
02:19:43,103 --> 02:19:48,406
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants to know if you can download incrementally on the Vita or will you have to start over like on the PSP?

1874
02:19:48,606 --> 02:19:51,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can download incrementally.

1875
02:19:51,548 --> 02:19:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in download or whatever, or if you happen to turn your system off or something like that, it will restart where it's at.

1876
02:19:57,331 --> 02:20:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the Vita really encourages you to put it to sleep, not to turn it off.

1877
02:20:01,853 --> 02:20:05,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You sleep it, and while it's sleeping, it'll download your shit, which is good.

1878
02:20:05,535 --> 02:20:11,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in fact, I keep forgetting that I have mine in sleep mode, like in my bag for like a... And then the battery's dead three days later.

1879
02:20:11,641 --> 02:20:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, exactly.

1880
02:20:11,861 --> 02:20:14,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was like, oh, shit, I better charge this again.

1881
02:20:14,664 --> 02:20:16,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP.

1882
02:20:16,646 --> 02:20:19,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure someone sells one, but... They sell one.

1883
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do they?

1884
02:20:19,929 --> 02:20:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1885
02:20:20,049 --> 02:20:20,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course they do.

1886
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love that 3DS dock.

1887
02:20:22,792 --> 02:20:24,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it so great to remember to charge it.

1888
02:20:24,834 --> 02:20:27,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a cheap piece of plastic, but it works so well.

1889
02:20:28,534 --> 02:20:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I almost skipped this email because it said oral advertising, but I saw who sent it.

1890
02:20:34,619 --> 02:20:37,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Dearest members of the online video game radio cast Pundidocracy.

1891
02:20:38,422 --> 02:20:39,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought it was some French spam for a minute.

1892
02:20:40,003 --> 02:20:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: We get inundated with French spam.

1893
02:20:41,464 --> 02:20:42,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

1894
02:20:43,086 --> 02:20:47,229
[SPEAKER_10]: This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD collection being released on Vita.

1895
02:20:47,609 --> 02:20:53,093
[SPEAKER_10]: The very possibility of a collection of games such as this being released on the Vita brought the following questions to my mind.

1896
02:20:53,694 --> 02:20:55,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3?

1897
02:20:56,696 --> 02:20:57,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay care, bettertainment.

1898
02:20:58,258 --> 02:21:02,041
[SPEAKER_10]: This message has been brought to you by oral advertising sent from my iPad.

1899
02:21:03,642 --> 02:21:05,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you don't even get all three games.

1900
02:21:05,744 --> 02:21:06,705
[SPEAKER_03]: You only get two of the three.

1901
02:21:07,205 --> 02:21:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1902
02:21:07,966 --> 02:21:08,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Acid 3.

1903
02:21:08,707 --> 02:21:10,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you going to have to blow to get that?

1904
02:21:10,889 --> 02:21:12,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably... Kojima.

1905
02:21:12,570 --> 02:21:13,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Kojima, I think.

1906
02:21:14,052 --> 02:21:15,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I understand, he's not too into the blow.

1907
02:21:15,993 --> 02:21:17,014
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd have to get his ass.

1908
02:21:18,015 --> 02:21:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I would see Acid 3 more on the 3DS than... Because remember they had the whole...

1909
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:28,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that really weird, like, binoculars garbage that you had to put on there?

1910
02:21:28,603 --> 02:21:30,444
[SPEAKER_02]: There also is a Metal Gear something.

1911
02:21:30,464 --> 02:21:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if it came out or not.

1912
02:21:32,765 --> 02:21:36,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's out yet, but they were demoing one a long time ago, a Metal Gear something on 3DS.

1913
02:21:36,708 --> 02:21:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that came out already.

1914
02:21:37,708 --> 02:21:40,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.

1915
02:21:41,831 --> 02:21:43,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Snake Eater.

1916
02:21:44,432 --> 02:21:45,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes?

1917
02:21:48,492 --> 02:22:03,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, this is Honey Badger, aka Blade 3 Okay, I have to stop and apologize Because Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night While I was drunk off cheap sangria Off my ghetto sangria made from Manischewitz So I'm sorry, I was a little drunk

1918
02:22:05,508 --> 02:22:08,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say the listeners will support you no matter what changes you make.

1919
02:22:09,712 --> 02:22:14,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I have a question for you all, but I think Loki may have the most input.

1920
02:22:14,677 --> 02:22:21,184
[SPEAKER_10]: How close are we to having essentially gaming computers and fancy cases that are just locked down by Microsoft or Sony?

1921
02:22:21,505 --> 02:22:25,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, where does the line between high-end console and gaming PCs start?

1922
02:22:27,171 --> 02:22:28,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much that's what they are now anyways.

1923
02:22:28,752 --> 02:22:37,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just gaming PCs, but it's proprietary boards and whatnot, and specialized chips that are made specifically for these systems.

1924
02:22:37,918 --> 02:22:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was a little bit more like gaming PCs, but I understand why they have limitations.

1925
02:22:43,121 --> 02:22:49,145
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would be kind of cool if, for example, you could have an Xbox 360 and be able to upgrade the RAM in it.

1926
02:22:49,445 --> 02:22:52,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, say, okay, all the games have to run with this amount of RAM,

1927
02:22:52,887 --> 02:22:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want the games to run a little bit smoother, you can add extra RAM.

1928
02:22:55,708 --> 02:22:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space.

1929
02:22:57,468 --> 02:23:00,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be worried, though, about those minimum system requirements slowly bumping up.

1930
02:23:00,989 --> 02:23:04,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the one thing that makes people a little leery of PC gaming.

1931
02:23:04,690 --> 02:23:06,091
[SPEAKER_03]: But RAM's so cheap nowadays.

1932
02:23:06,171 --> 02:23:08,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but, you know, then it's the video card.

1933
02:23:08,992 --> 02:23:13,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's, you know, the operating system that your thing's running.

1934
02:23:13,733 --> 02:23:15,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's the space on your hard drive.

1935
02:23:15,974 --> 02:23:16,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know...

1936
02:23:17,213 --> 02:23:18,133
[SPEAKER_02]: If any one thing is another.

1937
02:23:20,154 --> 02:23:21,074
[SPEAKER_09]: So next email.

1938
02:23:21,374 --> 02:23:23,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say real quick, though, since that was from Honey Badger.

1939
02:23:24,015 --> 02:23:26,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that name, by the way, because it always makes me think it is.

1940
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch it run in slow motion.

1941
02:23:29,877 --> 02:23:31,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty badass.

1942
02:23:31,137 --> 02:23:32,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, it runs all over the place.

1943
02:23:32,758 --> 02:23:35,279
[SPEAKER_10]: We should get Randall to do a bumper for us.

1944
02:23:35,639 --> 02:23:36,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

1945
02:23:36,739 --> 02:23:38,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to Orange Dolls Radio.

1946
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:40,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fuck your shit up.

1947
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not, you're a bitch.

1948
02:23:46,043 --> 02:23:46,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, it's Jim Sally.

1949
02:23:47,125 --> 02:23:47,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have to do the choo-choo noise?

1950
02:24:04,252 --> 02:24:07,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I live in Canada, sorry, and work as a party train conductor.

1951
02:24:08,233 --> 02:24:13,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Recently, me and my wife started shopping for Robot Butler, but we can't decide what features we want.

1952
02:24:13,095 --> 02:24:13,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1953
02:24:13,655 --> 02:24:14,916
[SPEAKER_02]: He really is a train conductor?

1954
02:24:15,476 --> 02:24:16,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's full of shit.

1955
02:24:16,596 --> 02:24:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a... No, I mean like... Let me finish the email.

1956
02:24:19,337 --> 02:24:21,518
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad... A party train conductor.

1957
02:24:21,778 --> 02:24:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1958
02:24:22,058 --> 02:24:22,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Party train.

1959
02:24:23,119 --> 02:24:24,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit, legit.

1960
02:24:24,279 --> 02:24:28,361
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad, for many years, he recently retired, but for about...

1961
02:24:29,861 --> 02:24:34,223
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 years he worked for the railroad and he was a train conductor.

1962
02:24:34,743 --> 02:24:36,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I hear that, I perk up.

1963
02:24:36,584 --> 02:24:38,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just saying.

1964
02:24:38,425 --> 02:24:41,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I empathize with the train people.

1965
02:24:43,287 --> 02:24:46,349
[SPEAKER_10]: She loves data from Star Trek, but I'm more of an R2-D2 kind of guy.

1966
02:24:46,769 --> 02:24:49,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Which fictional robot would you like to have in your real life?

1967
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:52,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides on the Sally Express.

1968
02:24:53,011 --> 02:24:54,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Love you and good night, Jim Sally.

1969
02:24:56,321 --> 02:24:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: E.D.

1970
02:24:56,641 --> 02:25:12,835
[SPEAKER_02]: cause she's hot Mass Effect reference that's all I have on the brain recently I think you know maybe the the gigalobot from Artificial Intelligence

1971
02:25:14,028 --> 02:25:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Does a Cylon count as a robot?

1972
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:19,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they cybernetic?

1973
02:25:19,631 --> 02:25:24,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to spoil, but there's a certain Cylon that's really hot.

1974
02:25:24,513 --> 02:25:26,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they full-on robots or are they cybernetic?

1975
02:25:28,966 --> 02:25:31,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I can say Angelica Houston from Captain EO.

1976
02:25:32,587 --> 02:25:33,527
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great choice.

1977
02:25:33,567 --> 02:25:34,788
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's cybernetic.

1978
02:25:35,988 --> 02:25:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So are the Borgs.

1979
02:25:37,068 --> 02:25:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1980
02:25:37,989 --> 02:25:38,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our show.

1981
02:25:38,769 --> 02:25:40,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please.

1982
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:43,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO.

1983
02:25:45,011 --> 02:25:47,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I want Angelica Houston to service me.

1984
02:25:49,938 --> 02:25:56,100
[SPEAKER_02]: and I want a certain unsaid very hot Cylon that was revealed in the third season finale.

1985
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just leave it at that.

1986
02:25:58,641 --> 02:25:59,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So what about you, Loki?

1987
02:25:59,881 --> 02:26:00,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a portal turret.

1988
02:26:00,981 --> 02:26:01,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It's technically a robot.

1989
02:26:03,422 --> 02:26:04,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm going to change mine to GLaDOS.

1990
02:26:06,303 --> 02:26:08,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be her when I grow up and die.

1991
02:26:10,064 --> 02:26:10,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the last email.

1992
02:26:10,944 --> 02:26:11,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be in a potato?

1993
02:26:13,185 --> 02:26:13,765
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1994
02:26:14,505 --> 02:26:15,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll french fry you, bitch.

1995
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:19,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch, I will come back and julienne you.

1996
02:26:19,912 --> 02:26:23,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take you to In-N-Out and watch them put you in the blender thing.

1997
02:26:25,593 --> 02:26:26,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1998
02:26:26,774 --> 02:26:27,414
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, Rob?

1999
02:26:27,934 --> 02:26:28,154
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2000
02:26:29,674 --> 02:26:30,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, I'm getting applause.

2001
02:26:31,054 --> 02:26:31,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting the slow clap.

2002
02:26:32,655 --> 02:26:33,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Howdy, OLR.

2003
02:26:33,815 --> 02:26:37,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to call in, but something came up as usual.

2004
02:26:38,016 --> 02:26:38,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2005
02:26:38,436 --> 02:26:39,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that why they're calling it these days?

2006
02:26:40,176 --> 02:26:41,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, I'm writing you folks instead.

2007
02:26:42,256 --> 02:26:45,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I was having a discussion with... We're getting the manual work, I see.

2008
02:26:45,817 --> 02:26:46,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So you mean you want them to be Sega?

2009
02:27:06,297 --> 02:27:07,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They want them to go first to third.

2010
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:12,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great thing for the fanboys to fantasize about.

2011
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't gonna happen.

2012
02:27:14,668 --> 02:27:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't gonna happen, not for a long time.

2013
02:27:17,332 --> 02:27:21,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that will happen over Miyamoto's dead body, literally.

2014
02:27:22,578 --> 02:27:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's a Japanese company, and there's a lot of... I don't want to sound rude or mean, but just look at the history.

2015
02:27:32,827 --> 02:27:39,653
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that, that they know what the people want, and that's not the way they want to go down.

2016
02:27:39,753 --> 02:27:45,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wanted to look for another example of what I'm talking about, the history of this show, we talked a lot about Konami.

2017
02:27:45,938 --> 02:27:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And Konami, and I had this conversation with a friend just the other day, Konami...

2018
02:27:51,042 --> 02:28:02,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw, Konami should have had the music, Konami had every right to be the kings of music games in America as well as Japan, but they fucked it up by not taking the risks.

2019
02:28:02,671 --> 02:28:11,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They did for a little while when there was a guy in America influencing a lot, but then that guy wasn't around anymore and music games at Konami fell the fuck apart.

2020
02:28:11,958 --> 02:28:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, Rock Revolution.

2021
02:28:13,579 --> 02:28:14,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Nintendo will

2022
02:28:36,838 --> 02:28:37,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2023
02:28:37,078 --> 02:28:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2024
02:29:01,193 --> 02:29:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Off topic here, I wanted to mention something since I was browsing through the PlayStation Store.

2025
02:29:05,516 --> 02:29:11,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it a bit ironic that the full game of Ridge Racer happens to be under the demo section.

2026
02:29:14,505 --> 02:29:15,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that a little funny?

2027
02:29:15,506 --> 02:29:16,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really?

2028
02:29:16,166 --> 02:29:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

2029
02:29:17,327 --> 02:29:18,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta pull that down right now.

2030
02:29:18,448 --> 02:29:18,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure?

2031
02:29:19,208 --> 02:29:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

2032
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:24,692
[SPEAKER_03]: The one you have to pay $25 for, but it's filed under demo.

2033
02:29:24,712 --> 02:29:25,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you meant it's free.

2034
02:29:25,653 --> 02:29:27,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, they screwed up again?

2035
02:29:27,194 --> 02:29:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

2036
02:29:28,394 --> 02:29:32,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning it's filed under demo because there's no content to it.

2037
02:29:34,519 --> 02:29:35,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's funny.

2038
02:29:36,403 --> 02:29:36,723
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2039
02:29:38,124 --> 02:29:38,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it for email?

2040
02:29:39,245 --> 02:29:39,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we done?

2041
02:29:39,606 --> 02:29:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2042
02:29:40,146 --> 02:29:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2043
02:29:40,687 --> 02:29:45,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us emails for a future week.

2044
02:29:45,651 --> 02:29:47,853
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, it's time to get renty.

2045
02:29:49,174 --> 02:29:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fuse of the Week.

2046
02:30:04,106 --> 02:30:05,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck Children's Week.

2047
02:30:06,576 --> 02:30:07,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck all the Zorphans.

2048
02:30:09,158 --> 02:30:09,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck their candy.

2049
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:11,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck their kites.

2050
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:13,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake.

2051
02:30:14,782 --> 02:30:15,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care anymore.

2052
02:30:16,903 --> 02:30:18,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the three holidays left.

2053
02:30:19,365 --> 02:30:19,805
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three.

2054
02:30:20,365 --> 02:30:22,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Children's Week has fucked it for me.

2055
02:30:23,327 --> 02:30:23,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Burn in hell.

2056
02:30:25,129 --> 02:30:25,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And your matron?

2057
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:26,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck her too.

2058
02:30:28,311 --> 02:30:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2059
02:30:29,704 --> 02:30:33,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Effie to my ceiling fan in my living room for breaking.

2060
02:30:33,748 --> 02:30:41,876
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife decided to turn the fan on high to dry the floors that she had recently mopped and the switch broke.

2061
02:30:42,317 --> 02:30:43,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So we couldn't shut it off.

2062
02:30:43,778 --> 02:30:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan to shut it off manually.

2063
02:30:49,224 --> 02:30:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But it gets hot in there now.

2064
02:30:55,711 --> 02:31:02,673
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland in a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go and my friend's graduating and I'll get to miss it.

2065
02:31:03,054 --> 02:31:05,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to Jamie because she'll be, you know.

2066
02:31:05,635 --> 02:31:07,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me.

2067
02:31:07,595 --> 02:31:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2068
02:31:08,516 --> 02:31:08,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

2069
02:31:08,936 --> 02:31:09,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

2070
02:31:10,376 --> 02:31:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to poop.

2071
02:31:14,758 --> 02:31:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it was a really good meal.

2072
02:31:16,559 --> 02:31:18,279
[SPEAKER_10]: She has been a little drippy lately.

2073
02:31:18,519 --> 02:31:19,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

2074
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:19,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.

2075
02:31:21,104 --> 02:31:21,884
[SPEAKER_02]: You're disgusting.

2076
02:31:21,984 --> 02:31:24,306
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys.

2077
02:31:24,326 --> 02:31:27,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to open up the Skype line just for a little bit tonight, guys.

2078
02:31:27,067 --> 02:31:30,649
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running a little late because of the interview earlier, but I think it was worth it, don't you?

2079
02:31:31,009 --> 02:31:32,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few more stories for you guys.

2080
02:31:32,229 --> 02:31:32,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2081
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:34,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, quickly, quickly.

2082
02:31:35,271 --> 02:31:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say this because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole Nintendo, and some folks brought up the iPhone.

2083
02:31:42,474 --> 02:31:43,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And I must say...

2084
02:31:44,304 --> 02:31:45,045
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2085
02:32:05,638 --> 02:32:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see something like that happening long before the Sony and Xbox thing.

2086
02:32:11,206 --> 02:32:14,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that was brought up in chat.

2087
02:32:15,012 --> 02:32:15,492
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

2088
02:32:16,213 --> 02:32:18,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku said iPhone enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that.

2089
02:32:19,778 --> 02:32:21,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories.

2090
02:32:21,401 --> 02:32:21,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2091
02:32:21,761 --> 02:32:25,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's talk about the dark side of Kickstarter.

2092
02:32:26,025 --> 02:32:35,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was this Kickstarter for a game titled Mythic the Story of Gods and Men, which is an RPG from this company called Little Monster Productions.

2093
02:32:35,975 --> 02:32:37,197
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, of course...

2094
02:32:37,757 --> 02:32:48,060
[SPEAKER_03]: This already sounds a little bit outlandish, but it said, to rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim, built together by a team of former Activision Blizzard developers.

2095
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:50,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And the project was asking for $80,000.

2096
02:32:50,381 --> 02:32:58,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It raised $5,000 up until a couple days ago.

2097
02:32:58,823 --> 02:33:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what happened was they actually canceled the funding altogether.

2098
02:33:03,264 --> 02:33:31,992
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's because apparently all their assets that they were showing on the site were stolen apparently all the artwork for the game that was supposedly being made was stolen off of different people's deviant art sites also some of the I guess pretty much all of the rewards were stolen from another Kickstarter page the Banner Saga

2099
02:33:33,412 --> 02:33:46,756
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course it made it to Reddit and people were warning them online and of course Little Monster Productions responded to the scam saying it seems we've been subjected to false claims of ownership rights to our concepts.

2100
02:33:47,116 --> 02:33:51,577
[SPEAKER_03]: The game itself is well in progress and it's not a scam of any kind.

2101
02:33:51,617 --> 02:33:52,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for understanding.

2102
02:33:52,677 --> 02:33:55,098
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any further questions feel free to ask.

2103
02:33:55,778 --> 02:34:03,682
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course since then the Kickstarter account's been deleted and they've kind of disappeared and vanished away.

2104
02:34:04,543 --> 02:34:05,243
[SPEAKER_03]: With all that money.

2105
02:34:05,584 --> 02:34:15,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well no, technically not because they have to hit their funding goal of $80,000 in order to keep that money so the $5,000 that was contributed or put down actually didn't go anywhere.

2106
02:34:15,829 --> 02:34:19,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It went back to the people that or actually never left the people that put it down.

2107
02:34:19,611 --> 02:34:21,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's a wake-up call.

2108
02:34:22,072 --> 02:34:24,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Kickstarter has really taken off.

2109
02:34:25,553 --> 02:34:27,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants a piece of it.

2110
02:34:27,154 --> 02:34:29,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, for some people, it's like an ATM machine right now.

2111
02:34:30,435 --> 02:34:31,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a tricky thing.

2112
02:34:31,395 --> 02:34:35,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still can't wrap my head around how I really feel about Kickstarter.

2113
02:34:35,256 --> 02:34:39,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's some things like, you know, what Random was talking about earlier.

2114
02:34:39,137 --> 02:34:40,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, cool.

2115
02:34:40,258 --> 02:34:42,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw a great piece on the internet this week.

2116
02:34:42,399 --> 02:34:43,559
[SPEAKER_02]: An awesome piece about...

2117
02:34:45,139 --> 02:34:46,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda Palmer's Kickstarter.

2118
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:53,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And why... And basically the gist of the article is this is why Amanda Palmer gets to do a Kickstarter and you don't.

2119
02:34:53,162 --> 02:34:55,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was kind of a really neat article.

2120
02:34:56,423 --> 02:34:58,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.

2121
02:34:59,325 --> 02:34:59,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I just...

2122
02:35:00,945 --> 02:35:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to get into the Kickstarter thing, that's cool, but play smart.

2123
02:35:05,806 --> 02:35:08,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And this story is a great example of why.

2124
02:35:08,127 --> 02:35:11,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it really seems like there's some people out there who are just donating to everything and anything.

2125
02:35:11,267 --> 02:35:12,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, hey, it's your money.

2126
02:35:12,848 --> 02:35:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend it on what you want.

2127
02:35:13,728 --> 02:35:14,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2128
02:35:14,208 --> 02:35:15,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be dangerous, and this is why.

2129
02:35:16,048 --> 02:35:16,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Educate yourself.

2130
02:35:17,689 --> 02:35:22,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you're aware of who you're donating to.

2131
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:24,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I also really think...

2132
02:35:25,190 --> 02:35:27,391
[SPEAKER_02]: This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter.

2133
02:35:27,971 --> 02:35:39,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Kickstarter needs to allow the person, and maybe they do, and to be fair, maybe they already do this and I just never see people do it, and maybe people should be encouraged to do it more, to set a limit.

2134
02:35:40,275 --> 02:35:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: on how much money is going to be raised.

2135
02:35:42,276 --> 02:35:56,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I see certain Kickstarters that ask for $30,000 and I can't even put my head around what you do with $30,000 and get $120,000, it's like... Well, they keep changing.

2136
02:35:56,962 --> 02:36:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: They're allowed to, I guess, change their goals, I guess, on there.

2137
02:36:01,444 --> 02:36:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But where... I don't know.

2138
02:36:05,406 --> 02:36:08,067
[SPEAKER_02]: As a consumer, I want to know where every dollar is going.

2139
02:36:09,405 --> 02:36:10,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an investor.

2140
02:36:11,166 --> 02:36:18,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you invest in a company, there's these things called investor and shareholder meetings where you talk about the company and the progress and where the money is going.

2141
02:36:18,888 --> 02:36:26,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, all that you are guaranteed out of that is basically what slot you fit into as far as the rewards go.

2142
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:27,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you're guaranteed.

2143
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:29,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my problem with Kickstarter.

2144
02:36:31,383 --> 02:36:34,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then don't donate the stuff that you're unaware of.

2145
02:36:34,645 --> 02:36:39,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will admit, you know, there are some Kickstarters I take interest in, like the Star Control thing we talked about last week.

2146
02:36:39,848 --> 02:36:41,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I kind of want that cartridge.

2147
02:36:42,069 --> 02:36:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounded pretty fucking awesome.

2148
02:36:43,550 --> 02:36:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I hear about people like, you know, Random, and certainly the Pink Elephant in the Room.

2149
02:36:49,413 --> 02:36:55,756
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other Kickstarters that, you know, obviously we're well aware of, you know, and I wish success for them.

2150
02:36:55,937 --> 02:36:58,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just...

2151
02:37:00,063 --> 02:37:01,445
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just something about it.

2152
02:37:01,505 --> 02:37:05,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just feel like the other shoe is going to drop on Kickstarter any day now.

2153
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:06,391
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble's going to burst.

2154
02:37:07,352 --> 02:37:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I want to be there when it does.

2155
02:37:09,795 --> 02:37:11,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer.

2156
02:37:12,882 --> 02:37:15,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, well, I mean, not everything gets we still love you, Rob.

2157
02:37:15,945 --> 02:37:18,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything gets, you know, funded.

2158
02:37:18,067 --> 02:37:26,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was the Kickstarter for it was a sequel to God, I remember now what it's called is a PSP game.

2159
02:37:26,676 --> 02:37:29,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't very popular, but they were trying to get a sequel for it.

2160
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:31,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fell through.

2161
02:37:32,241 --> 02:37:35,824
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is some interesting things on there, and this is another one of those.

2162
02:37:36,445 --> 02:37:41,489
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a MMO on there, if you can even call it.

2163
02:37:41,749 --> 02:37:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Class Realm.

2164
02:37:43,050 --> 02:37:50,056
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being developed by some people, I want to say they're in the education system.

2165
02:37:50,536 --> 02:37:58,279
[SPEAKER_03]: to basically motivate their students to read more and participate in discussions more and study more as well as learn.

2166
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:01,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called Class Realm.

2167
02:38:03,021 --> 02:38:04,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of interesting.

2168
02:38:04,162 --> 02:38:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, my kids are the best promoters.

2169
02:38:07,523 --> 02:38:10,144
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, they're going around telling other students how great it is.

2170
02:38:10,224 --> 02:38:13,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my classroom, the other kids come in from other classes for math and science.

2171
02:38:14,426 --> 02:38:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: and they see the classroom stuff on my wall and they want to do it.

2172
02:38:18,009 --> 02:38:21,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And other teachers also have been hugely supportive.

2173
02:38:21,211 --> 02:38:26,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what he's trying to do is he's creating this classroom thing that's both free and paid as well.

2174
02:38:26,375 --> 02:38:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the free sharing the tools with the other teachers and then the paid one you get additional things.

2175
02:38:33,479 --> 02:38:34,940
[SPEAKER_10]: We covered this a few weeks ago.

2176
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:36,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

2177
02:38:37,141 --> 02:38:41,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually launched now and he's taking donations.

2178
02:38:41,663 --> 02:38:43,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pledge towards it.

2179
02:38:43,584 --> 02:38:46,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of neat.

2180
02:38:47,546 --> 02:38:47,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2181
02:38:48,427 --> 02:38:49,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on to another story here.

2182
02:38:50,248 --> 02:38:56,631
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about Harmonix earlier in the show, and I want to talk about them again because everybody's kind of wondering, what are they going to do next?

2183
02:38:56,851 --> 02:39:03,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they have the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network thing that's coming, but you know that can't be the only thing they've been working on for the past few years.

2184
02:39:04,634 --> 02:39:07,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Some rumors are leaking out about what we might see very soon.

2185
02:39:07,796 --> 02:39:17,583
[SPEAKER_02]: According to some different job listings that were spotted, Harmonix is looking for a narrative content and level designers and one software engineer.

2186
02:39:17,603 --> 02:39:23,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing a project that's called, quote, a unique motion gaming IP.

2187
02:39:25,049 --> 02:39:32,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix seeks an accomplished narrative designer to incorporate creative storylines into gameplay on a unique motion gaming IP.

2188
02:39:34,431 --> 02:39:35,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be Dance Central 3?

2189
02:39:35,932 --> 02:39:37,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this something brand, brand new?

2190
02:39:37,293 --> 02:39:42,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Dance Central 2 kind of tried to do the story thing, but it was a little silly.

2191
02:39:42,237 --> 02:39:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't expect much out of a music game.

2192
02:39:44,459 --> 02:39:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Could Harmonix be doing something?

2193
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe it's Dance Central 3.

2194
02:39:47,541 --> 02:39:50,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's something totally different.

2195
02:39:50,163 --> 02:39:50,604
[SPEAKER_09]: You said unique.

2196
02:39:51,827 --> 02:40:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: they did say unique so I like Harmonix Harmonix does a pretty darn good job even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy but it was really an interesting little tool I'm really curious to see what they bring with this I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it but we'll see

2197
02:40:15,233 --> 02:40:17,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about some other news?

2198
02:40:31,321 --> 02:40:33,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically, it's called the Toilet.

2199
02:40:33,723 --> 02:40:33,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Toilet.

2200
02:41:00,683 --> 02:41:11,205
[SPEAKER_10]: and it gives men incentive to pee in the urinal and to play the mini games instead of on the floor and it makes cleaner restrooms.

2201
02:41:14,116 --> 02:41:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in a day and age where you have to give incentive for grown men.

2202
02:41:20,782 --> 02:41:23,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't go pee-pee on the floor.

2203
02:41:24,205 --> 02:41:26,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've had good feedback from customers.

2204
02:41:26,568 --> 02:41:28,509
[SPEAKER_10]: It says toilet cleanliness has improved.

2205
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:30,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Now get the price on this one, Rob.

2206
02:41:31,632 --> 02:41:32,934
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 130 units out there at 150,000 yen a pop.

2207
02:41:32,974 --> 02:41:33,554
[SPEAKER_10]: That's almost $2,000.

2208
02:41:37,717 --> 02:41:42,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just to be clear, we have heard about this system before because there was the whole, like, toilet jokes.

2209
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I've watched an informative video on this before.

2210
02:41:45,761 --> 02:41:51,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But what Jamie's talking about is that now Sega's putting it out there where it's really accessible where anybody can get this.

2211
02:41:51,404 --> 02:41:55,686
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get this for your personal bathroom if you're, like, into water sports or something weird.

2212
02:41:55,706 --> 02:42:03,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to clarify, and there's been a trickle of information about this, the hardware itself is $140,000, which is about $1,700.

2213
02:42:03,851 --> 02:42:04,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2214
02:42:08,092 --> 02:42:11,933
[SPEAKER_10]: The minigames are 10,000 yen a piece, which is $125.

2215
02:42:12,653 --> 02:42:20,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can get a 10 yen coin box that's 25,000 so that you can pay to pee, I guess.

2216
02:42:22,375 --> 02:42:24,195
[SPEAKER_10]: 312 bucks, pretty much, for the box.

2217
02:42:24,996 --> 02:42:26,416
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a terrible idea.

2218
02:42:26,456 --> 02:42:27,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay to pee.

2219
02:42:27,696 --> 02:42:30,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have home options.

2220
02:42:30,077 --> 02:42:32,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be on Spirit Airlines next week.

2221
02:42:33,240 --> 02:42:41,566
[SPEAKER_10]: and now they have home version options where you can pay $2,000 to pay to pee in your own house.

2222
02:42:41,806 --> 02:42:48,731
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can... Well, Giovedea, who is a lady, is in our chat room at vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households badly.

2223
02:42:49,031 --> 02:42:51,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and in college restrooms.

2224
02:42:51,593 --> 02:42:55,076
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, honestly, what do ladies have?

2225
02:42:55,397 --> 02:42:55,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We can pee.

2226
02:42:57,218 --> 02:43:03,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not directionally pee like men because, you know, it's really hard to aim when, you know, it's close to the hoo-ha.

2227
02:43:03,403 --> 02:43:04,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But why take the fun out of trying?

2228
02:43:05,065 --> 02:43:06,846
[SPEAKER_10]: We should have, like, poop pressure games.

2229
02:43:09,068 --> 02:43:09,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew!

2230
02:43:11,771 --> 02:43:11,971
Ew!

2231
02:43:12,591 --> 02:43:14,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, ew about the pee, too.

2232
02:43:15,374 --> 02:43:16,575
[SPEAKER_10]: At least pee is sterile.

2233
02:43:20,265 --> 02:43:37,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't want to talk about this story anymore but I really need to You're the one who gave it to me The show where every gamer has a voice Blackwolf in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says Sign in the men's bathroom of the LAN center I did Friday Night Gaming at You claim to have good aim Now's your chance to prove it

2234
02:43:38,917 --> 02:43:51,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, when I was at the University of South Alabama in the humanities building on the second floor in the ladies bathroom, there was a little poem written on the wall in the stall that I would usually use.

2235
02:43:51,782 --> 02:43:54,643
[SPEAKER_10]: If you must pee upon the seat, wipe it off and keep it neat.

2236
02:43:57,484 --> 02:44:00,826
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also, now get this, a toilet seat cover that I saw.

2237
02:44:01,526 --> 02:44:03,387
[SPEAKER_10]: On the top it says, we aim to please.

2238
02:44:04,127 --> 02:44:06,008
[SPEAKER_10]: You lift it up, you aim too, please.

2239
02:44:07,324 --> 02:44:09,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms.

2240
02:44:09,465 --> 02:44:10,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to talk about this for a minute.

2241
02:44:10,606 --> 02:44:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we don't pee all over everything.

2242
02:44:13,328 --> 02:44:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a gas station driving to LA and I was at the gas station at 3.30 in the morning because, you know, nature called and I had to go.

2243
02:44:20,492 --> 02:44:21,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But the men's restroom was closed.

2244
02:44:22,374 --> 02:44:24,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was not a soul in this place.

2245
02:44:24,335 --> 02:44:28,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said to my friend, I said, Victoria, I want you to stand outside this door and if a woman comes, don't let them in.

2246
02:44:29,939 --> 02:44:35,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went in the woman's restroom and, you know, I opened the door and I'm like, suddenly I'm like, there's like flowers and shit in here.

2247
02:44:35,982 --> 02:44:36,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2248
02:44:37,043 --> 02:44:37,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2249
02:44:58,038 --> 02:44:59,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Check who owns the gas station.

2250
02:45:00,119 --> 02:45:06,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been in some pretty shithole gas station bathrooms for women, so do not even go there.

2251
02:45:06,764 --> 02:45:15,390
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chevron on the way back from Pensacola that's right when you get back into Mobile off the causeway, never go there.

2252
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:15,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awful.

2253
02:45:17,892 --> 02:45:18,212
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2254
02:45:18,572 --> 02:45:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move on to some other stories quite quickly, but I do want to point out, because everybody in chat was like, how many listeners did you lose during that segment?

2255
02:45:27,048 --> 02:45:29,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We gained one, suckas!

2256
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You got told!

2257
02:45:31,090 --> 02:45:32,491
[SPEAKER_02]: When in doubt, potty jokes!

2258
02:45:33,151 --> 02:45:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

2259
02:45:34,892 --> 02:45:37,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We should talk more about that stuff.

2260
02:45:37,573 --> 02:45:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

2261
02:45:37,854 --> 02:45:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Microsoft.

2262
02:45:39,334 --> 02:45:42,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming soon to the VOG Network, Poop Poop Pee Pee Show!

2263
02:45:44,397 --> 02:45:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2264
02:45:46,318 --> 02:45:54,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft has patented some sort of arm band that has EMG sensors as well as other electrodes in there.

2265
02:45:55,162 --> 02:45:57,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what it does is it monitors your muscle movements.

2266
02:45:58,423 --> 02:46:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, they would have it programmed to where if you made a fist or something like that, that your character would make a fist.

2267
02:46:05,726 --> 02:46:09,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like an extension to the motion tracking and stuff.

2268
02:46:10,488 --> 02:46:15,411
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess it could be applied to other parts of your body like your leg or something like that.

2269
02:46:15,471 --> 02:46:23,875
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is kind of interesting that they're potentially going to have some sort of device that allows you to track yourself a little bit better.

2270
02:46:26,637 --> 02:46:27,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty soon.

2271
02:46:27,797 --> 02:46:30,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just worried about how far those things are going to evolve.

2272
02:46:30,459 --> 02:46:30,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2273
02:46:31,736 --> 02:46:38,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a device that you wrap around an appendage, so the TTP for that, how soon?

2274
02:46:41,732 --> 02:46:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what that is, just move right along.

2275
02:46:45,534 --> 02:47:04,343
[SPEAKER_02]: A moment of silence, please, because when I heard this news this week, I almost wanted to call the hotline and send some help over to one of our authors at OrangeLawnTrader.com's house to make sure he was okay.

2276
02:47:04,363 --> 02:47:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2277
02:47:06,964 --> 02:47:11,746
[SPEAKER_02]: La Mulana in North America and Europe has been cancelled on WiiWare.

2278
02:47:12,147 --> 02:47:16,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark Tetsuya, bless his heart, was really excited about that game.

2279
02:47:16,809 --> 02:47:19,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really excited about that game.

2280
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:25,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in development, and in development, and in development, and finally they just said...

2281
02:47:26,173 --> 02:47:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it, we're not releasing it on the Wii.

2282
02:47:28,775 --> 02:47:36,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is some good news, it is coming out on the PC, so maybe it'll be on Steam or something like that, but it was cancelled.

2283
02:47:36,781 --> 02:47:38,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was already on PC.

2284
02:47:40,123 --> 02:47:45,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is like a plus version or like an enhanced version of the game that's coming out.

2285
02:47:45,567 --> 02:47:51,652
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were waiting on it for two years, and basically at the end of the day they just came out and said, WiiWare ain't profitable anymore.

2286
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:53,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what everyone's been saying.

2287
02:47:53,571 --> 02:47:55,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something they need to fix.

2288
02:47:55,172 --> 02:48:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that is Nintendo's shitty guidelines where it's like you have to sell so many units before you even get like a check.

2289
02:48:01,637 --> 02:48:06,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that up and you won't have anybody but yourselves publishing on that service.

2290
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:11,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just a moment.

2291
02:48:12,455 --> 02:48:13,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, La Mulana.

2292
02:48:14,797 --> 02:48:15,278
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii.

2293
02:48:15,478 --> 02:48:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least it'll be coming out on the play.

2294
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:18,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It did look like a cute game.

2295
02:48:18,441 --> 02:48:19,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interested in it.

2296
02:48:19,522 --> 02:48:21,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they put that on, like, you know, Xbox Indie games?

2297
02:48:21,945 --> 02:48:23,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great effing question.

2298
02:48:24,087 --> 02:48:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.

2299
02:48:25,949 --> 02:48:27,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it.

2300
02:48:27,811 --> 02:48:29,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like they don't like to talk much.

2301
02:48:31,819 --> 02:48:50,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show why Nintendo fails at digital distribution SJ100 Matt says but then again it was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people are not placing the blame on the makers of La Mulana but they are placing the blame squarely at Nintendo's feet which I can't say I disagree with Shall we open up the Skype line?

2302
02:48:50,994 --> 02:48:51,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall.

2303
02:48:51,554 --> 02:48:58,420
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call Ranma just announced that he's a classy whore

2304
02:48:59,383 --> 02:49:02,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that on our program.

2305
02:49:03,125 --> 02:49:12,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or again our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give our show a call and talk about any news stories we may have missed or your opinion on what have you.

2306
02:49:13,812 --> 02:49:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, Random is long gone now.

2307
02:49:16,013 --> 02:49:17,254
[SPEAKER_02]: He's off to work on something else.

2308
02:49:17,314 --> 02:49:20,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't let you ask him a question but we can talk about what he talked about.

2309
02:49:21,236 --> 02:49:24,058
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, do we have any last-minute stories here in studio?

2310
02:49:24,078 --> 02:49:29,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fire up the Twitter and see if anyone sent us anything to talk about on twitter.com slash OLR.

2311
02:49:31,162 --> 02:49:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But first... Oh, never mind.

2312
02:49:35,485 --> 02:49:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: A call's coming in.

2313
02:49:36,326 --> 02:49:36,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

2314
02:49:36,766 --> 02:49:37,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Saved from last-minute stories.

2315
02:49:37,967 --> 02:49:38,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2316
02:49:38,907 --> 02:49:39,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2317
02:49:39,908 --> 02:49:41,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that classy whore Ranma.

2318
02:49:44,003 --> 02:49:46,865
[SPEAKER_02]: and I. Hey ho, what's up?

2319
02:49:49,186 --> 02:49:50,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Not too much.

2320
02:49:50,166 --> 02:49:55,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have a couple things I want to cover before I get out of here and start off my hellish work week.

2321
02:49:55,868 --> 02:49:56,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2322
02:49:57,229 --> 02:50:04,192
[SPEAKER_14]: First things first, as per orders of the great and mighty powerful Rob, I went to Chinatown Fair.

2323
02:50:06,313 --> 02:50:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm curious to hear what you thought about Chinatown Fair because what I read on Twitter was interesting.

2324
02:50:11,508 --> 02:50:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

2325
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:14,830
[SPEAKER_02]: That sums it up right there.

2326
02:50:18,333 --> 02:50:21,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't expecting this.

2327
02:50:22,015 --> 02:50:22,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wasn't.

2328
02:50:23,196 --> 02:50:30,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm posting a link to the complete total of eight photos I took there because all I needed was eight photos.

2329
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:33,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm scared.

2330
02:50:34,499 --> 02:50:38,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even trying to be a Dave & Buster's wannabe.

2331
02:50:38,760 --> 02:50:46,541
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the kid brother little bastard of Dave & Buster's that nobody talks to.

2332
02:50:48,042 --> 02:50:48,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Chuck E. Cheese?

2333
02:50:49,902 --> 02:50:50,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even!

2334
02:50:51,622 --> 02:50:52,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even.

2335
02:50:52,623 --> 02:50:56,923
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some skee-ball and the spinny wheel for tickets and a basketball thing.

2336
02:50:56,943 --> 02:50:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Terminator Salvation's cool.

2337
02:50:59,084 --> 02:51:00,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Arcade some people like.

2338
02:51:02,395 --> 02:51:16,817
[SPEAKER_14]: and if you notice over in the corner I only got one, it's a picture but right next to that one big screen TV there's another big screen TV that's not even on and they don't even have HDMI cables hooked up for the console

2339
02:51:18,888 --> 02:51:20,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they got a Plinko game.

2340
02:51:20,109 --> 02:51:22,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they made those for the prices, right?

2341
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, you and Plinko.

2342
02:51:23,271 --> 02:51:25,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all... I mean, it looks like a lot of... The ditter.

2343
02:51:26,012 --> 02:51:29,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember got replaced with ticket spitters.

2344
02:51:29,755 --> 02:51:31,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to every other arcade in America.

2345
02:51:31,656 --> 02:51:33,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sad, but that's what's happened.

2346
02:51:34,678 --> 02:51:38,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but I wasn't expecting something like this, though.

2347
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:38,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

2348
02:51:41,355 --> 02:51:48,320
[SPEAKER_14]: When I spoke to one of the guys who told me about this, he flat out said the new owner has no clue as to what he's doing.

2349
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:52,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's trying to convince the owner to get in some actual good games.

2350
02:51:54,284 --> 02:51:56,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well that, you know, and it is a new arcade.

2351
02:51:57,085 --> 02:52:00,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's give, I mean, yes, it's an old arcade, but it's new owners or whatever.

2352
02:52:01,288 --> 02:52:02,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give them a chance.

2353
02:52:03,424 --> 02:52:12,188
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what everybody was saying, because at first we're all outside, sitting on the stoop, bad-mouthing and cursing up a storm about this.

2354
02:52:12,868 --> 02:52:16,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're like, you know, we'll give them about 30 days.

2355
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:17,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to see.

2356
02:52:17,570 --> 02:52:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go back in a month and see what changes, if anything.

2357
02:52:20,831 --> 02:52:23,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And if nothing changes, well then, shit, they didn't learn anything.

2358
02:52:24,893 --> 02:52:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, give it a chance.

2359
02:52:27,874 --> 02:52:29,915
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying, and we're walking around like...

2360
02:52:30,799 --> 02:52:35,541
[SPEAKER_14]: The first thing we started raising with the fact that it is a pump-it-up machine because nobody plays pump-it-up.

2361
02:52:36,341 --> 02:52:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, in the picture, that's the only machine I see a crowd around.

2362
02:52:40,303 --> 02:52:41,143
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sad part.

2363
02:52:41,763 --> 02:52:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets.

2364
02:52:45,165 --> 02:52:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a Terminator Salvation machine I saw there too, and a couple others.

2365
02:52:49,270 --> 02:52:51,131
[SPEAKER_14]: and Superbikes2.

2366
02:52:51,191 --> 02:52:54,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what Chinatown Fair looks like right now?

2367
02:52:54,574 --> 02:52:55,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Roseville Golf Land.

2368
02:52:56,435 --> 02:52:57,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to my world.

2369
02:52:57,996 --> 02:53:01,018
[SPEAKER_14]: The funny thing is that's the first thing that came to mind.

2370
02:53:01,098 --> 02:53:04,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, maybe, I think this is it.

2371
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we were on the same wavelength at that time for that five seconds, Rob.

2372
02:53:08,343 --> 02:53:11,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that the East Coast now has a place where video games go to die.

2373
02:53:12,045 --> 02:53:12,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

2374
02:53:15,345 --> 02:53:18,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we'll take that with a badge of honor.

2375
02:53:18,246 --> 02:53:18,607
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2376
02:53:19,007 --> 02:53:20,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

2377
02:53:24,769 --> 02:53:27,391
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm just still in disgust from Chinatown Fair.

2378
02:53:28,671 --> 02:53:30,152
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to pretend I never saw that.

2379
02:53:30,312 --> 02:53:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, go take a shower.

2380
02:53:31,613 --> 02:53:31,873
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2381
02:53:32,953 --> 02:53:35,134
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not enough bleach in the world, damn it.

2382
02:53:35,734 --> 02:53:38,756
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bye, Ranma.

2383
02:53:38,896 --> 02:53:39,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2384
02:53:39,356 --> 02:53:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2385
02:53:44,235 --> 02:53:48,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Ranma, he passed along a little giveaway we're going to have in just a little bit here on the show.

2386
02:53:49,179 --> 02:53:51,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting until the very end because that's how I roll.

2387
02:53:53,602 --> 02:53:54,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2388
02:53:54,283 --> 02:53:57,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to some of our tweets that we have tonight.

2389
02:53:58,066 --> 02:54:00,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigerclaw, of course, sent us a few tweets here.

2390
02:54:01,188 --> 02:54:07,233
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is about Miyamoto's DS patent that will offer upgraded tourist hunting techniques.

2391
02:54:08,054 --> 02:54:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of interesting.

2392
02:54:09,415 --> 02:54:10,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't heard about this.

2393
02:54:11,156 --> 02:54:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently...

2394
02:54:13,337 --> 02:54:23,779
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is a real deal, there could be some type of advancement in GPS technology in tourist-heavy areas like museums and haunted house type places, and I'm imagining things like Disneyland.

2395
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:35,042
[SPEAKER_02]: This patent would have a system where an overhead grid of infrared positional information transmitters reads a user's DS to light up floor patterns and potential walkways.

2396
02:54:35,442 --> 02:54:39,783
[SPEAKER_02]: The user can pick which route they'd like to take, reading tourist facts along the way.

2397
02:54:40,123 --> 02:54:40,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2398
02:55:02,068 --> 02:55:09,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, there's iPhone apps and stuff that do all that, but this is a different way of implementing that technology that you know would be pretty stable.

2399
02:55:10,037 --> 02:55:12,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sounds very interesting to me.

2400
02:55:13,722 --> 02:55:15,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones and take another call.

2401
02:55:15,083 --> 02:55:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.

2402
02:55:16,565 --> 02:55:17,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's this?

2403
02:55:17,085 --> 02:55:18,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Zaku, what's up, buddy?

2404
02:55:19,208 --> 02:55:23,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just trying to reiterate what Ranma has said about CF.

2405
02:55:23,973 --> 02:55:29,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it from my sources a couple of days before it opened that it was going to be radically different.

2406
02:55:30,058 --> 02:55:34,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't going to be anything near what the old CF was.

2407
02:55:36,173 --> 02:55:52,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, in a way, I've got to give them the benefit of the doubt that, sure, they may have a rocky and uneven open just for the fact that it's out of place for what people would normally refer to as CF.

2408
02:55:53,752 --> 02:56:11,822
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, if the owner doesn't make a change quickly, then he's going to lose these folks for quite a while because they're going to go to Brooklyn to Next Level Arcade where the remnants of CF who used to run the place are pretty much alive and thriving there, especially the fighting game community.

2409
02:56:12,743 --> 02:56:16,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me play devil's advocate for a minute here because this is a question I should have asked on the last call.

2410
02:56:17,390 --> 02:56:21,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they might lose the fans that used to go, but is it possible that they'll gain fans?

2411
02:56:21,911 --> 02:56:23,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, arcades do this for a reason, right?

2412
02:56:24,151 --> 02:56:31,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it might be a demographic that doesn't bode well for that area.

2413
02:56:31,713 --> 02:56:39,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the way I describe a CFer is someone who's basically male, about 20-ish, into video games, very competitive.

2414
02:56:40,434 --> 02:56:43,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So that type of demographic pretty much held that place together for...

2415
02:56:44,795 --> 02:56:47,430
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last years of its old existence.

2416
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:54,261
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was mostly fighting games and to an extent our community, the DDR community.

2417
02:56:55,341 --> 02:57:15,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have something that barely resembles that and something where the old guard of CF are pretty much at their own place right now that caters to that demographic, it's not going to do any justice right away if that old location has nothing more than just a mini DMV.

2418
02:57:19,301 --> 02:57:21,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty much what I'm getting at.

2419
02:57:22,662 --> 02:57:26,524
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so much space that they crammed with arcade machines left and right.

2420
02:57:27,024 --> 02:57:31,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, just about every place, wall to wall, just literally, just covered in arcades.

2421
02:57:31,626 --> 02:57:37,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're just like, there's not that many at the moment, but as I said, I give them the benefit of the doubt because they just opened up.

2422
02:57:37,808 --> 02:57:42,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unless this new owner doesn't like, doesn't take in, you know, doesn't like...

2423
02:57:43,630 --> 02:57:51,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless this owner actually does something in terms of writing this course and trying to draw more people in there in order to stay alive.

2424
02:57:51,518 --> 02:57:52,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask this question, though.

2425
02:57:52,980 --> 02:57:54,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it maybe already a lost cause?

2426
02:57:54,962 --> 02:57:56,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.

2427
02:57:56,464 --> 02:57:58,746
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money?

2428
02:57:59,466 --> 02:58:25,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of another place like out in Queens in the city Peter Pan Games which is almost similar but it's more lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere it's like the only best you know in other words New York's only 2DX machine is out there as well as like an unlocked X2 but it has redemption games but the thing is that these redemption aren't just like some Mickey Mouse prizes they're like real big ticket items like iPads

2429
02:58:25,976 --> 02:58:38,797
[SPEAKER_00]: and the coupled with the fact that it's on a strip mall with which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood so it's partly it's almost like what CF is but it's like what CF is right now is an infancy of what Peter Pan games is already at

2430
02:58:40,393 --> 02:58:49,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at a point where unless they start drawing in something that will keep whales like myself, they'll draw them in there.

2431
02:58:49,317 --> 02:58:54,299
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you'll have a clientele that will constantly spend money there and will keep your place alive.

2432
02:58:54,839 --> 02:58:55,900
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just doomed to failure.

2433
02:58:56,580 --> 02:59:02,822
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need that type of customer or else they're just going to succumb to whatever tourists they get, if any.

2434
02:59:04,283 --> 02:59:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2435
02:59:05,123 --> 02:59:07,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Zaku, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2436
02:59:07,204 --> 02:59:08,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2437
02:59:09,861 --> 02:59:28,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than cheating in MLB 2K12, I'm not a baseball fan, but the fact that people could actually exploit a game just to make money and 2K basically denying that the exploit was illegal, even though they originally said it was.

2438
02:59:29,508 --> 02:59:31,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they just have egg in their face right now.

2439
02:59:31,751 --> 02:59:33,893
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like tainted that whole competition.

2440
02:59:33,934 --> 02:59:37,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have a shitty finale and they only have themselves to blame.

2441
02:59:38,579 --> 02:59:39,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2442
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:48,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically fell on their own sword for basically denying that said cheat was illegal even though it's technically allowed.

2443
02:59:49,022 --> 02:59:50,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, I gotta let you go, buddy.

2444
02:59:50,323 --> 02:59:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2445
02:59:50,743 --> 02:59:51,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2446
02:59:51,303 --> 02:59:52,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.

2447
03:00:16,512 --> 03:00:21,913
[SPEAKER_02]: for an Xbox 360 Avatar Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4 hoodie.

2448
03:00:21,973 --> 03:00:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want your Avatar on Xbox to be wearing a hoodie, we're going to give one of these away.

2449
03:00:26,994 --> 03:00:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And the good news is you can actually use this with male or female.

2450
03:00:30,034 --> 03:00:31,555
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a male code and a female code.

2451
03:00:31,575 --> 03:00:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically you get two codes.

2452
03:00:33,215 --> 03:00:37,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give it to one person, so maybe one for you and one for your SO or what have you.

2453
03:00:37,996 --> 03:00:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is send me a private message in our chat room at vognetwork.com right now with one reason...

2454
03:00:45,532 --> 03:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: you love VOG one reason you love VOG make it up, I don't care tell me one reason you love VOG it can be as silly or as serious as you want send Sky, just double click on my name and send me one reason you love VOG and we're gonna pick a random person to receive a Sonic 4 hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks Network tonight so there you go, and Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought to you by Anime Jam Session yes, fair enough, fair enough check out Anime Jam Session

2455
03:01:15,310 --> 03:01:16,373
[SPEAKER_02]: at AnimeJamSession.com.

2456
03:01:17,054 --> 03:01:19,119
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, send those private messages into Sky right now.

2457
03:01:19,641 --> 03:01:23,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I collect those messages, you have about three minutes to do that.

2458
03:01:24,412 --> 03:01:24,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2459
03:01:26,661 --> 03:01:48,071
[SPEAKER_03]: uh so yeah I have uh I guess the last minute story uh Taito put out a game for Akira about 25 years ago on the Famicom and it's finally been fan translated so you can check that there's a patch available for that um yeah so it's out there just google it um

2460
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just going to talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing.

2461
03:01:53,866 --> 03:01:54,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of sucks.

2462
03:01:54,767 --> 03:02:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the exploit they used is they adjusted the lineup of batters on the opposing team and removed the best players.

2463
03:02:03,460 --> 03:02:05,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it made it a little bit easier to...

2464
03:02:05,683 --> 03:02:06,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Pitch a Perfect Game

2465
03:02:35,864 --> 03:02:36,345
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

2466
03:02:36,866 --> 03:02:41,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, well, we stand by the people that we chose as the top eight.

2467
03:02:43,584 --> 03:03:12,226
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're just kind of rolling with it and I mean if you think about it they fucked up and they didn't program this exclusive mode for this the perfect pitch mode or whatever perfect game challenge they fucked it up and unfortunately I guess they'll just next year patch that out but it is unfortunate that they don't just start the whole thing over again but that's the way that is alright

2468
03:03:13,263 --> 03:03:14,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else in the last minute stories?

2469
03:03:14,684 --> 03:03:16,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm not totally paying attention.

2470
03:03:16,166 --> 03:03:17,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to collect the VOG stuff.

2471
03:03:17,607 --> 03:03:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.

2472
03:03:18,568 --> 03:03:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to close it up, the contest.

2473
03:03:21,070 --> 03:03:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2474
03:03:21,490 --> 03:03:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read you.

2475
03:03:22,491 --> 03:03:24,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read DarkSakura and Loki these answers here.

2476
03:03:24,733 --> 03:03:25,634
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me which one's your favorite.

2477
03:03:25,654 --> 03:03:26,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you who said it.

2478
03:03:27,215 --> 03:03:28,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is, and we'll pick a winner from this.

2479
03:03:28,776 --> 03:03:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So reasons you love VOG.

2480
03:03:29,937 --> 03:03:30,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2481
03:03:31,359 --> 03:03:35,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I love VOG because it supports and promotes the indie side of gaming, music, and geekdom.

2482
03:03:36,923 --> 03:03:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Because listening to VOG at work makes my day enjoyable.

2483
03:03:39,986 --> 03:03:42,207
[SPEAKER_02]: because we can chant VOG at wrestling events.

2484
03:03:42,487 --> 03:03:43,987
[SPEAKER_02]: V-O-G, V-O-G.

2485
03:03:45,107 --> 03:03:49,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I love VOG because it's got a host who asked Jiggly Kayente a question on the reunion of Drag Race.

2486
03:03:50,789 --> 03:03:57,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I love VOG because I want that stupid Sonic hoodie for name redacted because he would be so excited and that would keep him quiet for the whole night.

2487
03:03:58,671 --> 03:04:00,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I love VOG because every gamer has a voice.

2488
03:04:01,491 --> 03:04:03,032
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is a great reason I love VOG.

2489
03:04:04,218 --> 03:04:05,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Reason I love VOG.

2490
03:04:05,359 --> 03:04:06,139
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is on it.

2491
03:04:06,259 --> 03:04:06,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

2492
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:10,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I love VOG because I can make the initials mean dumb stuff.

2493
03:04:11,261 --> 03:04:17,604
[SPEAKER_02]: VOG is the only live podcast network I listen to often and look forward to the Bobby Blackwell Show and Orange Lounge Radio every week.

2494
03:04:20,025 --> 03:04:20,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tough one.

2495
03:04:21,586 --> 03:04:22,326
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

2496
03:04:22,666 --> 03:04:23,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the very first one?

2497
03:04:24,887 --> 03:04:28,409
