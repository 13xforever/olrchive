00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, May 13th, 2012, the biggest software companies give financial updates,

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
the price drops on older DS models, and could internet browsing finally be coming to the Xbox?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 457 of our show for this May the 13th of 2012.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Say hello first off to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi world.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
How are you doing?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm alright.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You sound a little better than last week, but not much.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
No, it's still the allergies. I'm feeling a lot better.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
We're sickly lounge radio tonight because actually, I don't know if you can really hear it, but I'm getting over what was a really bad, like, throaty cold.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Don't get me sick before I go to Disneyland.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, I'm hoping I'm way past that point because I was sick like Thursday, and if Alan didn't get sick, I don't think you guys are getting sick.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I have a sore throat.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Do you really?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'll make you pay me in coffee.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, then maybe you did get sick from me a week ago somehow.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, then I don't know if I was sick or if it was allergies. I felt just fine.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Something's going around, I don't know, but yeah, I had a really bad sore throat.

01:41.000 --> 01:51.000
It was bad because I was trying to, well, usually on Warcraft on Thursdays and Fridays, I lead the raid, which basically means, you know, well, I mean, like, I just, I make it sound bigger than it is.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
I basically am sitting there calling, you know, hold DPS, alright, attack the tentacle in the upper left, you know, or whatever it is.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But this week, I couldn't do it.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I was like, Shane, you're going to need to do it because it happened this week because I sounded like this.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I sounded like a little boy because my throat hurts so much.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
But thankfully, my voice is okay tonight and I can do a show for all you people out there listening to us on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I need to introduce, of course, the third host on our show, always here every week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hello.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
How are you, Loki?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm fine.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Apparently, you're getting sick too. That's no good.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
These things happen.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah. Alright.

02:30.000 --> 02:44.000
Also, of course, we do tape live on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our good pal Bobby Black Wolf over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the gamer mommies out there that listen.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I don't know of too many for sure. I know of one, at least, that usually listens live.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Maybe one other.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
But, you know, even if you're not necessarily a gaming mom, you might be a mom figure in somebody else's life or maybe a mommy to your pets.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
So, happy Mother's Day to all who that saying would apply to.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
However, for all of you whose girl bits work, ugh.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Are you having an unhappy Mother's Day right now?

03:18.000 --> 03:33.000
I've been having a funk because, and, you know, I've been, Dan and I have been trying for like the last six years and I've been trying not to get excited every time I've had a little thing happen, but I've gotten excited and I've gotten super depressed.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm sure.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So, I just wanted everyone to shut up.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, I understand where you get like really-

03:39.000 --> 03:53.000
It also creeps me the fuck out when people use pictures of their children as their Facebook icons. I understand being proud of your child, but living through your child and using your child as your avatar is creepy as fuck.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, you might change an awful lot once you go through that experience.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I really don't think so. I've never used a picture of Shermie as my icon.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You should. Shermie's adorable.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
She is adorable, but anytime I've ever used a picture of Shermie, I've been in it.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
I have an icon of Shermie on my LiveJournal where I have icons of me and a lot of other people from fandoms.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
And it's the picture of Shermie sitting in Mel B's lap.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
This says another lap dominated by Shermie.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, we'll see. I'll keep this recording and someday it'll happen for you.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
You know, remember, true story, my mom and dad didn't get knocked up till my mom was 37.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
She finally had me.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
In a row?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes, in a row. She finally had me at 37.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
However, Julian has turned five and I have to tell you the funny Mother's Day story from yesterday.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Sure, go ahead. Then we can talk about games.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay. I was at Becky's house and Julian runs in from the garage all excited and he hops up in Becky's lap.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
He says, Mommy, Mommy, we got you flowers, but it's a surprise.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And we started laughing so hard.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Well, it's the kind of flowers.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You can't see it yet because it's a surprise.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
And she's like, just know when it's a surprise, you're not supposed to tell me about it.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, the look on his face was funny.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
He's like, oh, you didn't know what kind of flowers.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That was the surprise.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
It was just funny because he's like, I can't show you.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
This is a surprise.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And just the way he said it, it was so cute.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
But yeah, that's my Julian story of the week.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
All right. Going to our chat room at vognetwork.com is where the chat room is.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Or if you're on the Game Surge Network, join us in channel VOG, V-O-G, voice of geeks.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Raginator says, Shermie and Mel B's lap, the one chick from the Spice Girls?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
No.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
No.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
He's our own Mel B of...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
DDR infamy from back in the day.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He used to do freestyle tournaments and all this stuff.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
And now he's a kick ass DJ.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's right, he's DJ now.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Didn't he spin at Fauna Mae last year? Isn't he doing it this year?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I think he's doing it this year too.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
We really need to do, you know, for our 10 year anniversary things

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
since we really have no ideas.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I would really like to do some type of where are they now

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
where we really catch up with a lot of the old people from back in the DDR day just to say hey.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
I know at least three of the girls are mothers.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Although I have to say one of them, you remember Renee?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
She told me to have a happy Mother's Day because I take care of other people.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
That's very nice.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
That's good.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
So that made me feel better.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
I talked to my mommy and my mommy was like, I was like, so what are you doing for Mother's Day?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Laundry?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, if you think about it, not only are you a mother to Shermie,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
but you're sort of a godmother to Maruko and Sanrio, our cats, because they have two daddies.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So you're like the womanly influence in their life.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I do get the cuddles from your little prissy dude.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
He is kind of a prissy cat with his tail in the air all the time.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's like, look at my butt.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Going to more comments from our chat room, Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, for Mother's Day,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
you should show your mom a violent video game just to see how she reacts.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
We already did that like six months ago.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I showed her the new Mortal Kombat game.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
It was hilarious.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
What episode number was that?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
You taped her reaction.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I did.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
It's actually on video, but she said she would disown me if I put the video up.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
So I could only play the audio of it for you guys.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Rob, what is this?

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Actually, the next thing I want to show her, I want to show her the love scene from Mass Effect 3.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Either the dude on dude or the female on female to get a reaction.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I want to get my mom.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Keep in mind, my mom used to play Super Mario Brothers with me back in the day.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
There you go.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
When I go back to Alabama, I need to get a video of mom today playing Super Mario Brothers.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
There you go.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
She could probably still do 1-1 blindfolded.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No, no, no.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
That was 8-1 that you had to do blindfolded.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Because it had the same timing every time you freaking did it.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
DJ Morpheus from Under Sedation Live, which is on the VOG Network,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Saturday nights at a new time, 7 Pacific, says,

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
With Rob's voice cracking periodically, it's like being in a time machine and hearing him go through puberty.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
You shut up. I'm sick.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm sick and I'm showing up for this show anyway because I love you guys.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Shut your whore mouth.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That's right. Shut your whore mouth.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Hey, video games.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
We'll get to our gaming weeks in just a moment, but I thought a couple kickoff topics tonight.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh, my God. That's so cute.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
What? Something else to distract us now?

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
No. It was Tiger Koplos did a picture of him with his old TV.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I had a TV like that.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I want to see.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
It has UHF channels and rabid ears.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, God. I used to have a TV like that in my bedroom because that was like the ultimate hand-me-down TV.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Since it is a radio show, this is the kind of TV that has the two knobs.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Shit.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Knobs. It had knobs.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I know. I know. But I'm just realizing as I'm saying this out loud.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
You know, any teenager listening to this show has absolutely no idea what we're talking about.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And it had a contrast twisty dial.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Maybe you've seen these at a thrift store.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
I saw a Blu-ray player at a thrift store, Rob.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I can only imagine that this description should be started with back in my day.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
I know. Well, a TV like that, the funny thing is a TV like that wouldn't even work anymore after the whole digital conversion.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
However, I'm looking for one.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
For a reason.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Why?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Play my Odyssey 2.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Go to a thrift store. I'm sure you'd find them.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I haven't seen them at a thrift store.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Really? You need to go to like, you know where you need to go?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Just need an RF adapter.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
You need to go to Deseret, the Mormon frickin'...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I do not like giving the Mormons my money.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I know, but I'll tell you what. They've got everything.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I used to buy old comics there, though.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
I almost bought, for Rocky Horror, in my defense it was for Rocky Horror and I don't want to hear it.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
I almost bought a wedding dress at Deseret.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I've been with Jessica a number of times getting stuff for clubbing.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah? Good times.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Because you can get lots of fun. I've actually bought cosplay stuff there to modify.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
There you go.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I bought...

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
The Mormons aren't all bad.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I bought some... actually, you know what the last thing I bought there was?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
What?

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Was my copy of Rubber Soul. The Beatles Rubber Soul. On vinyl. Five bucks.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
This other place I went to had a really shitty copy and one of 54. And I was like, nah, I'll buy it for the Mormons.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Alright, I was going to spend some time talking about some pre-E3 lulz and stuff, but you know what?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I just... I don't think we're going to be able to keep the topic on gaming.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Sure we can. I can do that.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
What?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I can keep the topic on gaming.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Alright.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So let's talk about pre-E3 stuff.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Let's talk about pre-E3 stuff. What did you want to bring up?

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know. There's a lot of big announcements I'm expecting at E3, so...

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Alright, is it time to make our E3 predictions now that we're talking?

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
You know, we know that the press dates have been set and some of them you'll be able to watch live,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
and some of them will only be online or what have you.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Okay, what are we going to see from Nintendo this year? This is the easy one.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
What are we going to see from Nintendo this year at their conference?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
The Game Boy Micro 2.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I still have my Micro, so STFU.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
They're just going to plain say, fuck it, we ain't releasing the Wii U, you bastards.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I'm sure we'll see the Wii U.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I just can't get excited about it, though.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I mean, I don't know.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
I don't think there's anything that they can put out for it at launch that's going to make me excited about the Wii U.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Save Excite Truck 2.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
In which case, that will be a tough, tough day.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
But they're not going to announce a date. They're not going to announce a price.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It's like...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's like the Wii all over again or something.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
That's right, they did come out and say, no date, no price at E3, right?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
It's like, thanks! No information.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, by the way, we're not going to show you any games either, because, you know...

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Alright, so Nintendo, easy.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
It's going to be all about the Wii U with a little bit thrown at the 3DS.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
What if it gets delayed?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You really think that's possible at this point?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
PS3 got delayed.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I don't think so.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They can't afford to delay it.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Nintendo already is going down the downward turn with their investors and everything.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
If they don't put out the Wii U, you're going to see Mario on the iPhone.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
They're going to have to give in to the investors, and that's what the investors want.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
They want Nintendo to develop for the iPhone.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
So if the Wii U gets delayed...

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
That's the day that Miyamoto will bind his knees and commit seppuku on the roof of the Nintendo building.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Honestly? Yes.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And then they would sell his head on eBay.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The Wii U's coming, whether it's ready or not.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I hear Foxconn has a nice roof that he can jump off of.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Stop it. Inappropriate.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
I think Miyamoto has a little more self-respect than that. I think it would be ritual suicide.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You know, the last one in Japan happened in 1978.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
You all are being so morbid and gross and tacky.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I have to read from chatroom, Rob, since you're ignoring it.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm not ignoring them. What do you want to read from chat?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I just lost it because you were busy jabbering.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh yeah, um...

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Great, now I forgot it. Oh well.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
I can't find them anymore. This is why I usually read chat.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
We have this awesome comment from our chatroom, and...

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, it scrolled away. Where'd it go?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm trying to find it.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Someone said, back in my day, we... Oh no, it was one-night stands.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Back in my day, we had to blow in our cartridges.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
But my retort was, back in my day, my computers used cassette tapes.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Because you're old. All right, um...

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
You're old, too! Who was it we were talking about needed hearing aid today, Mr. Rob?

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
All right, look. 3DS. Anything exciting going to happen on the 3DS at E3?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
All they're going to show is, they're going to show New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the 3DS,

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
which is like, yay, New Super Mario Brothers!

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
I mean, it's a good game, and they're just making more levels for it,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
which I've said in the past they should do for the first one,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
you know, and open it up so everyone else can make levels, but then they won't do that.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Um, I mean, what are they going to really have for...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It's not going to be Smash Brothers.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
They may announce Smash Brothers, because it could be years away before it actually comes out,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
but that's not beyond intended to do that.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I mean, hell, when did they announce Pikmin?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, like a couple of years ago.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
So, I'm not surprised there.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Um, probably Animal Crossing will be the holiday game, which is kind of...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
You know...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Yay!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I want to play it.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
He may do Luigi's Mansion 2, but eh.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
It's kind of been long enough for me since I really got into an Animal Crossing game

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
that I could be convinced, because I really just passed on the Wii one,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I really could be convinced to play Animal Crossing 3DS.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I would be pretty easily convinced.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Like, it's really a peer pressure thing for me.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
If all my friends do it, I will do it too.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You know what?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I found my copy of Doubutsu no Mori.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Really?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And I was like, I should play this.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
And then I was trying to remember why I stopped playing it to begin with.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Because I don't read Kana as well as I thought I did.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
This game's hard when you don't natively speak the language.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
I mean, there's not a lot that I can be excited about.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Especially if we're talking about this system's going to be

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
basically like an Xbox 360 with the tablet controller and the Wii controls.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't know.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
It doesn't seem very exciting to me.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
They're going to have...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Probably the same stuff that you saw in the tech demos

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
are probably going to become full-fledged games,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
because that's what they did with the Wii.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, these are only tech demos?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Wii Sports.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
You know, Wii Sports Resort.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It was just all the same shit.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So you'll probably see some sort of compilation that's going to be packed in,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
like a packing game or something that's going to be like Wii Sports.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I don't know, Wii U Sports or whatever they're going to call it.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And that'll be that.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But I'm kind of interested to see how it's going to work with, like,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
you know, especially first-person shooters and stuff,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
that tablet control is cool.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
But what if, like, say, I want to have more than just one person

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
playing a first-person shooter, you know,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
were we going to be on the classic controllers now?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean, that might not even be that great,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
because their controllers are kind of lacking

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
compared to some of the other systems.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's going to be hard to port that stuff over,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
but I don't know.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they show.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
All right, let's move on so we don't spend all show

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
on these predictions weeks before the show happens.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
How about Microsoft?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I said on Bobby's show a minute ago

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
that I think Microsoft is hedging all their bets on Halo 4.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
The Halo 4 is going to be the centerpiece

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
of that presentation at the very end,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
and that's really all the Xbox has going for it right now.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
No one's going to care.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I don't think I'd be that cynical about it.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Well, first party, they're going to have the new Forza game.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
They're going to have Halo 4, the new Fable game.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
They're going to be talking about exclusive DLC

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
for existing properties like Skyrim.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
They're going to have exclusive DLC for it.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They're going to talk black ops 2 because I'm assuming

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
they're going to continue on with them having the DLC

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
slightly earlier before everybody else.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
There's the rumors that they're going to be doing

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
some sort of extended peripherals for some exercise games

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
to kind of tie those all together, that kind of stuff.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Maybe the web browser thing.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
You may be talking about some more revisions to the...

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Please don't make any more revisions to the goddamn dashboard, okay?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's already Windows 8 enough.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
I mean, so... I don't know.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm wondering if they won't slip in some things about Windows 8

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
and kind of maybe how it might interact with the Xbox.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Maybe some type of enhanced media center or something?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I mean, big question mark there, but...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't think that's really necessary anymore

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
because a lot of the people they have now,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
it's tied in with all these different streaming services.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You don't really need to stream from your PC anymore

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
to stream Netflix and stuff

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
because you can do it through their apps.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
So they may talk about more partnerships with that kind of stuff.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
Another perfect one is the Kinect-enabled children's programming stuff

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
that they were going to be doing for National Geographic and Sesame Street.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
That might be something to push Kinect because that was kind of neat.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
So you think it'll be a lot of these really weird outside-the-box things like that

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
that you're talking about that we're going to see from Microsoft?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm thinking, yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Here's how the device does this, and here's how the device makes waffles.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Maybe they're going to talk about new properties.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
It would be nice if they made a new franchise or something like that.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Hell, Nintendo, make a new franchise.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
That would be kind of cool.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I would love it if they would kick off a new franchise.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
We'll see.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Maybe they'll bring Milo back from the dead, LOL.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Okay, Sony.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Sony's a huge what?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
What do you want to say, Dark Soccer?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Nothing.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It's a thought that when it came back into my head,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I thought that's actually going to be kind of stupid.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
What? Now I really want to hear it.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Taking old, kind of obscure NES games and making them into full-on new properties.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
That won't happen.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Like Milan's Secret Castle.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Not on the Xbox.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, no, I'm talking...

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
You said Nintendo needs a new...

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Sure, Nintendo. Any of them could use the new one. Why not?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
New IPs rock.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Well, maybe that's, you know, with all this retro gaming thing that's been going on,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
maybe what they need to do is look at the old stuff

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
and bring it screaming into the modern...

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, but some of it hasn't worked out too well. Look at Bionic Commando.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh, yeah, but that was shit.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, that worked out well for the Xbox Live Arcade games.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
That's true. The best Bionic Commando were the remade games. Yeah, yeah.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Which is ironic because they're by the same people, but...

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
The other thing, the IPTV stuff, the web TV thing that they're maybe going to be doing,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
their own TV network type thing, that might be interesting.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I would bet you anything that's where Major's Minute goes.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Some sort of new show.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Interesting.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
To get rid of the old show, to make way for the new show.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Alright, let's quickly talk Sony real quick, because Sony's kind of a wild card.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I mean, obviously, they're going to be pushing Vita, but we're not going to really see...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
You know, there's not going to be any peripherals that we can think of that would come out from Sony.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Like, there's nothing that they're pushing there.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
So, it's really games, games, games, games, games, left and right.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
Vita, they're going to be having a lot of stuff to talk about. The Vita, maybe enhancements to that.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Maybe some more move-enabled games.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Once again, I don't think the move is a bad peripheral.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Honestly, out of all of the motion-captured things that they have right now, I think that one works the best.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Yet, I don't want to play anything that's using it.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Well, actually, the sports champions thing, I thought it was really impressive.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm like, this actually works pretty well.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Versus Kinect, where it's like, this is not detecting me. This is frustrating.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
So, I can see them doing some more games that are going to probably support that.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Once again, they're going to continue doing hardcore games that support the move as well.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
I think they're going to talk a little bit more about, once again, franchises that are going to be supporting the move.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And stuff like Bioshock, Infinite.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
They have a few new games that they're supposed to be announcing, like the God of War prequel.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Well, the God of War prequel.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It's not making God of War prequels.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
I can't even keep track of the storyline anymore.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Sony Smash Brothers, or whatever they're calling it. Battle Royale.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
That might be pretty cool.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
They're going to probably show...

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
What about that one game, Last Guardian?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Where that guy suddenly disappeared, but they say the game's not cancelled.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
The Last of Us, also. That's their big holiday game.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So they're really going to just have game, game, game, game, game, game.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I think they're just going to have lots of games.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
That's good. That's what they need. Especially Vita.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I'm really excited to see the Vita's second half, based on some of the early stuff they were announcing before.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Alright.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Going to our chat room, ShadowNextGen says there needs to be a Vita price drop announcement at E3.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I don't... I mean, I think that will...

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
And then WhatUpG follows that with, there is talk of a PS3 price drop for E3, ShadowNextGen.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Again, that's vognetwork.com for chat.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I could see them doing that, because they want to push more systems.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
They're just bundling right now. They're kind of doing that whole thing.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
The Vita price drop... I mean...

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
I guess they could do that, but they're already... I think they're already losing money on the system.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
So it's going to be hard for them to do that.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Because, I mean, the system is more powerful than the 3DS.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
And so, therefore, it is more expensive.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
It's just right now, I don't think there's a lot of games that people need to have on the Vita.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
There's nothing like, oh my god, I need to get a Vita for this game.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Whereas, you know, like Mario Kart, oh, I gotta buy a 3DS for that.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Or Super Mario 3D Land, because it's just an amazing Mario game.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Or, you know, a Zelda game, or something like that.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Although, they need a new Zelda game on the 3DS.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
None of this Nintendo 64 rehash bullshit.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
Let's see... I'm actually speaking of rehash bullshit for the 3DS.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm surprised they haven't remade the Mario 64.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
That could be a title that they could just poop out real quick and put out for holiday.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And it would sell a ton of copies.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I don't know. I think there's going to be a lot of things for the Vita.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I think Call of Duty is definitely going to help.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
I think if they end up doing a Max Payne Grand Theft Auto or something of that caliber on there,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
they could easily do that.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
You know, I'm actually very interested in Lego City Stories, which was the game.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
They didn't announce the publisher, but it's fucking Rockstar.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
It is so goddamn Rockstar Games.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The interface is exactly the same.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So it's Lego Grand Theft Auto.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean, that would be pretty awesome for the Wii U.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
That could be a big thing.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
And if that comes out in other systems, that could be a pretty cool announcement.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And just more Grand Theft Auto 5.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I don't care who shows it.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Microsoft, Sony, both of them.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Hey, let's just show different things.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Every booth has it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
EA, just put it up there.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Hey, it's such an awesome game. We're going to show this too.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think that would be pretty cool.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I hope it's just something that's not cancelled.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Because once again, all those really cool things that I wanted for the 3DS,

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
DJ Hero, Saints Row, that kind of stuff,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
all got fucking cancelled before the 3DS came out.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
So all these things that they announced for the Wii U,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
like this Lego City Stories thing,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
could easily be cancelled by the time we get to it.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Alright, well, I'm sure some of you out there have your theories as well.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Email us quickly before the leaks start coming,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
because that's going to be the exciting thing over the next few weeks,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
is leaks, leaks, and more leaks. We even have a few tonight.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to lock in your predictions right now.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And I would like to add once again, because I don't think I say this enough,

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
I fucking hate Michael Patcher for getting paid lots of money to make stupid guesses.

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
I mean, hey, hey, I hear that a certain big title from Take Two got, you know, delayed.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Therefore, Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming out that day.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Yes, you could draw that, you know, you can make that argument, I guess,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
because it's a pretty obvious one to make.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
You know, or like, hey, I hear that, you know, a studio's making a new Halo game for the X-

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I think it's going to be for the Xbox.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
I mean, come on, that would be kind of the stuff that he makes calls on, I don't know.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
But he gets paid a lot more money than I do.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
because I have a pretty big thing I've got to get into in my gaming week this week,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
so let's start off with Ladies First Dark Sakura.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
How was your gaming week? What type of video games have you been playing this week when you haven't been coughing?

25:45.000 --> 25:52.000
Um, I got a panda to ten as a brewmaster and talked to the king of Stormwind

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
and realized he's an asshole and quit playing the beta.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
By the way, she's a Warcraft addict, everybody.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
A dealer. And I played some Portal 2.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, have you played with that new level creator thingy that came out?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Not yet, not yet.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Oh, you gotta. I need to.

26:10.000 --> 26:19.000
I need to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah, I think you might want to cash in on that.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
It's down to like twenty bucks now.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Oh, if it doesn't work, oh my god.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I'll have to wait for another Steam sale.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Still, I'm going to point and laugh at you for a second.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm going to point and laugh at you for having missed that bone.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
I want to thank ActDeft for the gift of the Portal 2 behind the scenes thing.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh, that's nice.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Listeners buy us gifts? I want gifts.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Listeners buy me gifts.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
No, actually, I have gotten nice things from listeners before. I can't pitch.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Speaking of gifts, I already bought you guys' Christmas gifts.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Already?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Really?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I already took care of it.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Nice. That's being proactive.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Now I'm going to remember that when Christmas comes around.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You bought that in May.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
No, I can't wait. It'll be great.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It's not ready yet, though.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Alright.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Uh-oh.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
RageNator in chat says,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Just an A. No A+. For shame.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
He's being very much an Asian father right now.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Do I look Asian to you?

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
Alright, I'm assuming she's done, so Loki, you're giving me a week.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I just played Call of Duty Mario Warfare 3.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
I wanted to get to play other things, but I was actually working on some Grand Theft Auto modding tool thing.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And I finally finished that, so...

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Whew! I'm done with that. I can actually go and work on actual Grand Theft Auto 4 modding.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
You know, I've got to get my stuff that I've been working on for like a year now done before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
And then I am going back to Skyrim.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
It's beckoning me, so I'm going to play that.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Now, actually, I'm supposed to be getting a copy.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
I don't know if I'm going to keep it, of the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition for the 360.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I haven't decided if I'm going to play that or not.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
I do want Max Payne 3, because I want to rule the online for that.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
But, we'll see.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I have to wait a money.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Alright. That's it then.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Alright, my gaming week has been all over the map.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Let's talk about the big one.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
I beat my third game for 2012 this week.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
That means I beat...

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Okay, so if we go back...

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Now, remember, I have Gamer's ADD.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I never beat video games.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And if you haven't heard me talk about my Gamer ADD on the show before,

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
I have a horrible habit of buying $60 video games, playing the first three stages,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and then going, ooh, shiny!

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Playing a new game that comes out the very next week.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I know I'm not the only podcast host that has this problem.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I've heard other guys with this.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Exactly. I know I'm not the only gamer with this problem.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So it happens to all of us.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It's been 25 hours in the day.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
You know, sorry, just to interrupt real quick,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
but you posted on Twitter you needed a new game to play.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah. I was going to get to that.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Well, then let me get to it.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
First, I have to talk about my big feat.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So I beat my third game.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
So to recap, this year, I beat Mass Effect.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Then after that, I beat Mass Effect 2.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Guess what I beat the other night?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Space Harrier.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Mass Effect 3, everybody!

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Woo!

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
In summary, you know how many hours I've sunk into the franchise overall?

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
Over 100 hours I have played these games since February.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, so I beat Mass Effect 3.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I've already kind of reviewed the game, I guess, on prior shows.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I love it.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
But I'm sure here's the question.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I already know.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I already know Tiger Claw is going to ask this in the chat room,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
or somebody's asking it in chat.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't even have to turn my head to look.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
So, Rob, how about that ending?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So I can finally talk about the ending.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I won't spoil, though.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Out of respect to those that have not beat Mass Effect 3 yet,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
or are just now getting into Mass Effect, I'm not going to spoil.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So which color did you get?

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
I went with green, which apparently was not the right thing to do.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
But my thought was,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
oh, well, I'm not going to go with the obviously Paragon

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
or the obviously Renegade thing.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
This surely must be the bonus choice that I get

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
for having collected so many war assets,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
which was only about half true.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Yes, it is a bonus choice you get for collecting a certain amount of war assets,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
but it's not as great as you'd think.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
You said ass.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, exactly.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Anyhow, so without ruining the ending, let me just say this.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I pretty much stand by everything I already said about this debacle

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
earlier in the program.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Yeah, it's kind of a disappointing end to a series

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
that a lot of people are very rabid over.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
It's a little weird that no matter what you do,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
the end result kind of ends up being really the same.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
And for all this war asset, multiplayer, EA server,

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
it interfaces with the iPad app and the iPhone game

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
and the website and all this stuff.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
You build up the war.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
It maybe impacts three QuickTime movies you get at the end of the game,

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
which is kind of disappointing considering BioWare puts so much more

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
into the game otherwise.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
But maybe they didn't want to branch it out in all these directions

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
because it makes future games in the series a bitch to make.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I don't know. I don't know their reasoning,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
but I'm looking forward to the DLC just like everybody else.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But this is supposed to be the last one.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Surely you don't suggest that they made a terrible ending

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
so that they could sell another game.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Oh, please. Please.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
It won't be the last Mass Effect game.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I mean, it might be the last in this trilogy,

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
but if they could make a Halo 4, they could make a Mass Effect 4.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That's for sure.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Otherwise, yes, the ending is unfortunate,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
but it doesn't ruin the hundred hours of the gaming experience

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
I had to get there, which was a great gameplay experience.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I'm still playing the multiplayer.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
As recently as earlier today, I was playing multiplayer.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I was playing multiplayer with Shane and Paul,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
one of our listeners and one of his friends last night.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We were all trying the gold multiplayer and getting our ass kicked,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
but it was so much fun.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
So, you know, we're having fun with that.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
And what else did I want to say about the whole ending debacle?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
There was one other thing I wanted to say about it.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
Oh, the whole talk about the defective game

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
and turning it back to Amazon and filing the complaint with the FCC.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
That shit was ridiculous.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh, really? I didn't need to play the game to know that.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Exactly. My thoughts have not changed on that.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I just want to make that clear.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
Do I think BioWare could have done better?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Fuck yeah, I think they could have done better.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Absolutely.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
But I'm not really the type to raise this huge ruckus and stink over it.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
They were a little busy working on some Star Wars MMO or something.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Shane is screaming at me to talk about the theory.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I don't want to spoil it, Shane.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I don't want to spoil it for listeners that haven't beat it yet.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
All I will say is this.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
He was begging me to watch this one and a half hour long documentary on YouTube

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
that is explaining the ending.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
And I'm like, Shane, I don't need to watch this hour and a half documentary

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
that explains the ending.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Exactly.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Because I kind of already figured it out.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Like, I was halfway there.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
And then he says, blah, blah, blah, blah.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And I'm like, oh, okay, I can see that.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Yeah, you're probably right.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
You see, they're going to better explain the ending soon.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
They're going to have the pop-up bubbles, like pop-up video for the ending

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
once the new BioWare DLC comes out for Mass Effect 3.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And he's like, no, you have to watch it anyway

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
because there's so many little things that go into it.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm like, Shane, I don't need to be sold on the theory.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I accept your theory.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
It makes a lot of sense.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
All right, I'm on board.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You're right.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
That's the ending and that's how they're going to fix it in the DLC.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
No, watch the documentary.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I'm like, God damn it, no.

34:06.000 --> 34:15.000
Anyhow, act deaf in the chat room screaming.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Exactly.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Fucking exactly.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It's open to interpretation.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
That it is.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
It is a little bit.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Anyhow, how about other games that aren't Mass Effect?

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Which I know is sacrilege, right?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Okay, you wanted me to get out the haterade, though,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
because I played a really fucking terrible game this week.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Like, it is Yaris bad, you guys.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
You ready?

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
It was a free game for me on PlayStation Plus,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
which should start to tell you how terrible it was.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
And I don't even remember the name of it.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
I think it was called Frogger Returns.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Good Lord, Rob.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Oh, no.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
No, you see, you don't even have to explain that.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I mean, it's just...

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Yeah.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It was free and...

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Okay, so it's like...

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Remember how, like, the original Frogger was a good game?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
And then remember how...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I don't remember the original Frogger anymore,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
because it's been tainted by all this shit that they keep popping out.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I have good memories of Frogger,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
because I was really good at it while on roller skates.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Then remember how Frogger came out again in, like,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
94 or 95 on the PlayStation?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
And it wasn't bad.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
That first Frogger game was kind of a neat reimagining

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
of Frogger on the PlayStation, right?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
And how every Frogger since then has basically tried to be

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
that PlayStation game all over again,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
because I guess that was actually one of, like,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
the best-selling PlayStation games ever,

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
was that Frogger that came out.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But it was awful.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
So Frogger Returns is, like, kind of a mixture of the two.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Like, it's trying to be the arcade game in that top overhead style,

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
but they've redone the maps to add a sewer level, a subway thing,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
and it's just, like, it's so derpy,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
and I don't really have a better way to explain it.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Like, there's power-ups, you guys.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh my god, oh my god, okay, power-ups, power-ups.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
You can make everything stop for a few seconds,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
which surprisingly doesn't make anything easier,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
because sometimes you have to have things moving

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
in order to get from platform to platform.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So that power-up does nothing.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And then, oh my god, you guys, oh my god, you guys,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
super revolutionary Frogger power-up,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
change your fucking mind, blow your fucking mind away.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Ready?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Reverse.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Everything fucking moves backwards.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh my god!

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Don't tell me that they have a mirror stage option as well.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I don't know, I didn't beat the game,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
but maybe that's something that comes up.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But everything moves backwards,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and you know what it changes?

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Nothing, because Frogger is just as hard

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
when everything's moving backwards as it is forwards.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Hey, Rob.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
What?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
There was a good Frogger thing that came out.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
What's that?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Frogger 3 Deep on the Commodore 64 was badass.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
It was a project using GPS mapping and street sensors

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
to where they had an interactive Frogger

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
that used New York City traffic as the cars,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
and you played the frog.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
That's already more interesting than the game I played.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't know, that looked pretty derpy.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I thought it was pretty neat.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I will say this.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
For you trophy whores,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
there are four trophies in Frogger Returns.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
You get a silver trophy for beating the first stage,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and then for stages two through four,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
you get a gold trophy.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
So if you want an easy gold trophy or two,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
go play Frogger Returns.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Three on PlayStation Plus.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Otherwise, oh, I needed to get out there.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
This is so important.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
The collision detection is awful.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
And in Frogger, collision detection is kind of important.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
You think?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
I was nowhere near that car.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
It's like playing a sprite-based game in three dimensions.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
It's terrible.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
All right.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Moving on.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
One other game I played on PlayStation 3,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
although this game's on Xbox Live Arcade as well.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
I didn't pay for it because it's also free on PlayStation Plus.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
No, we got it found at Fifth Avenue Frogger.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
And this game was actually worth my time,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
unlike the other one.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Awesomenauts is on PlayStation right now.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Awesomenauts is kind of cool

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
because Awesomenauts is like a tower defense game

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
mixed with Gunstar Heroes or Contra.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
It's like a shooter mixed with a tower defense game.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Here's the interesting thing about it, though.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Once you play the tutorial level,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
it's really all multiplayer.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I mean, yeah, you can play single player with bots,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and you can kind of do it that way,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
but it's all online.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
And so, I mean, imagine if you were playing a type of Contra

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
where you were just shooting the other people.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
That's kind of what they've made is a side-scroller shooter

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
that's multiplayer head-to-head.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
And, yeah, it's kind of a neat experience. I liked it.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Can you shoot people until they explode?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Yeah, you shoot people until they explode.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
They go back to their base, and they have to respawn,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and then you fall down this little rocket,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and that's kind of what fills the time

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
so that way there is a penalty for you having died.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
And in a nutshell, you're trying to bust through

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
these little, like, I think they're called turrets.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
You bust through these little turrets

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
on your way to get to the base.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I mean, it's like any other tower defense game,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
but they mixed it with a shooter,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
which makes it kind of unique and fun.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
So, yeah, I liked Awesomenauts.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That's worth a look.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
If you're on PlayStation Plus, especially, it's free.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So, like, seriously, go get it.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
So it wasn't Awesomenaut.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Well, and it has this amazing 80s retro theme song to it

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
and, like, anime intro.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And I got to say, it's a sharp-looking game.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
It looks like a cartoon.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It's great. Art style's fun.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
So, yeah, it's worth checking out.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
So I was just thinking now, you know,

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
how you're looking for another game to play, you know,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
and possibly one that's, you know,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
we could play with other people.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Yes, I put that out on Twitter.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Now that I've beat Mass Effect 3, what do I play?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
And, of course, Shane replied and said,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
More Mass Effect.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I'm like, I want to give it a month

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
before I start my Renegade playthrough.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Well, I was just thinking it'd be interesting

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
if we both tried Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
All right, look, I don't want the Minecraft hate mail.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
I played Minecraft on PC and I just didn't get it.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
But to be fair, to be fair, everybody,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
put the pens down, don't write the hate mail.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
The first time I played Mass Effect,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
about three years ago, the first Mass Effect game,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I didn't get it either and I didn't like it.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
So, okay, I'm with you, Loki.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Let's give Minecraft one more chance.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I will buy it tomorrow.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
All right.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I am looking for Minecraft for Linux.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Well, I'm sure it exists.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Why the sudden urge to get into Minecraft, Loki?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
I don't have a real urge to it,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
but I think it'd be interesting.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It'd be funny if we both played a game,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
like we set a time during the week or something

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
to play multiplayer and that just,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
whether we hate it or like it, it'll be interesting.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
That's right. Interesting it will.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
There is Minecraft for Linux.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Of course there is.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
There's everything for Linux.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't know.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Or Steam for Linux.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Or we could play a game that we already have,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
like Saints Row the Third.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says,

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Sky, Minecraft on 360 is a better introduction.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
That's what I hear.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
It's set up a little better to like get you into the series.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I'll check it out. I will. Why not?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Sure.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
All right.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Otherwise, I do have all these other games I could be playing,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
like Fez I need to play more of,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
because I actually really enjoyed the little time I spent with that.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Oh, whatever.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Let's move on.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
How's that sound?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Oh, first let me plug our Twitters.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Add us.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Be our friend.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
And we'll be your friend in return.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
And you can interact with the show

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
and answer our foogle questions every week.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Otherwise, housekeeping,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
there will still be a show next week.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
But no Dark Sakura.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Dark Sakura's going to the happiest place on Earth.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And not taking me.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
You know, you were invited.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I was.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I was totally invited,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
but I can't make it because I have a conflict.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
That's right.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
You're conflicted.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Yeah, I'm always am.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
So, Loki and I will be here holding down the fort,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
maybe a guest host.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Alan works on Sunday nights now, so he won't be here.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
And for the record, Frisbee,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
wine does not work on my netbook,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
which I'm running Lennox Mint on.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
So, end of story.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
And also, I want to say,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Nicholson, since I know you're listening,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
thank you for the pink berry.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Right, Jamie?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yes, thank you.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
It was considerate of you to think of us.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
It was considerate.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
He brought it for me.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
You just sound so sincere.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
But I'm here.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
No, you are.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
It was considerate.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
All right.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Let's move on and get into the news.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Loki.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
All right.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
So, EA, you know,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
they're planning on doing some layoffs.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
And they have,

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
they have,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
on Sunday nights.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
And, you know,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
they're planning on doing some layoffs.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
And they have,

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
they have,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
by September 30th.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Basically, what they're doing is the restructuring

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
of their employees.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Um, and they're-

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Running people off?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Yes, they're restructuring them out of the company.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Okay, see right here,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
this, this is our group of employees here.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
We have,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
this circle represents the people that are in the company.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The people that are outside of the circle.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
You're fired.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
So, um, that's kind of how it's going to work.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Um, they're basically, um,

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
I guess dropping from a one in eight engineers

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
to one in two engineers.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
To one in two.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Um, so, cool.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
And, um, I guess, uh,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
they, uh, will-

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
By the way, this is all the fault of people that rent games

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
and buy them used.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
This is all your fault,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and the blood is on your hands.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Clearly it's because you're not paying enough for those online passes.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That is clearly why these people are being let go

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and not because they like making money.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Um, so yes,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
apparently they're going to, um,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
have a variety of expenses, um,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
incurring up to 40 million in total costs, I guess,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
the severance packages for these people.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And, um, no,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
23 million of that is severance packages.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
The other 17, I guess, is going away parties.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Uh, that'd be my guess.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Uh, yeah.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And then, of course, um, they're going to, um,

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
drop the number of employees by five to ten percent,

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
which is approximately 500 to 1,000 people.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
How in the hell does that go from one in eight people being an engineer

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
to one in two people being an engineer when you're firing five percent?

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Like, I'm not even a math major, and that doesn't compute to me.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Does that mean all these people are suddenly going to be changed into engineers?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
They're just going to-

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Loki! Bam! You're an engineer!

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
They're just going to make them respec, okay?

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
As an engineer, so that's what's going to happen, you know.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
You were a white mage before, you're now a fucking engineer.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
You're going to need to pay 120 Microsoft points.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Listen, you better learn how to fucking pilot that airship,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
because if not, you're out of there as well.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
We're going to drop it down to one in one engineers.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Um, so yes.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
Only you could make a shitty thing like job loss hilarious, thank you, Loki.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Hey, not only do I speculate about, you know, game industry stuff,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I can also do comedy.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Fuck you, Michael Patcher.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
You can't do comedy for shit. I saw your video.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
My data says that there's more people that whine than complain.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
Well my data says that you're a fucking tard.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Allegedly.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Allegedly.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
So yes. So there's that.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And then of course, you know, beyond that,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
they've made some money with Origin.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
You know, I guess they have 11 million members on Origin.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
Now, to be fair, if you play an EA game that has multiplayer,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
you have to sign up on Origin.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Yeah, I'm on Origin because of Mass Effect, not willingly.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
You may be skewing those numbers a little bit, so fine.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
The person who hacked my Xbox signed me up for Origin.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
You know, I found out, I got signed up for Origin.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
And my Xbox hasn't been hacked, but I'm signed up for it.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Somehow, I don't remember doing it.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Dragon Age. You had to do it for Dragon Age.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Yep, see, aha! I'm smart.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
So, and then of course, they've made $150 million in revenue

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
during the fiscal year from March 31st, 2011 to April 1st of this year.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
And, you know, they're saying that EA's Nucleus cross-platform community network,

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
which, I gotta be honest, I've never heard of, has 220 million members.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
I don't even know what the fuck that is or why they have so many members for it.

46:45.000 --> 46:52.000
And they said, of course, they've allowed 11 million members to provide feedback

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
on Origin and their digital distribution service.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
But, see, once again, it's just because you can't tout those numbers.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
That's like, for example, the PlayStation, like Sony is saying,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
oh look, the PlayStation Network has all these members.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Yes, because it's free to make an account.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
I have four accounts. Am I four people? No, I am one person.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
But I have four accounts because I like having accounts in every single region.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
And also Nelly has an account. But technically it's on the PlayStation,

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
so therefore it's my account. But that doesn't count.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
So, whatever, fine. Tout your numbers, but all it really comes down to is revenue.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
$150 million isn't bad. I don't know what Steam makes during that same time period.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm assuming a lot more than $150 million.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
$150 million can save lots of jobs. Never mind.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
Oh, by the way, it wasn't Dragon Age. It was Sims 3.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Whatever.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Cray Sims 3 makes you sign up for Origin?

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
No, but I signed up for an EA registration account.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Oh.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
So it linked my data from when I signed up for Dragon Age.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
It actually linked my data from Sims 3.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Gotcha.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
Well, it's also weird because I had a Call of Duty Elite account,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
and yet I never remembered signing up for one.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
But I did. I just don't remember why.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
Alright, well speaking of Call of Duty Elite, if you're all done with the EA news over there,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
I am.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Let's move over to Activision Blizzard and talk about what they reported.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
After all, these are the two big software publishers in the world right now.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Activision Blizzard, or Active Blizzard, whatever I just called them,

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
the net revenue right now, $1.17 billion for the period ending on March 31, 2012.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
That is a 23% drop over 2011.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
Activision, let's see, Activision had 23% of net revenues, that's down 19%.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
Blizzard accounted for 21% of net revenues, down 42%.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
Probably because, I would imagine, because Blizzard had StarCraft II sales still pretty strong this time last year.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
And also, wow, subscriptions were up.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
Now, of course, Blizzard kind of has this semi-big game coming out.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Let me think, when is that game going to be out?

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Tomorrow night, Diablo III, which should look pretty good for them.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Pandas!

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
Panda People, Land of the Panda People is coming out later this year as well.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
And then, of course, they have a StarCraft II expansion on the horizon.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Do you suppose that maybe getting people to prepay for their full year of, you know,

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
now assuming that was prepaid for the blood pact, right?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
No, it was not.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Okay.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
It was merely, it was the equivalent of a cell phone contract.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
You signed it up and agreed not to.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I thought maybe they were trying to boost their numbers.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
You don't have to pay anything extra.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
It's just, we'll give you a pretty pony and this game and a beta.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
I will say I did this.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
When I signed up for the blood pact, I switched my account to six months at a time,

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
because when you do six months at a time, you get like $2 off a month.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
You pay like $77 for six months.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
And so I just did that because I had a nice chunk of money six months ago,

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
and then I knew around now I would have to pony up the money again, which I did.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
And it's okay.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
So, let's see.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Activision's big stuff coming up.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
Prototype 2, Amazing Spider-Man, Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, they've got, well, they've got, well, Prototype 2 just came out.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Obviously, their big one, Call of Duty.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
Later on, Skylanders Giants, which I hate to say is probably going to be a big title for them.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
And they have a whole bunch of smaller things in between them, like Ice Age 2.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
They have a terrible battleship game that's coming out also on Tuesday.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
They also have a-

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Battleship was a game. Now it's a movie.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
The game, based off the movie, based off the game.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
Yes, they have a game that's coming out.

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
A first-person shooter that will probably be passed over by a lot of people coming out as well.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
And then a couple weeks later, Men in Black, Alien Crisis, another terrible game based on a movie.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Well, not exactly based on a movie. It's based on a lot of secondary characters from the movies.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
That's also coming out as well. So they're going to have that.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
And Spider-Man will do well for them.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Alright, well, Call of Duty Elite, since Loki had brought that up a minute ago.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Apparently, 10 million users are signed up for Call of Duty Elite.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
2 million are paid subscribers.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
That's better than nothing, which is what they had a few years ago when the service didn't exist.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Apparently, that is up 3 million and a half million.

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
So it was 7 million and 1.5 million since February when they last reported on the numbers.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
So, yeah, it's gone up. I guess people are liking their Call of Duty Elite.

51:31.000 --> 51:40.000
They have a lot of content packs coming out, so it's becoming very apparent that paying the $60 a year is a good deal if you want all those maps and stuff.

51:40.000 --> 51:46.000
See, I'm not super into Call of Duty, so that's really not for me, but I could see where that is lucrative.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Like, if they had something like that for Mass Effect, I'd be tempted. I hate to say that.

51:50.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah, see, like, right now we play offline at work, so, you know, that would require everybody having those maps in order for it to be beneficial for me to buy those maps.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
So I just don't buy those maps right now.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
Alright. Well, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
Yes, other stuff that is, uh, well, more Blizzard-y things.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Blizzard and Valve settled their little trademark disagreement for the DOTA.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
DOTA, whatever it is.

52:20.000 --> 52:28.000
Um, so basically, Valve gets to use it, and Blizzard retains non-commercial use of the title for the community.

52:28.000 --> 52:35.000
Um, as in keeping it as an acronym available for Warcraft III and StarCraft II.

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
Um, in fact, Blizzard is renaming the Blizzard DOTA project. It's called Blizzard All-Stars.

52:43.000 --> 52:49.000
And this is the quote that came out from Rob Pardo, who's the Blizzard exec.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
Um, both Blizzard and Valve recognized that at the end of the day, players just want to be able to play the games they're looking forward to,

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
so we're happy to come to an agreement that helps both of us stay focused on that.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And then Gabe Newell said,

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
We're pleased that we could come to an agreement with Blizzard without drawing things out in a way that would benefit no one.

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
We both want to focus on the things our fans care about creating and shipping great games for our communities.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Um, neither title has a release date, by the way.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
But, soon.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
But they've come to an agreement. They've shaken hands.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
They said, you know what, this is silly.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Which is good. I mean, the community wins.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
And it's not like the community is not going to know one of these games from the other.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
I mean, DOTA-style games are really a rage right now.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
You know, League of Legends is really huge.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's a game we don't talk about enough on this show.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
There's a pretty huge community behind it.

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
Um, you know, those style of games are very popular, so I think everybody's really waiting to see what Blizzard and Valve puts out there.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
As well as, uh, there's another one.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
One of the other Dota makers went to go make a third one.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I can't remember the name. I'm sure someone in chat will jump in.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
But there's kind of a third one involved in all this, too, so.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
And then, of course, there's League of Legends, too.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
So, you know, they're all kind of very similar.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
But, we'll all be unique in their own ways.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It'll be neat to see.

54:04.000 --> 54:10.000
And, you know, honestly, I wish we could see this type of agreement.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
This type of goodwill, I would say.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
From more companies that are having little tiffs with each other.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
I would rather them consider their whole...

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
The whole reason they have money in their pockets is because of these communities.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Because of the gamers.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
And they try to, you know, delay things and screw each other over.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
In the end, they're screwing us over, too.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
And back to screwing themselves.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Because they're not getting their money as soon as they would probably like it.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
WhatupG in the chatroom says,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Can Valve now get to making Half-Life 3?

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
I agree. I definitely agree with that notion.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
I would like to see them back to making Half-Life 3 at this point.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
More Half-Life.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Alright, moving on.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
So, there's some other rumors or reports, I guess,

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
regarding some stuff that maybe Microsoft's gonna be showing off at E3.

54:59.000 --> 55:05.000
And this involves Kinect Play Fit in a device called JUUL.

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
Basically, what JUUL is supposed to be is some sort of device that's gonna include

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
a heart rate monitor and other wireless monitoring stuff.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Like, for example, I would imagine a pedometer or something like that.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
And what it's gonna do is track your, I guess, exercise across all different Kinect games.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
And, um, so, almost like, I would say, like those, uh, oh, I don't know what you call them,

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
but the, uh, the Nike things that they have for, like, the iPhone or, you know, whatever,

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
where you can jog and they'll, you know, keep track of how far you've jogged.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You mean the pedometer?

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Well, no, I understand it's a pedometer, but it's a little bit more than that.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
It's like a heart rate monitor and stuff, and it actually hooks up to these different software devices.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Um, so that's what they're gonna be talking about.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And I think that's kind of a neat idea,

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
because then that way you're not limited to, oh, I have to play a fitness game

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
in order to track how much, you know, how many calories I'm burning or something like that.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Almost reminds me a little bit of, like, what they did with kind of, like, the Wii Fit Plus stuff,

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
where you can, you know, show your progress across a bunch of different things,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
and you have your own dedicated channel for that.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Um, I can see them doing something similar, maybe built into the dashboard,

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
where you buy this device, maybe it comes with, like, an exercise program or something like that,

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
and you wear it for, you know, these different Kinect games, like Dance Central or something like that,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
and not only are you having fun, but you're, you know, tracking weight loss and that kind of stuff.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
Hurray! More weight loss and exercise games for the Kinect.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
Honestly, you know, I think, I mean, they need more of, not only do they need the weight loss stuff,

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
but they need, like, dieting stuff as well, like, what should you eat, you know?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Like a full program, not just, yeah.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Not just because, you know, weight loss stuff is a good idea, but if you're only doing that,

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
you're not gonna lose anything, so you need, like, you know, they need to also say,

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
okay, here's what you should eat too, and hey, recipes, recipes are nice.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Tied in with, like, a Windows phone thing or something, I don't know.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
Maybe a tie-in with Fedocracy?

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
Sure, why not. Who knows, anything's possible.

57:14.000 --> 57:20.000
Anything is possible, including an internet browser finally on the 360, what, about six years late?

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
At this point, it's, like, almost not even worth it.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
How long has the Wii and the, excuse me, the PlayStation 3 had a browser?

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
Well, sounds like the Xbox 360 could be getting one of their own if rumors are to be believed.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
Internet Explorer 9, which is weird because I thought they were up to, like, 10, but whatever,

57:38.000 --> 57:45.000
Internet Explorer 9, having Kinect functionality, is rumored to be coming to the Xbox in a future update.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
You'll be able to search with voice input, just like, you know, the Bing search bar and all that stuff,

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
and you can browse the web using Kinect-based controls,

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
which I have no idea how that would be practical or whatever, except maybe, like,

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
I wanna go back a page. Whoosh!

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
I wanna go back to home. Whoosh!

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Am I just scrolling through pages because you don't have a mouse?

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Well, you could use a controller for that, but why would you, why would we make things make sense?

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
Why do that when you can go whoosh?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The whoosh should be required.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
I don't want to whoosh. I do that in private.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
So, a big meh to that, I, I, whatever.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
I'll download it and try it once and go, huh.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
I am saying, though, let me be first to, I'm sure I'm not the first,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
but I'm gonna be the first in the show to venture into that area.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
Um, I can see that there's gonna be some dirty uses for the Kinect-enabled browsing.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Obviously since it's hands-free, you know.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Find porn! Go!

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Whoosh! Whoosh!

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
Enhance. Enhance. Enhance. Whoosh!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Next video!

59:03.000 --> 59:09.000
The Kinect starts scrolling up and down very rapidly. Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
We have detected masturbation.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
We are charting your calorie loss as part of the, uh...

59:19.000 --> 59:27.000
We heard you just say, Kinect video chat. Dark Sakura now calling.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
That would only work if I had a camera.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Do you have a Kinect? Then you have a camera.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
My Kinect, Rob, is still in its box.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Here's a question for everybody. I want honest answers.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
Who likes to put, like, a game box or something in front of their Kinect just in case they're spying on you?

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Cause sometimes I like to play Mass Effect 3 with no pants on.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
You know what, it's my house, I'll do what I want. And I'll sit in that chair with no pants on.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Well, I totally do that with my Kinect that's wrapped around, you know, that's not attached to anything that's collecting dust because that's how often I use the Kinect.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But I'm afraid one of these days it'll be like, start party with friends, and all of a sudden it's like, ba-doop, you've started video Kinect. Ah!

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
This is gonna be one day when I'm in my pajamas passed out on the couch while Dan's playing something.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Cause you've seen how my living room is arranged where we have the couch right in front of the TV and then we have a chaise lounge off to the side and Dan sits in the chaise lounge to play games.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Or what if, like, it'll just be me sleeping.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Or what if there's like an awkward moment where you're throwing a party actually in your house and you do not have enough cups to go around and you have a couple girls that are looking for a drink cup and you're like, there's two girls and I only have one cup.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Oh, embarrassing. That's embarrassing. Damn it. Did not want to see that. Who wants dip?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Or what if you have a new pet?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Did anyone bring lemons to the party?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Ah, shit!

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Or what if you just got a new pet and you say, look, I have a new goat, see?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.000
You know, that's actually funny enough that you should say that actually is a legitimate concern for my sister whose goats are actually having babies.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So she would have something that she would, you want to see my new goats, you know?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
New goat, see?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Which I still do want a pet goat to eat the grass in my backyard.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Tiger Claw in our chat says, Skye, what about the Kinect microphone? That thing would be on and they would hear you. You gotta turn that off.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know what? I actually did turn that off in the dashboard. I'm always afraid it's going to like pop back on or something because, you know, like sometimes I'm playing strangers on Mass Effect 3 and I don't want like, you know, Alan to walk in the room, be all like, honey, the kitty just barfed or something like that.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And then everybody hears it on the video game.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well, we used to have Shermie shit in the hall while we recorded the show, so it's not a big thing.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And just to let everyone know, Shermie is fine. She's old and smelly.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
All right, let's move on, please. Another story.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I got texted.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
You're supposed to be doing a show, young lady.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So? Was it my turn?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, yes. It's your turn. And then release dates coming up.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
That was Becky telling me she was home. She should be listening to the show right now. Becky, listen to us.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So have you ever wanted a mecha, Rob?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
A mecha?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Yeah, you're a mecha, like a Gundam or an Evangelion.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Can I kill people with it?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
That's what they're for.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Will I get away with it?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I have to tell you, because only in Japan, actually not only in Japan, because when I would go to Anime Expo,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
there are always these guys trying to get donations for building their giant mecha.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And we're like, no.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Kickstarter?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
This was before Kickstarter's. This was like my first AX in 1998 or something.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
But they're doing it in Japan. They're building a 12-foot-tall pilotable mecha.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And they're using Kinect for running it.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Basically, it's as far as they actually have a weapon, Rob. It's a water gun.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Not a big sniper rifle or chain gun. It's a water gun.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And they're calling it Vaudeville.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
If I shoot that water gun right in your eye, it might hurt.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah. They're calling it Vaudeville.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And it looks like it's four-legged, and there's some shots of it in production.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I mean, it looks really freaking not like a Gundam.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Can my cat drive it?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Kitty mech.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Meow, meow, meow.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Did you ever play BattleTech?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
No.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Well, it looks like old BattleTech stuff.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
All right.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But it's neat. But, you know, I want a mecha so that I can use it to go to work.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It brings up that age-old question. Why?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And the age-old response, Rob. Why not?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Why not? Because.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Reasons.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I'm bored.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because of reasons.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
coming to a gaming store near you in your country,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
which may or may not include gaming mechs.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
There's lots of stuff coming out this week,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
including a small PC title I'm sure no one's heard of, Diablo III.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
That's coming out this week, both regular and collector's edition.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
As I mentioned before, Battleship, the newest game from Activision,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
that will be a blockbuster smash, I'm sure.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I mean, the source material is excellent.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and Nintendo DS.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Also this week, Akai Katana on Xbox 360, if you're a fan of cave shooters.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Also this week, Game of Thrones on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Max Payne 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
as well as the special editions for that.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And last but not least, one week from today, Mario Tennis Open on the 3DS,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
as well as the Midnight Purple 3DS system.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I'm sorry. I thought you said Herple.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Herple to purple.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I really want that purple 3DS, actually.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
In case you're interested, apparently next week is when GameStop

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
is going to start selling the Avenger controller.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You know, if you want to throw money out the window, by the way.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
What's the Avenger controller?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The spider controller that I showed that sucked, remember?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Oh.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That thing that was...

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
First off on the Nintendo 3DS on May 17th.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
This is a mouthful. Are you ready for it?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Pachi Para 3D Omi Monogatari 2 Pachi Pro Funruko Hana Kibo 2 Urugiri no Gauken Sekkatsu.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
What?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It's basically a gambling...

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Beach Babes Pachinko.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Beach Babes Pachinko. You got it. That's exactly what it is.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Sweet.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And it's on the 3DS, so you know what that means.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
3DS 3DS!

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Woohoo!

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Because that's the game we've all really wanted on the 3DS.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
They've already had one of those. They're gonna make another one, too.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well, this one was a sequel.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Oh. Well, there you go.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That's the announcement I'd like to see from Nintendo at E3 this year.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Boobs 3D!

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Coming soon.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Otherwise, honestly, on any other console, I think the release dates are all the way out to the 24th.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Oh, wait, no. There are a couple things on the Sony PSP.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Regular Edition.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Uh...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
What the hell is this game?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That is literally the name.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh my god.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
This guy is carrying around this little pink bunny and he's sucking on a gigantic Pez candy or something.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I think it's like a Yowie game.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I think this is a Yowie game.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I want it.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Of course you would.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I like watching dudes make out.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I like watching ladies make out.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I like watching people make out. What am I talking about?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I'm gonna just post that in the chatroom and see who's gonna be pre-ordering that.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
At least there's a variety.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
See, on Nintendo handhelds this week, you can have Beach Bay Bikinis.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
On the Sony PSP this week, Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Bunnies and sucking.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Danzai no Maria La Campanella comes out this week as well.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I don't know what this game is either, but it's a little more gothy and dark.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Dramatic Pose!

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yes, Dramatic Pose is the game.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
This is worth mentioning.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Persona 2 Eternal Punishment.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I think there might be a few people interested in that one.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Finally, a really big title this week.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Persona 2 on the PSP.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Eternal Punishment.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That's it for Japanese releases.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Well, how about stuff for the UK?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
On the 15th we have Pixel Junk 4 AM.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
On the 16th is Ratchet and Clank HD Collection for PS3.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And on the 18th, a few things.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
We have Dragon's Lair for the Xbox 360.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City for PC.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And Bruce Willis the Game.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I'm sorry, Max Payne 3.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I don't think the man looks good.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
He looks like a different character.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Bald. Sorry.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He looks like he's trying to do that Bruce Willis thing.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm done.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Alright, just a few more stories before the classic game of the week.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But first, Loki.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So Assassin's Creed is being sued by a novelist.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
John Bisswanger is suing them.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Because he says that Assassin's Creed stole themes and other things from his book Link.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Apparently they stole the themes of assassination and spiritual and biblical tones.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And also the battle between good and evil.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That sounds awfully generic if you ask me.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
He's seeking five and a quarter million dollars in damages.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And basically saying that it could delay the release of Assassin's Creed 3.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And of course, you know, the response for it is that we understand that many gamers are upset by the litigation.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And the potential for a delay in the release of the next Assassin's Creed video game.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And as a result of that anger that had been posting negative comments on Amazon and other forums about our client and his novel Link.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
However, copyright laws exist to protect the authors and creators.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And for people to exploit them.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
From others who copy or create works that are under the law substantially similar.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I'm sorry. I just...

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'm not buying.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I think there's also something that was very similar to the animus that was in Assassin's Creed.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I think that's mainly the main tie in there.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But it's kind of stretching if you ask me.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I'm sure there's a lot of books that are pretty similar.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I know. I was going to say, I'm sure there's a lot of books in the world.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
There's a lot of books in the world.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I'm sure if you go back even further you might be able to find traces of it somewhere else, right?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yeah.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Surely?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't know.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Alright.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Moving on.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Let's talk about Zynga.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But no, no, no.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
This is a story that might make you lull a little bit here.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Zynga apparently has also filed their own lawsuit.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
It's against French publisher Cojobo.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Which sounds very French to me.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
They have a game on Facebook called Pyramidville.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Zynga ain't having that because what's wrong with the name Pyramidville?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Oh, Zynga owns Ville apparently.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Except they don't.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
They just think they do.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Zynga says that Facebook users are likely to believe erroneously that Pyramidville is a member of Zynga's Ville family of games.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
That's according to the complaint.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Given Cojobo's refusal to change their game name, legal action was necessary to defend our famous marks and prevent player confusion.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Well, I am kind of confused that they have a game that's called, what is it, Dream Tower or something like that.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And it looks very similar to, you know.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But apparently, yeah, apparently they own Ville, but the same logic will not apply to Nimblebit who owns Tiny Tower.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Although I think their game is called Dream Heights, to be fair.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Dream Heights.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Still. Still.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Oh, my mistake.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Oh, okay.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Still.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Yeah, they're gonna copyright Heights now.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
They just need to get back some of that money they blew on OMG Pop.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm sorry, but unfortunately they don't own the name Ville.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I mean, no one's gonna ever side with them in the fact that they own that as a copyright Ville.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It's not gonna happen.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And also, Ville happens to be French.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You know, French for town, so.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Well, they're gonna sue them because, you know, it's called Pyramid Town.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Pyramid Ville.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And you know what, honestly-

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Mental note, guys, for the new VoG site.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Bobby, Bobby, if you're listening, we need to cancel VoG Ville.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That can't happen. No VoG Ville.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Sorry about that.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We'll just have to scratch that out.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
It's gone.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Frisbee in our chatroom at VoGnetwork.com asks, so does that mean Zynga owns the song Margaritaville?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh, that's a good question you should ask them that.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Well, they do have a Facebook game that is Margaritaville as well.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Fifth Dream said they wanted to make a Smallville game and Zynga sued.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Let's see.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
One Night Stand said I played Potville on Facebook.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Do they own that?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You know, I honestly, I hope that they lose because it's just like Monster.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Remember Monster Cables or Monster-

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I don't know which one it was.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Monster Cables and Monster Energy.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
They both kind of suck.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But they sue everybody that uses the name Monster.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And so, oh, people are gonna get confused.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Facebook games-

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I'm gonna be the generic guy here and say, you know, they all kind of look alike anyways.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I mean, I understand that maybe this company may or may not have named their, you know, Pyramid Ville or whatever to get people confused to play their game.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Um, I don't know.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
From what I hear though, they're suing them for more than they actually made on that game.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Like three times as much as they've made on that game.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And all they're doing is they're just, you know, positioning themselves-

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It was Monster Cable by the way.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah, well Monster Energy does it too.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Like they sued Monster Mini Golf.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It's like, okay, whatever.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Um, I don't know.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I just think it's stupid to do that.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And fuck, it's Karma, bitch.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You know?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I mean, you rip all these other people off and now you're getting yourselves ripped off.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Too bad.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Alright, let's go to a time when there was no Ville games and nobody owned that name.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It was a simpler time for video games.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Dark Soccer's gonna open up the gaming vault and find a video game she deems worthy of being the classic game of the week.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Streets of Rage.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I can't believe this was never the classic game of the week before.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I'm always amazed at what you pull up.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Like, I'm like, no, she had to have done this.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
She had to. No.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Wiki says it's not true.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Another suggestion from my lovely husband.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Well, it's a good suggestion.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Here's a little bit of the music from Streets of Rage.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The Japanese name is Bare Knuckle Ikari No Tekken.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
So, two other games have based their names off of this.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But I fucking love this music.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I wanna fucking dance.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Right now?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
No.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So, which I actually have a Genesis cartridge of Bare Knuckle.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
But when you play it on the American Nomad, it comes through a Streets of Rage.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Did you hear that?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That's weird.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
It must read the region on the device or something.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It must.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Anyway, this was the first game, of course, in the Streets of Rage series.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
There were two and three after that.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
It's had multiple versions. We've had Game Gear, Mega CD, Master System.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It came out for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And there's an IOS version.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:24.000
There's a comic strip series that appeared in Sonic the Comic that were based off of Streets of Rage 2.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And another thing about this game is that you know who did the soundtrack, Rob?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Yuzo Koshiro Squee!

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Yeah!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
That's why it's fun.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
By the way, if you were listening to last week's show, you know it's a big inspiration for Mega Ran as well.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Indeed.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000
So basically, it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up, punch-em-in-the-face.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
It came out around the same time as Double Dragon and Final Fight, but it was its own thing.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And you have one special attack per life per level.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And your power-ups are shaped like police cars.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And you cannot use your special attack in level 8 at all.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It doesn't name any of the enemies.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Only in the Japanese version of the manual do the enemies have names.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Because apparently they care more than we do.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You can also play one-player or two-player co-op.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And you have multiple endings.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Of course, your enemy is Mr. X.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000
So you can actually end the game as a bad guy if you play in two-player mode.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So the way that it works is that you get the good ending just for finishing the game.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
The bad ending, like I said, is only in two-player mode.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The boss will ask you to join him.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And one says yes and the other says no.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And so the player who said yes must prove their loyalty by killing the other player.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And if the yes player wins and then turns down the boss's offer, then he has to fight the boss alone.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And if he succeeds on the bad ending, he will be sitting in the boss's chair that says,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
You became the boss, you are great.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I need a caption of me in a chair that says that.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You became the boss, you are great.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And then when the credits roll the character laughs and the word bad end appears.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If both of them say yes, the boss will test the player's loyalty by sending them back to an earlier stage.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And then they have to replay the game from that level.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So it had a little bit of interactivity to it.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So the characters in the game is Adam Hunter, who is an ex-cop and accomplished boxer.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
He's slower but tougher.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And then Axel, who is an ex-cop and skilled martial artist.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And he's the middle one, who is, you know, basically all around middle speed, middle other attributes,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
but he has a weak jumping ability.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And then there's Blaze Fielding, an ex-cop and judo expert.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
A little weaker but she is more agile and can jump the highest.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And her kicks have the longest range.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
She has throws and body slams. She's always who I use by the way.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000
You have the backup enforcer who is not a playable character, but he only comes out during a special attack.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
He's the one good cop.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So as far as different versions, there was 8-bit versions for the Sega Game Gear and the Master System.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
The Game Gear version was crap for the record and it didn't have Adam in it.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The Master System version was not actually a port from the Game Gear. It was pretty decent.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
It has a boss on round 6 that is not in any other version and has no two-player support.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
The Sega actually brought it out in the arcade for the Mega Touch and Mega Play arcade boards.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And in the Mega Tech version, you play for time, not for credits.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000
There's different collections that came out. There's Mega Games 2 that had Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi that came with the Mega Drive.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And again, that was the name in Japan and the UK for the Genesis.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000
There was Sega Classics Arcade which was the Mega CD version that had Super Monaco GP and Columns on it.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And also there was a cartridge version of this too.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And the voice effects in the game were redone.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Then there was the Sega Genesis 6 pack that had Streets of Rage on it, the Hedgehog, Columns, Revenge of Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Super Hang-On.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And the Mega 6 that had Streets of Rage, World Cup Italia 90, Columns, Super Monaco GP, Revenge of Shinobi, and Song of the Hedgehog.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
There was a version of the Sega Gems collection for the GameCube and PS2.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
They actually took it out of the North American version so that they wouldn't give it a T rating.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
You can get it on Game Chat by the way.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And then they're all in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 on the Wii Virtual Console.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And there was the Streets of Rage by Blaze Europe that was handheld.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And there's the iOS version. Now this is the thing that has come up on the show before was the fact that there was the Streets of Rage remix.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
That I believe, and I have it, I haven't played through it, but it was like all three of the games combined.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Just in, I guess, continuous levels.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Of course they were asked to take it down so it was stopped, but hey, clearly there are still fans in the series.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And you can get the soundtracks, which of course we said was done by Yuzo Koshiro.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And the second one and the third one had work done on it by Multihiro Kawashino.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So there you go.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Bare Knuckle, Yukari no Tekken.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Your classic game of the week.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Bare Knuckle, or as many of you know it, Streets of Rage.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
The first one.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Yes.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Available on the Genesis or Mega Drive and tons and tons of systems after that in various revivals.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Indeed.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Alright, we're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere guys.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
We've got more of Orange Lawn's radio coming up in a little bit, including the FUGL question of the week.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And guess what we're bringing back tonight, we haven't played this in a little while.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Listless tonight! Woo hoo! And I'll tell you guys the topic in just a little while.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
So stay tuned for part B and more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Welcome back everybody to the show wherever gamer has a voice.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday, May the 13th of 2012.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Mother's Day once again.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
To those of you that joined us a little late live tonight.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
A happy Mother's Day to all the gaming mommies who are listening or the geeky mommies.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Or mother figures in people's lives or pets lives.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And everybody that somebody or something could call a mother happy day to all of you out there.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
We are of course live as we are every Sunday night on VOG Network.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
www.vognetwork.com

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Still kind of a skeleton site there, but lots of exciting stuff to come in the next couple weeks.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Been starting to see some behind the scenes things of what's being planned and it's going to be a good time.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So looking forward to phase 2 which will be around the beginning of June.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You're not the one having to play in Photoshop Rob.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
You know what?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I am heading up the future of the radio, I mean although VOG is going to be more than a radio station.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Which I think sometimes people forget because that's all it is kind of right now is the radio station and chat room.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I am going to be heading up the radio station part of it.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So I am trying to put some of the final touches on the 24-7 music feed.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I am giving you a hard time.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I know, but I am just saying that is going live soon and the other shows.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I spent minutes going through music.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
If you want to recommend a show for the network get in touch with me.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000
You can find me idling throughout the week in the VOG chat room or rob at www.orangelandradio.com

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
is a great place to email me at.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I will have my VOG network address set up soon.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
But that's a good place.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
We are actually not really looking for a lot of more gamer shows.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Because we have a few now.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Can we set up a VOG network email account that doesn't get as much spam as we do now?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Actually yes.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I have to talk to you offline about how that's going to work.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But yes, yes you can.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So yeah, if you have a show that's of good audio quality is very important.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I especially am looking for live shows.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
It's a huge, huge draw.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
It can be anything about geek.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Anything geek.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Music geek.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Comic geek.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
TV geek.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Movie geek.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Book geek.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Oh my god a book club show would be awesome.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Anything that you think qualifies as geek get in touch with me.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm looking for most of all audio quality and consistency is hugely important too.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
If you can't be bothered to do the show regularly then we can't make it work.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But if you're willing to commit, we'll do what we can to help you grow an audience.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So there you go. Rob at Orensalterator.com.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Alright.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Get into some gaming news.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
We need a board game podcast.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
A board, especially, oh my god there's some crazy board games out there with like eleveny billion pieces.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And I know people that I get invited to these board game parties that some friends of mine have probably about every other month or so.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
And I didn't get to go to the last one because I had a conflict.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But I went to the first one that I was invited to a couple weeks or a couple months ago and I had a blast.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
And they have like shelves and shelves in their house just full of board games.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And played some new stuff I never heard of in my life.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah a board game podcast would rock.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Wait a second Bobby, no bronies or wrestling?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I don't know if wrestling is geeky.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Bronies, let's hear your ideas.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I wouldn't necessarily say no to that but it's got to be real good.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Real good.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Alright, let's move on to cover some video game news.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Lowkey, rapid fire news.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So Bioshock Infinite's been delayed to 2013.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:33.000
They basically made the excuse that it's to put some more polish on the game and apparently that they're working on multiplayer.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Because you know every game needs multiplayer.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
It will not be coming out in October as originally planned.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It is now scheduled for February 26th, 2013.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So that's when you can look forward to that.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Certain analysts would let you think that Grand Theft Auto will be coming out that day.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Or October instead.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Which, don't get me wrong, I would love that.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I would love that, love that, love that.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I'd also love it if it comes out in 2013.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But yes, the sooner the better. That's my theory.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I'm just saying though, Bioshock, the delay sucks.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
But at the same time, if they need the time to make the game better, then take it.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
We have to remember, as much as this news might disappoint, don't rush a game that needs to be good.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Like this.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Bioshock Infinite needs to be good.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So take your time.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Modern Warfare 3 is getting some new content.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:45.000
They're getting a brand new mode, which is called Face Off. It's meant for one-on-one or two-versus-two kind of deathmatch, team deathmatch type stuff.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
They're actually putting out four maps, two of which are going to be free.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And those new maps are Ground and Erosion.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
The Ground is a map with a run-of-ground ship.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And Erosion, I don't remember the hell that one was.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
But it looked cool.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So that's going to be coming out.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Also, of course, two more maps that you can buy, which will be also part of the content collection.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
So if you happen to be a paid subscriber of Call of Duty Elite, you'll be getting those for free.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And, well, you're paid for with your subscription.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But no additional cost, I guess.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And those will be coming out on May 15th for Elite subscribers.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And I guess everybody else on Xbox on May 21st.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And then Content Collection 2 is also going to include new multiplayer maps, Sanctuary, Foundation, and Oasis.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And two new Spec-Op missions, including Ironclad and Killswitch.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Ironclad being one where you get to drive a tank.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And Killswitch is a sniper and infiltration mission.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
So, yeah. Looks kind of neat.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And then, last but not least, we have LEGO Batman 2 coming out pretty soon.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And LEGO Harry Potter is obviously done with.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
So, what the hell is going to be the next LEGO game?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Well, the next series is supposed to be coming out, which happened to be leaked out on the LEGO toys themselves.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
LEGO Lord of the Rings will be the next series from Traveler's Tales.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And will, of course, be published by Warner Brothers, since they have the Lord of the Rings license.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So, look for that sometime this summer.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And that's kind of neat, I guess.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I don't know how that would play, but I know it's going to be popular, especially with the new movie coming out.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well, yeah. And those LEGO games are kind of always big sleeper hits.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Like, they might not seem huge to the core gamer.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
They don't seem like such a big deal, but they're hugely family-friendly games.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And lots of the family owners get those games.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So, those LEGO games are always a pretty big deal.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Except for Rock Band, maybe didn't do as well.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
It was a neat idea, you know? To be honest, it was a neat idea.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And it was a game that I got a copy of, just to download those songs for Rock Band.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Yeah, me too, because I found it for like $9.99. I was like, alright, I'll just get those songs.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And the songs were pretty fucking awesome. So, I don't know, it wasn't so bad.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, watch out for LEGO Twilight.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Well, here's the problem.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It's interesting. The premise is you just sit around and wait.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Yeah, I was going to say, here's the problem. There's no content to base a game around of.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I mean, unless ripping off your shirt.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Honestly, what would be funny for Twilight or something like that is like a microgame thing.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
You know, like WarioWare. Rip off shirt. Brute. Stare at the wall for months.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You know, you're like spinning the clock to make the time go faster.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Sparkle.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Sparkle. You know, that would be pretty funny. I could see that.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Doo doo doo doo.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Block Bella from getting eaten by vampires because she poked herself with a knife and is now spewing blood.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Alright, you're getting a little too carried away there.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
My wife is starting to read Fifty Shades of Grey and she says it's the worst thing ever. The worst thing.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Alright, moving on. Wolfenstein 3D. Remember that game?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Hell yeah.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Well, if you do remember that game, congrats. You're old because Wolfenstein 3D celebrated its 20th anniversary this week.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It's only been 20 years.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yeah, I remember downloading that demo from a local BBS back in the day.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I remember buying that shareware demo. Well, it wasn't a demo. It was the full first campaign, so it was pretty awesome.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Yeah.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
On a floppy disk at a flea market.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Shareware demos used to be the shit. Yeah, it was all of episode one and then if you wanted episodes two through six, that's what you bought.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
It'd be like getting the full game and then you'd have to buy the DLC later on.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Not bad.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It's awesome. So, anyhow, Wolfenstein 3D. How did they celebrate their 20th anniversary?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Well, Wolfenstein 3D is now playable in web browsers completely free.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Wolfenstein.bethsoft.com because Bethesda has the IP now.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You can also pick it up on the iPhone devices for free. I believe that was only on the actual anniversary, though, which was on the 9th.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I don't think it's free anymore. I will say this. I picked it up and I played it.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And, you know, it's a 20-year-old game, but they up-rezzed some things and they added a map to it, which was pretty cool.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
They did at least make some tweaks to the IOS version. The only thing is it controls, like, shit, like all iPhone games do.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I mean, what a shocker.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm not positive, but that may have been the first game I modded.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I remember an old-ass map editor that you could download, that you could make your own maps, and you could, like, spell fuck out of the walls.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
We used to make crazy maps. We used to make gore mods where we would take, like, a shareware paint editor and just,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
add more blood, add more blood, add more blood. That was it.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Or just have the giant room and put, like, 50 enemies in the giant, just, it's all it is, just one giant room.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
We used to make mazes out of the moving blocks. Like, just put a ton of moving blocks everywhere.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It was awesome.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Nice.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Kingdom Hearts. A lot of people are excited about the Kingdom Hearts 3D version, or Dream Drop Distance.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Get excited about this. There's going to be a demo coming out.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
That's pretty cool.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
The 3D, for the 3DS. That's pretty awesome that Nintendo's embracing those demos a little more.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
It is going to be the Traverse Town demo that's already out in Japan. It's going to be here in North America as well.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
No clue when, but hopefully soon.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
They also, they announced some AR cards for that as well, pre-order bonus thing.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That's right, huh? Is that the Nintendo AR cards where you can get the little pictures of?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yeah, it's something that ties in with the game.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
What they haven't announced yet is there's going to be a collector's edition.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Is there?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
There's going to be a collector's edition.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
What's the collector's edition going to have, Dino?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I have no fucking clue.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Alright.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
There's going to be one.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Of course there's going to be a collector's edition.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
They're going to announce it this week.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Stickers.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Stickers or something, I'm sure.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I know it's more than stickers.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Stickers' theater rhythm got stylus and stickers, but no.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Okay, so I wasn't too far off base suggesting stickers.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Yeah.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Maybe a soundtrack. How about a soundtrack?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It could be, yeah. I don't know.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
What's the theme song for Dream Drop Distance?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I have no clue.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I don't know.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Alright.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
They've always just been kind of using the same one from like, was it one?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
They're kind of like doing the score version of one.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Alright, and moving on into what could soon be the trial of the century with one of gaming's most important people, Beyonce Knowles.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Ugh.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
After all, she was the spokeswoman for the DS, not the 3DS, but the DS.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Remember when her and Carrie Underwood were doing those ultra-cute, hey girls play games too, hee hee, commercials.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
How'd that work out?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Well, the DS sold 11 billion units, so I'd say pretty well.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Well, Beyonce told me to buy it, so I have to buy it.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
That's right.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I wasn't, I'm not going to play anything Beyonce's not playing.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000
All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, give me money.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Anyhow, Gate 5, you might remember this company is suing Beyonce.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Why are they suing Beyonce?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Because, remember, Beyonce was supposed to have like, there was supposed to be like this uber Beyonce music game that was going to come out.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And Beyonce said, nope, not going to work.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Gate 5 apparently said to Beyonce, you continue to negotiate right up until the time you pull the plug.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And the judge said, that's not going to work with me, according to what Beyonce's lawyer said.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
So Star Power Beyonce was the game.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Its cancellation resulted in the firings of 70 employees.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And Gate 5 is suing for 100 million in damages, 6.7 in investment capital, and 100 million in hypothetical profits.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Hypothetical.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Hypothetical. Hypothetical.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:10.000
So they're suggesting that they were going to sell, that's actually not that much, that's almost like 200,000 copies.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I mean, that's not too bad.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Essentially what this decision has done is said, Gate 5 has enough information to proceed to an actual court.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And it is going to go to court.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Unless, of course, there's a settlement, which usually when things get this far along will inevitably happen.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And I'm sure all parties are being strongly encouraged to settle.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
But as of right now...

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Can you imagine what would have happened to that nameless puzzle game that Paris Hilton was, you know, putting out?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
If Paris Hilton had backed out.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Like, it may have sold more copies.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sagra.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Okay, other stuff.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Well, for people who are like me, Hatsune Miku fans, there is a crystal white Vita coming out that's coming with the Hatsune Miku limited edition.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It's a crystal white Vita with an exclusive rear touch design that has Miku on it.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000
And it will be shipped on August 30th with the next Project Diva game.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So, that's pretty neat.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And then, there's new download content for Dance Central.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Sorry, Dance Central 2.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.000
That will be the Spice Girls spice up your life.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Fuck yeah!

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And then, Hello Good Morning by Diddy Dirty Money.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest and Florida's Low.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Who cares?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And then, moving on, Marvel's Avengers Battle for Earth will be on Kinect and Wii U, Ubisoft.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:01.000
So, it's well interesting. It's actually being done by Ubisoft Quebec.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And you use the motion controls to fight off the scroll.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Yay.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
That's it.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
You know, the whole game idea sounded cool until they mentioned Kinect.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And it's just like, eh, it's not going to be very good.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I think they're probably going to base it off their Kinect Heroes game or something that they had. Remember that?

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Where it's like, you're superheroes and you get to fight each other and it's fun with Kinect.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And then, it didn't sell.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It doesn't say.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Hey, Jamie.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
You're having a good time.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I didn't know she'd feel fine.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
You know they're going to make you do that too.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Exactly.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Hey, let's go to Foogle.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
We combine Facebook and Google Plus and we get Foogle.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And that's where we ask you a question every week of our listeners.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And we read your answers live on air.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Alright, so we're going to get to a story here about this $99 Xbox here shortly.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So our question is, how would you feel if the Xbox Next 720 lube, whatever we're calling it, cost $499,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:34.000
but had a subsidized $299 option for a several year Xbox Gold commitment?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is something we hypothesized last week when the story first got brought up.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Assuming the specs are all top of the line, is the subsidized console something you would consider buying?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Why or why not?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So would you buy a subsidized next gen console, assuming it's all the top of the line features you want,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
say they knock $200 off the price, you know, for a two or three year commitment for Xbox Gold.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Would you do it?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
It would not be that different from what they do for the iPhones, right?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
No, I would not.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
No you would not, you say?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
No, I said no I would not and no I would not.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
No you would not. Why wouldn't you?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I wouldn't because I've learned well enough from buying in at launches of all these different consoles and stuff

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000
A lot of launch titles aren't that great, and you're gonna deal with all the launch bugs and all that fun stuff,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:27.000
so if I'm interested in buying a console like that, I'm just gonna save up the money that's required to buy outright to begin with.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Because who knows, if it takes you a long time to save up money, like say for example, you know, $499,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000
are you really gonna tell me that within two years time that console isn't gonna drop in price?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It's gonna fucking drop in price, and you're still paying fucking money for it.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Alright, well let's get to some answers from Google Plus first, we have AJ on Google Plus says,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I wouldn't mind, sounds like a good deal.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's like buying a cell phone for the discounted price in a two year agreement.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Would you really want to buy an Xbox and not want to use it online?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Going to some of the Facebook answers,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Tiara W, we love Tiara from Geek Life, geek-life.com says,

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
It would need to be more than just the basic model to make it worth the money.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
The $99 360 sounded like a good deal, even with the extra $5 a month for the gold subscription,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
until I heard it was for the 4GB console.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I can't even put most of my saved games on that little space, let alone save any games to my hard drive.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Doug T says, I won't be considering buying the next Xbox console system until it is out for at least a year.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I lost faith with Microsoft due to the Xbox 360 having so many red rings,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
and Microsoft's slow response time to correct the issue and help people out who experienced it.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Very interesting perspective from Doug, somewhat similar to what you said, a little bit.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Well, it's just, you know, if I'm going to be that strapped for cash,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
which I always find a way to buy those consoles at launch because I get excited about it,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000
but let's just say, you know, I'm strapped for cash and I just can't buy it at launch,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I don't think it's going to be that horrible.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I mean, I've got a console that I'm playing tons of games on.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
It's just, you know, not even necessary.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I mean, they're not going to repeat themselves with the whole red ring of death thing.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I mean, they're not that dumb.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And technology's gotten a lot better now.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I mean, the chips are on, you know, we've got like 20nm chips now that run way cooler,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
way more power efficient and stuff like that.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So overheating isn't as big of a problem anymore,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
and I think that they know that they don't want to do that again

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:36.000
because they're just going to lose all sorts of trust in their consumers if they fuck it up again.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So, I mean, I don't think that's really an issue, but if it's going to be that expensive, though,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I just have to see what my options are.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And if there's really something at launch that I have to, have to, have to have,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
which I don't really know if there's going to be anything at launch that I really, really need.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'll just have to wait and see what they have and also what it's going to cost

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
and if it's something that I can wait, I can wait and purchase it later on,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
when it goes on sale or when, you know, within a couple years time,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
you're not going to tell me that you're going to be able to find a used cop,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
a used system or something like that.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
There's ways to get it cheaper and having to, you know,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
since you're going to be stuck in a contract for multiple years,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
why would you do that when there's an opportunity to either save up money

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
or you just wait for the drop in price.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Alright, well, let's check out some different answers.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Peter Uno in our chat room says to, not chat, but Facebook says,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
to be perfectly honest, fuck yes.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
If you get a lot of use out of Xbox Live,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
then it's definitely worth taking the discount on the console.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You do end up paying less overall.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
It only works if you get a lot of use out of your console and subscription though.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And yeah, the console in question had better be semi-decent too.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But you're not saving money though.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You're spending $40 more than you would have paid separately.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Well, you know, it would, you know, we, it's,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
we're making up a hypothetical situation so we don't really know.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And to be honest, Dart Charger replied and said,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
having the option, this is a very sensible answer by the way,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
having the option for a subsidized version doesn't bother me,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
though I would almost always opt for the one-time fee.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
The actual value will all depend on the games and features of the unit

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
along with hopefully better reliability on launch.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That's a very sensible answer.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I pretty much agree with that.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
One more answer from Chiggers we'll read here.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I say it depends on how much the monthly gold subscription is.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
If that amount times however many months the commitment is,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
rather than what it would be if I bought the damn thing straight up,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
then I say, fuck you.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
If I don't save any money by doing it that way, then why bother?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
There you go.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
If I didn't read your answer, sorry about that.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
We had a lot of answers.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
But send those via email if you feel strongly.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And I mean, and if they, if the problem is,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
they got to know what the other company is doing

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
because if they come out and say, okay, our system is $499.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You can get it for $299 and blah, blah, blah.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
And Sony's like, well, our system just costs $299, so.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I have to admit going into that question,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I kind of assumed I would be in the camp of, yes,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I would just go ahead and do it because I'm going to get the system anyway

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
and I have Xbox anyway.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000
But I kind of think Doug's answer was right on the money because, you know,

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I did rush out and buy an Xbox 360.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I was tracking what Best Buy in the area actually had it.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I remember when they were so hard to get when they first came out.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Oh, yeah.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And then I finally was able to get one,

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
but it was the one without the hard drive,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
so I had to buy the hard drive separately and ended up paying like $40 more.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And then the fucking thing died on me after a week.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I was so mad.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Mine didn't die after a week, but yeah, I remember doing that.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So irritating.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Got mine on Craigslist.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Yeah.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Anyway, let's get back into some more gaming news.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Thank you to everybody who answered the Google question,

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
whether I read it or not.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
All right.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Well, let's talk a little bit about, you know, this $99 Xbox.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Of course, it was rumored last week and it ended up being true.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
So Microsoft stores are offering it for $99.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Of course, there's a two-year contract

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
and you're going to pay $14.99 a month for those two years,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
so it ends up being about $460,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
which is roughly $40 more than you would have paid separately.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
But if that's what you want to do, then you could do that.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
However, it is only through the Microsoft stores.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You know, remember, Microsoft has actual physical retail stores,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
21 of them in the United States,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
and those are the only ones that are offering said deal.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And now, the thing is, this is supposed to be part of a pilot program,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000
so the whole conspiracy theory that, you know,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
this may be happening for the next system is not that unwarranted.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
They're also saying that, right now, I guess,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
oh, 16 of the Microsoft stores are offering this.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I thought it was 21. Maybe some of those are out of country.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I bet you're right. I bet some of them are out of country.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It must be. I just looked that up real quick.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I seriously think the closest one to us is in, like, Phoenix,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
or maybe there's one in L.A.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
There is one in L.A.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Yeah, but none in Northern California.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Bay Area, there's one.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Is there really one in the Bay Area?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Yeah.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Cupertino, I think, has one.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
How ironic.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
In their mall.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I've been to that mall.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yeah, I think there's one down there, but that's a close one.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It was probably about 12 years ago, but I've been to that mall.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So, I mean, this, yeah, it could very well happen with the next console.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I think that's what they're testing out.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
They're seeing a response from this.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
If that's the case, then they may move forward with, you know,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
GameStop doing something like this, or, you know, the retailer.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I don't know.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Why not Best Buy or something?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
They could.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Because they sell the mobile phones.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I think, if anything, Best Buy would be a good choice,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
because, yeah, they do the whole mobile phone stuff.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Even, like, Walmart or something like that, they do mobile phones

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and that kind of, you know, service.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Hell, I mean, I don't know.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
You could get some sort of partner deal with, like, AT&T or something.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Who knows?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
All right.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Well, a lot of stuff going on in the handheld world in regards to price drops.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
The price of the DS has dropped.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Nope, I'm not talking about the 3DS.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I'm talking about the DSi.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
For some weird reason, for the longest time, the DSi and the DSi XL

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
had still retained their old prices.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
It cost just as much for a DSi XL as it did for a 3DS.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I know because Alan wanted one for his birth, or, no, for Christmas,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and I bought him one.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I was like, you want a DSi XL and not a 3DS?

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
But, I mean, the screens on those things really are gorgeous,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
so I wish they would make a 3DS XL.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I shouldn't say that.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Your wish has been granted.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Shit.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Here at E3, we will announce more shit like,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
hey, you know, we really should have put second analog stick on there.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Oops.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
But, hey, you can buy this new system in fancy colors that you want.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Get it for only $99 when you agree to buy 1,000 Nintendo points a month.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
All right.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
DSi is dropping to $100, and the DSi XL is dropping to $130.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Those prices are effective May 20th, so I wouldn't go buy one now.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But, you know, that's not a bad deal for a DSi, 100 bucks.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
They are still pretty good systems.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But, I don't know, I kind of think if you're going to invest,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
you might as well kick it up to the 3DS,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
but maybe you really want something to play your advanced games on.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
But the DSi XL is still a pretty good deal.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
That's a $50 price drop, by the way.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It was $170, now it's going to be one.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Oh, I take that back, $40, because it's going to be $129.99,

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
which is basically $130.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
So, there you go.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Apparently, I think there will also be.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Oh, this is all happening the same day as the launch of the purple 3DS.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
So, lots of Nintendo handheld stuff all happening in one day.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
The Aqua Blue 3DS, on the other hand, it is being discontinued in Japan.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Now, don't feel too bad for it,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
because there's already all these other colors in Japan, including black,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
and I think there's another shade of blue available in Japan, too,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
like the more regular blue.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
But it is kind of interesting that they're getting rid of one of the colors completely, I guess,

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000
especially one of the launch colors, but interesting.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Maybe it just wasn't selling very well.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Black Wolf in our chat room says,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Why did you buy Alan what he wanted? You should have gotten him what he should have wanted.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I really should do that next time.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Although, he was standing with me in the store, and I was like,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
All right, what do you want for Christmas? Pick something.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
He's like, I want a DSi XL. Really?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
You answered incorrectly.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Zonk!

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.000
You chose poorly. You will now disintegrate.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Not all the news is about the 3DS, though.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
There's also news about the Vita's in regards to how many they've sold.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000
1.8 million Vitas sold worldwide.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That's not bad.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
That's not bad.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:00.000
That's, what, 600,000 since late February when they last reported their sales figures, which is 1.2 million.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
That's not bad.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000
It's not incredible, but it's not like the system's dead.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I don't know.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.000
All right. Let's go ahead and move on to the mailbag.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And we'll choose some of your emails to read here live on air.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
A few of them.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I will start at the beginning. We only had three.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
One day and 15 hours left. I've been waiting 10 years for this.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I thought about taking a day off to play, but I can't justify the loss of income.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I'm hoping it's a rainy weekend.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Diablo and Rain go together.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
To pass the time until the release, I'm playing Dead Space 2, which I bought on Steam sale about six months ago.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I play at night with my headphones on and a candle lit.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
My wife gets a kick out of hearing me yell like a girl.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
It's probably the scariest game I've ever played.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Any of you play it?

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I'm like Rob with game ADD, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Plus, I heard that the end boss is mind-blowing.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
See you at the Skeleton King, mysterious turtle. Love the vlog network, kiddos.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I have not played Dead Space 2, but I've heard that it's super scary.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Somebody else starts to ask, acidic vampire in chatroom says, excellent game.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So you have one supporter there in the chatroom, at least.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I will be on board with the Diablo 3 train.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I'll be choo-chooing along too.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Yeah, it helps when the Warcraft addicts are all getting it for free.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I know, right?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Next email.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Hey, OLR. Specifically, I should be addressing both Rob and Shane.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
What's up with your taste in men? Kaiden is not that fabulous.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Get off my show.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I ended up taking Ashley on to Mass Effect 2 instead of Kaiden.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I've yet to play 3.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I just feel like there are much better fish in the galaxy.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Also, Shane needs to call in more.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Hearing him always makes me giggle, and he's always got something interesting to say,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
even if it's just to call in and say hello with no particular topic in mind.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
A show without a call from him just isn't complete for me heart, heart, heart.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Shane has a stalker fan.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Don't inflate his ego, for God's sake.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And you're especially not going to score points.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Can I finish reading, Rob?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000
No, you're not going to score points when you're dogging on Kaiden.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Yes, there's all kinds of homo all up in this email. Deal with it.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I love you all, Ospher.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I love DarkTetsuya. Gay hate mail. Is this a first on OLR?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Sadly, no. I don't think it is.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
This last one is a link, and I'm afraid to follow it.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Alright.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You're here because one of your friends has invited you. Page loading, please wait.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Uh, no.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I will say this.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Thank you for spamming us, listener.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Ash does have some great scenes in Mass Effect 3.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
She gets fucking smashed.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Well, see, I'll probably take her, because I'm going for full-on lesbian.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Doesn't that? She's not a lesbian romance option, sadly.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Oh, she might be in 3. I don't think she is, though.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
That makes my heart hurt.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Oh, there's plenty of people you can lez up with, if you want.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
That's awesome.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Aliens, and I will say, I will say this.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Because that was totally me in Dragon Age 2.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
There is a, I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
there is a very hot, hot woman, a woman of color, in Part 3,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
that is, she is only a lesbian option.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Nice.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And there's a shower scene, that's all I'm going to say.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Okay.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Good times.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Okay. Need.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And AcidicVampire confirms she doesn't go lesbian.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
That's alright. Save yourself for, uh, I guess I can say, save yourself for trainer.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
It's hot.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Alright.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Moving on.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Uh, let's get to the FUs of the Week.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
That was it for emails, huh? You got a spam email?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Uh, yeah.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Alright.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
And good thing I'm on Linux, because they don't make viruses for Linux, really.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the Week.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Every week we get ranty.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Um, FU.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I have a few, actually, because I'm tired and sore and bitchy.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000
So, FU, as much fun as the Komen walk was, I didn't say that I did that on the show yet, did I?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
No.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I did the, um, the Komen walk for breast cancer yesterday.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And, um, apparently since I've started wearing Vibram five fingers, and before I was wearing shape-ups, my stride has changed.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I found out that I used to walk on the outsides of my feet.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So when I put on my old shape-ups, because my heel pads for my Vibrams wore out, um, I'm walking.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000
First of all, we've had to park away from the start of the walk, so walk a mile and a half to the, no, a mile to the start.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Walk the three and a half miles for the walk.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Walk another half a mile to get to the convention center.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Walking all over the place there and walking back, I have blisters in places on my feet that I've never had blisters before.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I have one on the outside of my big toe, and of course I've got the requisite one on my right heel,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000
which is, um, probably another quarter bigger than a half dollar if anyone remembers what those look like and how big they are.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And then I have one on my left foot on the bottom of my, uh, next to pinky toe.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.000
It's just bizarre, and they're annoying and they hurt.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And then, um, I woke up this morning in so much pain.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Because I pretty much walked about eight hours, eight, not eight hours, um, eight miles continuously over the course of, uh, two and a half hours.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
So, which isn't bad, but, you know.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And so I was just in all kinds of pain, and thankfully my husband let me sleep in this morning.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Dan is, and he woke me up by screaming from the kitchen,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Omelette du fromage! So that woke me up. I woke up to omelette du fromage.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:29.000
And, um, I've been soaring grumpy all day, and I've been sort of snapping at people because I've been too tired to articulate properly exactly what it is that I want to say.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:37.000
The other one goes towards me losing my voice, um, which is now going on two weeks and all the signage drainage.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And then I'm just hoping that all of this crap is cleared up by the time I go to Disneyland, because I want to go out and have a good time.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So, uh, also, um, F.U. to, uh, Vibram speed for being way too expensive for me to get before Disneyland.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Marathon F.U. segment. Loki?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Um, I guess F.U. to my throat being sore.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000
It's really annoying. I hate sore throats. Scratchy.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I tried honey. It worked for like a minute.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
No, that's alright. I don't want anything.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000
F.U. to the fact that I've been sick for like five, I'm sorry, were you done?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I'm done.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000
F.U. to the fact that I've been sick since like Thursday, and it sucks, and I've missed some important stuff because of it.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And what also pisses me off, I've really been sick since Wednesday, I skipped work on Thursday and stayed home.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Friday I went back to work because I had something really important, I really wanted to get done, and I was feeling a little better.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
But I think because I exerted myself too much, I was really sick again yesterday.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I'm feeling a little better today, and I'm hoping by the time I wake up tomorrow I'm all better.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:50.000
So I haven't taken my pills, and it's time to take my pills, and I'm doing alright, I'm making it through the show.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And I'm not as super congested, but just, ugh, go away. Be healed.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And also F.U. to the fact that our stream apparently went down about five minutes ago and caused a bunch of people to disconnect.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Because that's never good for retaining your listeners, so I hate when the server fucking burps like that.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Argh.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Alright. Anyhow.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
That's really it for the F.U.s for me.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Listless is coming up very, very, very soon, but first, a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Oh, actually, this next one's a doozy.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Loki has a bunch of stories about Kickstarter, right?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Let's talk about Kickstarter.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
This is a new segment we're gonna call Give Us All Your Money.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And we even have an appropriate theme song for this.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Of course.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the latest Kickstarter campaigns, because I have a feeling this is not gonna go away anytime soon.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Kickstarter, the place where you can kickstart any franchise that may or may not need to be kickstarted, or you may or may not want kickstarted.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Can it kickstart my heart?

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Random amount of money? Yes.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Battle Chess.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:04.000
They're doing a remake for that, which I was completely unaware of, and I thought that series had died off, but oh no, they want to come back.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
And they're going to Kickstarter to fund multiplayer.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And, yeah, they're looking for $100,000 for an online experience that includes skill-based matchmaking statistics and leaderboards, achievements, and in-game chat.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And they're $12,000 with 18 days to go, they're probably not gonna make it.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I like Battle Chess.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Too bad.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
That was the one where the queen would like flat out chop off someone's head, right?

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Yeah, that was awesome.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You might be able to get behind something like this. Two guys from Andromeda, SpaceVenture.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:44.000
It's the guys that created Space Quest, they're doing a new adventure game, and it looks pretty cool.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And they've got some really popular voice actors, including the original narrator, Gary Owens.

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Rob Paulson, who you may not know by name, but he voiced some of the characters from Animaniacs, as well as other things, including Pinky.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.000
And then, of course, Ellen McLean, who you may recognize as GLaDOS.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I know her from Opera.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
But she will be in there as well.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
You make it sound like you don't know her as GLaDOS.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Chances of this one succeeding, probably pretty good.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:32.000
They have 30 days left and they're already at almost $150,000.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Looks pretty good.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Carmageddon is trying to come back. They have a Carmageddon reincarnation, which looks terrible. I've got to be honest, man.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000
It's a remake of the original game. I mean, I would think if you want to kickstart something, you should do like a brand new game.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
But anyways, they're doing that, and yay.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Probably it's going to get funded. They're already at $225,000 of the $400,000 that they need.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I'm killing the music. The segment's going on too long.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Sorry, I'm trying to be quick.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Another one, Redux, which is a sequel to a game called Ducks, which is a 2009 shooter that came out in the Dreamcast.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000
And now they're doing one, they want to do this new game for the Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Steam.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And they need $25,000, which, that's reasonable for a game.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000
They're definitely going to hit it. They're already at almost $24,000, and they've got 25 days to go.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
And there's all sorts of neat rewards for that.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I mean, if you're a fan of shooters, it might be some of them throw your money at it, I guess.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And then, last but not least, this one's kind of interesting.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Jason Rohrer, I hope that's Rohrer, I guess, he is putting out a game called Diamond Trust of London.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
It's actually a DS game. It's going to be a retail DS game. He has the game done.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
He just needs the money now to make the cartridges.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Apparently Nintendo has all these, you know, limits or minimums and stuff, and they need $78,000 in order to make,

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I think it's like, I don't remember how many cartridges they're making, a thousand cartridges, if not more.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:28.000
They're already at $53,000 of the $78,000, just over $78,000.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
They've got 12 days to go. It may not happen.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.000
And Diamond Trust of London is kind of like a strategy game, where it has to do with diamond trading.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
That was, I don't know, it sounded pretty interesting. I actually watched a little video for it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Not my type of game, so obviously not something I'm going to buy.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:55.000
He's done a few other games, too, as well. A lot of the browser games, I can't remember what he's worked on.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
But you would recognize him if you saw him.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
So, that's it. That's for the stuff that's on Kickstarter right now. That's notable, I guess.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
There's actually a cracked article about six amazing indie video games that are made possible through Kickstarter.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And the first one is Double Fight Adventure, for number six. Number five is Auditorium Duet, which I haven't heard of.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
It's a music game.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Yeah, I've heard of that.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Music game and shooter.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Sounds like Beat Hazard, which was a great game.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:39.000
FTL, which doesn't look very interesting to me, but okay.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I have to go to the next page now.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Oh, come on. I just thought it was neat because it's kind of related.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
We've poo-pooed on Kickstarters and I honestly still don't like them. I don't trust them.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I don't trust them.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:03.000
There was one dark side of Kickstarter last week where the people had stolen the art from DeviantArt or what have you.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:12.000
There's a few, actually. One of the first ones I put money towards, Video Game High School had their first episode this week.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
It was actually pretty cool. I'm digging that.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:24.000
It's a neat little web series that they've got going on right now about this high school that basically recruits people that play video games.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
It's like video games have taken over the world type thing. It's really cool.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So anyways, that guy, he did Passage, which was kind of a browser game that was popular. It was very minimalistic.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Between was another one that he did. Sleep is Death, Inside a Starfield Sky, and then he has this new one.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But a lot of stuff that's been covered in gaming blogs and stuff like that.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Alright, well if that website ain't working...

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
It's not loading.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Alright, that's alright. Let's move on. Anyhow, we have a list list coming up here and it's going to relate a little bit to this story, so pay attention.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:06.000
There are rumors circulating that Tadashi Sugiyama, and if you don't know that name, he directed a Mario Kart game, Pilotwings, and F-Zero.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.000
He's apparently working on a Wii U game, which is supposed to be revealed at E3 next month.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And apparently it's one that has not been spoiled in this whole early list or whatever that leaked.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000
That was all speculated titles. None of those were actually official.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I see. So we'll add this to the list of speculation now, because apparently he is working on a game that's going to be revealed at E3 next month.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:40.000
No hints on what it is, but if you consider that he has worked in the past on Mario Kart, which has been on the 3DS, Pilotwings, which has been on the 3DS, and F-Zero...

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
One of those looks really like me.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:49.000
It could be a new IP, granted, or maybe he's been put on one of the other Nintendo IPs.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:57.000
But, that fanboy in me is still a little excited at the possibilities, right? Am I right? Am I right?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
That would be awesome. It would be awesome.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I mean, the last F-Zero game was pretty awesome.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Yes!

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
It was just a long time ago.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
It's just that the arcade version was surprisingly leaked.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Here's the thing. Nintendo, sometimes they have really brilliant things that come out, and sometimes they have really, like, just lazy, lazily put together projects that they put out.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Like, the whole F-Zero thing with interaction with the arcade, where you can unlock the arcade tracks at home by playing at the arcade.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Or you can take your cars that you make, or your ships that you make to the arcade.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
That was amazing! That was fucking awesome!

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000
And then they just rehash Animal Crossing again.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
You know, it's just like, I don't know.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Sometimes I just wonder.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I think that all comes down to, it's different development teams.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Some people have it, some people don't.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Some people just, you know, do what they can to get on by.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Sorry, I got slowed up in the chatroom here, and it, um, it's screwing me up here, because I really wanted the chatroom for this next segment.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Oh, did we lose stream again, too?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I'm not seeing anything from the chatroom.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I think we pinged out. You might want to reload chat.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Okay.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Fantastic.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000
The joys and fun of live radio, everybody. What can you do? Alright.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Anyhow, we're gonna move into the next segment tonight called Listless!

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
We have lots of theme songs tonight.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Listless is where we are going to come up with the definitive list, definitive fanboy list on a particular topic.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
You guys in our chatroom are gonna help us out by voting for your favorites.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Let me remind you how Listless works.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:53.000
We're gonna come up with a topic, and the topic for tonight I'll reveal in just a minute.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And then what you do on this topic is, oh, I'm sorry, you guys here in studio, and we'll have a surprise fourth guest on the phone here in a minute.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:08.000
What we're gonna do on the phone and in studio is come up with our top three answers for this topic.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
That's gonna leave us a list of 12.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:16.000
We will then all go around the room and eliminate one from the list, leaving us a list of eight.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.000
And then we will put it to a vote in our chatroom for their number one and number two answers.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.000
And after that, definitive process is done. That's it. This is the list. It's a done deal.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
There's no arguing. This is what the gamers demand.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Highly scientific, tested and trued over the past ten years. Am I right?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Yeah, you're right.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Here it is. Tonight's Listless topic.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Oh, actually, let me get our fourth person on the phone.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Sorry, the whole disconnection of the stream kind of screwed me up here.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It's Comcast.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Apparently.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Yeah, because we were having an issue, well, I was having an issue loading a page.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Stupids.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
All right, let's try to get our person on the line here.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Hey, is this Shane?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yeah, holy crap. You're allowed. I need to fix this.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Boo, surprise. Hey, it's Shane joining us from Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
which can be heard not on the VOG Network yet, but soon.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
www.hoardhouse.com.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
All about the World of Warcraft, right, Shane?

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
That's actually what I'm playing right now.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I'm playing the Mists of Pandaria beta because Male Panda's got new hairstyles,

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
so clearly I have to take it out for a test drive.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Wait a minute. You're not playing Mass Effect for a change?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I don't always play Mass Effect, just most of the time.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yes, you do. Why is it that on the Warcraft show, you're always playing Mass Effect,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
and now on the general gaming show, you're always playing Warcraft?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I don't understand.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Because...

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I don't always play Mass Effect, but when I do, it's with Kaiden.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Yeah, what? Oh my gosh. That letter, while it did inflate my ego,

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
how could you bash Kaiden?

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I have to say, we planned this long before we read that email tonight.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I had no idea that email was in there. That was a late-arriving email.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000
We already knew Shane was going to be our fourth person tonight for Listless,

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000
and then that email comes in, and here you are on the show five minutes later.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
What do you want to say to that emailer?

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Thank you for inflating my ego, but you're wrong about Kaiden,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
so it's like, I don't know. I just can't talk to you.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
All right. You ready to play Listless with us tonight, Shane?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
As long as it doesn't get in the way of playing World of Warcraft, yes.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
We'll do our best. All right.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So here's the topic for tonight, because everybody's dying to know.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Here's the topic for tonight, E3 Wii U announcement

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000
that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Now, chatters, if you want to give us your suggestions,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
you can start typing those in our chat room at vognetwork.com.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I can't guarantee we're going to use your answers,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
but if one of us ends up having an answer stolen by another host or something,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
we tend to look to chat room for a little bit of help.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
So what do you think?

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:16.000
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Let's start with Shane. What is your number three answer?

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Okay. I'm going to have to try to explain this,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
because my writing it out, I didn't do a very good job.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
So my number three would be Nintendo announcing a new F-Zero game

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.000
utilizing the tablet controller as some sort of like future racing control dash thing

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.000
where you'd press the buttons on the screen to go and break and stuff,

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and then it would have a stand that you could tilt the controller with for tilt controls.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
How about we just say new F-Zero game?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
No, because you have to have the rest of that, or else it's just a crappy F-Zero game.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
How about new F-Zero with tilt control?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Well, it's probably good. It's a zero.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Summarize the tilt controls one more time.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000
It would be this mount you put the tablet on,

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.000
because it would be awkward to have the acceleration and break on the touchscreen

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.000
while you're trying to use the crappy controller with the analog nub stick or whatever.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
So it would be tilt controlled.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
So it would be like you're standing on a console.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I see it on Power Rangers all the time. That's where I got the idea.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
If it's good enough for Power Rangers, it's good enough for Shane.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Too bad. I shortened the answer to new F-Zero game.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Fine, whatever.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Loki, what's your number three pick?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
All these are going to be kind of similar, except for the last one.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.000
The first one is going to be a Mario Kart game with track editor.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
It's like ModNation Racers with Mario Kart.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Really, everyone wants anyways.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So ModNation Mario Kart, basically.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Something like that.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
ModNation is a really terrible name.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Mario Kart game with track editor.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
What character is most important to have in Mario Kart?

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Mario.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I mean, like, what would you want to play, mostly?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Like, as you know, there's a variety of characters that come in the games.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
They haven't put Samus in there. That'd be kind of funny.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
It would be funny. That's a good answer.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
All right.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Dark Sakura, your number three answer.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
A Mario Paint.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
A new Mario Paint.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yes.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Oh, that'd be awesome. Can I change my answer?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Only if it has the music mode in it.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
With the cat meow and the dog barks.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
It has to have the undo doggy, too.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
So if you make a mistake, you can click on his face.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Yes. All right.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
As long as undo doggy's there.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I can actually see that.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I mean, if they don't make a Mario Paint game, I mean, come on.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I agree.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
They're kind of dumb if they don't make a Mario part.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Mario.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I said Mario Party, but they'll probably make one of those, too.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
All right.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
My number three answer.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000
E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and preorder it that day.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
My virtual console games still work on it.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
OMG.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Because that won't happen.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:06.000
We all know.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
But it would be nice that all that money I invested on the Wii could, like,

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
somehow carry over to the Wii U and I could take that little tablet, like,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
into, you know, my bedroom and play before I go to bed and, you know.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Mm-hmm.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
All right.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Shane, your number two answer.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Nintendo announcing multiple colors of the system for launch,

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
especially a blue color.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Especially blue.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Especially blue.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Yes.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Multiple colors.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Oh, because I put multiple colors including blue,

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
but I'll put multiple colors especially blue.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
You could also put most importantly.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
That would work as well.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I can't spell.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Rob spiel's will.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
All right.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Aqua blue or navy blue or what?

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I will take either a midnight blue, a cobalt blue, or a metallic blue,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
but not aqua blue.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I support cobalt.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Loki, your number two answer.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:13.000
My number two answer, I just had something different too.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Oh, my number two answer would be that that tablet controller can actually

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
be used as a tablet.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Like, you know, you can take it as a portable system wherever you go,

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
although that wouldn't really fit in your pocket.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
But it would be nice, you know, get some more value out of it.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
There you go.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
So the tablet controller is actually a tablet and not reliant on being

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000
actually near a Wii U.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Yes.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
All right.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Fair enough.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
How would the tablet work in Pokemon Snap Wii U?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000
See, I would want, like, an augmented reality version.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Is that where you pick your balls?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
They could do that.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000
I think it has a camera on the tablet.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
That is true.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Jamie, you know that there's a 3DS application coming out for

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Black and White 2 that is Pokemon Snap augmented reality.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Well, I don't have a 3DS, so that doesn't sound good.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
You need one for it.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
It's Pokemon Snap.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Well, send me one, please.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I'm going to Disneyland.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
That's more important.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
All right.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
My number two answer.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
I bet I'm stealing Dark Sakura's number one answer right here,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
but I don't even care.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I don't think you are.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I don't even care.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
All right.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
My answer.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.000
You're not stealing my number one answer.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
But I'm sorry.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
It's a damn good answer.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
If they say, bam, Guardian Legends coming back, I'll be, like, preordered.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Done.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Sold.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Give me two.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
All right.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000
So far we have new F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
My virtual console games work.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Pokemon Snap Wii U and the Guardian Legend Wii U.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Let's get to the number one answers.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Shane.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Okay.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Okay.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
This is going to be a complete surprise to everybody.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Are you ready for it?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Mass Effect.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
What?

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
A new Mass Effect game.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
See?

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000
The tablet would have straps so you could strap it to your arm like an omni-tool, and

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
then it would have a control scheme similar to Metroid Prime.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.000
So you'd have awesome, you know, omni-tool stuff, and you would have a really good control

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
scheme.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And I don't care if it's four or whatever.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
I just would love that.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
You just need Mass Effect in your life somehow being brought together with you.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Yes.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Always.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Fair enough.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Fair enough.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
What a shocking answer from Shane.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
All right.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Number one answer.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Try not to be shocked, but Excite Truck 2.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
I would buy that system.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
What a shocking answer.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:54.000
But if there's one fucking minigame in that goddamn racing game, I will fucking burn that

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
console through the ground.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Is this an official bet?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
You will buy a Wii U and set it on fire if there's an Excite Truck 2?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
No, I will not waste my money.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
But like in my mind, I would, you know, that console deserves a burn.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I would imagine really hard and hope you were pyrokinetic.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
All right.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000
All of my answers have been like legit and not smartassy.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
So, I said DJ Max Technica.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
That was going to be my number two.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Because, yeah.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
All right.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Yeah, I could see that.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And totally doable.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
And totally doable.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Mm-hmm.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Okay.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Or at least, at least, a game that's very similar to an Elite Beat Agent.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Like an Elite Beat Agent.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Yeah.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Yeah.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I would say an Elite Beat Agent's Technica style.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Do they have multi-touch on that thing?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Because I think it's supposed to be just like the DS screen.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000
I think it's just like a DS screen.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
It's not like an iPhone or anything like that.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Technica won't work.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I could make mine, oh, Shitataka and Olendon.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
You want to change it from Technica to EBA?

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Well, you know, that type of game.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
How about Technica or EBA?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Okay.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Well, just honestly, I liked Olendon better than EBA because I thought the cheerleaders

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000
were funny.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
All right.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Well, look at all these serious answers here.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
My answer is very serious.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
My number one answer is very serious.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And it is a very practical use of the Wii U technology.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000
You can have one thing on the television and you can have one thing on the tablet that

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
sits on your pants.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Okay?

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
So my number one answer for my number one game I won.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
You mean like using the GBA back in the day?

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Sort of.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000
My game that I want more than anything is called Porn on My Pants.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
And what happens is that on the TV screen, it looks like you're playing something really

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.000
cute and chibi, like you're playing like a new Pokemon game, but on your pants, porn.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
And whatever porn you could possibly imagine.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
You want straight porn?

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Fine.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
You want gay porn?

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
You want five people going at it at once?

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Fine.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Anything you're into is available through the various DLC.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Human Sent to Porn.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Human Sent to Porn, if that's what you're into, fine.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Midget Porn, go for it.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Do you know that old person porn is very popular in Japan now?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I don't care.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Alright, porn.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Porn.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Not in my version of Porn on My Pants.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
That shit will stay out.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Alright, so Porn on My Pants is my number one answer.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Alright.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Here we get to the very hard part of Listless.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
You said hard right after you talked about porn.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:22.000
It's just a necessary part of the game that we play here.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.000
By the way, let me read some of the answers from chat because there were some great answers

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
from chat here.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Tiger Clawed.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Nyan Cat the Game.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Act Def'd.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Mass Effect.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Weeology.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Act Def'd said Steam Integration on the Wii U.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Act Def'd President Cat Wii U.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Black Wolf Mother Wii U.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Raginator, a limited edition ABBA and Rocky Horror themed console.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000
SSJ-100 Matt, Goat Say Me for Wii U.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
SSJ-100 Matt, Ultra Kade Wii U.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Raginator, Sky Barbie Horse Adventures Wii U edition is the pack in game.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
World of Warcraft Wii U is Act Def'd.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Frisbee says Dreamcast 2.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Going back to an old Listless, but unfortunately none of those answers made the list tonight.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
One of my other considerations, Rob, was a boob game.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000
There you go.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Bobby also says automatically allocates 1 million sales of Eye of Judgment.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I'm afraid that that will never happen.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Yeah, actually the bet was officially closed a couple years ago, too.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
It's just, they're not making it anymore.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Very sad.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Alright, so here we go.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Here we go.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Now's the time where we're going to go around and eliminate one answer from the list.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
And the list as it stands right now.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
New F-Zero game.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Mario Kart Wii with track editor.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Or, excuse me, Mario Kart with track editor.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
New Mario Paint.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
My virtual console games work.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Excite Truck 2.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
DJ Max Technica or EBA.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
And porn on my pants.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Shane, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Because I don't think Nintendo would get it right.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Porn on my pants.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000
I knew you would erase that, you ass.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:12.000
But, Nintendo doesn't know how to make anything mature.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Ever.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:20.000
So, would you want something so terrible as to taint the name porn on my pants?

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:27.000
It could be their breakthrough hit.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Right.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I just don't have faith.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I'm sorry.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000
It is stricken from the list and I'm mad at you forever.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Alright.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Because it's something that they could really just include into a new Pokemon game.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Which they're doing apparently.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Yeah.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Alright, it is stricken from the list, unfortunately, for Dark Soccer.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
But, Dark Soccer, here's your chance for revenge.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I'm above revenge, Rob.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
What are you talking about?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Excite Truck 2.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Because I didn't give a shit about Excite Truck 1 and that's not enough to make me buy one.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
That's because you never played it.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I played it.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I didn't care for it.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Alright, let's see.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Then, to be fair, I need to get rid of one of Shane's answers here.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Ooh!

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I'm getting rid of multiple colors, especially blue.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Oh, come on!

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Because I actually like the rest of the answers.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000
And, I'm sorry, we need a purple.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
You know I might get the purple one for my birthday because I can't tell the difference

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
between the color.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
So I'll trade in my aqua blue one for that one.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
It's gonna be awesome.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Alright, so we have narrowed down the list for your voting pleasure.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Here's a recap and you guys can place your votes.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom at vognetwork.com, type slash MSG space SKIE,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000
my name's Sky, and your vote, your number one and your number two answers.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Here is the list that you can pick from.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.000
New F-Zero game.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Mario Kart with track editor.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
New Mario Paint.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
My virtual console games work.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And DJ Max Technica or EBA.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
There it is.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000
We will tally up your votes and have those real soon.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
A little later on when we start taking calls.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So that's it.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Shane, anything else you want to talk to us about or say before we let you go?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I don't know.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Probably not.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Alright, well then I guess have fun with pandas.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I will.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Goodbye.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Alright, bye.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Well that should make Shane's one fan very happy that he was there on the show.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Playing listless with us.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Black Wolf is accusing us, by the way, of not enough lols tonight in the match game segment.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Not enough lols.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
We did not bring the lols tonight.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Sorry to hear that.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Well you know what?

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
We can't be funny all the time.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I spend a lot of my funny.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
But Loki's funny looking all the time.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
That's true.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Kind of Amish.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I don't know.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I think he looks kind of Amish.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
A little bit maybe.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000
We need to get you a black hat and some buttons.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Alright, let's do a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Then we're going to get to the Skype line and we'll get to the results of listless as well.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Dark Sakura I think we're on right now.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Well, it's just a big pile of shit.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:21.000
The court in Holland has ordered that a particular Pirate Bay supporter stop publicizing a work around for the ban that was there.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
It's called the Dutch Pirate Party.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000
They've been publicizing ways to circumvent the ban on Pirate Bay.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:38.000
And as reported by the BBC, the judge also said that it ceased offering a proxy service so that Dutch Pirate Bay users could access the torrents without having to link the site.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I mean, not really surprising that they try to stop it.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000
But it's more and more people finding a way.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.000
But honestly people could find a way around it on their own if they were creative.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Also, the group's UK branch is actually offering more of a proxy for the country-wide ISP block.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So, that's it.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:13.000
The party's campaign officer actually said that they received 2 million hits in over 24 hours.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And, of course, the legal campaign in the UK is being spearheaded by the British Phonographic Institute.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
That's old school there.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Phonographic.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Phonograph.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
And then here's something really funny.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:43.000
So, people that play Battlefield 3 are having issues finding servers to actually play their game on.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
You know how you pay those online passes and then you can't connect to a game?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Fan-fucking-tastic.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.000
And so, what's ending up happening is apparently you remember that they announced that you can rent servers from EA.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Well, apparently the rentals have been so popular that there's not enough servers to go around anymore.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Because being smart and having a certain amount of servers available to regular players versus opening up tons of servers so that you can make more profit.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
You know, enjoyable experience versus profit.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
They went with profit.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000
So, apparently that's an issue.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And they're saying that, of course, they reserve a percentage of the servers for players who prefer to connect through dice-hosted servers.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
But they won't say what percent of that.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000
And they're also saying that a lot of the servers appear unavailable.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:28:00.000
In fact, some people are having trouble connecting to a server so long that it's taking them an hour to connect to a game without having to try to connect to one of these private servers which you may or may not get kicked from because it's a private server.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000
That kind of sucks. Money first.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I know, that's kind of weird.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:11.000
It's kind of like, sorry, you can't come here because we already rented it out for so-and-so's birthday party.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:20.000
For that guy who runs MegaUpload.com or whatever his name is, rented everything for his private parole party.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, they're saying that basically people are looking for just, you know, to play the regular game types without any sort of custom stuff.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000
And, you know, one guy's saying, I rarely got kicked from a dice server.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:38.000
And it says, you know, but once the rented servers bit took off, got kicked quite a bit.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:46.000
And it's damn near impossible to find an official server in that many of the rented servers features are games with server requirements.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I don't want to play Team Deathmatch to 500 kills or Conquest to 700 tickets.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
So, you know, they're basically saying, no, they're not shutting down servers.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:07.000
But, you know, if dice managed servers appear offline, it's because they've been rented and customized by players.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Custom servers have always been extremely popular at Battlefield PC players.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.000
With Battlefield 3, we introduced the custom server program to console gamers.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Response has been overwhelmingly positive.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:27.000
But just remember that when you're paying for your online pass for your used game that you're not going to necessarily get online.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.000
And you might have played Kid Icarus Uprising at this point on the 3DS.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And if you haven't, you really should, because it's a good game.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Except for the whole, your hand will cramp in 20 different ways.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:54.000
However, it's kind of sad to hear that they're not going to get a chance to redo the controls in a sequel.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
They will not be doing a sequel.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:06.000
The staff behind Project Sora, which is, you know, really the same people that made Super Smash Brothers, and the various versions, have said that they're not going to be doing a sequel.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Mashihiro Sakurai, who of course is the brains behind it, said, quote,

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
If by lasting universe you mean to ask if there's a sequel, the answer is no.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:23.000
We pushed a lot into the game in order to let people have this short yet deep experience, but the novelty of that would likely grow thin in the next game.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.000
For now, my thought is that perhaps we'll see someone else besides me make another Kid Icarus in another 25 years.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Yikes.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:38.000
At least they tried to make it so that they'd have a ton of replayability on it, but I'm sure they're busy with, you know, Smash Brothers.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Exactly. Exactly.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
So sadly, that will not be coming out any time soon.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Hey, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:54.000
The phones are open, so go ahead and give us a call if you want, and let us know your thoughts on tonight's news or anything else that you wanted to share.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:02.000
We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute, but first I was going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories, so I can tally up these last few listless votes that came in.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:12.000
This is kind of funny. Apparently they have a pre-order bonus for The Amazing Spider-Man coming out in June, where you can play as Stan Lee.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Like, actually as Stan Lee in the Spider-Man game. And of course he has, you know, some of the powers that Spider-Man has, and he is searching, or he's hunting down, I guess, script pages from his next movie or something.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
It's the one and only Rama.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Of course it is. How you doing, Rama?

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
I'm pretty good. Alive, but okay.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Should you not be alive? Did you have a weekend filled with devious things that could have got you killed?

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yes, it's called Staffia Convention, where I tweaked my knee.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Touché.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Yes. Or as I was saying at the end of the rave last night, I was raving like nobody else's business until I took a glow stick to the knee.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000
When will that meme die?

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Not anytime soon.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I did put that call out on Twitter as to what game should I play next now that I finally beat Mass Effect, and it looks like I'm gonna do Skyrim.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
No, don't.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
No, I have to. I bought it, and I really liked it.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000
It's one of those endless games, and poor Alan's gonna be a gamer widow. We can't have that.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Alan's been the one playing it.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:42.000
He's been the one playing. Okay, Alan got to the point where he beat every single quest in Skyrim, save for the ones that are automatically generated, and he knew which one those were.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
He beat them all.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Mmm.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:53.000
So, just saying, I ain't the widow. I mean, he ain't the widow. He should sympathize.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I just want to play the main quest. I don't want to do all the science stuff.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
For the record, I do have to say that I found one good surviving remnant of that meme.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
What?

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I was like, I used to think Hawkeye was useless, but then I took an arrow to the knee.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
That one was good.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So, Rama, what did you really call to talk to us about tonight?

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I want to talk about this Xbox 360 deal. It's just something I was thinking about that doesn't kind of make sense, but it kind of does, when you're trying to compare it in a way of, like, a subsidized cell phone.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Now, if you pay $200 for your smartphone, and you have to pay the bill every month, and if you happen to terminate the contract, you have to pay this fee.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Now, let's say you don't pay that bill for that month. They'll let you slide.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Second month, not so much. They cut the phone off, and the phone is rendered useless.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Right.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Now, with Microsoft, you pay $99, and you pay $15 a month.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Now, let's say you don't pay the bill for the first month. They let it slide.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:56.000
And you're paying the bill for the second month. What's going to happen?

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.000
You fire your 360. We already know that your live account is canceled.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
But what else is going to happen? Are you going to get a little pop-up to say that you can't play a console unless you pay the bill?

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Maybe. I mean, maybe the technology is not there yet, but it's something that they could implement for the next round of consoles.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I believe there is some type of $299 fee that you have to pay, or you have to pay some type of big fee for the early cancellation,

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:29.000
which basically amounts to the rest of the cost of the console on its own, plus the Kinect.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:37.000
And they would automatically charge it against whatever credit card they have on file for you, or send your ass to collections, for all I know.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Well, that I do see happening, but I'm just going to be amused at where people are going to start complaining where they forgot to pay the bill.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:52.000
You get this pop-up with your 360. You cannot play a console unless the bill isn't paid. Please call this number, you know.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Well, think about, you know what, this is somewhat modeled after, one could argue, and that is the Blizzard blood pact that came out at the end of last year.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000
If I were to suddenly stop paying my World of Warcraft bill, they would shut off my Diablo 3.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000
They can do that. You just shut it off.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Yeah, I can see Microsoft doing where they do this, and you activate your account, like a special extra software gets loaded onto your console where they actually monitor, where if you don't pay the bill, that happens.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:29.000
That sounds like one of those low credit cars, where it won't start if you haven't paid the bill.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Mm-hmm. It's scary, but the next round of consoles could have that technology if they decide to go with this. Of course, that's a big if, but we'll see.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000
And somewhere in the corporate offices of Rent-A-Center, they're going, why didn't we think of this?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Why didn't we think of this? That's alright, Rent-A-Center still gets to do the televisions and all the stuff that, you know, you have to play the video games on.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I had one of those. Did I tell you that?

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
No. You feel like sharing?

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Sure. I wish I still had it, but as a birthday gift when I was 12, me and my great-grandma went to Rent-A-Center. She bought me a 20-inch TV with a built-in Nintendo from Sharp Electronics.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
I didn't realize they ever made TVs with built-in Nintendos.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Yep.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Huh. Okay.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Man, I had it for years, but back in, I believe, 2005, I had to sit it out on the side because the tube went and I had paid to get it fixed like twice and it kept going out.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Wow. Alright.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Are you talking about the C1 NES TV?

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
What was that?

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
The C1 NES TV.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I believe so, yeah. And I think in Japan, Sharp actually had a Super Nintendo, a Super Famicom version of that as well.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
There was one.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.000
ActDeft in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says Kmart had them. You know what? Kmart probably still has them if you want to go check it out.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:59.000
If they did, I will buy one right now because the only place I saw them at the time was Rent-A-Center and where I lived, there was no Kmart.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I keep forgetting those places like Rent-A-Center exist.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I posted a link to that in the chatroom.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Oh my gosh. That's so cool. I never realized they made those.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Oh, mine was slightly different from that one. Mine was slightly different. It was taller. After the call, I'll find a link and I'll post it, but yeah.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:22.000
That's still pretty rad. Alright, Ramo, we ought to let you go so we can get some more calls. Take care, buddy. Okay?

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Ain't no problem. Take care.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Alright, bye. Any other last minute stories to cover? I do have a couple Twitter things I can do.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Chris Sharp made another thing called the Twin Famicom that came out in 1986, only released in Japan, and it's the combination of the Famicom and the disk system in one piece of hardware.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you need to get ahold of us that way. Anything else, Loki? Are we done with last minute stories? There's a bonus 25 minutes of Cave Johnson in the DLC for Portal 2.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Good lord, monologues or what? Yeah, pretty much. It's all stuff that they recorded, especially for that. It's brand new stuff.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Oh, wow. You can listen to it on YouTube. That's pretty cool that they got him back in to do that.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Yep.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Alright, going to a few tweets at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Eric RPG on Twitter sent us a tweet with a link from this game from the I Wanna Be the Guy dev.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Oh, I'd heard about this. This is like the Castlevania-esque game, isn't it? I'm looking at the link right now that he sent us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000
And I wanna say I heard about this.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I just found a Twin Famicom on eBay for 57 bucks.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
That right there is the trailer for Union High School.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.000
He sent us to a link. Oh, there it is. Right here. Here it is.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I don't know why, but the link he sent us didn't work and it sent me to the main page of Destructoid because he linked me to the story over there.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Oh, wow. That does look a lot like Castlevania. But that's what he's making. A Castlevania-esque platformer. It's called Brave Earth Prologue and it's an homage to old school Castlevania.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
We could use more homages to old school Castlevania, to be quite honest.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Or homages to, like, say, Guardian Legend.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Guardian Legend. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's a very 8-bit style game. That's pretty cool. It's gonna appear on Steam and other services for 5 bucks.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:21.000
That's a really good deal, actually. I'm liking the way that looks. Thank you for sharing that.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I will probably pick that up. You can't beat 5 bucks.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Alright, let's see. Going to Tiger. Oh, let's go to the phones. Phones are lighting up. Why not? Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Hey. Hey. Who's this?

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
This is Zaku.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Hey, Zaku.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I'm calling for my cell phone.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Are you calling for your cell phone?

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
I'm calling for my cell phone.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000
What's up?

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Nothing much. I guess I want to bring the fact that E3, the way we know E3, may not be the same this year.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000
What makes you say that?

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Hello?

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000
What makes you say that?

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Yeah. Well, because of the recent article that was published where the notable figures such as THQ, Nintendo, even Sega are not even present this year.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:25.000
So it's kind of like a scare piece in the sense that the lack of these developers are actually going to be a much more lackluster E3 this year.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Do you think a lot of developers are starting to realize, and publishers really, in this age of the internet and everything, maybe they don't need E3?

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I mean, I guess I probably beat this subject before, but mobile might be eating at some of these companies, like Nintendo in particular.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Well, and Facebook games.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Zinga's showing for the first time this year.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
What was that?

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Zinga's showing for the first time this year.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:12.000
I mean, most of their games, they're going to be all browser-based, but I guess it goes beyond what we typically expect from the developers and the folks that make console games.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.000
I guess it's kind of like branching out from the old guard.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:21.000
It's an evolutionary shift in gaming.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I don't think consoles will ever die out because there will always be a market for those AAA titles.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:33.000
However, you're going to see another emerging in the form of casual through either mobile or browser-based.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:49.000
So this is where, you're right, Zinga and any other smaller mobile publisher can make inroads due to the fact that these heavy hitter developers are no longer showing up this year or sitting out E3.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.000
We've been seeing that develop over the past few years where the casuals are, especially Facebook.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I think, yeah, Facebook and iOS games and Android really to an extent too are just the three that are really gaining steam and have almost made up what is this new platform of sorts.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
At least there are two new platforms really.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I would say Facebook and then mobile are just the platforms that now compete with the Vita and the 3DS.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Exactly. I remember mentioning this before, but in a couple of years, the next two to three years, you might actually have parity.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000
You're going to get to the point where they're going to converge.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Your Vita and your 3DS are going to converge against whatever Apple is offering, whatever is being offered, whatever high-end Android phone will still be out there.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And whatever other platform, you know, scales along.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:43:02.000
You know, if you're a parent out there looking to get a portable game console for your kid to shut them up on long car rides or whatever, you've got to admit, you put a Vita next to an iTouch, which is just the iPhone without the phone, and they're about the same price, and yet the games on one are 99 cents.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Right. And even then, it's like when you throw in the iPad in there, you let your kid use your iPad.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.000
That pretty much keeps them distracted at that point.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Ah, but Shadow Next Gen in our chatroom has a good point.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000
iOS games will never be as good as core games as long as they rely on those virtual controls.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Now, an 11-year-old probably doesn't care, but true for the college gamer and even high school gamer and so forth, they're going to care a little more.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Right. They are. That is true, but, you know, and the way I see it is this.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:49.000
In the next three years, physical buttons may not be as prevalent in any new platform, as long as they get the tactile feel down to it.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I know it's going to be a growing thing, but think about it.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.000
I mean, the next evolution besides hardware will have to be some sort of virtual control, something that isn't there, but you touch it and it does something.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:10.000
But it's a lot better. It's either on parity with the hardware button or has more of a natural feeling.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Zaku, before we let you go, what do you think will be the biggest shocker out of E3 this year?

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Well, I mean, we use definitely not in the cards. I'm thinking whatever Microsoft has up their sleeve.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And, yeah, not even Sony, I don't even think, because as I said, there isn't a lot of buzz going around of, you know, what actually might steal a show at E3.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:47.000
It could be some other browser-based developer. It could be a mobile developer creating something for multiple platforms that will create a hit.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Like Rovio, for example, they're trying to branch out beyond Angry Birds, create a new franchise.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:45:01.000
So, you know, that might be something as an example, but think if Microsoft might have something up their sleeve.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:07.000
I wouldn't put it past me that they're actually going to reveal the success to 360 or at least hate to it.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
We'll see. That's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but we'll see.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
All right, Zaku, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy, okay?

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
All right, have a good one.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.000
You got it. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to try and get through here in the last minute or so.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:28.000
One story I wanted to read real quick from Tigerclaw on Twitter. I missed this story earlier in the show, but GameStop apparently cutting down on PSP games.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:35.000
A quarter of the stores will no longer sell PSP games. Please note that's not the PlayStation Vita, that's PSP.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:41.000
So this shouldn't be too big of a surprise, as obviously the Vita is now rolling into probably a lot of that old shelf space.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Not really any more PSP games coming out anyways.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:49.000
That's right, so that's kind of on its way out. I would still think there'd be a demand for used games, somewhat.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Yeah, but it's going to be a lot smaller. They can shrink that down.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Right, and they didn't get rid of all the stores, just a quarter of them, so I imagine some of the little stores.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000
The bigger locations will still carry PSP games as well as the website GameStop.com.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:07.000
So chances are if the GameStop near you is small and doesn't have a lot of shelf space, they were probably one of the 25% that got rid of them.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Alright, it doesn't look like our phone line's lighting up, and it's getting to be about 9 o'clock here on the West Coast, so I'm going to go ahead and close that up.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.000
And we need to get to listless results. You guys ready for listless results? Because it was very interesting tonight.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Let's do it.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Let's get to them.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:34.000
We had quite the tie tonight. We have a two-way tie for first place in listless, and we have a two-way tie for what would essentially be third place.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Because, you know, when you have a two-way tie for first place, it's first and second, and then you have a two-way tie for third place.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
So you have the top four answers tonight.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Fun.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Alright, so here they are as voted by the listeners. Your number tied for number three, new F-Zero game, and new Mario Paint.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:06.000
There you go. Those are the number three things you most want to see on the new 3DS, or excuse me, the new Wii U that will make you go pre-order it that day.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
A new F-Zero game and a new Mario Paint.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Here is the number one answer. We had two answers tie for number one.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:19.000
The tablet controller is actually a tablet. Good luck with that, you guys.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
I know, it's like a never happens.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.000
And lastly, Mario Kart with track editor is number one.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Double win for more.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Look at that, a double win for Loki. Has that ever happened in the history of list? I don't know.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:39.000
So there it is. Number one tied, Mario Kart with track editor. Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.000
And number three tied, new F-Zero game and new Mario Paint. Crazy ties tonight.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:54.000
But the fans have spoken. Mario Kart, Mario Paint, F-Zero. Bring them. And a free tablet.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Well that is going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into this whole episode and staying with us, especially the live listeners who have stuck with us through all these disconnects all night.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.000
I really appreciate you guys staying with us. I don't know what's causing that.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.000
We'll have to see what we can do about next week, make sure all the porn torrents are off.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Let's go around and of course get everybody's final thought.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
We are done with last minute news, right?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Yes.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000
I forgot to ask if you had anything else.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.000
My final thought tonight is, I would like to be less Flemmy, please.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Four words. Robot, unicorn, attack, evolution.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Yes.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Oh dear.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Robot panda, or unit panda, uni-wolf, unit dragon.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Oh dear.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:53.000
All right. Thank you guys, all you guys that stayed up late with us listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We really appreciate it.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Hey, it's a free show. If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell a friend or tell a friend or two about our show.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Even your imaginary friend.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.000
That's right. Tell them too.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
And then tune in twice.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:08.000
And tell them also, not just about our show, but the VOG Network, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Lots of exciting stuff coming over the next few weeks.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Again, we don't have a big website or millions of dollars, you know, funding advertisements or whatever.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.000
We just have word of mouth and we appreciate every recommendation you guys give.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:25.000
iTunes reviews and website reviews and forum signatures and all that, those help a lot too.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Please spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and the VOG Network.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
That is too fucking cute.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000
What are you looking at?

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000
The panda. Robot panda attack.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Makes great radio, just saying.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
All right, have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you next week.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000
And again, happy Mother's Day to all the mommies.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.000
