Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, May 13th, 2012, the biggest software companies give financial updates,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the price drops on older DS models, and could internet browsing finally be coming to the Xbox?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 457 of our show for this May the 13th of 2012.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Say hello first off to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi world.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How are you doing?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm alright.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You sound a little better than last week, but not much.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, it's still the allergies. I'm feeling a lot better.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're sickly lounge radio tonight because actually, I don't know if you can really hear it, but I'm getting over what was a really bad, like, throaty cold.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't get me sick before I go to Disneyland.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, I'm hoping I'm way past that point because I was sick like Thursday, and if Alan didn't get sick, I don't think you guys are getting sick.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I have a sore throat.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you really?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll make you pay me in coffee.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, then maybe you did get sick from me a week ago somehow.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, then I don't know if I was sick or if it was allergies. I felt just fine.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Something's going around, I don't know, but yeah, I had a really bad sore throat.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was bad because I was trying to, well, usually on Warcraft on Thursdays and Fridays, I lead the raid, which basically means, you know, well, I mean, like, I just, I make it sound bigger than it is.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I basically am sitting there calling, you know, hold DPS, alright, attack the tentacle in the upper left, you know, or whatever it is.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But this week, I couldn't do it.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was like, Shane, you're going to need to do it because it happened this week because I sounded like this.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I sounded like a little boy because my throat hurts so much.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But thankfully, my voice is okay tonight and I can do a show for all you people out there listening to us on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I need to introduce, of course, the third host on our show, always here every week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hello.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How are you, Loki?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm fine.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Apparently, you're getting sick too. That's no good.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
These things happen.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah. Alright.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Also, of course, we do tape live on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our good pal Bobby Black Wolf over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the gamer mommies out there that listen.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know of too many for sure. I know of one, at least, that usually listens live.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe one other.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But, you know, even if you're not necessarily a gaming mom, you might be a mom figure in somebody else's life or maybe a mommy to your pets.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, happy Mother's Day to all who that saying would apply to.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
However, for all of you whose girl bits work, ugh.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you having an unhappy Mother's Day right now?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've been having a funk because, and, you know, I've been, Dan and I have been trying for like the last six years and I've been trying not to get excited every time I've had a little thing happen, but I've gotten excited and I've gotten super depressed.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sure.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, I just wanted everyone to shut up.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, I understand where you get like really-

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It also creeps me the fuck out when people use pictures of their children as their Facebook icons. I understand being proud of your child, but living through your child and using your child as your avatar is creepy as fuck.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, you might change an awful lot once you go through that experience.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I really don't think so. I've never used a picture of Shermie as my icon.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You should. Shermie's adorable.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She is adorable, but anytime I've ever used a picture of Shermie, I've been in it.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have an icon of Shermie on my LiveJournal where I have icons of me and a lot of other people from fandoms.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it's the picture of Shermie sitting in Mel B's lap.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This says another lap dominated by Shermie.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, we'll see. I'll keep this recording and someday it'll happen for you.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, remember, true story, my mom and dad didn't get knocked up till my mom was 37.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She finally had me.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In a row?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, in a row. She finally had me at 37.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
However, Julian has turned five and I have to tell you the funny Mother's Day story from yesterday.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sure, go ahead. Then we can talk about games.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay. I was at Becky's house and Julian runs in from the garage all excited and he hops up in Becky's lap.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He says, Mommy, Mommy, we got you flowers, but it's a surprise.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And we started laughing so hard.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, it's the kind of flowers.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't see it yet because it's a surprise.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And she's like, just know when it's a surprise, you're not supposed to tell me about it.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, the look on his face was funny.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's like, oh, you didn't know what kind of flowers.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That was the surprise.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It was just funny because he's like, I can't show you.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is a surprise.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And just the way he said it, it was so cute.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But yeah, that's my Julian story of the week.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All right. Going to our chat room at vognetwork.com is where the chat room is.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or if you're on the Game Surge Network, join us in channel VOG, V-O-G, voice of geeks.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Raginator says, Shermie and Mel B's lap, the one chick from the Spice Girls?

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's our own Mel B of...

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
DDR infamy from back in the day.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He used to do freestyle tournaments and all this stuff.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And now he's a kick ass DJ.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right, he's DJ now.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Didn't he spin at Fauna Mae last year? Isn't he doing it this year?

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think he's doing it this year too.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We really need to do, you know, for our 10 year anniversary things

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
since we really have no ideas.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I would really like to do some type of where are they now

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
where we really catch up with a lot of the old people from back in the DDR day just to say hey.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know at least three of the girls are mothers.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Although I have to say one of them, you remember Renee?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh yeah.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She told me to have a happy Mother's Day because I take care of other people.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's very nice.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's good.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So that made me feel better.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I talked to my mommy and my mommy was like, I was like, so what are you doing for Mother's Day?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Laundry?

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, if you think about it, not only are you a mother to Shermie,

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but you're sort of a godmother to Maruko and Sanrio, our cats, because they have two daddies.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you're like the womanly influence in their life.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I do get the cuddles from your little prissy dude.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He is kind of a prissy cat with his tail in the air all the time.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's like, look at my butt.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Going to more comments from our chat room, Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, for Mother's Day,

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you should show your mom a violent video game just to see how she reacts.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We already did that like six months ago.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I showed her the new Mortal Kombat game.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It was hilarious.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What episode number was that?

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You taped her reaction.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I did.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's actually on video, but she said she would disown me if I put the video up.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I could only play the audio of it for you guys.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Rob, what is this?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Actually, the next thing I want to show her, I want to show her the love scene from Mass Effect 3.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Either the dude on dude or the female on female to get a reaction.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to get my mom.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Keep in mind, my mom used to play Super Mario Brothers with me back in the day.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There you go.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
When I go back to Alabama, I need to get a video of mom today playing Super Mario Brothers.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There you go.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She could probably still do 1-1 blindfolded.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, no, no.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That was 8-1 that you had to do blindfolded.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because it had the same timing every time you freaking did it.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
DJ Morpheus from Under Sedation Live, which is on the VOG Network,

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Saturday nights at a new time, 7 Pacific, says,

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
With Rob's voice cracking periodically, it's like being in a time machine and hearing him go through puberty.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You shut up. I'm sick.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sick and I'm showing up for this show anyway because I love you guys.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Shut your whore mouth.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's right. Shut your whore mouth.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, video games.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We'll get to our gaming weeks in just a moment, but I thought a couple kickoff topics tonight.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, my God. That's so cute.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What? Something else to distract us now?

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No. It was Tiger Koplos did a picture of him with his old TV.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I had a TV like that.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to see.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It has UHF channels and rabid ears.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, God. I used to have a TV like that in my bedroom because that was like the ultimate hand-me-down TV.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Since it is a radio show, this is the kind of TV that has the two knobs.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Shit.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Knobs. It had knobs.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know. I know. But I'm just realizing as I'm saying this out loud.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You know, any teenager listening to this show has absolutely no idea what we're talking about.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And it had a contrast twisty dial.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Maybe you've seen these at a thrift store.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I saw a Blu-ray player at a thrift store, Rob.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can only imagine that this description should be started with back in my day.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I know. Well, a TV like that, the funny thing is a TV like that wouldn't even work anymore after the whole digital conversion.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
However, I'm looking for one.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
For a reason.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Play my Odyssey 2.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Go to a thrift store. I'm sure you'd find them.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I haven't seen them at a thrift store.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really? You need to go to like, you know where you need to go?

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Just need an RF adapter.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You need to go to Deseret, the Mormon frickin'...

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I do not like giving the Mormons my money.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I know, but I'll tell you what. They've got everything.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I used to buy old comics there, though.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I almost bought, for Rocky Horror, in my defense it was for Rocky Horror and I don't want to hear it.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I almost bought a wedding dress at Deseret.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I've been with Jessica a number of times getting stuff for clubbing.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah? Good times.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because you can get lots of fun. I've actually bought cosplay stuff there to modify.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There you go.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I bought...

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Mormons aren't all bad.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I bought some... actually, you know what the last thing I bought there was?

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Was my copy of Rubber Soul. The Beatles Rubber Soul. On vinyl. Five bucks.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This other place I went to had a really shitty copy and one of 54. And I was like, nah, I'll buy it for the Mormons.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, I was going to spend some time talking about some pre-E3 lulz and stuff, but you know what?

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just... I don't think we're going to be able to keep the topic on gaming.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sure we can. I can do that.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can keep the topic on gaming.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Alright.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So let's talk about pre-E3 stuff.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's talk about pre-E3 stuff. What did you want to bring up?

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know. There's a lot of big announcements I'm expecting at E3, so...

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright, is it time to make our E3 predictions now that we're talking?

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You know, we know that the press dates have been set and some of them you'll be able to watch live,

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and some of them will only be online or what have you.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, what are we going to see from Nintendo this year? This is the easy one.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What are we going to see from Nintendo this year at their conference?

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The Game Boy Micro 2.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I still have my Micro, so STFU.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They're just going to plain say, fuck it, we ain't releasing the Wii U, you bastards.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sure we'll see the Wii U.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I just can't get excited about it, though.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, I don't know.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't think there's anything that they can put out for it at launch that's going to make me excited about the Wii U.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Save Excite Truck 2.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In which case, that will be a tough, tough day.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But they're not going to announce a date. They're not going to announce a price.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's like...

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like the Wii all over again or something.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right, they did come out and say, no date, no price at E3, right?

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like, thanks! No information.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, by the way, we're not going to show you any games either, because, you know...

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright, so Nintendo, easy.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's going to be all about the Wii U with a little bit thrown at the 3DS.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What if it gets delayed?

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You really think that's possible at this point?

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
PS3 got delayed.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't think so.

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They can't afford to delay it.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Nintendo already is going down the downward turn with their investors and everything.

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If they don't put out the Wii U, you're going to see Mario on the iPhone.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They're going to have to give in to the investors, and that's what the investors want.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They want Nintendo to develop for the iPhone.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So if the Wii U gets delayed...

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's the day that Miyamoto will bind his knees and commit seppuku on the roof of the Nintendo building.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Honestly? Yes.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then they would sell his head on eBay.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The Wii U's coming, whether it's ready or not.

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I hear Foxconn has a nice roof that he can jump off of.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Stop it. Inappropriate.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think Miyamoto has a little more self-respect than that. I think it would be ritual suicide.

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You know, the last one in Japan happened in 1978.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You all are being so morbid and gross and tacky.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have to read from chatroom, Rob, since you're ignoring it.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not ignoring them. What do you want to read from chat?

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just lost it because you were busy jabbering.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh yeah, um...

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Great, now I forgot it. Oh well.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't find them anymore. This is why I usually read chat.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We have this awesome comment from our chatroom, and...

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, it scrolled away. Where'd it go?

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm trying to find it.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Someone said, back in my day, we... Oh no, it was one-night stands.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Back in my day, we had to blow in our cartridges.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But my retort was, back in my day, my computers used cassette tapes.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because you're old. All right, um...

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're old, too! Who was it we were talking about needed hearing aid today, Mr. Rob?

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, look. 3DS. Anything exciting going to happen on the 3DS at E3?

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
All they're going to show is, they're going to show New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the 3DS,

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
which is like, yay, New Super Mario Brothers!

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I mean, it's a good game, and they're just making more levels for it,

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
which I've said in the past they should do for the first one,

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you know, and open it up so everyone else can make levels, but then they won't do that.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Um, I mean, what are they going to really have for...

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's not going to be Smash Brothers.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They may announce Smash Brothers, because it could be years away before it actually comes out,

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but that's not beyond intended to do that.

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I mean, hell, when did they announce Pikmin?

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, like a couple of years ago.

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So, I'm not surprised there.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Um, probably Animal Crossing will be the holiday game, which is kind of...

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You know...

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yay!

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I want to play it.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He may do Luigi's Mansion 2, but eh.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's kind of been long enough for me since I really got into an Animal Crossing game

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that I could be convinced, because I really just passed on the Wii one,

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I really could be convinced to play Animal Crossing 3DS.

268
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I would be pretty easily convinced.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like, it's really a peer pressure thing for me.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If all my friends do it, I will do it too.

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know what?

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I found my copy of Doubutsu no Mori.

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really?

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And I was like, I should play this.

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And then I was trying to remember why I stopped playing it to begin with.

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Because I don't read Kana as well as I thought I did.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This game's hard when you don't natively speak the language.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, there's not a lot that I can be excited about.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Especially if we're talking about this system's going to be

280
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
basically like an Xbox 360 with the tablet controller and the Wii controls.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It doesn't seem very exciting to me.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They're going to have...

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Probably the same stuff that you saw in the tech demos

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
are probably going to become full-fledged games,

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
because that's what they did with the Wii.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, these are only tech demos?

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Wii Sports.

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know, Wii Sports Resort.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was just all the same shit.

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So you'll probably see some sort of compilation that's going to be packed in,

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
like a packing game or something that's going to be like Wii Sports.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know, Wii U Sports or whatever they're going to call it.

294
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And that'll be that.

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But I'm kind of interested to see how it's going to work with, like,

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you know, especially first-person shooters and stuff,

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
that tablet control is cool.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But what if, like, say, I want to have more than just one person

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
playing a first-person shooter, you know,

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
were we going to be on the classic controllers now?

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I mean, that might not even be that great,

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
because their controllers are kind of lacking

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
compared to some of the other systems.

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's going to be hard to port that stuff over,

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but I don't know.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they show.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
All right, let's move on so we don't spend all show

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
on these predictions weeks before the show happens.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How about Microsoft?

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I said on Bobby's show a minute ago

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
that I think Microsoft is hedging all their bets on Halo 4.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The Halo 4 is going to be the centerpiece

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
of that presentation at the very end,

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and that's really all the Xbox has going for it right now.

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No one's going to care.

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't think I'd be that cynical about it.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, first party, they're going to have the new Forza game.

318
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
They're going to have Halo 4, the new Fable game.

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They're going to be talking about exclusive DLC

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
for existing properties like Skyrim.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They're going to have exclusive DLC for it.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They're going to talk black ops 2 because I'm assuming

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
they're going to continue on with them having the DLC

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
slightly earlier before everybody else.

325
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There's the rumors that they're going to be doing

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
some sort of extended peripherals for some exercise games

327
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
to kind of tie those all together, that kind of stuff.

328
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe the web browser thing.

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You may be talking about some more revisions to the...

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Please don't make any more revisions to the goddamn dashboard, okay?

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's already Windows 8 enough.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I mean, so... I don't know.

333
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm wondering if they won't slip in some things about Windows 8

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and kind of maybe how it might interact with the Xbox.

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Maybe some type of enhanced media center or something?

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I mean, big question mark there, but...

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't think that's really necessary anymore

338
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
because a lot of the people they have now,

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it's tied in with all these different streaming services.

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't really need to stream from your PC anymore

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to stream Netflix and stuff

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
because you can do it through their apps.

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So they may talk about more partnerships with that kind of stuff.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Another perfect one is the Kinect-enabled children's programming stuff

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that they were going to be doing for National Geographic and Sesame Street.

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That might be something to push Kinect because that was kind of neat.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So you think it'll be a lot of these really weird outside-the-box things like that

348
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that you're talking about that we're going to see from Microsoft?

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm thinking, yeah.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Here's how the device does this, and here's how the device makes waffles.

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Maybe they're going to talk about new properties.

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It would be nice if they made a new franchise or something like that.

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hell, Nintendo, make a new franchise.

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That would be kind of cool.

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I would love it if they would kick off a new franchise.

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We'll see.

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Maybe they'll bring Milo back from the dead, LOL.

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, Sony.

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sony's a huge what?

360
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What do you want to say, Dark Soccer?

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Nothing.

362
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a thought that when it came back into my head,

363
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I thought that's actually going to be kind of stupid.

364
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What? Now I really want to hear it.

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Taking old, kind of obscure NES games and making them into full-on new properties.

366
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That won't happen.

367
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like Milan's Secret Castle.

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Not on the Xbox.

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, no, I'm talking...

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You said Nintendo needs a new...

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Sure, Nintendo. Any of them could use the new one. Why not?

372
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
New IPs rock.

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well, maybe that's, you know, with all this retro gaming thing that's been going on,

374
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
maybe what they need to do is look at the old stuff

375
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and bring it screaming into the modern...

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, but some of it hasn't worked out too well. Look at Bionic Commando.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, yeah, but that was shit.

378
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, that worked out well for the Xbox Live Arcade games.

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's true. The best Bionic Commando were the remade games. Yeah, yeah.

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Which is ironic because they're by the same people, but...

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The other thing, the IPTV stuff, the web TV thing that they're maybe going to be doing,

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
their own TV network type thing, that might be interesting.

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I would bet you anything that's where Major's Minute goes.

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Some sort of new show.

385
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Interesting.

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
To get rid of the old show, to make way for the new show.

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Alright, let's quickly talk Sony real quick, because Sony's kind of a wild card.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean, obviously, they're going to be pushing Vita, but we're not going to really see...

389
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know, there's not going to be any peripherals that we can think of that would come out from Sony.

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Like, there's nothing that they're pushing there.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So, it's really games, games, games, games, games, left and right.

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Vita, they're going to be having a lot of stuff to talk about. The Vita, maybe enhancements to that.

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe some more move-enabled games.

394
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Once again, I don't think the move is a bad peripheral.

395
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Honestly, out of all of the motion-captured things that they have right now, I think that one works the best.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yet, I don't want to play anything that's using it.

397
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, actually, the sports champions thing, I thought it was really impressive.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm like, this actually works pretty well.

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Versus Kinect, where it's like, this is not detecting me. This is frustrating.

400
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So, I can see them doing some more games that are going to probably support that.

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Once again, they're going to continue doing hardcore games that support the move as well.

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think they're going to talk a little bit more about, once again, franchises that are going to be supporting the move.

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And stuff like Bioshock, Infinite.

404
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They have a few new games that they're supposed to be announcing, like the God of War prequel.

405
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, the God of War prequel.

406
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not making God of War prequels.

407
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't even keep track of the storyline anymore.

408
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Sony Smash Brothers, or whatever they're calling it. Battle Royale.

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That might be pretty cool.

410
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They're going to probably show...

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What about that one game, Last Guardian?

412
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Where that guy suddenly disappeared, but they say the game's not cancelled.

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The Last of Us, also. That's their big holiday game.

414
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So they're really going to just have game, game, game, game, game, game.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I think they're just going to have lots of games.

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's good. That's what they need. Especially Vita.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm really excited to see the Vita's second half, based on some of the early stuff they were announcing before.

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

419
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Alright.

420
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Going to our chat room, ShadowNextGen says there needs to be a Vita price drop announcement at E3.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't... I mean, I think that will...

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And then WhatUpG follows that with, there is talk of a PS3 price drop for E3, ShadowNextGen.

423
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Again, that's vognetwork.com for chat.

424
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I could see them doing that, because they want to push more systems.

425
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They're just bundling right now. They're kind of doing that whole thing.

426
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The Vita price drop... I mean...

427
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I guess they could do that, but they're already... I think they're already losing money on the system.

428
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So it's going to be hard for them to do that.

429
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because, I mean, the system is more powerful than the 3DS.

430
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And so, therefore, it is more expensive.

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's just right now, I don't think there's a lot of games that people need to have on the Vita.

432
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's nothing like, oh my god, I need to get a Vita for this game.

433
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Whereas, you know, like Mario Kart, oh, I gotta buy a 3DS for that.

434
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Or Super Mario 3D Land, because it's just an amazing Mario game.

435
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Or, you know, a Zelda game, or something like that.

436
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Although, they need a new Zelda game on the 3DS.

437
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
None of this Nintendo 64 rehash bullshit.

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's see... I'm actually speaking of rehash bullshit for the 3DS.

439
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm surprised they haven't remade the Mario 64.

440
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That could be a title that they could just poop out real quick and put out for holiday.

441
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And it would sell a ton of copies.

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know. I think there's going to be a lot of things for the Vita.

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think Call of Duty is definitely going to help.

444
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think if they end up doing a Max Payne Grand Theft Auto or something of that caliber on there,

445
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
they could easily do that.

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You know, I'm actually very interested in Lego City Stories, which was the game.

447
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They didn't announce the publisher, but it's fucking Rockstar.

448
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It is so goddamn Rockstar Games.

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The interface is exactly the same.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So it's Lego Grand Theft Auto.

451
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean, that would be pretty awesome for the Wii U.

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That could be a big thing.

453
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And if that comes out in other systems, that could be a pretty cool announcement.

454
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And just more Grand Theft Auto 5.

455
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't care who shows it.

456
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Microsoft, Sony, both of them.

457
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey, let's just show different things.

458
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Every booth has it.

459
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
EA, just put it up there.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Hey, it's such an awesome game. We're going to show this too.

461
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think that would be pretty cool.

462
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I hope it's just something that's not cancelled.

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because once again, all those really cool things that I wanted for the 3DS,

464
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
DJ Hero, Saints Row, that kind of stuff,

465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
all got fucking cancelled before the 3DS came out.

466
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So all these things that they announced for the Wii U,

467
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
like this Lego City Stories thing,

468
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
could easily be cancelled by the time we get to it.

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Alright, well, I'm sure some of you out there have your theories as well.

470
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Email us quickly before the leaks start coming,

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
because that's going to be the exciting thing over the next few weeks,

472
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is leaks, leaks, and more leaks. We even have a few tonight.

473
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to lock in your predictions right now.

474
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I would like to add once again, because I don't think I say this enough,

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I fucking hate Michael Patcher for getting paid lots of money to make stupid guesses.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I mean, hey, hey, I hear that a certain big title from Take Two got, you know, delayed.

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Therefore, Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming out that day.

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yes, you could draw that, you know, you can make that argument, I guess,

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
because it's a pretty obvious one to make.

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know, or like, hey, I hear that, you know, a studio's making a new Halo game for the X-

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think it's going to be for the Xbox.

482
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I mean, come on, that would be kind of the stuff that he makes calls on, I don't know.

483
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But he gets paid a lot more money than I do.

484
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks,

485
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because I have a pretty big thing I've got to get into in my gaming week this week,

486
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
so let's start off with Ladies First Dark Sakura.

487
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How was your gaming week? What type of video games have you been playing this week when you haven't been coughing?

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Um, I got a panda to ten as a brewmaster and talked to the king of Stormwind

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and realized he's an asshole and quit playing the beta.

490
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
By the way, she's a Warcraft addict, everybody.

491
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
A dealer. And I played some Portal 2.

492
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, have you played with that new level creator thingy that came out?

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Not yet, not yet.

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh, you gotta. I need to.

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I need to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

496
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, I think you might want to cash in on that.

497
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's down to like twenty bucks now.

498
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, if it doesn't work, oh my god.

499
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll have to wait for another Steam sale.

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Still, I'm going to point and laugh at you for a second.

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

502
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.

503
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm going to point and laugh at you for having missed that bone.

504
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I want to thank ActDeft for the gift of the Portal 2 behind the scenes thing.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, that's nice.

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Listeners buy us gifts? I want gifts.

507
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Listeners buy me gifts.

508
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
No, actually, I have gotten nice things from listeners before. I can't pitch.

509
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Speaking of gifts, I already bought you guys' Christmas gifts.

510
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Already?

511
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Really?

512
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I already took care of it.

513
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Nice. That's being proactive.

514
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Now I'm going to remember that when Christmas comes around.

515
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You bought that in May.

516
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
No, I can't wait. It'll be great.

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's not ready yet, though.

518
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Alright.

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Uh-oh.

520
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
RageNator in chat says,

521
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Just an A. No A+. For shame.

522
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He's being very much an Asian father right now.

523
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Do I look Asian to you?

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Alright, I'm assuming she's done, so Loki, you're giving me a week.

525
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just played Call of Duty Mario Warfare 3.

526
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I wanted to get to play other things, but I was actually working on some Grand Theft Auto modding tool thing.

527
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And I finally finished that, so...

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Whew! I'm done with that. I can actually go and work on actual Grand Theft Auto 4 modding.

529
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You know, I've got to get my stuff that I've been working on for like a year now done before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.

530
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And then I am going back to Skyrim.

531
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's beckoning me, so I'm going to play that.

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Now, actually, I'm supposed to be getting a copy.

533
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know if I'm going to keep it, of the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition for the 360.

534
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I haven't decided if I'm going to play that or not.

535
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I do want Max Payne 3, because I want to rule the online for that.

536
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But, we'll see.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I have to wait a money.

538
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Alright. That's it then.

539
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Alright, my gaming week has been all over the map.

540
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's talk about the big one.

541
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I beat my third game for 2012 this week.

542
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That means I beat...

543
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Okay, so if we go back...

544
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now, remember, I have Gamer's ADD.

545
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I never beat video games.

546
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And if you haven't heard me talk about my Gamer ADD on the show before,

547
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I have a horrible habit of buying $60 video games, playing the first three stages,

548
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and then going, ooh, shiny!

549
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Playing a new game that comes out the very next week.

550
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I know I'm not the only podcast host that has this problem.

551
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I've heard other guys with this.

552
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

553
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Exactly. I know I'm not the only gamer with this problem.

554
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So it happens to all of us.

555
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's been 25 hours in the day.

556
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You know, sorry, just to interrupt real quick,

557
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
but you posted on Twitter you needed a new game to play.

558
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah. I was going to get to that.

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, then let me get to it.

560
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
First, I have to talk about my big feat.

561
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So I beat my third game.

562
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So to recap, this year, I beat Mass Effect.

563
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Then after that, I beat Mass Effect 2.

564
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Guess what I beat the other night?

565
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Space Harrier.

566
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Mass Effect 3, everybody!

567
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Woo!

568
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In summary, you know how many hours I've sunk into the franchise overall?

569
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Over 100 hours I have played these games since February.

570
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, so I beat Mass Effect 3.

571
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I've already kind of reviewed the game, I guess, on prior shows.

572
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I love it.

573
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But I'm sure here's the question.

574
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I already know.

575
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I already know Tiger Claw is going to ask this in the chat room,

576
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
or somebody's asking it in chat.

577
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't even have to turn my head to look.

578
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So, Rob, how about that ending?

579
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So I can finally talk about the ending.

580
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I won't spoil, though.

581
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Out of respect to those that have not beat Mass Effect 3 yet,

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
or are just now getting into Mass Effect, I'm not going to spoil.

583
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So which color did you get?

584
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I went with green, which apparently was not the right thing to do.

585
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But my thought was,

586
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
oh, well, I'm not going to go with the obviously Paragon

587
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
or the obviously Renegade thing.

588
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This surely must be the bonus choice that I get

589
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
for having collected so many war assets,

590
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
which was only about half true.

591
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, it is a bonus choice you get for collecting a certain amount of war assets,

592
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but it's not as great as you'd think.

593
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You said ass.

594
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

595
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Anyhow, so without ruining the ending, let me just say this.

596
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I pretty much stand by everything I already said about this debacle

597
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
earlier in the program.

598
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, it's kind of a disappointing end to a series

599
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that a lot of people are very rabid over.

600
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's a little weird that no matter what you do,

601
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the end result kind of ends up being really the same.

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And for all this war asset, multiplayer, EA server,

603
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
it interfaces with the iPad app and the iPhone game

604
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and the website and all this stuff.

605
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You build up the war.

606
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It maybe impacts three QuickTime movies you get at the end of the game,

607
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which is kind of disappointing considering BioWare puts so much more

608
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
into the game otherwise.

609
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But maybe they didn't want to branch it out in all these directions

610
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
because it makes future games in the series a bitch to make.

611
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't know. I don't know their reasoning,

612
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but I'm looking forward to the DLC just like everybody else.

613
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But this is supposed to be the last one.

614
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Surely you don't suggest that they made a terrible ending

615
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so that they could sell another game.

616
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, please. Please.

617
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It won't be the last Mass Effect game.

618
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I mean, it might be the last in this trilogy,

619
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
but if they could make a Halo 4, they could make a Mass Effect 4.

620
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's for sure.

621
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Otherwise, yes, the ending is unfortunate,

622
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but it doesn't ruin the hundred hours of the gaming experience

623
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I had to get there, which was a great gameplay experience.

624
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm still playing the multiplayer.

625
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
As recently as earlier today, I was playing multiplayer.

626
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was playing multiplayer with Shane and Paul,

627
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
one of our listeners and one of his friends last night.

628
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We were all trying the gold multiplayer and getting our ass kicked,

629
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but it was so much fun.

630
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So, you know, we're having fun with that.

631
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And what else did I want to say about the whole ending debacle?

632
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There was one other thing I wanted to say about it.

633
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, the whole talk about the defective game

634
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and turning it back to Amazon and filing the complaint with the FCC.

635
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That shit was ridiculous.

636
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, really? I didn't need to play the game to know that.

637
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Exactly. My thoughts have not changed on that.

638
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I just want to make that clear.

639
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Do I think BioWare could have done better?

640
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Fuck yeah, I think they could have done better.

641
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Absolutely.

642
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But I'm not really the type to raise this huge ruckus and stink over it.

643
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They were a little busy working on some Star Wars MMO or something.

644
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Shane is screaming at me to talk about the theory.

645
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't want to spoil it, Shane.

646
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't want to spoil it for listeners that haven't beat it yet.

647
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
All I will say is this.

648
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
He was begging me to watch this one and a half hour long documentary on YouTube

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that is explaining the ending.

650
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And I'm like, Shane, I don't need to watch this hour and a half documentary

651
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
that explains the ending.

652
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Exactly.

653
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because I kind of already figured it out.

654
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like, I was halfway there.

655
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And then he says, blah, blah, blah, blah.

656
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And I'm like, oh, okay, I can see that.

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

658
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You see, they're going to better explain the ending soon.

659
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They're going to have the pop-up bubbles, like pop-up video for the ending

660
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
once the new BioWare DLC comes out for Mass Effect 3.

661
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And he's like, no, you have to watch it anyway

662
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
because there's so many little things that go into it.

663
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm like, Shane, I don't need to be sold on the theory.

664
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I accept your theory.

665
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It makes a lot of sense.

666
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
All right, I'm on board.

667
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're right.

668
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's the ending and that's how they're going to fix it in the DLC.

669
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
No, watch the documentary.

670
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm like, God damn it, no.

671
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Anyhow, act deaf in the chat room screaming.

672
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Exactly.

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Fucking exactly.

674
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's open to interpretation.

675
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That it is.

676
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It is a little bit.

677
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Anyhow, how about other games that aren't Mass Effect?

678
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Which I know is sacrilege, right?

679
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Okay, you wanted me to get out the haterade, though,

680
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because I played a really fucking terrible game this week.

681
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Like, it is Yaris bad, you guys.

682
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You ready?

683
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It was a free game for me on PlayStation Plus,

684
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
which should start to tell you how terrible it was.

685
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I don't even remember the name of it.

686
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I think it was called Frogger Returns.

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Good Lord, Rob.

688
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh, no.

689
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
No, you see, you don't even have to explain that.

690
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I mean, it's just...

691
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

692
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It was free and...

693
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Okay, so it's like...

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Remember how, like, the original Frogger was a good game?

695
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And then remember how...

696
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't remember the original Frogger anymore,

697
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
because it's been tainted by all this shit that they keep popping out.

698
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I have good memories of Frogger,

699
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
because I was really good at it while on roller skates.

700
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Then remember how Frogger came out again in, like,

701
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
94 or 95 on the PlayStation?

702
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And it wasn't bad.

703
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That first Frogger game was kind of a neat reimagining

704
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
of Frogger on the PlayStation, right?

705
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And how every Frogger since then has basically tried to be

706
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that PlayStation game all over again,

707
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
because I guess that was actually one of, like,

708
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
the best-selling PlayStation games ever,

709
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
was that Frogger that came out.

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But it was awful.

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So Frogger Returns is, like, kind of a mixture of the two.

712
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Like, it's trying to be the arcade game in that top overhead style,

713
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
but they've redone the maps to add a sewer level, a subway thing,

714
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and it's just, like, it's so derpy,

715
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and I don't really have a better way to explain it.

716
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like, there's power-ups, you guys.

717
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh my god, oh my god, okay, power-ups, power-ups.

718
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You can make everything stop for a few seconds,

719
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
which surprisingly doesn't make anything easier,

720
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
because sometimes you have to have things moving

721
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
in order to get from platform to platform.

722
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So that power-up does nothing.

723
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And then, oh my god, you guys, oh my god, you guys,

724
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
super revolutionary Frogger power-up,

725
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
change your fucking mind, blow your fucking mind away.

726
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Ready?

727
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Reverse.

728
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Everything fucking moves backwards.

729
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh my god!

730
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Don't tell me that they have a mirror stage option as well.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't know, I didn't beat the game,

732
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but maybe that's something that comes up.

733
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But everything moves backwards,

734
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and you know what it changes?

735
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Nothing, because Frogger is just as hard

736
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
when everything's moving backwards as it is forwards.

737
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Hey, Rob.

738
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What?

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There was a good Frogger thing that came out.

740
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What's that?

741
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Frogger 3 Deep on the Commodore 64 was badass.

742
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It was a project using GPS mapping and street sensors

743
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
to where they had an interactive Frogger

744
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
that used New York City traffic as the cars,

745
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and you played the frog.

746
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's already more interesting than the game I played.

747
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know, that looked pretty derpy.

748
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I thought it was pretty neat.

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I will say this.

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
For you trophy whores,

751
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
there are four trophies in Frogger Returns.

752
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You get a silver trophy for beating the first stage,

753
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and then for stages two through four,

754
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you get a gold trophy.

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So if you want an easy gold trophy or two,

756
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
go play Frogger Returns.

757
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Three on PlayStation Plus.

758
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Otherwise, oh, I needed to get out there.

759
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This is so important.

760
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The collision detection is awful.

761
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And in Frogger, collision detection is kind of important.

762
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You think?

763
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I was nowhere near that car.

764
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's like playing a sprite-based game in three dimensions.

765
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's terrible.

766
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
All right.

767
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Moving on.

768
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
One other game I played on PlayStation 3,

769
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
although this game's on Xbox Live Arcade as well.

770
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I didn't pay for it because it's also free on PlayStation Plus.

771
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
No, we got it found at Fifth Avenue Frogger.

772
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And this game was actually worth my time,

773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
unlike the other one.

774
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Awesomenauts is on PlayStation right now.

775
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Awesomenauts is kind of cool

776
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
because Awesomenauts is like a tower defense game

777
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
mixed with Gunstar Heroes or Contra.

778
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's like a shooter mixed with a tower defense game.

779
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Here's the interesting thing about it, though.

780
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Once you play the tutorial level,

781
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
it's really all multiplayer.

782
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, yeah, you can play single player with bots,

783
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and you can kind of do it that way,

784
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
but it's all online.

785
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And so, I mean, imagine if you were playing a type of Contra

786
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
where you were just shooting the other people.

787
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That's kind of what they've made is a side-scroller shooter

788
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that's multiplayer head-to-head.

789
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And, yeah, it's kind of a neat experience. I liked it.

790
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Can you shoot people until they explode?

791
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, you shoot people until they explode.

792
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
They go back to their base, and they have to respawn,

793
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and then you fall down this little rocket,

794
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and that's kind of what fills the time

795
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
so that way there is a penalty for you having died.

796
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And in a nutshell, you're trying to bust through

797
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
these little, like, I think they're called turrets.

798
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You bust through these little turrets

799
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
on your way to get to the base.

800
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I mean, it's like any other tower defense game,

801
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but they mixed it with a shooter,

802
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
which makes it kind of unique and fun.

803
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, yeah, I liked Awesomenauts.

804
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's worth a look.

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
If you're on PlayStation Plus, especially, it's free.

806
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So, like, seriously, go get it.

807
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So it wasn't Awesomenaut.

808
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Well, and it has this amazing 80s retro theme song to it

809
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and, like, anime intro.

810
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I got to say, it's a sharp-looking game.

811
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It looks like a cartoon.

812
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's great. Art style's fun.

813
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So, yeah, it's worth checking out.

814
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So I was just thinking now, you know,

815
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
how you're looking for another game to play, you know,

816
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and possibly one that's, you know,

817
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
we could play with other people.

818
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yes, I put that out on Twitter.

819
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Now that I've beat Mass Effect 3, what do I play?

820
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And, of course, Shane replied and said,

821
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
More Mass Effect.

822
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm like, I want to give it a month

823
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
before I start my Renegade playthrough.

824
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, I was just thinking it'd be interesting

825
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
if we both tried Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.

826
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
All right, look, I don't want the Minecraft hate mail.

827
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I played Minecraft on PC and I just didn't get it.

828
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But to be fair, to be fair, everybody,

829
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
put the pens down, don't write the hate mail.

830
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
The first time I played Mass Effect,

831
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
about three years ago, the first Mass Effect game,

832
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I didn't get it either and I didn't like it.

833
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So, okay, I'm with you, Loki.

834
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Let's give Minecraft one more chance.

835
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I will buy it tomorrow.

836
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
All right.

837
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I am looking for Minecraft for Linux.

838
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Well, I'm sure it exists.

839
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Why the sudden urge to get into Minecraft, Loki?

840
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I don't have a real urge to it,

841
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
but I think it'd be interesting.

842
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It'd be funny if we both played a game,

843
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
like we set a time during the week or something

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to play multiplayer and that just,

845
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
whether we hate it or like it, it'll be interesting.

846
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's right. Interesting it will.

847
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There is Minecraft for Linux.

848
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Of course there is.

849
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
There's everything for Linux.

850
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't know.

851
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Or Steam for Linux.

852
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Or we could play a game that we already have,

853
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
like Saints Row the Third.

854
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says,

855
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Sky, Minecraft on 360 is a better introduction.

856
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's what I hear.

857
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's set up a little better to like get you into the series.

858
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'll check it out. I will. Why not?

859
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Sure.

860
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
All right.

861
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Otherwise, I do have all these other games I could be playing,

862
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
like Fez I need to play more of,

863
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
because I actually really enjoyed the little time I spent with that.

864
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, whatever.

865
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's move on.

866
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.

867
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
How's that sound?

868
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Oh, first let me plug our Twitters.

869
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook.

870
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

871
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Add us.

872
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Be our friend.

873
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And we'll be your friend in return.

874
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And you can interact with the show

875
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and answer our foogle questions every week.

876
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Otherwise, housekeeping,

877
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
there will still be a show next week.

878
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
But no Dark Sakura.

879
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Dark Sakura's going to the happiest place on Earth.

880
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And not taking me.

881
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You know, you were invited.

882
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I was.

883
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I was totally invited,

884
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
but I can't make it because I have a conflict.

885
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That's right.

886
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You're conflicted.

887
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Yeah, I'm always am.

888
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So, Loki and I will be here holding down the fort,

889
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
maybe a guest host.

890
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Alan works on Sunday nights now, so he won't be here.

891
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And for the record, Frisbee,

892
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
wine does not work on my netbook,

893
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
which I'm running Lennox Mint on.

894
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So, end of story.

895
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And also, I want to say,

896
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Nicholson, since I know you're listening,

897
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
thank you for the pink berry.

898
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Right, Jamie?

899
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yes, thank you.

900
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It was considerate of you to think of us.

901
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It was considerate.

902
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
He brought it for me.

903
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You just sound so sincere.

904
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But I'm here.

905
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
No, you are.

906
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It was considerate.

907
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
All right.

908
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Let's move on and get into the news.

909
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Loki.

910
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
All right.

911
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So, EA, you know,

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
they're planning on doing some layoffs.

913
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And they have,

914
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
they have,

915
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs

916
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
on Sunday nights.

917
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And, you know,

918
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
they're planning on doing some layoffs.

919
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And they have,

920
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
they have,

921
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs

922
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
by September 30th.

923
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Basically, what they're doing is the restructuring

924
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
of their employees.

925
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Um, and they're-

926
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Running people off?

927
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes, they're restructuring them out of the company.

928
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Okay, see right here,

929
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
this, this is our group of employees here.

930
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We have,

931
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
this circle represents the people that are in the company.

932
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The people that are outside of the circle.

933
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You're fired.

934
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So, um, that's kind of how it's going to work.

935
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Um, they're basically, um,

936
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I guess dropping from a one in eight engineers

937
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to one in two engineers.

938
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
To one in two.

939
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Um, so, cool.

940
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And, um, I guess, uh,

941
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
they, uh, will-

942
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
By the way, this is all the fault of people that rent games

943
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and buy them used.

944
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
This is all your fault,

945
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and the blood is on your hands.

946
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Clearly it's because you're not paying enough for those online passes.

947
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That is clearly why these people are being let go

948
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and not because they like making money.

949
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Um, so yes,

950
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
apparently they're going to, um,

951
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
have a variety of expenses, um,

952
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
incurring up to 40 million in total costs, I guess,

953
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the severance packages for these people.

954
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And, um, no,

955
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
23 million of that is severance packages.

956
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The other 17, I guess, is going away parties.

957
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Uh, that'd be my guess.

958
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Uh, yeah.

959
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And then, of course, um, they're going to, um,

960
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
drop the number of employees by five to ten percent,

961
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
which is approximately 500 to 1,000 people.

962
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
How in the hell does that go from one in eight people being an engineer

963
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to one in two people being an engineer when you're firing five percent?

964
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Like, I'm not even a math major, and that doesn't compute to me.

965
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Does that mean all these people are suddenly going to be changed into engineers?

966
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
They're just going to-

967
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Loki! Bam! You're an engineer!

968
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
They're just going to make them respec, okay?

969
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
As an engineer, so that's what's going to happen, you know.

970
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You were a white mage before, you're now a fucking engineer.

971
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You're going to need to pay 120 Microsoft points.

972
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Listen, you better learn how to fucking pilot that airship,

973
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
because if not, you're out of there as well.

974
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
We're going to drop it down to one in one engineers.

975
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Um, so yes.

976
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Only you could make a shitty thing like job loss hilarious, thank you, Loki.

977
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Hey, not only do I speculate about, you know, game industry stuff,

978
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I can also do comedy.

979
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Fuck you, Michael Patcher.

980
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You can't do comedy for shit. I saw your video.

981
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
My data says that there's more people that whine than complain.

982
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well my data says that you're a fucking tard.

983
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Allegedly.

984
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Allegedly.

985
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So yes. So there's that.

986
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And then of course, you know, beyond that,

987
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
they've made some money with Origin.

988
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You know, I guess they have 11 million members on Origin.

989
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Now, to be fair, if you play an EA game that has multiplayer,

990
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you have to sign up on Origin.

991
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah, I'm on Origin because of Mass Effect, not willingly.

992
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You may be skewing those numbers a little bit, so fine.

993
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
The person who hacked my Xbox signed me up for Origin.

994
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You know, I found out, I got signed up for Origin.

995
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And my Xbox hasn't been hacked, but I'm signed up for it.

996
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Somehow, I don't remember doing it.

997
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Dragon Age. You had to do it for Dragon Age.

998
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yep, see, aha! I'm smart.

999
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So, and then of course, they've made $150 million in revenue

1000
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
during the fiscal year from March 31st, 2011 to April 1st of this year.

1001
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And, you know, they're saying that EA's Nucleus cross-platform community network,

1002
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
which, I gotta be honest, I've never heard of, has 220 million members.

1003
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't even know what the fuck that is or why they have so many members for it.

1004
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And they said, of course, they've allowed 11 million members to provide feedback

1005
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
on Origin and their digital distribution service.

1006
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But, see, once again, it's just because you can't tout those numbers.

1007
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That's like, for example, the PlayStation, like Sony is saying,

1008
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
oh look, the PlayStation Network has all these members.

1009
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yes, because it's free to make an account.

1010
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I have four accounts. Am I four people? No, I am one person.

1011
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But I have four accounts because I like having accounts in every single region.

1012
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And also Nelly has an account. But technically it's on the PlayStation,

1013
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
so therefore it's my account. But that doesn't count.

1014
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, whatever, fine. Tout your numbers, but all it really comes down to is revenue.

1015
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
$150 million isn't bad. I don't know what Steam makes during that same time period.

1016
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm assuming a lot more than $150 million.

1017
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
$150 million can save lots of jobs. Never mind.

1018
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh, by the way, it wasn't Dragon Age. It was Sims 3.

1019
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Whatever.

1020
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Cray Sims 3 makes you sign up for Origin?

1021
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
No, but I signed up for an EA registration account.

1022
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh.

1023
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So it linked my data from when I signed up for Dragon Age.

1024
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It actually linked my data from Sims 3.

1025
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Gotcha.

1026
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, it's also weird because I had a Call of Duty Elite account,

1027
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and yet I never remembered signing up for one.

1028
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But I did. I just don't remember why.

1029
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Alright, well speaking of Call of Duty Elite, if you're all done with the EA news over there,

1030
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I am.

1031
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let's move over to Activision Blizzard and talk about what they reported.

1032
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
After all, these are the two big software publishers in the world right now.

1033
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Activision Blizzard, or Active Blizzard, whatever I just called them,

1034
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
the net revenue right now, $1.17 billion for the period ending on March 31, 2012.

1035
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That is a 23% drop over 2011.

1036
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Activision, let's see, Activision had 23% of net revenues, that's down 19%.

1037
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Blizzard accounted for 21% of net revenues, down 42%.

1038
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Probably because, I would imagine, because Blizzard had StarCraft II sales still pretty strong this time last year.

1039
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And also, wow, subscriptions were up.

1040
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

1041
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Now, of course, Blizzard kind of has this semi-big game coming out.

1042
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Let me think, when is that game going to be out?

1043
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Tomorrow night, Diablo III, which should look pretty good for them.

1044
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Pandas!

1045
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Panda People, Land of the Panda People is coming out later this year as well.

1046
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then, of course, they have a StarCraft II expansion on the horizon.

1047
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Do you suppose that maybe getting people to prepay for their full year of, you know,

1048
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
now assuming that was prepaid for the blood pact, right?

1049
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
No, it was not.

1050
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Okay.

1051
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It was merely, it was the equivalent of a cell phone contract.

1052
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You signed it up and agreed not to.

1053
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I thought maybe they were trying to boost their numbers.

1054
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You don't have to pay anything extra.

1055
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's just, we'll give you a pretty pony and this game and a beta.

1056
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I will say I did this.

1057
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
When I signed up for the blood pact, I switched my account to six months at a time,

1058
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
because when you do six months at a time, you get like $2 off a month.

1059
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You pay like $77 for six months.

1060
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And so I just did that because I had a nice chunk of money six months ago,

1061
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and then I knew around now I would have to pony up the money again, which I did.

1062
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And it's okay.

1063
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So, let's see.

1064
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Activision's big stuff coming up.

1065
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Prototype 2, Amazing Spider-Man, Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

1066
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah, they've got, well, they've got, well, Prototype 2 just came out.

1067
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Obviously, their big one, Call of Duty.

1068
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Later on, Skylanders Giants, which I hate to say is probably going to be a big title for them.

1069
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And they have a whole bunch of smaller things in between them, like Ice Age 2.

1070
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
They have a terrible battleship game that's coming out also on Tuesday.

1071
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They also have a-

1072
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Battleship was a game. Now it's a movie.

1073
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The game, based off the movie, based off the game.

1074
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yes, they have a game that's coming out.

1075
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
A first-person shooter that will probably be passed over by a lot of people coming out as well.

1076
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And then a couple weeks later, Men in Black, Alien Crisis, another terrible game based on a movie.

1077
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well, not exactly based on a movie. It's based on a lot of secondary characters from the movies.

1078
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's also coming out as well. So they're going to have that.

1079
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And Spider-Man will do well for them.

1080
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Alright, well, Call of Duty Elite, since Loki had brought that up a minute ago.

1081
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Apparently, 10 million users are signed up for Call of Duty Elite.

1082
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
2 million are paid subscribers.

1083
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's better than nothing, which is what they had a few years ago when the service didn't exist.

1084
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Apparently, that is up 3 million and a half million.

1085
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So it was 7 million and 1.5 million since February when they last reported on the numbers.

1086
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So, yeah, it's gone up. I guess people are liking their Call of Duty Elite.

1087
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
They have a lot of content packs coming out, so it's becoming very apparent that paying the $60 a year is a good deal if you want all those maps and stuff.

1088
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
See, I'm not super into Call of Duty, so that's really not for me, but I could see where that is lucrative.

1089
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Like, if they had something like that for Mass Effect, I'd be tempted. I hate to say that.

1090
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah, see, like, right now we play offline at work, so, you know, that would require everybody having those maps in order for it to be beneficial for me to buy those maps.

1091
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So I just don't buy those maps right now.

1092
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Alright. Well, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.

1093
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yes, other stuff that is, uh, well, more Blizzard-y things.

1094
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Blizzard and Valve settled their little trademark disagreement for the DOTA.

1095
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
DOTA, whatever it is.

1096
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Um, so basically, Valve gets to use it, and Blizzard retains non-commercial use of the title for the community.

1097
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Um, as in keeping it as an acronym available for Warcraft III and StarCraft II.

1098
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Um, in fact, Blizzard is renaming the Blizzard DOTA project. It's called Blizzard All-Stars.

1099
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And this is the quote that came out from Rob Pardo, who's the Blizzard exec.

1100
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Um, both Blizzard and Valve recognized that at the end of the day, players just want to be able to play the games they're looking forward to,

1101
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
so we're happy to come to an agreement that helps both of us stay focused on that.

1102
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And then Gabe Newell said,

1103
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
We're pleased that we could come to an agreement with Blizzard without drawing things out in a way that would benefit no one.

1104
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
We both want to focus on the things our fans care about creating and shipping great games for our communities.

1105
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Um, neither title has a release date, by the way.

1106
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But, soon.

1107
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But they've come to an agreement. They've shaken hands.

1108
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They said, you know what, this is silly.

1109
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Which is good. I mean, the community wins.

1110
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And it's not like the community is not going to know one of these games from the other.

1111
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean, DOTA-style games are really a rage right now.

1112
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You know, League of Legends is really huge.

1113
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's a game we don't talk about enough on this show.

1114
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
There's a pretty huge community behind it.

1115
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Um, you know, those style of games are very popular, so I think everybody's really waiting to see what Blizzard and Valve puts out there.

1116
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
As well as, uh, there's another one.

1117
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
One of the other Dota makers went to go make a third one.

1118
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I can't remember the name. I'm sure someone in chat will jump in.

1119
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But there's kind of a third one involved in all this, too, so.

1120
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And then, of course, there's League of Legends, too.

1121
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So, you know, they're all kind of very similar.

1122
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But, we'll all be unique in their own ways.

1123
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It'll be neat to see.

1124
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And, you know, honestly, I wish we could see this type of agreement.

1125
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This type of goodwill, I would say.

1126
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
From more companies that are having little tiffs with each other.

1127
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I would rather them consider their whole...

1128
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The whole reason they have money in their pockets is because of these communities.

1129
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Because of the gamers.

1130
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And they try to, you know, delay things and screw each other over.

1131
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
In the end, they're screwing us over, too.

1132
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And back to screwing themselves.

1133
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Because they're not getting their money as soon as they would probably like it.

1134
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
WhatupG in the chatroom says,

1135
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Can Valve now get to making Half-Life 3?

1136
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I agree. I definitely agree with that notion.

1137
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I would like to see them back to making Half-Life 3 at this point.

1138
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
More Half-Life.

1139
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Alright, moving on.

1140
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So, there's some other rumors or reports, I guess,

1141
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
regarding some stuff that maybe Microsoft's gonna be showing off at E3.

1142
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And this involves Kinect Play Fit in a device called JUUL.

1143
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Basically, what JUUL is supposed to be is some sort of device that's gonna include

1144
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
a heart rate monitor and other wireless monitoring stuff.

1145
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Like, for example, I would imagine a pedometer or something like that.

1146
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And what it's gonna do is track your, I guess, exercise across all different Kinect games.

1147
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And, um, so, almost like, I would say, like those, uh, oh, I don't know what you call them,

1148
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
but the, uh, the Nike things that they have for, like, the iPhone or, you know, whatever,

1149
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
where you can jog and they'll, you know, keep track of how far you've jogged.

1150
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You mean the pedometer?

1151
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Well, no, I understand it's a pedometer, but it's a little bit more than that.

1152
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's like a heart rate monitor and stuff, and it actually hooks up to these different software devices.

1153
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Um, so that's what they're gonna be talking about.

1154
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And I think that's kind of a neat idea,

1155
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
because then that way you're not limited to, oh, I have to play a fitness game

1156
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
in order to track how much, you know, how many calories I'm burning or something like that.

1157
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Almost reminds me a little bit of, like, what they did with kind of, like, the Wii Fit Plus stuff,

1158
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
where you can, you know, show your progress across a bunch of different things,

1159
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and you have your own dedicated channel for that.

1160
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Um, I can see them doing something similar, maybe built into the dashboard,

1161
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
where you buy this device, maybe it comes with, like, an exercise program or something like that,

1162
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and you wear it for, you know, these different Kinect games, like Dance Central or something like that,

1163
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and not only are you having fun, but you're, you know, tracking weight loss and that kind of stuff.

1164
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Hurray! More weight loss and exercise games for the Kinect.

1165
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Honestly, you know, I think, I mean, they need more of, not only do they need the weight loss stuff,

1166
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but they need, like, dieting stuff as well, like, what should you eat, you know?

1167
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Like a full program, not just, yeah.

1168
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Not just because, you know, weight loss stuff is a good idea, but if you're only doing that,

1169
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
you're not gonna lose anything, so you need, like, you know, they need to also say,

1170
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
okay, here's what you should eat too, and hey, recipes, recipes are nice.

1171
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Tied in with, like, a Windows phone thing or something, I don't know.

1172
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Maybe a tie-in with Fedocracy?

1173
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Sure, why not. Who knows, anything's possible.

1174
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Anything is possible, including an internet browser finally on the 360, what, about six years late?

1175
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
At this point, it's, like, almost not even worth it.

1176
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
How long has the Wii and the, excuse me, the PlayStation 3 had a browser?

1177
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Well, sounds like the Xbox 360 could be getting one of their own if rumors are to be believed.

1178
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Internet Explorer 9, which is weird because I thought they were up to, like, 10, but whatever,

1179
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Internet Explorer 9, having Kinect functionality, is rumored to be coming to the Xbox in a future update.

1180
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You'll be able to search with voice input, just like, you know, the Bing search bar and all that stuff,

1181
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and you can browse the web using Kinect-based controls,

1182
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
which I have no idea how that would be practical or whatever, except maybe, like,

1183
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I wanna go back a page. Whoosh!

1184
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I wanna go back to home. Whoosh!

1185
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Am I just scrolling through pages because you don't have a mouse?

1186
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, you could use a controller for that, but why would you, why would we make things make sense?

1187
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Why do that when you can go whoosh?

1188
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The whoosh should be required.

1189
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't want to whoosh. I do that in private.

1190
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So, a big meh to that, I, I, whatever.

1191
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'll download it and try it once and go, huh.

1192
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I am saying, though, let me be first to, I'm sure I'm not the first,

1193
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
but I'm gonna be the first in the show to venture into that area.

1194
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Um, I can see that there's gonna be some dirty uses for the Kinect-enabled browsing.

1195
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Obviously since it's hands-free, you know.

1196
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Find porn! Go!

1197
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Whoosh! Whoosh!

1198
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Enhance. Enhance. Enhance. Whoosh!

1199
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Next video!

1200
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The Kinect starts scrolling up and down very rapidly. Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.

1201
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We have detected masturbation.

1202
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We are charting your calorie loss as part of the, uh...

1203
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We heard you just say, Kinect video chat. Dark Sakura now calling.

1204
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That would only work if I had a camera.

1205
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Do you have a Kinect? Then you have a camera.

1206
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
My Kinect, Rob, is still in its box.

1207
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Here's a question for everybody. I want honest answers.

1208
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Who likes to put, like, a game box or something in front of their Kinect just in case they're spying on you?

1209
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Cause sometimes I like to play Mass Effect 3 with no pants on.

1210
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You know what, it's my house, I'll do what I want. And I'll sit in that chair with no pants on.

1211
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Well, I totally do that with my Kinect that's wrapped around, you know, that's not attached to anything that's collecting dust because that's how often I use the Kinect.

1212
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But I'm afraid one of these days it'll be like, start party with friends, and all of a sudden it's like, ba-doop, you've started video Kinect. Ah!

1213
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
This is gonna be one day when I'm in my pajamas passed out on the couch while Dan's playing something.

1214
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Cause you've seen how my living room is arranged where we have the couch right in front of the TV and then we have a chaise lounge off to the side and Dan sits in the chaise lounge to play games.

1215
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Or what if, like, it'll just be me sleeping.

1216
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Or what if there's like an awkward moment where you're throwing a party actually in your house and you do not have enough cups to go around and you have a couple girls that are looking for a drink cup and you're like, there's two girls and I only have one cup.

1217
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Oh, embarrassing. That's embarrassing. Damn it. Did not want to see that. Who wants dip?

1218
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Or what if you have a new pet?

1219
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Did anyone bring lemons to the party?

1220
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Ah, shit!

1221
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Or what if you just got a new pet and you say, look, I have a new goat, see?

1222
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You know, that's actually funny enough that you should say that actually is a legitimate concern for my sister whose goats are actually having babies.

1223
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So she would have something that she would, you want to see my new goats, you know?

1224
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
New goat, see?

1225
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Which I still do want a pet goat to eat the grass in my backyard.

1226
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Tiger Claw in our chat says, Skye, what about the Kinect microphone? That thing would be on and they would hear you. You gotta turn that off.

1227
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know what? I actually did turn that off in the dashboard. I'm always afraid it's going to like pop back on or something because, you know, like sometimes I'm playing strangers on Mass Effect 3 and I don't want like, you know, Alan to walk in the room, be all like, honey, the kitty just barfed or something like that.

1228
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And then everybody hears it on the video game.

1229
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Well, we used to have Shermie shit in the hall while we recorded the show, so it's not a big thing.

1230
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And just to let everyone know, Shermie is fine. She's old and smelly.

1231
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
All right, let's move on, please. Another story.

1232
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I got texted.

1233
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
You're supposed to be doing a show, young lady.

1234
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So? Was it my turn?

1235
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, yes. It's your turn. And then release dates coming up.

1236
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That was Becky telling me she was home. She should be listening to the show right now. Becky, listen to us.

1237
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So have you ever wanted a mecha, Rob?

1238
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
A mecha?

1239
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Yeah, you're a mecha, like a Gundam or an Evangelion.

1240
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Can I kill people with it?

1241
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That's what they're for.

1242
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Will I get away with it?

1243
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I have to tell you, because only in Japan, actually not only in Japan, because when I would go to Anime Expo,

1244
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
there are always these guys trying to get donations for building their giant mecha.

1245
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And we're like, no.

1246
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Kickstarter?

1247
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
This was before Kickstarter's. This was like my first AX in 1998 or something.

1248
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But they're doing it in Japan. They're building a 12-foot-tall pilotable mecha.

1249
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And they're using Kinect for running it.

1250
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Basically, it's as far as they actually have a weapon, Rob. It's a water gun.

1251
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Not a big sniper rifle or chain gun. It's a water gun.

1252
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And they're calling it Vaudeville.

1253
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If I shoot that water gun right in your eye, it might hurt.

1254
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah. They're calling it Vaudeville.

1255
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And it looks like it's four-legged, and there's some shots of it in production.

1256
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I mean, it looks really freaking not like a Gundam.

1257
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Can my cat drive it?

1258
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Kitty mech.

1259
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Meow, meow, meow.

1260
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Did you ever play BattleTech?

1261
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
No.

1262
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Well, it looks like old BattleTech stuff.

1263
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
All right.

1264
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But it's neat. But, you know, I want a mecha so that I can use it to go to work.

1265
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It brings up that age-old question. Why?

1266
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And the age-old response, Rob. Why not?

1267
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Why not? Because.

1268
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Reasons.

1269
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm bored.

1270
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Because of reasons.

1271
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1272
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
coming to a gaming store near you in your country,

1273
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
which may or may not include gaming mechs.

1274
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
There's lots of stuff coming out this week,

1275
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
including a small PC title I'm sure no one's heard of, Diablo III.

1276
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
That's coming out this week, both regular and collector's edition.

1277
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
As I mentioned before, Battleship, the newest game from Activision,

1278
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
that will be a blockbuster smash, I'm sure.

1279
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I mean, the source material is excellent.

1280
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and Nintendo DS.

1281
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Also this week, Akai Katana on Xbox 360, if you're a fan of cave shooters.

1282
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Also this week, Game of Thrones on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1283
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Max Payne 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

1284
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
as well as the special editions for that.

1285
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And last but not least, one week from today, Mario Tennis Open on the 3DS,

1286
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
as well as the Midnight Purple 3DS system.

1287
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm sorry. I thought you said Herple.

1288
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Herple to purple.

1289
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I really want that purple 3DS, actually.

1290
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
In case you're interested, apparently next week is when GameStop

1291
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
is going to start selling the Avenger controller.

1292
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You know, if you want to throw money out the window, by the way.

1293
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
What's the Avenger controller?

1294
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The spider controller that I showed that sucked, remember?

1295
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Oh.

1296
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That thing that was...

1297
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

1298
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
First off on the Nintendo 3DS on May 17th.

1299
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
This is a mouthful. Are you ready for it?

1300
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Pachi Para 3D Omi Monogatari 2 Pachi Pro Funruko Hana Kibo 2 Urugiri no Gauken Sekkatsu.

1301
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
What?

1302
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It's basically a gambling...

1303
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Beach Babes Pachinko.

1304
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Beach Babes Pachinko. You got it. That's exactly what it is.

1305
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Sweet.

1306
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And it's on the 3DS, so you know what that means.

1307
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
3DS 3DS!

1308
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Woohoo!

1309
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Because that's the game we've all really wanted on the 3DS.

1310
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
They've already had one of those. They're gonna make another one, too.

1311
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, this one was a sequel.

1312
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh. Well, there you go.

1313
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
That's the announcement I'd like to see from Nintendo at E3 this year.

1314
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Boobs 3D!

1315
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Coming soon.

1316
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Otherwise, honestly, on any other console, I think the release dates are all the way out to the 24th.

1317
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, wait, no. There are a couple things on the Sony PSP.

1318
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

1319
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Regular Edition.

1320
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Uh...

1321
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
What the hell is this game?

1322
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That is literally the name.

1323
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

1324
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Oh my god.

1325
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
This guy is carrying around this little pink bunny and he's sucking on a gigantic Pez candy or something.

1326
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I think it's like a Yowie game.

1327
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I think this is a Yowie game.

1328
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I want it.

1329
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Of course you would.

1330
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I like watching dudes make out.

1331
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I like watching ladies make out.

1332
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I like watching people make out. What am I talking about?

1333
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm gonna just post that in the chatroom and see who's gonna be pre-ordering that.

1334
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
At least there's a variety.

1335
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
See, on Nintendo handhelds this week, you can have Beach Bay Bikinis.

1336
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
On the Sony PSP this week, Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.

1337
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Bunnies and sucking.

1338
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Danzai no Maria La Campanella comes out this week as well.

1339
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't know what this game is either, but it's a little more gothy and dark.

1340
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Dramatic Pose!

1341
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes, Dramatic Pose is the game.

1342
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
This is worth mentioning.

1343
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Persona 2 Eternal Punishment.

1344
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I think there might be a few people interested in that one.

1345
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Finally, a really big title this week.

1346
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Persona 2 on the PSP.

1347
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Eternal Punishment.

1348
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
That's it for Japanese releases.

1349
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Well, how about stuff for the UK?

1350
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
On the 15th we have Pixel Junk 4 AM.

1351
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
On the 16th is Ratchet and Clank HD Collection for PS3.

1352
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And on the 18th, a few things.

1353
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
We have Dragon's Lair for the Xbox 360.

1354
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City for PC.

1355
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And Bruce Willis the Game.

1356
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm sorry, Max Payne 3.

1357
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't think the man looks good.

1358
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
He looks like a different character.

1359
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Bald. Sorry.

1360
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He looks like he's trying to do that Bruce Willis thing.

1361
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm done.

1362
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Alright, just a few more stories before the classic game of the week.

1363
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But first, Loki.

1364
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So Assassin's Creed is being sued by a novelist.

1365
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
John Bisswanger is suing them.

1366
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Because he says that Assassin's Creed stole themes and other things from his book Link.

1367
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Apparently they stole the themes of assassination and spiritual and biblical tones.

1368
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And also the battle between good and evil.

1369
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That sounds awfully generic if you ask me.

1370
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
He's seeking five and a quarter million dollars in damages.

1371
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And basically saying that it could delay the release of Assassin's Creed 3.

1372
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And of course, you know, the response for it is that we understand that many gamers are upset by the litigation.

1373
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And the potential for a delay in the release of the next Assassin's Creed video game.

1374
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And as a result of that anger that had been posting negative comments on Amazon and other forums about our client and his novel Link.

1375
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
However, copyright laws exist to protect the authors and creators.

1376
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And for people to exploit them.

1377
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,000
From others who copy or create works that are under the law substantially similar.

1378
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm sorry. I just...

1379
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm not buying.

1380
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I think there's also something that was very similar to the animus that was in Assassin's Creed.

1381
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think that's mainly the main tie in there.

1382
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But it's kind of stretching if you ask me.

1383
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm sure there's a lot of books that are pretty similar.

1384
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I know. I was going to say, I'm sure there's a lot of books in the world.

1385
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
There's a lot of books in the world.

1386
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I'm sure if you go back even further you might be able to find traces of it somewhere else, right?

1387
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah.

1388
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Surely?

1389
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I don't know.

1390
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Alright.

1391
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Moving on.

1392
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Let's talk about Zynga.

1393
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But no, no, no.

1394
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
This is a story that might make you lull a little bit here.

1395
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Zynga apparently has also filed their own lawsuit.

1396
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It's against French publisher Cojobo.

1397
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Which sounds very French to me.

1398
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
They have a game on Facebook called Pyramidville.

1399
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Zynga ain't having that because what's wrong with the name Pyramidville?

1400
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Oh, Zynga owns Ville apparently.

1401
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Except they don't.

1402
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
They just think they do.

1403
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Zynga says that Facebook users are likely to believe erroneously that Pyramidville is a member of Zynga's Ville family of games.

1404
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That's according to the complaint.

1405
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Given Cojobo's refusal to change their game name, legal action was necessary to defend our famous marks and prevent player confusion.

1406
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Well, I am kind of confused that they have a game that's called, what is it, Dream Tower or something like that.

1407
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And it looks very similar to, you know.

1408
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But apparently, yeah, apparently they own Ville, but the same logic will not apply to Nimblebit who owns Tiny Tower.

1409
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Although I think their game is called Dream Heights, to be fair.

1410
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Dream Heights.

1411
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Still. Still.

1412
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, my mistake.

1413
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, okay.

1414
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Still.

1415
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah, they're gonna copyright Heights now.

1416
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
They just need to get back some of that money they blew on OMG Pop.

1417
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm sorry, but unfortunately they don't own the name Ville.

1418
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I mean, no one's gonna ever side with them in the fact that they own that as a copyright Ville.

1419
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It's not gonna happen.

1420
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And also, Ville happens to be French.

1421
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
You know, French for town, so.

1422
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Well, they're gonna sue them because, you know, it's called Pyramid Town.

1423
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Pyramid Ville.

1424
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And you know what, honestly-

1425
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Mental note, guys, for the new VoG site.

1426
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Bobby, Bobby, if you're listening, we need to cancel VoG Ville.

1427
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That can't happen. No VoG Ville.

1428
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Sorry about that.

1429
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We'll just have to scratch that out.

1430
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It's gone.

1431
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Frisbee in our chatroom at VoGnetwork.com asks, so does that mean Zynga owns the song Margaritaville?

1432
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh, that's a good question you should ask them that.

1433
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Well, they do have a Facebook game that is Margaritaville as well.

1434
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Fifth Dream said they wanted to make a Smallville game and Zynga sued.

1435
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Let's see.

1436
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
One Night Stand said I played Potville on Facebook.

1437
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Do they own that?

1438
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
You know, I honestly, I hope that they lose because it's just like Monster.

1439
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Remember Monster Cables or Monster-

1440
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I don't know which one it was.

1441
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Monster Cables and Monster Energy.

1442
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
They both kind of suck.

1443
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But they sue everybody that uses the name Monster.

1444
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And so, oh, people are gonna get confused.

1445
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Facebook games-

1446
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I'm gonna be the generic guy here and say, you know, they all kind of look alike anyways.

1447
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I mean, I understand that maybe this company may or may not have named their, you know, Pyramid Ville or whatever to get people confused to play their game.

1448
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Um, I don't know.

1449
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
From what I hear though, they're suing them for more than they actually made on that game.

1450
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Like three times as much as they've made on that game.

1451
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And all they're doing is they're just, you know, positioning themselves-

1452
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It was Monster Cable by the way.

1453
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Yeah, well Monster Energy does it too.

1454
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Like they sued Monster Mini Golf.

1455
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It's like, okay, whatever.

1456
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Um, I don't know.

1457
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I just think it's stupid to do that.

1458
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And fuck, it's Karma, bitch.

1459
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You know?

1460
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I mean, you rip all these other people off and now you're getting yourselves ripped off.

1461
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Too bad.

1462
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Alright, let's go to a time when there was no Ville games and nobody owned that name.

1463
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It was a simpler time for video games.

1464
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Dark Soccer's gonna open up the gaming vault and find a video game she deems worthy of being the classic game of the week.

1465
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

1466
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?

1467
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Streets of Rage.

1468
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I can't believe this was never the classic game of the week before.

1469
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I'm always amazed at what you pull up.

1470
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Like, I'm like, no, she had to have done this.

1471
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
She had to. No.

1472
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Wiki says it's not true.

1473
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Another suggestion from my lovely husband.

1474
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, it's a good suggestion.

1475
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Here's a little bit of the music from Streets of Rage.

1476
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
The Japanese name is Bare Knuckle Ikari No Tekken.

1477
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
So, two other games have based their names off of this.

1478
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But I fucking love this music.

1479
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I wanna fucking dance.

1480
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Right now?

1481
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
No.

1482
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So, which I actually have a Genesis cartridge of Bare Knuckle.

1483
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
But when you play it on the American Nomad, it comes through a Streets of Rage.

1484
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Did you hear that?

1485
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
That's weird.

1486
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It must read the region on the device or something.

1487
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It must.

1488
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Anyway, this was the first game, of course, in the Streets of Rage series.

1489
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
There were two and three after that.

1490
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It's had multiple versions. We've had Game Gear, Mega CD, Master System.

1491
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
It came out for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe.

1492
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And there's an IOS version.

1493
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:24,000
There's a comic strip series that appeared in Sonic the Comic that were based off of Streets of Rage 2.

1494
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And another thing about this game is that you know who did the soundtrack, Rob?

1495
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Yuzo Koshiro Squee!

1496
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yeah!

1497
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That's why it's fun.

1498
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
By the way, if you were listening to last week's show, you know it's a big inspiration for Mega Ran as well.

1499
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Indeed.

1500
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So basically, it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up, punch-em-in-the-face.

1501
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
It came out around the same time as Double Dragon and Final Fight, but it was its own thing.

1502
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And you have one special attack per life per level.

1503
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And your power-ups are shaped like police cars.

1504
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And you cannot use your special attack in level 8 at all.

1505
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It doesn't name any of the enemies.

1506
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Only in the Japanese version of the manual do the enemies have names.

1507
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Because apparently they care more than we do.

1508
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You can also play one-player or two-player co-op.

1509
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And you have multiple endings.

1510
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Of course, your enemy is Mr. X.

1511
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
So you can actually end the game as a bad guy if you play in two-player mode.

1512
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So the way that it works is that you get the good ending just for finishing the game.

1513
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The bad ending, like I said, is only in two-player mode.

1514
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
The boss will ask you to join him.

1515
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And one says yes and the other says no.

1516
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And so the player who said yes must prove their loyalty by killing the other player.

1517
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And if the yes player wins and then turns down the boss's offer, then he has to fight the boss alone.

1518
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And if he succeeds on the bad ending, he will be sitting in the boss's chair that says,

1519
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You became the boss, you are great.

1520
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I need a caption of me in a chair that says that.

1521
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You became the boss, you are great.

1522
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And then when the credits roll the character laughs and the word bad end appears.

1523
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
If both of them say yes, the boss will test the player's loyalty by sending them back to an earlier stage.

1524
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And then they have to replay the game from that level.

1525
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So it had a little bit of interactivity to it.

1526
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So the characters in the game is Adam Hunter, who is an ex-cop and accomplished boxer.

1527
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
He's slower but tougher.

1528
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And then Axel, who is an ex-cop and skilled martial artist.

1529
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And he's the middle one, who is, you know, basically all around middle speed, middle other attributes,

1530
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
but he has a weak jumping ability.

1531
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And then there's Blaze Fielding, an ex-cop and judo expert.

1532
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
A little weaker but she is more agile and can jump the highest.

1533
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And her kicks have the longest range.

1534
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
She has throws and body slams. She's always who I use by the way.

1535
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You have the backup enforcer who is not a playable character, but he only comes out during a special attack.

1536
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
He's the one good cop.

1537
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So as far as different versions, there was 8-bit versions for the Sega Game Gear and the Master System.

1538
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The Game Gear version was crap for the record and it didn't have Adam in it.

1539
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:49,000
The Master System version was not actually a port from the Game Gear. It was pretty decent.

1540
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It has a boss on round 6 that is not in any other version and has no two-player support.

1541
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
The Sega actually brought it out in the arcade for the Mega Touch and Mega Play arcade boards.

1542
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And in the Mega Tech version, you play for time, not for credits.

1543
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:16,000
There's different collections that came out. There's Mega Games 2 that had Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi that came with the Mega Drive.

1544
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And again, that was the name in Japan and the UK for the Genesis.

1545
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,000
There was Sega Classics Arcade which was the Mega CD version that had Super Monaco GP and Columns on it.

1546
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And also there was a cartridge version of this too.

1547
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And the voice effects in the game were redone.

1548
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Then there was the Sega Genesis 6 pack that had Streets of Rage on it, the Hedgehog, Columns, Revenge of Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Super Hang-On.

1549
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And the Mega 6 that had Streets of Rage, World Cup Italia 90, Columns, Super Monaco GP, Revenge of Shinobi, and Song of the Hedgehog.

1550
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
There was a version of the Sega Gems collection for the GameCube and PS2.

1551
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,000
They actually took it out of the North American version so that they wouldn't give it a T rating.

1552
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
You can get it on Game Chat by the way.

1553
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And then they're all in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 on the Wii Virtual Console.

1554
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And there was the Streets of Rage by Blaze Europe that was handheld.

1555
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And there's the iOS version. Now this is the thing that has come up on the show before was the fact that there was the Streets of Rage remix.

1556
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
That I believe, and I have it, I haven't played through it, but it was like all three of the games combined.

1557
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Just in, I guess, continuous levels.

1558
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Of course they were asked to take it down so it was stopped, but hey, clearly there are still fans in the series.

1559
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And you can get the soundtracks, which of course we said was done by Yuzo Koshiro.

1560
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And the second one and the third one had work done on it by Multihiro Kawashino.

1561
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So there you go.

1562
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Bare Knuckle, Yukari no Tekken.

1563
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Your classic game of the week.

1564
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Bare Knuckle, or as many of you know it, Streets of Rage.

1565
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
The first one.

1566
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yes.

1567
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Available on the Genesis or Mega Drive and tons and tons of systems after that in various revivals.

1568
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Indeed.

1569
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Alright, we're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere guys.

1570
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We've got more of Orange Lawn's radio coming up in a little bit, including the FUGL question of the week.

1571
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And guess what we're bringing back tonight, we haven't played this in a little while.

1572
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Listless tonight! Woo hoo! And I'll tell you guys the topic in just a little while.

1573
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So stay tuned for part B and more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1574
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Welcome back everybody to the show wherever gamer has a voice.

1575
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday, May the 13th of 2012.

1576
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Mother's Day once again.

1577
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
To those of you that joined us a little late live tonight.

1578
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
A happy Mother's Day to all the gaming mommies who are listening or the geeky mommies.

1579
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Or mother figures in people's lives or pets lives.

1580
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And everybody that somebody or something could call a mother happy day to all of you out there.

1581
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
We are of course live as we are every Sunday night on VOG Network.

1582
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
www.vognetwork.com

1583
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Still kind of a skeleton site there, but lots of exciting stuff to come in the next couple weeks.

1584
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Been starting to see some behind the scenes things of what's being planned and it's going to be a good time.

1585
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
So looking forward to phase 2 which will be around the beginning of June.

1586
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You're not the one having to play in Photoshop Rob.

1587
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
You know what?

1588
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I am heading up the future of the radio, I mean although VOG is going to be more than a radio station.

1589
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Which I think sometimes people forget because that's all it is kind of right now is the radio station and chat room.

1590
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I am going to be heading up the radio station part of it.

1591
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So I am trying to put some of the final touches on the 24-7 music feed.

1592
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I am giving you a hard time.

1593
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I know, but I am just saying that is going live soon and the other shows.

1594
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I spent minutes going through music.

1595
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
If you want to recommend a show for the network get in touch with me.

1596
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
You can find me idling throughout the week in the VOG chat room or rob at www.orangelandradio.com

1597
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
is a great place to email me at.

1598
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I will have my VOG network address set up soon.

1599
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But that's a good place.

1600
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
We are actually not really looking for a lot of more gamer shows.

1601
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Because we have a few now.

1602
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Can we set up a VOG network email account that doesn't get as much spam as we do now?

1603
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Actually yes.

1604
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I have to talk to you offline about how that's going to work.

1605
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But yes, yes you can.

1606
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So yeah, if you have a show that's of good audio quality is very important.

1607
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I especially am looking for live shows.

1608
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It's a huge, huge draw.

1609
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It can be anything about geek.

1610
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Anything geek.

1611
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Music geek.

1612
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Comic geek.

1613
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
TV geek.

1614
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Movie geek.

1615
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Book geek.

1616
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Oh my god a book club show would be awesome.

1617
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Anything that you think qualifies as geek get in touch with me.

1618
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm looking for most of all audio quality and consistency is hugely important too.

1619
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
If you can't be bothered to do the show regularly then we can't make it work.

1620
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But if you're willing to commit, we'll do what we can to help you grow an audience.

1621
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So there you go. Rob at Orensalterator.com.

1622
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Alright.

1623
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

1624
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Get into some gaming news.

1625
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
We need a board game podcast.

1626
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,000
A board, especially, oh my god there's some crazy board games out there with like eleveny billion pieces.

1627
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And I know people that I get invited to these board game parties that some friends of mine have probably about every other month or so.

1628
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And I didn't get to go to the last one because I had a conflict.

1629
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But I went to the first one that I was invited to a couple weeks or a couple months ago and I had a blast.

1630
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And they have like shelves and shelves in their house just full of board games.

1631
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And played some new stuff I never heard of in my life.

1632
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah a board game podcast would rock.

1633
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Wait a second Bobby, no bronies or wrestling?

1634
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I don't know if wrestling is geeky.

1635
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Bronies, let's hear your ideas.

1636
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I wouldn't necessarily say no to that but it's got to be real good.

1637
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Real good.

1638
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Alright, let's move on to cover some video game news.

1639
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Lowkey, rapid fire news.

1640
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So Bioshock Infinite's been delayed to 2013.

1641
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,000
They basically made the excuse that it's to put some more polish on the game and apparently that they're working on multiplayer.

1642
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Because you know every game needs multiplayer.

1643
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It will not be coming out in October as originally planned.

1644
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It is now scheduled for February 26th, 2013.

1645
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So that's when you can look forward to that.

1646
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Certain analysts would let you think that Grand Theft Auto will be coming out that day.

1647
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Or October instead.

1648
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Which, don't get me wrong, I would love that.

1649
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I would love that, love that, love that.

1650
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'd also love it if it comes out in 2013.

1651
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But yes, the sooner the better. That's my theory.

1652
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm just saying though, Bioshock, the delay sucks.

1653
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But at the same time, if they need the time to make the game better, then take it.

1654
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
We have to remember, as much as this news might disappoint, don't rush a game that needs to be good.

1655
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Like this.

1656
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Bioshock Infinite needs to be good.

1657
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So take your time.

1658
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Modern Warfare 3 is getting some new content.

1659
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
They're getting a brand new mode, which is called Face Off. It's meant for one-on-one or two-versus-two kind of deathmatch, team deathmatch type stuff.

1660
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
They're actually putting out four maps, two of which are going to be free.

1661
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And those new maps are Ground and Erosion.

1662
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
The Ground is a map with a run-of-ground ship.

1663
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And Erosion, I don't remember the hell that one was.

1664
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
But it looked cool.

1665
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So that's going to be coming out.

1666
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Also, of course, two more maps that you can buy, which will be also part of the content collection.

1667
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So if you happen to be a paid subscriber of Call of Duty Elite, you'll be getting those for free.

1668
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And, well, you're paid for with your subscription.

1669
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But no additional cost, I guess.

1670
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And those will be coming out on May 15th for Elite subscribers.

1671
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And I guess everybody else on Xbox on May 21st.

1672
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And then Content Collection 2 is also going to include new multiplayer maps, Sanctuary, Foundation, and Oasis.

1673
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And two new Spec-Op missions, including Ironclad and Killswitch.

1674
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Ironclad being one where you get to drive a tank.

1675
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And Killswitch is a sniper and infiltration mission.

1676
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
So, yeah. Looks kind of neat.

1677
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And then, last but not least, we have LEGO Batman 2 coming out pretty soon.

1678
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And LEGO Harry Potter is obviously done with.

1679
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
So, what the hell is going to be the next LEGO game?

1680
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Well, the next series is supposed to be coming out, which happened to be leaked out on the LEGO toys themselves.

1681
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
LEGO Lord of the Rings will be the next series from Traveler's Tales.

1682
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And will, of course, be published by Warner Brothers, since they have the Lord of the Rings license.

1683
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So, look for that sometime this summer.

1684
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And that's kind of neat, I guess.

1685
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I don't know how that would play, but I know it's going to be popular, especially with the new movie coming out.

1686
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Well, yeah. And those LEGO games are kind of always big sleeper hits.

1687
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Like, they might not seem huge to the core gamer.

1688
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
They don't seem like such a big deal, but they're hugely family-friendly games.

1689
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And lots of the family owners get those games.

1690
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So, those LEGO games are always a pretty big deal.

1691
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Except for Rock Band, maybe didn't do as well.

1692
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
It was a neat idea, you know? To be honest, it was a neat idea.

1693
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And it was a game that I got a copy of, just to download those songs for Rock Band.

1694
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yeah, me too, because I found it for like $9.99. I was like, alright, I'll just get those songs.

1695
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And the songs were pretty fucking awesome. So, I don't know, it wasn't so bad.

1696
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, watch out for LEGO Twilight.

1697
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Well, here's the problem.

1698
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It's interesting. The premise is you just sit around and wait.

1699
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah, I was going to say, here's the problem. There's no content to base a game around of.

1700
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I mean, unless ripping off your shirt.

1701
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Honestly, what would be funny for Twilight or something like that is like a microgame thing.

1702
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You know, like WarioWare. Rip off shirt. Brute. Stare at the wall for months.

1703
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
You know, you're like spinning the clock to make the time go faster.

1704
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Sparkle.

1705
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Sparkle. You know, that would be pretty funny. I could see that.

1706
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Doo doo doo doo.

1707
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Block Bella from getting eaten by vampires because she poked herself with a knife and is now spewing blood.

1708
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Alright, you're getting a little too carried away there.

1709
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,000
My wife is starting to read Fifty Shades of Grey and she says it's the worst thing ever. The worst thing.

1710
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Alright, moving on. Wolfenstein 3D. Remember that game?

1711
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Hell yeah.

1712
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Well, if you do remember that game, congrats. You're old because Wolfenstein 3D celebrated its 20th anniversary this week.

1713
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's only been 20 years.

1714
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Yeah, I remember downloading that demo from a local BBS back in the day.

1715
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I remember buying that shareware demo. Well, it wasn't a demo. It was the full first campaign, so it was pretty awesome.

1716
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Yeah.

1717
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
On a floppy disk at a flea market.

1718
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Shareware demos used to be the shit. Yeah, it was all of episode one and then if you wanted episodes two through six, that's what you bought.

1719
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It'd be like getting the full game and then you'd have to buy the DLC later on.

1720
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

1721
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Not bad.

1722
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's awesome. So, anyhow, Wolfenstein 3D. How did they celebrate their 20th anniversary?

1723
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Well, Wolfenstein 3D is now playable in web browsers completely free.

1724
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Wolfenstein.bethsoft.com because Bethesda has the IP now.

1725
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You can also pick it up on the iPhone devices for free. I believe that was only on the actual anniversary, though, which was on the 9th.

1726
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I don't think it's free anymore. I will say this. I picked it up and I played it.

1727
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And, you know, it's a 20-year-old game, but they up-rezzed some things and they added a map to it, which was pretty cool.

1728
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
They did at least make some tweaks to the IOS version. The only thing is it controls, like, shit, like all iPhone games do.

1729
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I mean, what a shocker.

1730
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm not positive, but that may have been the first game I modded.

1731
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I remember an old-ass map editor that you could download, that you could make your own maps, and you could, like, spell fuck out of the walls.

1732
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,000
We used to make crazy maps. We used to make gore mods where we would take, like, a shareware paint editor and just,

1733
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
add more blood, add more blood, add more blood. That was it.

1734
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Or just have the giant room and put, like, 50 enemies in the giant, just, it's all it is, just one giant room.

1735
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
We used to make mazes out of the moving blocks. Like, just put a ton of moving blocks everywhere.

1736
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It was awesome.

1737
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Nice.

1738
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Kingdom Hearts. A lot of people are excited about the Kingdom Hearts 3D version, or Dream Drop Distance.

1739
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Get excited about this. There's going to be a demo coming out.

1740
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
That's pretty cool.

1741
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
The 3D, for the 3DS. That's pretty awesome that Nintendo's embracing those demos a little more.

1742
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It is going to be the Traverse Town demo that's already out in Japan. It's going to be here in North America as well.

1743
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
No clue when, but hopefully soon.

1744
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
They also, they announced some AR cards for that as well, pre-order bonus thing.

1745
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That's right, huh? Is that the Nintendo AR cards where you can get the little pictures of?

1746
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Yeah, it's something that ties in with the game.

1747
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
What they haven't announced yet is there's going to be a collector's edition.

1748
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Is there?

1749
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
There's going to be a collector's edition.

1750
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
What's the collector's edition going to have, Dino?

1751
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I have no fucking clue.

1752
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Alright.

1753
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
There's going to be one.

1754
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Of course there's going to be a collector's edition.

1755
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
They're going to announce it this week.

1756
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Stickers.

1757
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Stickers or something, I'm sure.

1758
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I know it's more than stickers.

1759
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Stickers' theater rhythm got stylus and stickers, but no.

1760
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Okay, so I wasn't too far off base suggesting stickers.

1761
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah.

1762
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Maybe a soundtrack. How about a soundtrack?

1763
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It could be, yeah. I don't know.

1764
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
What's the theme song for Dream Drop Distance?

1765
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I have no clue.

1766
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I don't know.

1767
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Alright.

1768
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
They've always just been kind of using the same one from like, was it one?

1769
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
They're kind of like doing the score version of one.

1770
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Alright, and moving on into what could soon be the trial of the century with one of gaming's most important people, Beyonce Knowles.

1771
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Ugh.

1772
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
After all, she was the spokeswoman for the DS, not the 3DS, but the DS.

1773
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Remember when her and Carrie Underwood were doing those ultra-cute, hey girls play games too, hee hee, commercials.

1774
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
How'd that work out?

1775
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Well, the DS sold 11 billion units, so I'd say pretty well.

1776
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Well, Beyonce told me to buy it, so I have to buy it.

1777
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
That's right.

1778
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I wasn't, I'm not going to play anything Beyonce's not playing.

1779
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,000
All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, give me money.

1780
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Anyhow, Gate 5, you might remember this company is suing Beyonce.

1781
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Why are they suing Beyonce?

1782
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Because, remember, Beyonce was supposed to have like, there was supposed to be like this uber Beyonce music game that was going to come out.

1783
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And Beyonce said, nope, not going to work.

1784
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Gate 5 apparently said to Beyonce, you continue to negotiate right up until the time you pull the plug.

1785
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And the judge said, that's not going to work with me, according to what Beyonce's lawyer said.

1786
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
So Star Power Beyonce was the game.

1787
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Its cancellation resulted in the firings of 70 employees.

1788
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And Gate 5 is suing for 100 million in damages, 6.7 in investment capital, and 100 million in hypothetical profits.

1789
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Hypothetical.

1790
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Hypothetical. Hypothetical.

1791
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,000
So they're suggesting that they were going to sell, that's actually not that much, that's almost like 200,000 copies.

1792
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I mean, that's not too bad.

1793
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Essentially what this decision has done is said, Gate 5 has enough information to proceed to an actual court.

1794
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And it is going to go to court.

1795
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Unless, of course, there's a settlement, which usually when things get this far along will inevitably happen.

1796
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And I'm sure all parties are being strongly encouraged to settle.

1797
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
But as of right now...

1798
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Can you imagine what would have happened to that nameless puzzle game that Paris Hilton was, you know, putting out?

1799
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
If Paris Hilton had backed out.

1800
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Like, it may have sold more copies.

1801
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sagra.

1802
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Okay, other stuff.

1803
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Well, for people who are like me, Hatsune Miku fans, there is a crystal white Vita coming out that's coming with the Hatsune Miku limited edition.

1804
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It's a crystal white Vita with an exclusive rear touch design that has Miku on it.

1805
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
And it will be shipped on August 30th with the next Project Diva game.

1806
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
So, that's pretty neat.

1807
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And then, there's new download content for Dance Central.

1808
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Sorry, Dance Central 2.

1809
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That will be the Spice Girls spice up your life.

1810
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Fuck yeah!

1811
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And then, Hello Good Morning by Diddy Dirty Money.

1812
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest and Florida's Low.

1813
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Who cares?

1814
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And then, moving on, Marvel's Avengers Battle for Earth will be on Kinect and Wii U, Ubisoft.

1815
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So, it's well interesting. It's actually being done by Ubisoft Quebec.

1816
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And you use the motion controls to fight off the scroll.

1817
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Yay.

1818
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
That's it.

1819
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
You know, the whole game idea sounded cool until they mentioned Kinect.

1820
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And it's just like, eh, it's not going to be very good.

1821
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I think they're probably going to base it off their Kinect Heroes game or something that they had. Remember that?

1822
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Where it's like, you're superheroes and you get to fight each other and it's fun with Kinect.

1823
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And then, it didn't sell.

1824
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It doesn't say.

1825
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Hey, Jamie.

1826
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You're having a good time.

1827
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I didn't know she'd feel fine.

1828
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
You know they're going to make you do that too.

1829
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Exactly.

1830
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Hey, let's go to Foogle.

1831
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
We combine Facebook and Google Plus and we get Foogle.

1832
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And that's where we ask you a question every week of our listeners.

1833
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And we read your answers live on air.

1834
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Alright, so we're going to get to a story here about this $99 Xbox here shortly.

1835
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So our question is, how would you feel if the Xbox Next 720 lube, whatever we're calling it, cost $499,

1836
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:34,000
but had a subsidized $299 option for a several year Xbox Gold commitment?

1837
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This is something we hypothesized last week when the story first got brought up.

1838
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Assuming the specs are all top of the line, is the subsidized console something you would consider buying?

1839
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Why or why not?

1840
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So would you buy a subsidized next gen console, assuming it's all the top of the line features you want,

1841
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
say they knock $200 off the price, you know, for a two or three year commitment for Xbox Gold.

1842
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Would you do it?

1843
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
It would not be that different from what they do for the iPhones, right?

1844
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
No, I would not.

1845
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
No you would not, you say?

1846
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
No, I said no I would not and no I would not.

1847
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
No you would not. Why wouldn't you?

1848
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I wouldn't because I've learned well enough from buying in at launches of all these different consoles and stuff

1849
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
A lot of launch titles aren't that great, and you're gonna deal with all the launch bugs and all that fun stuff,

1850
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:27,000
so if I'm interested in buying a console like that, I'm just gonna save up the money that's required to buy outright to begin with.

1851
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Because who knows, if it takes you a long time to save up money, like say for example, you know, $499,

1852
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
are you really gonna tell me that within two years time that console isn't gonna drop in price?

1853
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's gonna fucking drop in price, and you're still paying fucking money for it.

1854
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Alright, well let's get to some answers from Google Plus first, we have AJ on Google Plus says,

1855
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I wouldn't mind, sounds like a good deal.

1856
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's like buying a cell phone for the discounted price in a two year agreement.

1857
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Would you really want to buy an Xbox and not want to use it online?

1858
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Going to some of the Facebook answers,

1859
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Tiara W, we love Tiara from Geek Life, geek-life.com says,

1860
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It would need to be more than just the basic model to make it worth the money.

1861
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
The $99 360 sounded like a good deal, even with the extra $5 a month for the gold subscription,

1862
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
until I heard it was for the 4GB console.

1863
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I can't even put most of my saved games on that little space, let alone save any games to my hard drive.

1864
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Doug T says, I won't be considering buying the next Xbox console system until it is out for at least a year.

1865
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I lost faith with Microsoft due to the Xbox 360 having so many red rings,

1866
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and Microsoft's slow response time to correct the issue and help people out who experienced it.

1867
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Very interesting perspective from Doug, somewhat similar to what you said, a little bit.

1868
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Well, it's just, you know, if I'm going to be that strapped for cash,

1869
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
which I always find a way to buy those consoles at launch because I get excited about it,

1870
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
but let's just say, you know, I'm strapped for cash and I just can't buy it at launch,

1871
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I don't think it's going to be that horrible.

1872
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I mean, I've got a console that I'm playing tons of games on.

1873
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
It's just, you know, not even necessary.

1874
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I mean, they're not going to repeat themselves with the whole red ring of death thing.

1875
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I mean, they're not that dumb.

1876
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And technology's gotten a lot better now.

1877
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I mean, the chips are on, you know, we've got like 20nm chips now that run way cooler,

1878
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
way more power efficient and stuff like that.

1879
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So overheating isn't as big of a problem anymore,

1880
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
and I think that they know that they don't want to do that again

1881
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:36,000
because they're just going to lose all sorts of trust in their consumers if they fuck it up again.

1882
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:42,000
So, I mean, I don't think that's really an issue, but if it's going to be that expensive, though,

1883
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I just have to see what my options are.

1884
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And if there's really something at launch that I have to, have to, have to have,

1885
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
which I don't really know if there's going to be anything at launch that I really, really need.

1886
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'll just have to wait and see what they have and also what it's going to cost

1887
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
and if it's something that I can wait, I can wait and purchase it later on,

1888
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,000
when it goes on sale or when, you know, within a couple years time,

1889
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
you're not going to tell me that you're going to be able to find a used cop,

1890
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
a used system or something like that.

1891
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
There's ways to get it cheaper and having to, you know,

1892
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
since you're going to be stuck in a contract for multiple years,

1893
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
why would you do that when there's an opportunity to either save up money

1894
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
or you just wait for the drop in price.

1895
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Alright, well, let's check out some different answers.

1896
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Peter Uno in our chat room says to, not chat, but Facebook says,

1897
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
to be perfectly honest, fuck yes.

1898
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
If you get a lot of use out of Xbox Live,

1899
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
then it's definitely worth taking the discount on the console.

1900
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
You do end up paying less overall.

1901
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
It only works if you get a lot of use out of your console and subscription though.

1902
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And yeah, the console in question had better be semi-decent too.

1903
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But you're not saving money though.

1904
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
You're spending $40 more than you would have paid separately.

1905
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Well, you know, it would, you know, we, it's,

1906
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
we're making up a hypothetical situation so we don't really know.

1907
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And to be honest, Dart Charger replied and said,

1908
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
having the option, this is a very sensible answer by the way,

1909
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
having the option for a subsidized version doesn't bother me,

1910
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
though I would almost always opt for the one-time fee.

1911
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
The actual value will all depend on the games and features of the unit

1912
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
along with hopefully better reliability on launch.

1913
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That's a very sensible answer.

1914
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I pretty much agree with that.

1915
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
One more answer from Chiggers we'll read here.

1916
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I say it depends on how much the monthly gold subscription is.

1917
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
If that amount times however many months the commitment is,

1918
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
rather than what it would be if I bought the damn thing straight up,

1919
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
then I say, fuck you.

1920
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
If I don't save any money by doing it that way, then why bother?

1921
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
There you go.

1922
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
If I didn't read your answer, sorry about that.

1923
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
We had a lot of answers.

1924
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But send those via email if you feel strongly.

1925
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1926
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And I mean, and if they, if the problem is,

1927
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
they got to know what the other company is doing

1928
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
because if they come out and say, okay, our system is $499.

1929
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You can get it for $299 and blah, blah, blah.

1930
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And Sony's like, well, our system just costs $299, so.

1931
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I have to admit going into that question,

1932
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I kind of assumed I would be in the camp of, yes,

1933
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I would just go ahead and do it because I'm going to get the system anyway

1934
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
and I have Xbox anyway.

1935
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But I kind of think Doug's answer was right on the money because, you know,

1936
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I did rush out and buy an Xbox 360.

1937
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I was tracking what Best Buy in the area actually had it.

1938
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I remember when they were so hard to get when they first came out.

1939
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1940
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And then I finally was able to get one,

1941
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
but it was the one without the hard drive,

1942
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
so I had to buy the hard drive separately and ended up paying like $40 more.

1943
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
And then the fucking thing died on me after a week.

1944
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I was so mad.

1945
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Mine didn't die after a week, but yeah, I remember doing that.

1946
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
So irritating.

1947
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Got mine on Craigslist.

1948
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah.

1949
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Anyway, let's get back into some more gaming news.

1950
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Thank you to everybody who answered the Google question,

1951
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
whether I read it or not.

1952
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
All right.

1953
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Well, let's talk a little bit about, you know, this $99 Xbox.

1954
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Of course, it was rumored last week and it ended up being true.

1955
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
So Microsoft stores are offering it for $99.

1956
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Of course, there's a two-year contract

1957
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
and you're going to pay $14.99 a month for those two years,

1958
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
so it ends up being about $460,

1959
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
which is roughly $40 more than you would have paid separately.

1960
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
But if that's what you want to do, then you could do that.

1961
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
However, it is only through the Microsoft stores.

1962
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You know, remember, Microsoft has actual physical retail stores,

1963
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
21 of them in the United States,

1964
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
and those are the only ones that are offering said deal.

1965
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And now, the thing is, this is supposed to be part of a pilot program,

1966
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
so the whole conspiracy theory that, you know,

1967
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
this may be happening for the next system is not that unwarranted.

1968
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
They're also saying that, right now, I guess,

1969
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
oh, 16 of the Microsoft stores are offering this.

1970
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I thought it was 21. Maybe some of those are out of country.

1971
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I bet you're right. I bet some of them are out of country.

1972
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It must be. I just looked that up real quick.

1973
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I seriously think the closest one to us is in, like, Phoenix,

1974
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
or maybe there's one in L.A.

1975
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
There is one in L.A.

1976
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Yeah, but none in Northern California.

1977
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Bay Area, there's one.

1978
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Is there really one in the Bay Area?

1979
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Yeah.

1980
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Cupertino, I think, has one.

1981
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
How ironic.

1982
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
In their mall.

1983
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I've been to that mall.

1984
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Yeah, I think there's one down there, but that's a close one.

1985
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It was probably about 12 years ago, but I've been to that mall.

1986
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So, I mean, this, yeah, it could very well happen with the next console.

1987
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I think that's what they're testing out.

1988
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
They're seeing a response from this.

1989
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
If that's the case, then they may move forward with, you know,

1990
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
GameStop doing something like this, or, you know, the retailer.

1991
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I don't know.

1992
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Why not Best Buy or something?

1993
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
They could.

1994
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Because they sell the mobile phones.

1995
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I think, if anything, Best Buy would be a good choice,

1996
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
because, yeah, they do the whole mobile phone stuff.

1997
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Even, like, Walmart or something like that, they do mobile phones

1998
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
and that kind of, you know, service.

1999
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Hell, I mean, I don't know.

2000
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
You could get some sort of partner deal with, like, AT&T or something.

2001
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Who knows?

2002
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
All right.

2003
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Well, a lot of stuff going on in the handheld world in regards to price drops.

2004
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
The price of the DS has dropped.

2005
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Nope, I'm not talking about the 3DS.

2006
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I'm talking about the DSi.

2007
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
For some weird reason, for the longest time, the DSi and the DSi XL

2008
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
had still retained their old prices.

2009
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It cost just as much for a DSi XL as it did for a 3DS.

2010
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I know because Alan wanted one for his birth, or, no, for Christmas,

2011
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and I bought him one.

2012
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I was like, you want a DSi XL and not a 3DS?

2013
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
But, I mean, the screens on those things really are gorgeous,

2014
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
so I wish they would make a 3DS XL.

2015
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I shouldn't say that.

2016
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Your wish has been granted.

2017
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Shit.

2018
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Here at E3, we will announce more shit like,

2019
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
hey, you know, we really should have put second analog stick on there.

2020
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Oops.

2021
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
But, hey, you can buy this new system in fancy colors that you want.

2022
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Get it for only $99 when you agree to buy 1,000 Nintendo points a month.

2023
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
All right.

2024
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
DSi is dropping to $100, and the DSi XL is dropping to $130.

2025
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Those prices are effective May 20th, so I wouldn't go buy one now.

2026
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But, you know, that's not a bad deal for a DSi, 100 bucks.

2027
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
They are still pretty good systems.

2028
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
But, I don't know, I kind of think if you're going to invest,

2029
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
you might as well kick it up to the 3DS,

2030
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
but maybe you really want something to play your advanced games on.

2031
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
But the DSi XL is still a pretty good deal.

2032
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That's a $50 price drop, by the way.

2033
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It was $170, now it's going to be one.

2034
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Oh, I take that back, $40, because it's going to be $129.99,

2035
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
which is basically $130.

2036
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
So, there you go.

2037
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Apparently, I think there will also be.

2038
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Oh, this is all happening the same day as the launch of the purple 3DS.

2039
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
So, lots of Nintendo handheld stuff all happening in one day.

2040
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
The Aqua Blue 3DS, on the other hand, it is being discontinued in Japan.

2041
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Now, don't feel too bad for it,

2042
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
because there's already all these other colors in Japan, including black,

2043
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
and I think there's another shade of blue available in Japan, too,

2044
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
like the more regular blue.

2045
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
But it is kind of interesting that they're getting rid of one of the colors completely, I guess,

2046
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,000
especially one of the launch colors, but interesting.

2047
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Maybe it just wasn't selling very well.

2048
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Black Wolf in our chat room says,

2049
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Why did you buy Alan what he wanted? You should have gotten him what he should have wanted.

2050
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I really should do that next time.

2051
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Although, he was standing with me in the store, and I was like,

2052
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
All right, what do you want for Christmas? Pick something.

2053
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
He's like, I want a DSi XL. Really?

2054
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
You answered incorrectly.

2055
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Zonk!

2056
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
You chose poorly. You will now disintegrate.

2057
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Not all the news is about the 3DS, though.

2058
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
There's also news about the Vita's in regards to how many they've sold.

2059
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
1.8 million Vitas sold worldwide.

2060
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That's not bad.

2061
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
That's not bad.

2062
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That's, what, 600,000 since late February when they last reported their sales figures, which is 1.2 million.

2063
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
That's not bad.

2064
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
It's not incredible, but it's not like the system's dead.

2065
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I don't know.

2066
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
All right. Let's go ahead and move on to the mailbag.

2067
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2068
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And we'll choose some of your emails to read here live on air.

2069
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
A few of them.

2070
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I will start at the beginning. We only had three.

2071
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2072
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
One day and 15 hours left. I've been waiting 10 years for this.

2073
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I thought about taking a day off to play, but I can't justify the loss of income.

2074
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm hoping it's a rainy weekend.

2075
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Diablo and Rain go together.

2076
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
To pass the time until the release, I'm playing Dead Space 2, which I bought on Steam sale about six months ago.

2077
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I play at night with my headphones on and a candle lit.

2078
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
My wife gets a kick out of hearing me yell like a girl.

2079
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
It's probably the scariest game I've ever played.

2080
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Any of you play it?

2081
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I'm like Rob with game ADD, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.

2082
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Plus, I heard that the end boss is mind-blowing.

2083
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
See you at the Skeleton King, mysterious turtle. Love the vlog network, kiddos.

2084
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I have not played Dead Space 2, but I've heard that it's super scary.

2085
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Somebody else starts to ask, acidic vampire in chatroom says, excellent game.

2086
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
So you have one supporter there in the chatroom, at least.

2087
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I will be on board with the Diablo 3 train.

2088
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I'll be choo-chooing along too.

2089
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yeah, it helps when the Warcraft addicts are all getting it for free.

2090
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I know, right?

2091
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Next email.

2092
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Hey, OLR. Specifically, I should be addressing both Rob and Shane.

2093
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
What's up with your taste in men? Kaiden is not that fabulous.

2094
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Get off my show.

2095
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I ended up taking Ashley on to Mass Effect 2 instead of Kaiden.

2096
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I've yet to play 3.

2097
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I just feel like there are much better fish in the galaxy.

2098
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Also, Shane needs to call in more.

2099
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Hearing him always makes me giggle, and he's always got something interesting to say,

2100
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
even if it's just to call in and say hello with no particular topic in mind.

2101
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
A show without a call from him just isn't complete for me heart, heart, heart.

2102
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Shane has a stalker fan.

2103
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Don't inflate his ego, for God's sake.

2104
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And you're especially not going to score points.

2105
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Can I finish reading, Rob?

2106
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
No, you're not going to score points when you're dogging on Kaiden.

2107
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Yes, there's all kinds of homo all up in this email. Deal with it.

2108
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I love you all, Ospher.

2109
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I love DarkTetsuya. Gay hate mail. Is this a first on OLR?

2110
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Sadly, no. I don't think it is.

2111
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
This last one is a link, and I'm afraid to follow it.

2112
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Alright.

2113
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
You're here because one of your friends has invited you. Page loading, please wait.

2114
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Uh, no.

2115
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I will say this.

2116
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Thank you for spamming us, listener.

2117
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,

2118
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Ash does have some great scenes in Mass Effect 3.

2119
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
She gets fucking smashed.

2120
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Well, see, I'll probably take her, because I'm going for full-on lesbian.

2121
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Doesn't that? She's not a lesbian romance option, sadly.

2122
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Oh, she might be in 3. I don't think she is, though.

2123
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
That makes my heart hurt.

2124
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Oh, there's plenty of people you can lez up with, if you want.

2125
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That's awesome.

2126
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Aliens, and I will say, I will say this.

2127
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Because that was totally me in Dragon Age 2.

2128
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
There is a, I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say,

2129
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:26,000
there is a very hot, hot woman, a woman of color, in Part 3,

2130
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
that is, she is only a lesbian option.

2131
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Nice.

2132
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And there's a shower scene, that's all I'm going to say.

2133
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Okay.

2134
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Good times.

2135
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Okay. Need.

2136
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And AcidicVampire confirms she doesn't go lesbian.

2137
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
That's alright. Save yourself for, uh, I guess I can say, save yourself for trainer.

2138
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
It's hot.

2139
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Alright.

2140
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Moving on.

2141
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Uh, let's get to the FUs of the Week.

2142
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
That was it for emails, huh? You got a spam email?

2143
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Uh, yeah.

2144
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Alright.

2145
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And good thing I'm on Linux, because they don't make viruses for Linux, really.

2146
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the Week.

2147
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Every week we get ranty.

2148
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Um, FU.

2149
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I have a few, actually, because I'm tired and sore and bitchy.

2150
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So, FU, as much fun as the Komen walk was, I didn't say that I did that on the show yet, did I?

2151
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
No.

2152
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I did the, um, the Komen walk for breast cancer yesterday.

2153
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And, um, apparently since I've started wearing Vibram five fingers, and before I was wearing shape-ups, my stride has changed.

2154
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I found out that I used to walk on the outsides of my feet.

2155
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So when I put on my old shape-ups, because my heel pads for my Vibrams wore out, um, I'm walking.

2156
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,000
First of all, we've had to park away from the start of the walk, so walk a mile and a half to the, no, a mile to the start.

2157
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Walk the three and a half miles for the walk.

2158
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Walk another half a mile to get to the convention center.

2159
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Walking all over the place there and walking back, I have blisters in places on my feet that I've never had blisters before.

2160
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I have one on the outside of my big toe, and of course I've got the requisite one on my right heel,

2161
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:32,000
which is, um, probably another quarter bigger than a half dollar if anyone remembers what those look like and how big they are.

2162
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And then I have one on my left foot on the bottom of my, uh, next to pinky toe.

2163
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
It's just bizarre, and they're annoying and they hurt.

2164
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And then, um, I woke up this morning in so much pain.

2165
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Because I pretty much walked about eight hours, eight, not eight hours, um, eight miles continuously over the course of, uh, two and a half hours.

2166
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So, which isn't bad, but, you know.

2167
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And so I was just in all kinds of pain, and thankfully my husband let me sleep in this morning.

2168
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Dan is, and he woke me up by screaming from the kitchen,

2169
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Omelette du fromage! So that woke me up. I woke up to omelette du fromage.

2170
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:29,000
And, um, I've been soaring grumpy all day, and I've been sort of snapping at people because I've been too tired to articulate properly exactly what it is that I want to say.

2171
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:37,000
The other one goes towards me losing my voice, um, which is now going on two weeks and all the signage drainage.

2172
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And then I'm just hoping that all of this crap is cleared up by the time I go to Disneyland, because I want to go out and have a good time.

2173
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So, uh, also, um, F.U. to, uh, Vibram speed for being way too expensive for me to get before Disneyland.

2174
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Marathon F.U. segment. Loki?

2175
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Um, I guess F.U. to my throat being sore.

2176
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,000
It's really annoying. I hate sore throats. Scratchy.

2177
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I tried honey. It worked for like a minute.

2178
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
No, that's alright. I don't want anything.

2179
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
F.U. to the fact that I've been sick for like five, I'm sorry, were you done?

2180
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I'm done.

2181
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:22,000
F.U. to the fact that I've been sick since like Thursday, and it sucks, and I've missed some important stuff because of it.

2182
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And what also pisses me off, I've really been sick since Wednesday, I skipped work on Thursday and stayed home.

2183
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Friday I went back to work because I had something really important, I really wanted to get done, and I was feeling a little better.

2184
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
But I think because I exerted myself too much, I was really sick again yesterday.

2185
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I'm feeling a little better today, and I'm hoping by the time I wake up tomorrow I'm all better.

2186
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So I haven't taken my pills, and it's time to take my pills, and I'm doing alright, I'm making it through the show.

2187
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
And I'm not as super congested, but just, ugh, go away. Be healed.

2188
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And also F.U. to the fact that our stream apparently went down about five minutes ago and caused a bunch of people to disconnect.

2189
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Because that's never good for retaining your listeners, so I hate when the server fucking burps like that.

2190
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Argh.

2191
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Alright. Anyhow.

2192
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
That's really it for the F.U.s for me.

2193
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Listless is coming up very, very, very soon, but first, a couple more news stories for you guys.

2194
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Oh, actually, this next one's a doozy.

2195
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Loki has a bunch of stories about Kickstarter, right?

2196
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Let's talk about Kickstarter.

2197
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
This is a new segment we're gonna call Give Us All Your Money.

2198
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And we even have an appropriate theme song for this.

2199
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Of course.

2200
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the latest Kickstarter campaigns, because I have a feeling this is not gonna go away anytime soon.

2201
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Kickstarter, the place where you can kickstart any franchise that may or may not need to be kickstarted, or you may or may not want kickstarted.

2202
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Can it kickstart my heart?

2203
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Random amount of money? Yes.

2204
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Battle Chess.

2205
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,000
They're doing a remake for that, which I was completely unaware of, and I thought that series had died off, but oh no, they want to come back.

2206
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
And they're going to Kickstarter to fund multiplayer.

2207
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And, yeah, they're looking for $100,000 for an online experience that includes skill-based matchmaking statistics and leaderboards, achievements, and in-game chat.

2208
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And they're $12,000 with 18 days to go, they're probably not gonna make it.

2209
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I like Battle Chess.

2210
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Too bad.

2211
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
That was the one where the queen would like flat out chop off someone's head, right?

2212
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Yeah, that was awesome.

2213
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
You might be able to get behind something like this. Two guys from Andromeda, SpaceVenture.

2214
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It's the guys that created Space Quest, they're doing a new adventure game, and it looks pretty cool.

2215
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:51,000
And they've got some really popular voice actors, including the original narrator, Gary Owens.

2216
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Rob Paulson, who you may not know by name, but he voiced some of the characters from Animaniacs, as well as other things, including Pinky.

2217
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
And then, of course, Ellen McLean, who you may recognize as GLaDOS.

2218
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I know her from Opera.

2219
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
But she will be in there as well.

2220
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:20,000
You make it sound like you don't know her as GLaDOS.

2221
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Chances of this one succeeding, probably pretty good.

2222
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:32,000
They have 30 days left and they're already at almost $150,000.

2223
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Looks pretty good.

2224
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Carmageddon is trying to come back. They have a Carmageddon reincarnation, which looks terrible. I've got to be honest, man.

2225
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It's a remake of the original game. I mean, I would think if you want to kickstart something, you should do like a brand new game.

2226
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
But anyways, they're doing that, and yay.

2227
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Probably it's going to get funded. They're already at $225,000 of the $400,000 that they need.

2228
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I'm killing the music. The segment's going on too long.

2229
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Sorry, I'm trying to be quick.

2230
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Another one, Redux, which is a sequel to a game called Ducks, which is a 2009 shooter that came out in the Dreamcast.

2231
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And now they're doing one, they want to do this new game for the Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Steam.

2232
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And they need $25,000, which, that's reasonable for a game.

2233
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,000
They're definitely going to hit it. They're already at almost $24,000, and they've got 25 days to go.

2234
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And there's all sorts of neat rewards for that.

2235
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I mean, if you're a fan of shooters, it might be some of them throw your money at it, I guess.

2236
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And then, last but not least, this one's kind of interesting.

2237
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Jason Rohrer, I hope that's Rohrer, I guess, he is putting out a game called Diamond Trust of London.

2238
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
It's actually a DS game. It's going to be a retail DS game. He has the game done.

2239
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
He just needs the money now to make the cartridges.

2240
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Apparently Nintendo has all these, you know, limits or minimums and stuff, and they need $78,000 in order to make,

2241
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I think it's like, I don't remember how many cartridges they're making, a thousand cartridges, if not more.

2242
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:28,000
They're already at $53,000 of the $78,000, just over $78,000.

2243
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
They've got 12 days to go. It may not happen.

2244
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And Diamond Trust of London is kind of like a strategy game, where it has to do with diamond trading.

2245
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
That was, I don't know, it sounded pretty interesting. I actually watched a little video for it.

2246
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Not my type of game, so obviously not something I'm going to buy.

2247
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:55,000
He's done a few other games, too, as well. A lot of the browser games, I can't remember what he's worked on.

2248
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But you would recognize him if you saw him.

2249
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:04,000
So, that's it. That's for the stuff that's on Kickstarter right now. That's notable, I guess.

2250
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:11,000
There's actually a cracked article about six amazing indie video games that are made possible through Kickstarter.

2251
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:19,000
And the first one is Double Fight Adventure, for number six. Number five is Auditorium Duet, which I haven't heard of.

2252
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
It's a music game.

2253
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Yeah, I've heard of that.

2254
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Music game and shooter.

2255
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Sounds like Beat Hazard, which was a great game.

2256
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:39,000
FTL, which doesn't look very interesting to me, but okay.

2257
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I have to go to the next page now.

2258
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Oh, come on. I just thought it was neat because it's kind of related.

2259
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
We've poo-pooed on Kickstarters and I honestly still don't like them. I don't trust them.

2260
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't trust them.

2261
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:03,000
There was one dark side of Kickstarter last week where the people had stolen the art from DeviantArt or what have you.

2262
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:12,000
There's a few, actually. One of the first ones I put money towards, Video Game High School had their first episode this week.

2263
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
It was actually pretty cool. I'm digging that.

2264
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:24,000
It's a neat little web series that they've got going on right now about this high school that basically recruits people that play video games.

2265
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
It's like video games have taken over the world type thing. It's really cool.

2266
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So anyways, that guy, he did Passage, which was kind of a browser game that was popular. It was very minimalistic.

2267
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Between was another one that he did. Sleep is Death, Inside a Starfield Sky, and then he has this new one.

2268
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
But a lot of stuff that's been covered in gaming blogs and stuff like that.

2269
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Alright, well if that website ain't working...

2270
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
It's not loading.

2271
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Alright, that's alright. Let's move on. Anyhow, we have a list list coming up here and it's going to relate a little bit to this story, so pay attention.

2272
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:06,000
There are rumors circulating that Tadashi Sugiyama, and if you don't know that name, he directed a Mario Kart game, Pilotwings, and F-Zero.

2273
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:12,000
He's apparently working on a Wii U game, which is supposed to be revealed at E3 next month.

2274
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And apparently it's one that has not been spoiled in this whole early list or whatever that leaked.

2275
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
That was all speculated titles. None of those were actually official.

2276
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I see. So we'll add this to the list of speculation now, because apparently he is working on a game that's going to be revealed at E3 next month.

2277
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:40,000
No hints on what it is, but if you consider that he has worked in the past on Mario Kart, which has been on the 3DS, Pilotwings, which has been on the 3DS, and F-Zero...

2278
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
One of those looks really like me.

2279
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:49,000
It could be a new IP, granted, or maybe he's been put on one of the other Nintendo IPs.

2280
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:57,000
But, that fanboy in me is still a little excited at the possibilities, right? Am I right? Am I right?

2281
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
That would be awesome. It would be awesome.

2282
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I mean, the last F-Zero game was pretty awesome.

2283
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Yes!

2284
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
It was just a long time ago.

2285
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,000
It's just that the arcade version was surprisingly leaked.

2286
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Here's the thing. Nintendo, sometimes they have really brilliant things that come out, and sometimes they have really, like, just lazy, lazily put together projects that they put out.

2287
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Like, the whole F-Zero thing with interaction with the arcade, where you can unlock the arcade tracks at home by playing at the arcade.

2288
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Or you can take your cars that you make, or your ships that you make to the arcade.

2289
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
That was amazing! That was fucking awesome!

2290
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
And then they just rehash Animal Crossing again.

2291
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
You know, it's just like, I don't know.

2292
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Sometimes I just wonder.

2293
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I think that all comes down to, it's different development teams.

2294
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Some people have it, some people don't.

2295
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Some people just, you know, do what they can to get on by.

2296
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Sorry, I got slowed up in the chatroom here, and it, um, it's screwing me up here, because I really wanted the chatroom for this next segment.

2297
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Oh, did we lose stream again, too?

2298
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I'm not seeing anything from the chatroom.

2299
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I think we pinged out. You might want to reload chat.

2300
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Okay.

2301
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Fantastic.

2302
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
The joys and fun of live radio, everybody. What can you do? Alright.

2303
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Anyhow, we're gonna move into the next segment tonight called Listless!

2304
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
We have lots of theme songs tonight.

2305
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Listless is where we are going to come up with the definitive list, definitive fanboy list on a particular topic.

2306
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,000
You guys in our chatroom are gonna help us out by voting for your favorites.

2307
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Let me remind you how Listless works.

2308
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:53,000
We're gonna come up with a topic, and the topic for tonight I'll reveal in just a minute.

2309
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And then what you do on this topic is, oh, I'm sorry, you guys here in studio, and we'll have a surprise fourth guest on the phone here in a minute.

2310
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:08,000
What we're gonna do on the phone and in studio is come up with our top three answers for this topic.

2311
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
That's gonna leave us a list of 12.

2312
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:16,000
We will then all go around the room and eliminate one from the list, leaving us a list of eight.

2313
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
And then we will put it to a vote in our chatroom for their number one and number two answers.

2314
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And after that, definitive process is done. That's it. This is the list. It's a done deal.

2315
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
There's no arguing. This is what the gamers demand.

2316
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Highly scientific, tested and trued over the past ten years. Am I right?

2317
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Yeah, you're right.

2318
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Here it is. Tonight's Listless topic.

2319
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Oh, actually, let me get our fourth person on the phone.

2320
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Sorry, the whole disconnection of the stream kind of screwed me up here.

2321
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
It's Comcast.

2322
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Apparently.

2323
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Yeah, because we were having an issue, well, I was having an issue loading a page.

2324
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Stupids.

2325
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
All right, let's try to get our person on the line here.

2326
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Hey, is this Shane?

2327
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah, holy crap. You're allowed. I need to fix this.

2328
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Boo, surprise. Hey, it's Shane joining us from Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth,

2329
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
which can be heard not on the VOG Network yet, but soon.

2330
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
www.hoardhouse.com.

2331
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
All about the World of Warcraft, right, Shane?

2332
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
That's actually what I'm playing right now.

2333
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I'm playing the Mists of Pandaria beta because Male Panda's got new hairstyles,

2334
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
so clearly I have to take it out for a test drive.

2335
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Wait a minute. You're not playing Mass Effect for a change?

2336
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't always play Mass Effect, just most of the time.

2337
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Yes, you do. Why is it that on the Warcraft show, you're always playing Mass Effect,

2338
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
and now on the general gaming show, you're always playing Warcraft?

2339
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I don't understand.

2340
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Because...

2341
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I don't always play Mass Effect, but when I do, it's with Kaiden.

2342
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Yeah, what? Oh my gosh. That letter, while it did inflate my ego,

2343
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
how could you bash Kaiden?

2344
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I have to say, we planned this long before we read that email tonight.

2345
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I had no idea that email was in there. That was a late-arriving email.

2346
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,000
We already knew Shane was going to be our fourth person tonight for Listless,

2347
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
and then that email comes in, and here you are on the show five minutes later.

2348
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
What do you want to say to that emailer?

2349
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Thank you for inflating my ego, but you're wrong about Kaiden,

2350
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,000
so it's like, I don't know. I just can't talk to you.

2351
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
All right. You ready to play Listless with us tonight, Shane?

2352
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
As long as it doesn't get in the way of playing World of Warcraft, yes.

2353
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
We'll do our best. All right.

2354
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So here's the topic for tonight, because everybody's dying to know.

2355
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Here's the topic for tonight, E3 Wii U announcement

2356
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

2357
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

2358
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Now, chatters, if you want to give us your suggestions,

2359
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
you can start typing those in our chat room at vognetwork.com.

2360
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I can't guarantee we're going to use your answers,

2361
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
but if one of us ends up having an answer stolen by another host or something,

2362
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
we tend to look to chat room for a little bit of help.

2363
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
So what do you think?

2364
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:16,000
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.

2365
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Let's start with Shane. What is your number three answer?

2366
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Okay. I'm going to have to try to explain this,

2367
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
because my writing it out, I didn't do a very good job.

2368
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
So my number three would be Nintendo announcing a new F-Zero game

2369
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:36,000
utilizing the tablet controller as some sort of like future racing control dash thing

2370
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,000
where you'd press the buttons on the screen to go and break and stuff,

2371
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and then it would have a stand that you could tilt the controller with for tilt controls.

2372
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
How about we just say new F-Zero game?

2373
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
No, because you have to have the rest of that, or else it's just a crappy F-Zero game.

2374
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
How about new F-Zero with tilt control?

2375
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Well, it's probably good. It's a zero.

2376
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Summarize the tilt controls one more time.

2377
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
It would be this mount you put the tablet on,

2378
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
because it would be awkward to have the acceleration and break on the touchscreen

2379
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:18,000
while you're trying to use the crappy controller with the analog nub stick or whatever.

2380
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
So it would be tilt controlled.

2381
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
So it would be like you're standing on a console.

2382
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I see it on Power Rangers all the time. That's where I got the idea.

2383
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
If it's good enough for Power Rangers, it's good enough for Shane.

2384
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Too bad. I shortened the answer to new F-Zero game.

2385
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Fine, whatever.

2386
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Loki, what's your number three pick?

2387
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
All these are going to be kind of similar, except for the last one.

2388
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,000
The first one is going to be a Mario Kart game with track editor.

2389
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's like ModNation Racers with Mario Kart.

2390
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Really, everyone wants anyways.

2391
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So ModNation Mario Kart, basically.

2392
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Something like that.

2393
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
ModNation is a really terrible name.

2394
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Mario Kart game with track editor.

2395
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
What character is most important to have in Mario Kart?

2396
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Mario.

2397
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I mean, like, what would you want to play, mostly?

2398
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Like, as you know, there's a variety of characters that come in the games.

2399
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
They haven't put Samus in there. That'd be kind of funny.

2400
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
It would be funny. That's a good answer.

2401
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
All right.

2402
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Dark Sakura, your number three answer.

2403
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
A Mario Paint.

2404
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
A new Mario Paint.

2405
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Yes.

2406
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Oh, that'd be awesome. Can I change my answer?

2407
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Only if it has the music mode in it.

2408
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
With the cat meow and the dog barks.

2409
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
It has to have the undo doggy, too.

2410
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
So if you make a mistake, you can click on his face.

2411
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Yes. All right.

2412
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
As long as undo doggy's there.

2413
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I can actually see that.

2414
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I mean, if they don't make a Mario Paint game, I mean, come on.

2415
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I agree.

2416
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
They're kind of dumb if they don't make a Mario part.

2417
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Mario.

2418
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I said Mario Party, but they'll probably make one of those, too.

2419
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
All right.

2420
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
My number three answer.

2421
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,000
E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and preorder it that day.

2422
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,000
My virtual console games still work on it.

2423
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
OMG.

2424
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Because that won't happen.

2425
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:06,000
We all know.

2426
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
But it would be nice that all that money I invested on the Wii could, like,

2427
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
somehow carry over to the Wii U and I could take that little tablet, like,

2428
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
into, you know, my bedroom and play before I go to bed and, you know.

2429
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

2430
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?

2431
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Mm-hmm.

2432
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
All right.

2433
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Shane, your number two answer.

2434
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Nintendo announcing multiple colors of the system for launch,

2435
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
especially a blue color.

2436
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Especially blue.

2437
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Especially blue.

2438
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Yes.

2439
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Multiple colors.

2440
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Oh, because I put multiple colors including blue,

2441
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
but I'll put multiple colors especially blue.

2442
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
You could also put most importantly.

2443
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,000
That would work as well.

2444
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I can't spell.

2445
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Rob spiel's will.

2446
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
All right.

2447
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

2448
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Aqua blue or navy blue or what?

2449
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I will take either a midnight blue, a cobalt blue, or a metallic blue,

2450
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
but not aqua blue.

2451
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I support cobalt.

2452
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Loki, your number two answer.

2453
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:13,000
My number two answer, I just had something different too.

2454
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Oh, my number two answer would be that that tablet controller can actually

2455
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
be used as a tablet.

2456
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Like, you know, you can take it as a portable system wherever you go,

2457
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
although that wouldn't really fit in your pocket.

2458
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
But it would be nice, you know, get some more value out of it.

2459
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
There you go.

2460
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
So the tablet controller is actually a tablet and not reliant on being

2461
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
actually near a Wii U.

2462
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Yes.

2463
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
All right.

2464
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Fair enough.

2465
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer.

2466
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

2467
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
How would the tablet work in Pokemon Snap Wii U?

2468
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
See, I would want, like, an augmented reality version.

2469
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Is that where you pick your balls?

2470
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
They could do that.

2471
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I think it has a camera on the tablet.

2472
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
That is true.

2473
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Jamie, you know that there's a 3DS application coming out for

2474
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Black and White 2 that is Pokemon Snap augmented reality.

2475
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Well, I don't have a 3DS, so that doesn't sound good.

2476
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
You need one for it.

2477
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
It's Pokemon Snap.

2478
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Well, send me one, please.

2479
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I'm going to Disneyland.

2480
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
That's more important.

2481
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
All right.

2482
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
My number two answer.

2483
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
I bet I'm stealing Dark Sakura's number one answer right here,

2484
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
but I don't even care.

2485
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I don't think you are.

2486
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I don't even care.

2487
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
All right.

2488
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
My answer.

2489
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

2490
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,000
You're not stealing my number one answer.

2491
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
But I'm sorry.

2492
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
It's a damn good answer.

2493
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:38,000
If they say, bam, Guardian Legends coming back, I'll be, like, preordered.

2494
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Done.

2495
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Sold.

2496
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Give me two.

2497
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
All right.

2498
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
So far we have new F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint.

2499
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
My virtual console games work.

2500
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

2501
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

2502
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Pokemon Snap Wii U and the Guardian Legend Wii U.

2503
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Let's get to the number one answers.

2504
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Shane.

2505
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Okay.

2506
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Okay.

2507
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
This is going to be a complete surprise to everybody.

2508
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Are you ready for it?

2509
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Mass Effect.

2510
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
What?

2511
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
A new Mass Effect game.

2512
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
See?

2513
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:14,000
The tablet would have straps so you could strap it to your arm like an omni-tool, and

2514
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
then it would have a control scheme similar to Metroid Prime.

2515
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So you'd have awesome, you know, omni-tool stuff, and you would have a really good control

2516
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
scheme.

2517
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And I don't care if it's four or whatever.

2518
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
I just would love that.

2519
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
You just need Mass Effect in your life somehow being brought together with you.

2520
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Yes.

2521
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Always.

2522
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Fair enough.

2523
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Fair enough.

2524
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
What a shocking answer from Shane.

2525
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
All right.

2526
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Number one answer.

2527
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Try not to be shocked, but Excite Truck 2.

2528
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I would buy that system.

2529
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
What a shocking answer.

2530
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:54,000
But if there's one fucking minigame in that goddamn racing game, I will fucking burn that

2531
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
console through the ground.

2532
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Is this an official bet?

2533
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
You will buy a Wii U and set it on fire if there's an Excite Truck 2?

2534
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
No, I will not waste my money.

2535
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
But like in my mind, I would, you know, that console deserves a burn.

2536
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I would imagine really hard and hope you were pyrokinetic.

2537
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
All right.

2538
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

2539
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
All of my answers have been like legit and not smartassy.

2540
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
So, I said DJ Max Technica.

2541
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
That was going to be my number two.

2542
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Because, yeah.

2543
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
All right.

2544
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

2545
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Yeah, I could see that.

2546
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
And totally doable.

2547
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,000
And totally doable.

2548
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Mm-hmm.

2549
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Okay.

2550
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Or at least, at least, a game that's very similar to an Elite Beat Agent.

2551
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Like an Elite Beat Agent.

2552
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Yeah.

2553
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Yeah.

2554
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I would say an Elite Beat Agent's Technica style.

2555
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Do they have multi-touch on that thing?

2556
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Because I think it's supposed to be just like the DS screen.

2557
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
I think it's just like a DS screen.

2558
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
It's not like an iPhone or anything like that.

2559
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Technica won't work.

2560
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I could make mine, oh, Shitataka and Olendon.

2561
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
You want to change it from Technica to EBA?

2562
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Well, you know, that type of game.

2563
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
How about Technica or EBA?

2564
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Okay.

2565
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Well, just honestly, I liked Olendon better than EBA because I thought the cheerleaders

2566
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
were funny.

2567
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
All right.

2568
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Well, look at all these serious answers here.

2569
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
My answer is very serious.

2570
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
My number one answer is very serious.

2571
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And it is a very practical use of the Wii U technology.

2572
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
You can have one thing on the television and you can have one thing on the tablet that

2573
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
sits on your pants.

2574
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Okay?

2575
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So my number one answer for my number one game I won.

2576
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
You mean like using the GBA back in the day?

2577
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Sort of.

2578
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,000
My game that I want more than anything is called Porn on My Pants.

2579
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And what happens is that on the TV screen, it looks like you're playing something really

2580
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,000
cute and chibi, like you're playing like a new Pokemon game, but on your pants, porn.

2581
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
And whatever porn you could possibly imagine.

2582
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
You want straight porn?

2583
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Fine.

2584
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
You want gay porn?

2585
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
You want five people going at it at once?

2586
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Fine.

2587
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Anything you're into is available through the various DLC.

2588
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Human Sent to Porn.

2589
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Human Sent to Porn, if that's what you're into, fine.

2590
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Midget Porn, go for it.

2591
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Do you know that old person porn is very popular in Japan now?

2592
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I don't care.

2593
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Alright, porn.

2594
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Porn.

2595
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Not in my version of Porn on My Pants.

2596
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
That shit will stay out.

2597
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Alright, so Porn on My Pants is my number one answer.

2598
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Alright.

2599
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Here we get to the very hard part of Listless.

2600
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
You said hard right after you talked about porn.

2601
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:22,000
It's just a necessary part of the game that we play here.

2602
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,000
By the way, let me read some of the answers from chat because there were some great answers

2603
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
from chat here.

2604
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Tiger Clawed.

2605
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Nyan Cat the Game.

2606
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Act Def'd.

2607
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Mass Effect.

2608
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Weeology.

2609
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Act Def'd said Steam Integration on the Wii U.

2610
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Act Def'd President Cat Wii U.

2611
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Black Wolf Mother Wii U.

2612
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Raginator, a limited edition ABBA and Rocky Horror themed console.

2613
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
SSJ-100 Matt, Goat Say Me for Wii U.

2614
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
SSJ-100 Matt, Ultra Kade Wii U.

2615
02:20:52,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Raginator, Sky Barbie Horse Adventures Wii U edition is the pack in game.

2616
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
World of Warcraft Wii U is Act Def'd.

2617
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Frisbee says Dreamcast 2.

2618
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Going back to an old Listless, but unfortunately none of those answers made the list tonight.

2619
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
One of my other considerations, Rob, was a boob game.

2620
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
There you go.

2621
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Bobby also says automatically allocates 1 million sales of Eye of Judgment.

2622
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I'm afraid that that will never happen.

2623
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Yeah, actually the bet was officially closed a couple years ago, too.

2624
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
It's just, they're not making it anymore.

2625
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Very sad.

2626
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Alright, so here we go.

2627
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Here we go.

2628
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Now's the time where we're going to go around and eliminate one answer from the list.

2629
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
And the list as it stands right now.

2630
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
New F-Zero game.

2631
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Mario Kart Wii with track editor.

2632
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Or, excuse me, Mario Kart with track editor.

2633
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
New Mario Paint.

2634
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
My virtual console games work.

2635
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Multiple colors, especially blue.

2636
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

2637
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

2638
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

2639
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.

2640
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Excite Truck 2.

2641
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
DJ Max Technica or EBA.

2642
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
And porn on my pants.

2643
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Shane, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2644
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Because I don't think Nintendo would get it right.

2645
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Porn on my pants.

2646
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I knew you would erase that, you ass.

2647
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
But, Nintendo doesn't know how to make anything mature.

2648
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Ever.

2649
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:20,000
So, would you want something so terrible as to taint the name porn on my pants?

2650
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:27,000
It could be their breakthrough hit.

2651
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Right.

2652
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I just don't have faith.

2653
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

2654
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
It is stricken from the list and I'm mad at you forever.

2655
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Alright.

2656
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2657
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Pokemon Snap Wii U.

2658
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Because it's something that they could really just include into a new Pokemon game.

2659
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Which they're doing apparently.

2660
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Yeah.

2661
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Alright, it is stricken from the list, unfortunately, for Dark Soccer.

2662
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
But, Dark Soccer, here's your chance for revenge.

2663
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2664
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I'm above revenge, Rob.

2665
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
What are you talking about?

2666
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Excite Truck 2.

2667
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Because I didn't give a shit about Excite Truck 1 and that's not enough to make me buy one.

2668
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
That's because you never played it.

2669
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I played it.

2670
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I didn't care for it.

2671
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Alright, let's see.

2672
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Then, to be fair, I need to get rid of one of Shane's answers here.

2673
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Ooh!

2674
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I'm getting rid of multiple colors, especially blue.

2675
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Oh, come on!

2676
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Because I actually like the rest of the answers.

2677
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,000
And, I'm sorry, we need a purple.

2678
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
You know I might get the purple one for my birthday because I can't tell the difference

2679
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
between the color.

2680
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
So I'll trade in my aqua blue one for that one.

2681
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
It's gonna be awesome.

2682
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Alright, so we have narrowed down the list for your voting pleasure.

2683
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Here's a recap and you guys can place your votes.

2684
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom at vognetwork.com, type slash MSG space SKIE,

2685
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
my name's Sky, and your vote, your number one and your number two answers.

2686
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Here is the list that you can pick from.

2687
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
New F-Zero game.

2688
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Mario Kart with track editor.

2689
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
New Mario Paint.

2690
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
My virtual console games work.

2691
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

2692
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
The Guardian Legend Wii U.

2693
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.

2694
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And DJ Max Technica or EBA.

2695
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
There it is.

2696
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,000
We will tally up your votes and have those real soon.

2697
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
A little later on when we start taking calls.

2698
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So that's it.

2699
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Shane, anything else you want to talk to us about or say before we let you go?

2700
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I don't know.

2701
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Probably not.

2702
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Alright, well then I guess have fun with pandas.

2703
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I will.

2704
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Goodbye.

2705
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Alright, bye.

2706
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Well that should make Shane's one fan very happy that he was there on the show.

2707
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Playing listless with us.

2708
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Black Wolf is accusing us, by the way, of not enough lols tonight in the match game segment.

2709
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Not enough lols.

2710
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
We did not bring the lols tonight.

2711
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Sorry to hear that.

2712
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Well you know what?

2713
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
We can't be funny all the time.

2714
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I spend a lot of my funny.

2715
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
But Loki's funny looking all the time.

2716
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
That's true.

2717
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Kind of Amish.

2718
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I don't know.

2719
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I think he looks kind of Amish.

2720
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
A little bit maybe.

2721
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
We need to get you a black hat and some buttons.

2722
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Alright, let's do a couple more news stories for you guys.

2723
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Then we're going to get to the Skype line and we'll get to the results of listless as well.

2724
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Dark Sakura I think we're on right now.

2725
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Well, it's just a big pile of shit.

2726
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:21,000
The court in Holland has ordered that a particular Pirate Bay supporter stop publicizing a work around for the ban that was there.

2727
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
It's called the Dutch Pirate Party.

2728
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
They've been publicizing ways to circumvent the ban on Pirate Bay.

2729
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And as reported by the BBC, the judge also said that it ceased offering a proxy service so that Dutch Pirate Bay users could access the torrents without having to link the site.

2730
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I mean, not really surprising that they try to stop it.

2731
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:46,000
But it's more and more people finding a way.

2732
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:51,000
But honestly people could find a way around it on their own if they were creative.

2733
02:25:51,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Also, the group's UK branch is actually offering more of a proxy for the country-wide ISP block.

2734
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So, that's it.

2735
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:13,000
The party's campaign officer actually said that they received 2 million hits in over 24 hours.

2736
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:23,000
And, of course, the legal campaign in the UK is being spearheaded by the British Phonographic Institute.

2737
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
That's old school there.

2738
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Phonographic.

2739
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Phonograph.

2740
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
And then here's something really funny.

2741
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So, people that play Battlefield 3 are having issues finding servers to actually play their game on.

2742
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
You know how you pay those online passes and then you can't connect to a game?

2743
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Fan-fucking-tastic.

2744
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,000
And so, what's ending up happening is apparently you remember that they announced that you can rent servers from EA.

2745
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Well, apparently the rentals have been so popular that there's not enough servers to go around anymore.

2746
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Because being smart and having a certain amount of servers available to regular players versus opening up tons of servers so that you can make more profit.

2747
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
You know, enjoyable experience versus profit.

2748
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
They went with profit.

2749
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
So, apparently that's an issue.

2750
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And they're saying that, of course, they reserve a percentage of the servers for players who prefer to connect through dice-hosted servers.

2751
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
But they won't say what percent of that.

2752
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
And they're also saying that a lot of the servers appear unavailable.

2753
02:27:44,000 --> 02:28:00,000
In fact, some people are having trouble connecting to a server so long that it's taking them an hour to connect to a game without having to try to connect to one of these private servers which you may or may not get kicked from because it's a private server.

2754
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:03,000
That kind of sucks. Money first.

2755
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I know, that's kind of weird.

2756
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:11,000
It's kind of like, sorry, you can't come here because we already rented it out for so-and-so's birthday party.

2757
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:20,000
For that guy who runs MegaUpload.com or whatever his name is, rented everything for his private parole party.

2758
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, they're saying that basically people are looking for just, you know, to play the regular game types without any sort of custom stuff.

2759
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
And, you know, one guy's saying, I rarely got kicked from a dice server.

2760
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:38,000
And it says, you know, but once the rented servers bit took off, got kicked quite a bit.

2761
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:46,000
And it's damn near impossible to find an official server in that many of the rented servers features are games with server requirements.

2762
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I don't want to play Team Deathmatch to 500 kills or Conquest to 700 tickets.

2763
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
So, you know, they're basically saying, no, they're not shutting down servers.

2764
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:07,000
But, you know, if dice managed servers appear offline, it's because they've been rented and customized by players.

2765
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Custom servers have always been extremely popular at Battlefield PC players.

2766
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,000
With Battlefield 3, we introduced the custom server program to console gamers.

2767
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Response has been overwhelmingly positive.

2768
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.

2769
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:27,000
But just remember that when you're paying for your online pass for your used game that you're not going to necessarily get online.

2770
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2771
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
And you might have played Kid Icarus Uprising at this point on the 3DS.

2772
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And if you haven't, you really should, because it's a good game.

2773
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Except for the whole, your hand will cramp in 20 different ways.

2774
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:54,000
However, it's kind of sad to hear that they're not going to get a chance to redo the controls in a sequel.

2775
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
They will not be doing a sequel.

2776
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:06,000
The staff behind Project Sora, which is, you know, really the same people that made Super Smash Brothers, and the various versions, have said that they're not going to be doing a sequel.

2777
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Mashihiro Sakurai, who of course is the brains behind it, said, quote,

2778
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
If by lasting universe you mean to ask if there's a sequel, the answer is no.

2779
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:23,000
We pushed a lot into the game in order to let people have this short yet deep experience, but the novelty of that would likely grow thin in the next game.

2780
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:29,000
For now, my thought is that perhaps we'll see someone else besides me make another Kid Icarus in another 25 years.

2781
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Yikes.

2782
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:38,000
At least they tried to make it so that they'd have a ton of replayability on it, but I'm sure they're busy with, you know, Smash Brothers.

2783
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Exactly. Exactly.

2784
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
So sadly, that will not be coming out any time soon.

2785
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Hey, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2786
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:54,000
The phones are open, so go ahead and give us a call if you want, and let us know your thoughts on tonight's news or anything else that you wanted to share.

2787
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:02,000
We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute, but first I was going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories, so I can tally up these last few listless votes that came in.

2788
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:12,000
This is kind of funny. Apparently they have a pre-order bonus for The Amazing Spider-Man coming out in June, where you can play as Stan Lee.

2789
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Like, actually as Stan Lee in the Spider-Man game. And of course he has, you know, some of the powers that Spider-Man has, and he is searching, or he's hunting down, I guess, script pages from his next movie or something.

2790
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2791
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
It's the one and only Rama.

2792
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Of course it is. How you doing, Rama?

2793
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I'm pretty good. Alive, but okay.

2794
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Should you not be alive? Did you have a weekend filled with devious things that could have got you killed?

2795
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Yes, it's called Staffia Convention, where I tweaked my knee.

2796
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Touché.

2797
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Yes. Or as I was saying at the end of the rave last night, I was raving like nobody else's business until I took a glow stick to the knee.

2798
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
When will that meme die?

2799
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Not anytime soon.

2800
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I did put that call out on Twitter as to what game should I play next now that I finally beat Mass Effect, and it looks like I'm gonna do Skyrim.

2801
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
No, don't.

2802
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
No, I have to. I bought it, and I really liked it.

2803
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:29,000
It's one of those endless games, and poor Alan's gonna be a gamer widow. We can't have that.

2804
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Alan's been the one playing it.

2805
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:42,000
He's been the one playing. Okay, Alan got to the point where he beat every single quest in Skyrim, save for the ones that are automatically generated, and he knew which one those were.

2806
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
He beat them all.

2807
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Mmm.

2808
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:53,000
So, just saying, I ain't the widow. I mean, he ain't the widow. He should sympathize.

2809
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I just want to play the main quest. I don't want to do all the science stuff.

2810
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
For the record, I do have to say that I found one good surviving remnant of that meme.

2811
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
What?

2812
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I was like, I used to think Hawkeye was useless, but then I took an arrow to the knee.

2813
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
That one was good.

2814
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
So, Rama, what did you really call to talk to us about tonight?

2815
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I want to talk about this Xbox 360 deal. It's just something I was thinking about that doesn't kind of make sense, but it kind of does, when you're trying to compare it in a way of, like, a subsidized cell phone.

2816
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Now, if you pay $200 for your smartphone, and you have to pay the bill every month, and if you happen to terminate the contract, you have to pay this fee.

2817
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Now, let's say you don't pay that bill for that month. They'll let you slide.

2818
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Second month, not so much. They cut the phone off, and the phone is rendered useless.

2819
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Right.

2820
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Now, with Microsoft, you pay $99, and you pay $15 a month.

2821
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Now, let's say you don't pay the bill for the first month. They let it slide.

2822
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
And you're paying the bill for the second month. What's going to happen?

2823
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,000
You fire your 360. We already know that your live account is canceled.

2824
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,000
But what else is going to happen? Are you going to get a little pop-up to say that you can't play a console unless you pay the bill?

2825
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Maybe. I mean, maybe the technology is not there yet, but it's something that they could implement for the next round of consoles.

2826
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I believe there is some type of $299 fee that you have to pay, or you have to pay some type of big fee for the early cancellation,

2827
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,000
which basically amounts to the rest of the cost of the console on its own, plus the Kinect.

2828
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:37,000
And they would automatically charge it against whatever credit card they have on file for you, or send your ass to collections, for all I know.

2829
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Well, that I do see happening, but I'm just going to be amused at where people are going to start complaining where they forgot to pay the bill.

2830
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:52,000
You get this pop-up with your 360. You cannot play a console unless the bill isn't paid. Please call this number, you know.

2831
02:34:52,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Well, think about, you know what, this is somewhat modeled after, one could argue, and that is the Blizzard blood pact that came out at the end of last year.

2832
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
If I were to suddenly stop paying my World of Warcraft bill, they would shut off my Diablo 3.

2833
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
They can do that. You just shut it off.

2834
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Yeah, I can see Microsoft doing where they do this, and you activate your account, like a special extra software gets loaded onto your console where they actually monitor, where if you don't pay the bill, that happens.

2835
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:29,000
That sounds like one of those low credit cars, where it won't start if you haven't paid the bill.

2836
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Mm-hmm. It's scary, but the next round of consoles could have that technology if they decide to go with this. Of course, that's a big if, but we'll see.

2837
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
And somewhere in the corporate offices of Rent-A-Center, they're going, why didn't we think of this?

2838
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Why didn't we think of this? That's alright, Rent-A-Center still gets to do the televisions and all the stuff that, you know, you have to play the video games on.

2839
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I had one of those. Did I tell you that?

2840
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
No. You feel like sharing?

2841
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Sure. I wish I still had it, but as a birthday gift when I was 12, me and my great-grandma went to Rent-A-Center. She bought me a 20-inch TV with a built-in Nintendo from Sharp Electronics.

2842
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I didn't realize they ever made TVs with built-in Nintendos.

2843
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Yep.

2844
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Huh. Okay.

2845
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Man, I had it for years, but back in, I believe, 2005, I had to sit it out on the side because the tube went and I had paid to get it fixed like twice and it kept going out.

2846
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Wow. Alright.

2847
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Are you talking about the C1 NES TV?

2848
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
What was that?

2849
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
The C1 NES TV.

2850
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I believe so, yeah. And I think in Japan, Sharp actually had a Super Nintendo, a Super Famicom version of that as well.

2851
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
There was one.

2852
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:53,000
ActDeft in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says Kmart had them. You know what? Kmart probably still has them if you want to go check it out.

2853
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:59,000
If they did, I will buy one right now because the only place I saw them at the time was Rent-A-Center and where I lived, there was no Kmart.

2854
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I keep forgetting those places like Rent-A-Center exist.

2855
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I posted a link to that in the chatroom.

2856
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Oh my gosh. That's so cool. I never realized they made those.

2857
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Oh, mine was slightly different from that one. Mine was slightly different. It was taller. After the call, I'll find a link and I'll post it, but yeah.

2858
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
That's still pretty rad. Alright, Ramo, we ought to let you go so we can get some more calls. Take care, buddy. Okay?

2859
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Ain't no problem. Take care.

2860
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Alright, bye. Any other last minute stories to cover? I do have a couple Twitter things I can do.

2861
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Chris Sharp made another thing called the Twin Famicom that came out in 1986, only released in Japan, and it's the combination of the Famicom and the disk system in one piece of hardware.

2862
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you need to get ahold of us that way. Anything else, Loki? Are we done with last minute stories? There's a bonus 25 minutes of Cave Johnson in the DLC for Portal 2.

2863
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Good lord, monologues or what? Yeah, pretty much. It's all stuff that they recorded, especially for that. It's brand new stuff.

2864
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Oh, wow. You can listen to it on YouTube. That's pretty cool that they got him back in to do that.

2865
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Yep.

2866
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Alright, going to a few tweets at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Eric RPG on Twitter sent us a tweet with a link from this game from the I Wanna Be the Guy dev.

2867
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Oh, I'd heard about this. This is like the Castlevania-esque game, isn't it? I'm looking at the link right now that he sent us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2868
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:35,000
And I wanna say I heard about this.

2869
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:39,000
I just found a Twin Famicom on eBay for 57 bucks.

2870
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
That right there is the trailer for Union High School.

2871
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
He sent us to a link. Oh, there it is. Right here. Here it is.

2872
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I don't know why, but the link he sent us didn't work and it sent me to the main page of Destructoid because he linked me to the story over there.

2873
02:38:49,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Oh, wow. That does look a lot like Castlevania. But that's what he's making. A Castlevania-esque platformer. It's called Brave Earth Prologue and it's an homage to old school Castlevania.

2874
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
We could use more homages to old school Castlevania, to be quite honest.

2875
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Or homages to, like, say, Guardian Legend.

2876
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Guardian Legend. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's a very 8-bit style game. That's pretty cool. It's gonna appear on Steam and other services for 5 bucks.

2877
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,000
That's a really good deal, actually. I'm liking the way that looks. Thank you for sharing that.

2878
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I will probably pick that up. You can't beat 5 bucks.

2879
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Alright, let's see. Going to Tiger. Oh, let's go to the phones. Phones are lighting up. Why not? Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

2880
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Hey. Hey. Who's this?

2881
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
This is Zaku.

2882
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Hey, Zaku.

2883
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I'm calling for my cell phone.

2884
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Are you calling for your cell phone?

2885
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
I'm calling for my cell phone.

2886
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
What's up?

2887
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Nothing much. I guess I want to bring the fact that E3, the way we know E3, may not be the same this year.

2888
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,000
What makes you say that?

2889
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Hello?

2890
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
What makes you say that?

2891
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Yeah. Well, because of the recent article that was published where the notable figures such as THQ, Nintendo, even Sega are not even present this year.

2892
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:25,000
So it's kind of like a scare piece in the sense that the lack of these developers are actually going to be a much more lackluster E3 this year.

2893
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Do you think a lot of developers are starting to realize, and publishers really, in this age of the internet and everything, maybe they don't need E3?

2894
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I mean, I guess I probably beat this subject before, but mobile might be eating at some of these companies, like Nintendo in particular.

2895
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Well, and Facebook games.

2896
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Zinga's showing for the first time this year.

2897
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:54,000
What was that?

2898
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Zinga's showing for the first time this year.

2899
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I mean, most of their games, they're going to be all browser-based, but I guess it goes beyond what we typically expect from the developers and the folks that make console games.

2900
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,000
I guess it's kind of like branching out from the old guard.

2901
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:21,000
It's an evolutionary shift in gaming.

2902
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:27,000
I don't think consoles will ever die out because there will always be a market for those AAA titles.

2903
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:33,000
However, you're going to see another emerging in the form of casual through either mobile or browser-based.

2904
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:49,000
So this is where, you're right, Zinga and any other smaller mobile publisher can make inroads due to the fact that these heavy hitter developers are no longer showing up this year or sitting out E3.

2905
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,000
We've been seeing that develop over the past few years where the casuals are, especially Facebook.

2906
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I think, yeah, Facebook and iOS games and Android really to an extent too are just the three that are really gaining steam and have almost made up what is this new platform of sorts.

2907
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
At least there are two new platforms really.

2908
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I would say Facebook and then mobile are just the platforms that now compete with the Vita and the 3DS.

2909
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Exactly. I remember mentioning this before, but in a couple of years, the next two to three years, you might actually have parity.

2910
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
You're going to get to the point where they're going to converge.

2911
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Your Vita and your 3DS are going to converge against whatever Apple is offering, whatever is being offered, whatever high-end Android phone will still be out there.

2912
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:44,000
And whatever other platform, you know, scales along.

2913
02:42:44,000 --> 02:43:02,000
You know, if you're a parent out there looking to get a portable game console for your kid to shut them up on long car rides or whatever, you've got to admit, you put a Vita next to an iTouch, which is just the iPhone without the phone, and they're about the same price, and yet the games on one are 99 cents.

2914
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Right. And even then, it's like when you throw in the iPad in there, you let your kid use your iPad.

2915
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:16,000
That pretty much keeps them distracted at that point.

2916
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Ah, but Shadow Next Gen in our chatroom has a good point.

2917
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:24,000
iOS games will never be as good as core games as long as they rely on those virtual controls.

2918
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Now, an 11-year-old probably doesn't care, but true for the college gamer and even high school gamer and so forth, they're going to care a little more.

2919
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Right. They are. That is true, but, you know, and the way I see it is this.

2920
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:49,000
In the next three years, physical buttons may not be as prevalent in any new platform, as long as they get the tactile feel down to it.

2921
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I know it's going to be a growing thing, but think about it.

2922
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:02,000
I mean, the next evolution besides hardware will have to be some sort of virtual control, something that isn't there, but you touch it and it does something.

2923
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:10,000
But it's a lot better. It's either on parity with the hardware button or has more of a natural feeling.

2924
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Zaku, before we let you go, what do you think will be the biggest shocker out of E3 this year?

2925
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Well, I mean, we use definitely not in the cards. I'm thinking whatever Microsoft has up their sleeve.

2926
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:37,000
And, yeah, not even Sony, I don't even think, because as I said, there isn't a lot of buzz going around of, you know, what actually might steal a show at E3.

2927
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:47,000
It could be some other browser-based developer. It could be a mobile developer creating something for multiple platforms that will create a hit.

2928
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Like Rovio, for example, they're trying to branch out beyond Angry Birds, create a new franchise.

2929
02:44:53,000 --> 02:45:01,000
So, you know, that might be something as an example, but think if Microsoft might have something up their sleeve.

2930
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I wouldn't put it past me that they're actually going to reveal the success to 360 or at least hate to it.

2931
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
We'll see. That's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but we'll see.

2932
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
All right, Zaku, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy, okay?

2933
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
All right, have a good one.

2934
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:19,000
You got it. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to try and get through here in the last minute or so.

2935
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:28,000
One story I wanted to read real quick from Tigerclaw on Twitter. I missed this story earlier in the show, but GameStop apparently cutting down on PSP games.

2936
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:35,000
A quarter of the stores will no longer sell PSP games. Please note that's not the PlayStation Vita, that's PSP.

2937
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:41,000
So this shouldn't be too big of a surprise, as obviously the Vita is now rolling into probably a lot of that old shelf space.

2938
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Not really any more PSP games coming out anyways.

2939
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:49,000
That's right, so that's kind of on its way out. I would still think there'd be a demand for used games, somewhat.

2940
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Yeah, but it's going to be a lot smaller. They can shrink that down.

2941
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Right, and they didn't get rid of all the stores, just a quarter of them, so I imagine some of the little stores.

2942
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:01,000
The bigger locations will still carry PSP games as well as the website GameStop.com.

2943
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:07,000
So chances are if the GameStop near you is small and doesn't have a lot of shelf space, they were probably one of the 25% that got rid of them.

2944
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Alright, it doesn't look like our phone line's lighting up, and it's getting to be about 9 o'clock here on the West Coast, so I'm going to go ahead and close that up.

2945
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:19,000
And we need to get to listless results. You guys ready for listless results? Because it was very interesting tonight.

2946
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Let's do it.

2947
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Let's get to them.

2948
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:34,000
We had quite the tie tonight. We have a two-way tie for first place in listless, and we have a two-way tie for what would essentially be third place.

2949
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Because, you know, when you have a two-way tie for first place, it's first and second, and then you have a two-way tie for third place.

2950
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
So you have the top four answers tonight.

2951
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Fun.

2952
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Alright, so here they are as voted by the listeners. Your number tied for number three, new F-Zero game, and new Mario Paint.

2953
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:06,000
There you go. Those are the number three things you most want to see on the new 3DS, or excuse me, the new Wii U that will make you go pre-order it that day.

2954
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
A new F-Zero game and a new Mario Paint.

2955
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Here is the number one answer. We had two answers tie for number one.

2956
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:19,000
The tablet controller is actually a tablet. Good luck with that, you guys.

2957
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I know, it's like a never happens.

2958
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And lastly, Mario Kart with track editor is number one.

2959
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Double win for more.

2960
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Look at that, a double win for Loki. Has that ever happened in the history of list? I don't know.

2961
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:39,000
So there it is. Number one tied, Mario Kart with track editor. Tablet controller is actually a tablet.

2962
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
And number three tied, new F-Zero game and new Mario Paint. Crazy ties tonight.

2963
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:54,000
But the fans have spoken. Mario Kart, Mario Paint, F-Zero. Bring them. And a free tablet.

2964
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Well that is going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2965
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into this whole episode and staying with us, especially the live listeners who have stuck with us through all these disconnects all night.

2966
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I really appreciate you guys staying with us. I don't know what's causing that.

2967
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,000
We'll have to see what we can do about next week, make sure all the porn torrents are off.

2968
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Let's go around and of course get everybody's final thought.

2969
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
We are done with last minute news, right?

2970
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Yes.

2971
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
I forgot to ask if you had anything else.

2972
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:23,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2973
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:28,000
My final thought tonight is, I would like to be less Flemmy, please.

2974
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

2975
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2976
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Four words. Robot, unicorn, attack, evolution.

2977
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Yes.

2978
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Oh dear.

2979
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Robot panda, or unit panda, uni-wolf, unit dragon.

2980
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Oh dear.

2981
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:53,000
All right. Thank you guys, all you guys that stayed up late with us listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We really appreciate it.

2982
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Hey, it's a free show. If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell a friend or tell a friend or two about our show.

2983
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Even your imaginary friend.

2984
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
That's right. Tell them too.

2985
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
And then tune in twice.

2986
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:08,000
And tell them also, not just about our show, but the VOG Network, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

2987
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Lots of exciting stuff coming over the next few weeks.

2988
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Again, we don't have a big website or millions of dollars, you know, funding advertisements or whatever.

2989
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:20,000
We just have word of mouth and we appreciate every recommendation you guys give.

2990
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:25,000
iTunes reviews and website reviews and forum signatures and all that, those help a lot too.

2991
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Please spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and the VOG Network.

2992
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
That is too fucking cute.

2993
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
What are you looking at?

2994
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,000
The panda. Robot panda attack.

2995
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Makes great radio, just saying.

2996
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
All right, have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you next week.

2997
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,000
And again, happy Mother's Day to all the mommies.

2998
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:45,000
