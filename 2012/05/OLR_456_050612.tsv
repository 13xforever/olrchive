0	19920	Today, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is
19920	31680	a reality, and we talk to video game hip hop artist, Megaran.
31680	35600	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35600	39600	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39600	48320	We are live with episode number 456, yes that's 456, of our show on this May the 6th, that's
48320	50880	5-6, 2012.
50880	57100	A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show.
57100	60280	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games
60280	63220	and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.
63220	66660	Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
66660	72600	To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Man, to paraphrase I should say, but Mani isn't dead,
72600	74240	but Mani is life.
74240	75640	Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Man?
75640	77760	He was the leader of the Disco Boys.
77760	79080	That was Eddie Izzard?
79080	81960	I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for
81960	82960	that movie when I saw it.
82960	83960	That movie was great.
83960	86680	It was okay, but I saw it so long ago.
86680	88260	Avengers, Avengers, Avengers.
88260	91640	The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only tech master, Loki.
91640	93280	I have also not seen the Avengers.
93280	95320	I have not seen the Avengers, I'm like the one person in the world.
95320	96660	You both are lame.
96660	97660	We are lame.
97660	100800	Well I'll explain my reasons in a minute, but first I have to plug the ever present
100800	103720	fourth guest on our show, The Chatters.
103720	107440	That's right, head on over to vognetwork.com, you can't miss it, we're a brand new start
107440	111840	up network at VOG, so our chat is right there in the middle of the screen, and you can join
111840	117800	our chat room and chat with us, and you might have heard on tonight's show, we have an interview.
117800	120860	I'm excited, we haven't had an interview in a long time, and I was thinking about this
120860	125500	last week, I was like, can either of you name who the last person was on the show and when?
125500	127800	We had like a legit interview going on on the show.
127800	128840	I don't remember.
128840	129840	I could not remember.
129840	130840	What about Snake360dude?
130840	131840	No, it wasn't Snake360dude.
131840	132840	It wasn't Snake360dude.
132840	139840	No, it wasn't Snake360dude, it was the guy that was behind Technokitten Adventures.
139840	142360	That was a year ago, it was Technokitten Adventure.
142360	144280	Well we talked to him again, didn't we?
144280	145960	No, I don't think so.
145960	149200	Because he has Nyan Cat Adventures, which is the same thing.
149200	150200	Anyway, he sold it off to an iPhone developer.
150200	152400	And we had the Orange Lounge game.
152400	153400	Mmhmm.
153400	154400	Yeah.
154400	156080	Well I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of.
156080	157080	And he was on the show.
157080	159720	But I wasn't technically on the interview, because he did, you know, was he plugging
159720	161720	the new game?
161720	165800	Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview.
165800	167240	Where is the new game?
167240	168240	Where is it?
168240	170440	He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on.
170440	171440	You know what?
171440	172920	Beggars can't be choosers.
172920	173920	Let him take his time.
173920	178520	Alright, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like,
178520	180440	hey guys, who do you want us to interview on the show?
180440	181440	Like within reason.
181440	185800	You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-Aime, okay, we're not a television
185800	186800	network or something.
186800	188000	We're not going to get those folks.
188000	190440	And so we kind of fielded some of the responses.
190440	195400	And one idea that I really liked was getting Mega Ran on our show.
195400	200060	Now if you guys don't know Mega Ran, he also goes by Random, and he does this like video
200060	202320	game hip hop music.
202320	205200	And I know some of you guys are probably sitting at that going, what, what?
205200	206200	Video game hip hop?
206200	207200	What is that?
207200	208200	It's awesome.
208200	209200	This is what it sounds like.
209200	210200	I'm only going to tease you a little bit with this.
210200	211200	Check out this.
211200	224160	That song is called Splash Woman, and you can like hear it in the background, like that
224160	225160	riff.
225160	228200	And then he's kind of, you know, has some verses that he's laying down about Splash
228200	230200	Woman or his Splash Woman.
230200	231200	It's brilliant.
231200	232200	I love it.
232200	236360	Anyway, I can't play the whole thing.
236360	239200	I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing
239200	240400	there, iTunes or whatever.
240400	242920	But that's one of his like bigger, well-known songs, Splash Woman.
242920	243920	That was amazing.
243920	246920	Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got, you got to do more.
246920	250040	So he's got like a Mega Man 9, he's got a Mega Man 10, and we're going to ask him about
250040	251040	some of his other projects.
251040	252120	He's not just a Capcom guy.
252120	253120	He's got Final Fantasy.
253120	256200	We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact.
256200	259320	So if you're a Mega Ran fan who saw the shout out on Twitter and all that, it was waiting
259320	264280	for him to come on the show, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here.
264280	267720	But join our chat room because we are a live show.
267720	270720	Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview.
270720	274840	And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com.
274840	277000	Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts.
277000	280720	But when we get going, when we get Random on the phone, you can ask those questions.
280720	281720	All right.
281720	286920	Anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right
286920	290200	after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
290200	294720	Hope you'll join us live sometime even if you missed our action-packed show tonight.
294720	297400	Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually
297400	301480	like to kind of have a kickoff topic and we kind of got into it a little bit already,
301480	310200	but everybody's talking about everybody, everybody in the geek world talking about the Avengers.
310200	311920	Dark Sakura, I know you were there.
311920	314320	I know you went and saw the Avengers movie.
314320	315320	You're a comic fan.
315320	316320	You're a Marvel fan.
316320	317320	Ed Joss.
317320	318320	What?
318320	319320	Ed Joss.
319320	320320	Oh, Ed Joss Whedon.
320320	321320	You're a Joss Whedon fan.
321320	322320	How was the Avengers movie?
322320	324840	Oh my God.
324840	325840	It was beautiful.
325840	332400	And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today, I've had allergies.
332400	333400	I went to see it.
333400	339320	I loaded myself up on Sudafed and Allegra and ate Ricolas and Junior Mints the entire
339320	342760	time, which are an odd combination, but oddly work.
342760	349920	And I was just like, oh, Hawkeye, this is the Hawkeye movie.
349920	352360	Why is he evil?
352360	359480	Not to spoil, but I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass, I mean, please.
359480	362400	I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me.
362400	363400	Anyway.
363400	364400	In full 3D?
364400	368720	Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie.
368720	369720	All right.
369720	372080	I have a new ship.
372080	377480	I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because, oh my God.
377480	381160	Aren't there, I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites, but I think I read something
381160	383200	about, cause you know, I read all that trash.
383200	387880	I think I read something, something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson.
387880	389540	They've been flirty.
389540	393240	Like there's pictures of them on the red carpet, flirty.
393240	395360	So you know what?
395360	399340	If I get pretty, I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett
399340	400340	Johansson.
400340	405760	So, you know, and it's all because of him is the whole reason I want to see that Mission
405760	408160	Impossible movie, him and Simon Peck because hello.
408160	415760	Um, so yeah, I can say first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss
415760	416760	death.
416760	417760	I will not tell you who.
417760	419920	And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye.
419920	421960	No, don't spoil.
421960	427360	I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man.
427360	429520	Like I did with Wash.
429520	430980	Okay.
430980	431980	And stay during the credits.
431980	432980	Yes.
432980	433980	Oh my God.
433980	434980	What was that?
434980	435980	What was that?
435980	439960	So one does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits.
439960	440960	Exactly.
440960	444080	Cause now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the cause you know, there's that like that
444080	448200	lovely designed a bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who
448200	450720	is in it, who were in it, sorry.
450720	455200	And then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil,
455200	456880	but if nobody gets it, please ask me.
456880	462480	I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants.
462480	468720	And then, but the very end of the movie and really listen very carefully to the dialogue
468720	469720	right before the credits.
469720	471120	That's all I'm having to say.
471120	472880	Tiger claw on our chat and chat chatters.
472880	473880	Don't spoil.
473880	474880	Don't do it.
474880	478560	If you spoil your getting kicked to the private messages, take your spoil into the private
478560	479560	messages.
479560	481960	Uh, just double click on some of these names and you can private message him.
481960	484760	Uh, and you can, you can talk a double click on dark soccer.
484760	485960	I will gush you all.
485960	486960	You're in the show.
486960	487960	Okay.
487960	488960	Talk to her.
488960	495000	Um, I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly.
495000	497720	Let's go to the chat room real quick at vog network.com a tiger.
497720	500080	Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner.
500080	504560	He's taken over the born movies, the Matt Damon, born conspiracy, all that stuff.
504560	505560	Yeah.
505560	506560	Those board movies are pretty awesome.
506560	507560	Actually.
507560	508560	I'm, I'm excited about that.
508560	509560	How do you think so?
509560	511400	I'm better than Matt Damon.
511400	512400	I mean, come on.
512400	513400	It's Matt Damon.
513400	515720	I just didn't care about the board movies.
515720	516720	SSJ 100.
516720	518120	Matt says I give it to Joss Whedon.
518120	519960	He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts.
519960	520960	I think there were a lot of people.
520960	522160	Did you hear this?
522160	528320	Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter,
528320	532320	you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but two, 200 million
532320	535480	plus for the weekend.
535480	538440	And a, this is the, this is the other real telling thing.
538440	540040	Um, hunger games beat that.
540040	541040	No, no.
541040	542040	Hunger games didn't beat it either.
542040	544080	A, I mean, hunger games was huge, but didn't beat it.
544080	547440	A plus cinema score that in cinema score.
547440	550440	Those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie.
550440	552220	I actually pulled for them once.
552220	554800	They were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was, but
554800	559680	they pulled me on it and they actually take, you know, they grade it a plus rating from
559680	560680	cinema score.
560680	565360	That's, that's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, Hey,
565360	566360	this movie doesn't suck.
566360	567360	Go see it.
567360	570980	And, uh, going to some other chats, uh, panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right in the VOG
570980	573920	network chat room said Avengers did something amazing.
573920	579100	They combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it because hello.
579100	580100	Who else could do that?
580100	582080	But the Joss, I'm sorry.
582080	589320	So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say everybody was characterized perfectly.
589320	592400	The interaction was perfect.
592400	597160	And um, for those of you who read ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first.
597160	601960	It really does seem like it's based a bit more off of ultimates with a good splash of
601960	604160	six one six universe in it.
604160	607380	So yeah, it, it, um, it's really good.
607380	612680	And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks, although I'd pay to see that.
612680	617200	I would pay for that Star Wars slash, you know, Avengers movie.
617200	621600	I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is and it's not a spoiler,
621600	626180	but it, cause they did the first half of it in the trailer is this whole scene where Iron
626180	630000	Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing
630000	631000	the party to you.
631000	634880	Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on
634880	638040	her face saying, I don't see how this is a party.
638040	639600	That's the best line in the whole movie.
639600	642520	All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.
642520	646360	It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day and they're making
646360	647800	an Avengers video game.
647800	651400	So well, actually I was going to ask, where is the video game?
651400	652400	It is coming.
652400	655000	It's strike while the iron is hot.
655000	659080	I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always rush the game out.
659080	660080	Okay.
660080	661080	Perfect.
661080	663520	Let's have a sub plan better.
663520	667280	It would have been out for the movie, but I'm willing to do something like ultimate
667280	670840	Alliance honestly, cause that was both.
670840	674680	The second one did the whole civil war thing and it was kind of crap, but the first one,
674680	676360	I love the gameplay in both of the games.
676360	677360	They were just fantastic.
677360	682680	I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in ultimate Alliance style.
682680	684680	All right, so go into our chat room.
684680	685760	There is a hater.
685760	687580	We do have a hater in the chat room.
687580	690280	You know that every, every big fandom is going to have its haters.
690280	695120	Rama's in the chat room saying, fuck Joss Whedon, James Cameron will come back strong
695120	696360	with avatar too.
696360	697360	Yeah.
697360	699580	Cause he came out strong with avatar one.
699580	701320	That was some cheesy piece of shit.
701320	702320	Uh, okay.
702320	703320	Look low key.
703320	704320	Okay.
704320	705320	Yeah.
705320	708560	Cause everybody bought into, Oh my God, I have to see this in 3d.
708560	710820	My eyes will be blown out of my head.
710820	714440	It was just such a terrible story and just wasn't bad.
714440	715440	It was terrible.
715440	719840	In one of those movies, you want, I don't want to admit they like just like guys, guys,
719840	726080	guys, man, man, please, no, don't worry about ripoffs and who's going to come out on top.
726080	730640	There hasn't been a real original idea since the sixties.
730640	733300	Maybe they're all going to take your money.
733300	734300	Let's be real.
734300	738960	One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative
738960	740700	deal the fuck with it.
740700	744720	They're going to make Titanic more 3d it's what's going to happen.
744720	746200	Deal with it.
746200	747200	Falling sunglasses.
747200	751280	A technist in our chat room says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel
751280	754960	or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good.
754960	755960	What do you think?
755960	756960	Agreed.
756960	762240	And honestly, given the big spoiler, not spoiler, I should say, but the big preview of the next
762240	764960	movie, Joss has to do it.
764960	770040	There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and, and please forgive me for saying
770040	773080	this, Chris Claremont, please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers.
773080	777600	They'll just have Treyarch do it and then they'll add zombies.
777600	784320	I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that and yeah, he did
784320	788040	kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont
788040	789200	was the man.
789200	791400	He's the one who gave us dark Phoenix.
791400	796240	He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel
796240	799360	bin and made it the top a player it is now.
799360	804400	So now I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward
804400	805400	to a lot.
805400	806400	Like, you know, the Avengers.
806400	809360	I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but you know, I'm into it.
809360	811640	I liked the, the Iron Man movie was good and all the movies are good.
811640	812640	I'll go see it.
812640	813640	I just don't want to see it opening weekend.
813640	815400	I don't, I knew the crowds are going to be insane.
815400	819360	One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget Joss Whedon also wrote comics.
819360	822120	He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out.
822120	824640	But there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to.
824640	828300	One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care.
828300	830240	I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week.
830240	831240	I want to see it.
831240	833840	And I know people are like, it looks stupid.
833840	835240	What's it?
835240	840480	The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival, but that's what made
840480	841640	it awesome.
841640	846880	And like if, if they, I'm a little worried cause I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot,
846880	849840	but if they did it right, it's, it's going to be a fun time.
849840	852280	So I'm looking forward to that cautiously.
852280	855200	And Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.
855200	856960	Just Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.
856960	858560	Helena Bonham Carter.
858560	859880	Also a flaw free goddess.
859880	861920	Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about.
861920	862920	I know, right?
862920	863920	With Michelle Pfeiffer.
863920	864920	Amazing.
864920	865920	I'll see anything to her in it.
865920	867200	I have that on HD DVD.
867200	873440	I sat through an Oprah book of the month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer cause I
873440	875240	love her that much.
875240	880680	And hello, the best, the only Catwoman, which leads me to, I am still excited a lot about
880680	887560	this Batman movie, really, really excited about the third Batman movie.
887560	892800	You know, I'm kind of two thoughts about that one, but you know what preview I saw that
892800	896400	I will be there to see because I love the original so much.
896400	900280	Frankenweenie I'm serious.
900280	904200	That looks adorable and I freaking love Frankenweenie so shut up.
904200	905200	Don't judge.
905200	906200	I see you judging.
906200	907200	I'm judging a little bit.
907200	908200	Stop judging me.
908200	909200	All right.
909200	910200	Video games back.
910200	911200	Yeah.
911200	912200	As much as we love to talk movies and all that.
912200	913200	We got it.
913200	915200	It's all about the Tron series starting in June.
915200	917040	We can all agree on that.
917040	918040	Tron is King.
918040	919040	Yes.
919040	920040	A couple of weeks away.
920040	921040	Disney XD.
921040	922040	I am there.
922040	923040	Finally.
923040	924040	OLR Avengers assemble.
924040	925040	Tron.
925040	926040	Woo.
926040	927040	Okay.
927040	928040	OLR is assemble.
928040	929040	All right.
929040	930040	Thank God.
930040	931040	We agree on something.
931040	932040	As long as I get to be Hawkeye.
932040	933040	All right.
933040	934040	There's no Hawkeye in Tron.
934040	935040	You fool.
935040	937400	There should be Hawkeye in Tron.
937400	938400	You know?
938400	939400	Oh, I have to say, I have to say.
939400	940400	We got to get to games.
940400	941400	We got to get to games.
941400	942400	You know why?
942400	943400	You know why?
943400	944400	There were all these Disney trailers before.
944400	948640	There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel.
948640	953480	But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers.
953480	954480	Duntron style.
954480	955480	Yes.
955480	956480	I saw that.
956480	957480	It was amazing.
957480	958480	Yeah.
958480	959480	They were epic.
959480	960480	I loved them as Marvel.
960480	961480	But anyway.
961480	962480	Okay.
962480	963480	All right.
963480	964480	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
964480	965480	Join us in our chat.
965480	966480	Vognetwork.com.
966480	967480	We're getting into.
967480	968480	The Spider-Man trailer was good.
968480	969480	What was your gaming week?
969480	970480	What kinds of games did you play this week?
970480	974320	I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet
974320	978040	was just, has been crap all week and it's the last week before finals.
978040	980640	I've also had a crap ton of design work to do.
980640	983640	So Mass Effect came out of the box.
983640	984640	Oh my gosh.
984640	987640	I didn't get played, but it got opened.
987640	988640	You tease.
988640	990200	I know.
990200	991960	And yes, Frankenweenie really.
991960	992960	Frankenweenie's awesome.
992960	993960	Shut up.
993960	994960	Zombie dogs.
994960	995960	Anyway.
995960	1003240	Uh, I, I actually did play through some Portal 2 and I played a little bit of WoW, but like,
1003240	1005400	okay, this is what was so stupid.
1005400	1006720	All right.
1006720	1013160	I get in queue and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me fart angry
1013160	1014160	farts.
1014160	1015160	Okay.
1015160	1020020	I was trying to play WoW and I was in queue and then while, and then I didn't realize
1020020	1021260	how close I was to a level.
1021260	1025080	So I did a cooking daily level got kick out of queue.
1025080	1026240	Oh shoot.
1026240	1028480	You know, at 13 minutes of waiting in queue.
1028480	1030280	So I get kicked out, whatever.
1030280	1033840	So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily.
1033840	1038720	Um, so then I get back in another queue and we all get in and everything's happy.
1038720	1039720	We're in there.
1039720	1040720	Yay.
1040720	1041720	Queue.
1041720	1042800	And then, Oh, I'm going to leave.
1042800	1043800	Log off.
1043800	1044800	Fine.
1044800	1045800	Offline.
1045800	1046800	What?
1046800	1047800	Everybody leaves the party.
1047800	1052080	As soon as I get my quest, I'm like, all of you suck.
1052080	1054000	And I just logged off for the day.
1054000	1056120	Die in a hundred fires.
1056120	1058920	May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.
1058920	1063540	You didn't even get, I, I was here, I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and
1063540	1066720	your anger rant about children's week.
1066720	1072520	And speaking of things that he's saving that for the FUs of the week, because I cannot
1072520	1078040	get my Drake this year because of children's week whores.
1078040	1080080	She just wanted her virtual pony.
1080080	1082440	Bring your child to your virtual world.
1082440	1086920	Your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little
1086920	1090160	five year old wander behind you while you're in the firelands.
1090160	1091160	She's right.
1091160	1093160	That's what it is.
1093160	1096440	It's like, I was telling, that seems very unsafe.
1096440	1100240	I was telling Becky and Becky doesn't really, she's not really into well, she doesn't play
1100240	1101240	it.
1101240	1102240	Nothing to that.
1102240	1106640	I was telling her about children's week and her reply was, Oh my God, that's fucked up.
1106640	1110100	And it is the best place to, when you had to do the five dailies thing, the fastest
1110100	1113000	place to get it done is firelands if you're 85.
1113000	1116480	So you just run them through, Oh, this thing is setting you on fire.
1116480	1121800	Oh, you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going,
1121800	1124000	this is cool.
1124000	1126480	And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement.
1126480	1127680	Yes you do.
1127680	1129000	Called bad example.
1129000	1130000	Yes you do.
1130000	1131000	That was great.
1131000	1135360	And then you give them a gun and a kite.
1135360	1139080	I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday.
1139080	1140400	Actually, it's kind of disturbing.
1140400	1144760	And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron.
1144760	1145800	She has to deal with you now.
1145800	1146800	You're not my problem.
1146800	1149080	So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem.
1149080	1153880	Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe or is it just like, no, they just have
1153880	1157600	to follow you because they're, they're lonely orphans cooped up in the orphanage all day
1157600	1160880	and they want to get out and see the world and children's week is a time for them to
1160880	1161880	do that.
1161880	1164840	Oh, and one of the achievements is you have to hearth back while you have your orphan
1164840	1165840	with you.
1165840	1170080	So you leave your orphan behind in another town across the world, like no child left
1170080	1172840	behind or something like that.
1172840	1175200	Oh my God.
1175200	1177640	And of course I have the stupid human kid following me around.
1177640	1181720	If I do this crap next year, cause I get, I do want the pets and I did get my pet, but
1181720	1185600	if I do this next year, then I'm gonna get the drawn eye kid.
1185600	1189960	You know, the only children in the game that I like is that little bloodthirsty blood elf
1189960	1191960	kid that hangs out with all the orcs.
1191960	1192960	You know what I'm talking about?
1192960	1197920	I have to kill this guy for my daddy and I like the gem and the holograms wandering around
1197920	1198920	dark wind fair.
1198920	1202440	Uh, Ziba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for dark soccer.
1202440	1203440	Just stop playing.
1203440	1204440	Wow.
1204440	1205440	Then shut up.
1205440	1206440	Picaruna wants me to be on hard house.
1206440	1207580	Rob, we can arrange that.
1207580	1208840	You should come back on hard house.
1208840	1209840	I love it.
1209840	1211440	All right.
1211440	1214120	Hoard house.com is the spinoff show all about work.
1214120	1215160	All right.
1215160	1216160	Other games.
1216160	1217160	Loki.
1217160	1218160	I know you got something else to talk about.
1218160	1219560	Uh, yeah, I don't play a while.
1219560	1224560	So um, I play Call of Duty, my warfare three and honestly that's, it's all I really played
1224560	1229240	this week because I only played it at work and um, you know, the rest of the time I've
1229240	1235200	been working on my portal to papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, I'm about 99%
1235200	1237860	done with the body of the portal turret.
1237860	1241240	Did you see that amazing portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a
1241240	1243240	cake falling through the portal?
1243240	1244240	Yeah.
1244240	1245240	Oh yeah.
1245240	1246240	You gotta see it.
1246240	1247240	It's great.
1247240	1248240	I'll find it and link my tumblr.
1248240	1249240	Everyone should be looking at my tumblr.
1249240	1251040	Uh, kurotsubasa.
1251040	1254720	You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guests to
1254720	1258960	make Iran and the Fugu question we're going to get into is, you know, creating art inspired
1258960	1260400	by video games.
1260400	1261400	What is it about?
1261400	1265280	And you're, you're basically making art based on portal to granted it might be on a template
1265280	1267320	that's already out there or whatever with your own flare.
1267320	1272200	But what is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real
1272200	1273200	world?
1273200	1274200	Because they're funny.
1274200	1275280	They're funny little things.
1275280	1278000	And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some.
1278000	1281760	Um, and I don't count the, the stuffed ones cause they look stupid.
1281760	1286800	But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA for example, made a full size
1286800	1290840	portal turret that talked in like, you know, shut air stuff, BBs or something like that.
1290840	1293040	I would probably buy two or three.
1293040	1295280	Um, but I don't know.
1295280	1299320	I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it cause it was a cheap project.
1299320	1303540	Um, although now I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want it to look a little bit better.
1303540	1310440	So now I have to use Bondo and Plex or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a
1310440	1313440	load of fun except it's not.
1313440	1317240	Um, so I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.
1317240	1318240	Uh, we'll see.
1318240	1321880	But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now.
1321880	1327760	You know, I did a portal turret in, uh, uh, Maya as my final projects.
1327760	1328760	Yeah.
1328760	1329760	I remember seeing that.
1329760	1331760	Um, I don't know.
1331760	1334280	It was just fun.
1334280	1335280	So that's what I did.
1335280	1340680	I've been looking at, um, getting portal two for, well, redeeming my copy of portal two
1340680	1343080	on steam that I have for my PS3.
1343080	1346360	Um, I still have to do that or look at it or whatever.
1346360	1348360	I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever.
1348360	1349600	I mean, it's so cheap now.
1349600	1352040	I'm sure I can get it, you know, a few bucks.
1352040	1356240	And then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too, because of all the like cool mods that
1356240	1357240	they have.
1357240	1360900	Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation three just because I'm missing out on all
1360900	1362480	these darn mods.
1362480	1366840	I thought Sony said they were, I, maybe I was just hallucinating, but I thought Sony
1366840	1369680	said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation three.
1369680	1370680	Yeah.
1370680	1371680	Well, what did they ever do?
1371680	1374640	This steam stuff for, you know, portal to nothing.
1374640	1378360	I mean, it's, I don't know.
1378360	1380100	So I may do that.
1380100	1385240	And then, um, I mean, I guess I played a little bit of the perfect strangers adver game thing.
1385240	1386240	That was kind of fun.
1386240	1392080	I actually played it a few times because I liked watching the, or reading the dream board
1392080	1398280	that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and, uh, you know, stuff
1398280	1399280	of that nature.
1399280	1401280	It was kind of funny.
1401280	1405040	Um, yeah, that's pretty much all I played.
1405040	1408320	Um, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it.
1408320	1411480	I kind of wish I'd, I did want to play some Skyrim this week.
1411480	1415120	I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I, if I dive back in, I'm going to be, that's
1415120	1417560	going to be another, like three months of my life.
1417560	1422840	Well, it's going to be more than three months because by the time I get to about three months,
1422840	1426160	they'll release the expansion.
1426160	1427160	Just over from there.
1427160	1429320	That's why I was like, Oh no, Skyrim online or not.
1429320	1430320	Skyrim.
1430320	1431320	Well, the other scrolls online.
1431320	1432320	I'm like, ah, crap.
1432320	1435320	Well, I'm going to have to play this, aren't I?
1435320	1441240	And then, uh, I started reading up on it and I was like, well, maybe not.
1441240	1442880	All right.
1442880	1446440	Um, my gaming week, um, not a lot of new stuff.
1446440	1447440	I did play Mass Effect.
1447440	1448440	I did.
1448440	1449440	Yes.
1449440	1450440	I played a lot of Mass Effect.
1450440	1451440	Let's get that out of the way.
1451440	1455640	Uh, Mass Effect three, I'm playing more, lots of side missions, working on the main missions.
1455640	1459800	I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys, but
1459800	1463920	it was, uh, I'll just say some, something involving the Citadel happened and it was
1463920	1464920	pretty awesome.
1464920	1467760	Um, and then, uh, multiplayer.
1467760	1469600	That's the, that's the thing that gets me.
1469600	1474720	I am really into multiplayer in this game, which you guys have to understand.
1474720	1480360	I don't really play a lot of Xbox live games online, especially things that are kind of
1480360	1484600	like shooters, although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter, but it's, it's,
1484600	1485600	it's a shooter.
1485600	1489620	It's like a shooter RPG hybrid, more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG,
1489620	1490620	I guess.
1490620	1496200	But my point is I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox live outside of arcade games
1496200	1500720	and music games like rock band that I've played online that I truly enjoyed.
1500720	1504880	Like I, one of the last ones is like Halo two, you want to go that back that far with
1504880	1512160	your pink guy, but I, yep, my red, but I love Mass Effect three online and I think a big
1512160	1514280	part of that and the community's great.
1514280	1518500	I mean, sometimes I hear random people like yelling at people across the room in their
1518500	1524560	own house, but you don't hear the same stuff like, you know, F you and you know, the racial
1524560	1530360	slurs and the, you know, um, sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated
1530360	1531360	with Xbox live.
1531360	1532600	I don't hear it in Mass Effect three.
1532600	1534360	Oh, that would be kind of funny though.
1534360	1538000	Like, you know, cause I'm assuming it's basically co-op against, you know, the enemy.
1538000	1539000	It'd be funny.
1539000	1543240	It would be funny to have people that are racist against the enemies, you know, that's
1543240	1544480	just Ashley.
1544480	1548560	But anyway, if you were, if you're a Mass Effect player, you'll get that joke.
1548560	1553580	But anyway, uh, yeah, the fact that it's co-op I think really leads to a different kind of
1553580	1555000	community for the game.
1555000	1557560	And you know, I, I'm sure it's not perfect.
1557560	1563760	Every community has their, you know, dumb asses, but this game's pretty awesome so far
1563760	1564760	from my experience.
1564760	1567780	And I'm, I'm, uh, motivated to continue to play it online.
1567780	1572460	I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits
1572460	1573560	and doing all that stuff.
1573560	1577040	So, uh, yeah, Mass Effect good times.
1577040	1579120	So I'll Mass Effect three gets a big endorsement for me.
1579120	1582120	Um, I haven't gotten to that ending yet.
1582120	1584480	I still am not spoiled on the ending yet.
1584480	1588880	I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it, but let me tell you what, I've been
1588880	1590480	on this Mass Effect bang bandwagon.
1590480	1595260	I just started back in February and I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect one, 40 hours
1595260	1598660	of Mass Effect two, maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC.
1598660	1601440	And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect three.
1601440	1603920	That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played.
1603920	1609200	The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob
1609200	1611420	what was a great experience.
1611420	1616940	I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up or, you know, kind of say
1616940	1621640	that was shitty, you know, or compare it to the ending of the Sopranos, which wasn't that
1621640	1622720	great either.
1622720	1626280	But that's, you know, I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of
1626280	1627280	Mass Effect three.
1627280	1628280	It's so terrible.
1628280	1630120	And the ending just ruined it for me.
1630120	1635240	So I'm going to our chat room at chat, excuse me, almost at the old one going to shit, vog
1635240	1636240	network.com.
1636240	1640160	Uh, tiger class says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kayden.
1640160	1643920	Techness says Mass Effect two was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect
1643920	1644920	game.
1644920	1647880	But the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is.
1647880	1651120	I, however, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat.
1651120	1653320	So I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side.
1653320	1657600	Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect three, all that crap out of the
1657600	1660560	way, all that crap out of the way.
1660560	1661560	So all right.
1661560	1665000	Uh, one of the game, I, uh, Mega Rants coming on in just a minute, we got to call him, but
1665000	1669160	I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week, a new game Fez on Xbox
1669160	1673600	live arcade, because everybody's telling me, Rob, this is like an eight bit looking game
1673600	1674600	with great music.
1674600	1675600	It's a puzzler.
1675600	1676600	It is right up your fucking alley.
1676600	1677600	Go play this game.
1677600	1678600	You play Fez now.
1678600	1679600	Fez is cool.
1679600	1680600	Fez is cool.
1680600	1681600	I like it.
1681600	1682600	Sorry.
1682600	1683600	Doctor Who reference.
1683600	1684600	Oh, I see.
1684600	1685600	Uh, well whatever.
1685600	1686600	Doctor, Doctor Who reference or not.
1686600	1687600	It's a pretty fun game.
1687600	1694160	Uh, quickly, the concept, it's the 2d world that you're in getting turned into a 3d world.
1694160	1699080	So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2d
1699080	1703240	scroller is suddenly like has four different sides cause you don't really go up or down.
1703240	1708760	So it's just like the four sides of a cube and you know, you kind of, you get puzzles
1708760	1713400	out of that where you might have to climb up a vine on one side of the cube to get the
1713400	1715840	gem that's on another side of it.
1715840	1719600	The puzzles in the beginning are pretty simple, but from what I understand, there are some
1719600	1725520	killer hard puzzles that they call the anti cube puzzles and they're buried in things
1725520	1729160	like random QR codes that might be on the wall.
1729160	1730560	I've unlocked an anti cube.
1730560	1733360	I actually got the anti cube before I got a regular cube.
1733360	1734360	Here's a hint.
1734360	1735720	Read the achievements.
1735720	1738680	How to unlock an anti cube is in one of the achievements.
1738680	1740320	Minor spoiler, but whatever.
1740320	1741520	It's a gamer tip.
1741520	1742520	Take that.
1742520	1746280	Um, so a lot of depth to it and I thought I saw Pete Caruno and somebody in our chat
1746280	1749240	said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight cause I was trying to get one of those
1749240	1752120	freaking cubes and Fez to unlock.
1752120	1756120	So apparently there's, it's like Castlevania Symphony of the night where there's like a,
1756120	1758600	a pretty easy game in the beginning.
1758600	1763780	And then once you, just when you thought you beat it, there's that twist of, Oh crap.
1763780	1768640	Now I have to do it all again, but it just got like 11 billion times harder.
1768640	1769880	All right.
1769880	1771800	Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.
1771800	1772800	And Hey, how about that?
1772800	1777720	It is just about time for us to go to the phone and bring onto the program.
1777720	1782360	Mega ran video game, hip hop artist, he goes by random as well.
1782360	1784800	I like mega ran cause you know, mega man and all that stuff.
1784800	1790400	And obviously that was a lot of what he became famous for, but airman can't be beaten.
1790400	1793200	But uh, yeah, you know, we played a clip from a splash woman earlier.
1793200	1796180	We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview.
1796180	1801040	Just a talented guy really into the art and he, you know, he's made it like a Bobby joked
1801040	1802040	on his show earlier.
1802040	1805160	He got on sports center with a rap about Jeremy Lin.
1805160	1809080	So it's not, it's not just restricted to video games.
1809080	1811520	So, and I understand even better.
1811520	1813320	This guy is a teacher during the day.
1813320	1818760	He's a teacher IRL as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side.
1818760	1821760	So I want to talk to him about his art and I want to open it up to you guys for your
1821760	1824780	questions on vog network.com.
1824780	1826840	So let's get random on the show right now.
1826840	1829080	I've punched in his number and we're giving him a call.
1829080	1830480	It is live radio.
1830480	1835720	Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message just like the phone getting forwarded
1835720	1837680	to an automatic voicemail.
1837680	1838980	Let's try it one more time.
1838980	1843480	Maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick.
1843480	1852160	It is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail.
1852160	1856520	Let's try it one more time here.
1856520	1859280	Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.
1859280	1866240	Boy, I think, I think, uh, I think he might be on the other line or something right now.
1866240	1867240	So all right.
1867240	1868240	That's all right.
1868240	1869240	These things happen in live radio.
1869240	1871920	We'll try him again in about three minutes.
1871920	1875880	So, uh, if you're a friend of MEGA's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to
1875880	1876880	get through.
1876880	1877880	All right.
1877880	1880680	Uh, meanwhile, let's, uh, let's go to our first news story tonight.
1880680	1884000	Uh, Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to MEGA, okay.
1884000	1885000	That's fine.
1885000	1888120	Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls online.
1888120	1892800	It's being developed by ZeniMax online, not necessarily Bethesda, but you know, it's owned
1892800	1898760	by the same company and, uh, it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series.
1898760	1903320	It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with, um, some of the places being
1903320	1907320	locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on.
1907320	1913040	But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh,
1913040	1915880	elsewhere and that kind of stuff.
1915880	1921520	Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like,
1921520	1925680	the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of
1925680	1926680	the game.
1926680	1929240	At least some of the screenshots, uh.
1929240	1934360	One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third person perspective.
1934360	1938640	Now, I know that's an option in, like, the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third person
1938640	1944760	perspective, but I really like the first person aspect of it and I understand that the reason
1944760	1948440	that they wanted to go that route is because, you know, it'd be less of a learning curve
1948440	1952080	for people that are from, you know, other MMOs.
1952080	1955800	The problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to, kind of, World of Warcraft
1955800	1957320	and that's kind of, ehhhh.
1957320	1962360	Well, you know what they did is apparently they licensed BioWare's Star Wars The Old
1962360	1964660	Republic engine to do it.
1964660	1965840	That's what I'm hearing.
1965840	1971140	And it's kind of, I mean, I'm not shade in the BioWare game, I mean, Star Wars was alright,
1971140	1975000	but it's like, I like Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine.
1975000	1976000	I mean, it's weird.
1976000	1977000	Yeah.
1977000	1980000	Well, I have no problem with them doing, like, a third person's perspective or even, like,
1980000	1984760	having all those options, but at the same time also allow people to play the same way
1984760	1988400	you would play, like, a regular, you know, like, Skyrim or Oblivion or something like
1988400	1992800	that, like, from a first person perspective without, you know, necessarily the hotbar
1992800	1993800	and that kind of stuff.
1993800	1994800	Um.
1994800	1995800	I don't know.
1995800	2000220	Some of the other, uh, features that they're talking about also, they're gonna have, um,
2000220	2005800	you know, PVP battles also, some 100 vs 100 instances, in fact, one of them they explained
2005800	2012080	is you take over Cyrodiil's Imperial City and the winning faction, um, I guess, uh,
2012080	2017620	the greatest champion of the winning faction gets installed is the Emperor.
2017620	2021800	Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is, uh, 35 after right now and, you know, it is
2021800	2024500	live radio and, you know, he could be anywhere right now.
2024500	2029000	He could be, he could be in the basement writing his next hit and the cell signal might not
2029000	2030000	be catching.
2030000	2031720	Let's see if maybe he's, uh, come to the surface.
2031720	2034240	I'm gonna try to get through again real quick here.
2034240	2035640	Your call has been-
2035640	2037600	Oh, boy, that's really not good.
2037600	2038600	Alright.
2038600	2042280	Let's, uh, let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that.
2042280	2043280	Alright.
2043280	2044560	And then, um, let's see.
2044560	2050880	They also, uh, you know, they're showing off some of the different, uh, kind of artwork
2050880	2051880	for the game.
2051880	2056640	A lot of it's still very early, um, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game.
2056640	2060920	I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing, um,
2060920	2065920	but then again, I guess I got used to it with, you know, Final Fantasy XI and that kind of
2065920	2066920	stuff.
2066920	2071880	Um, and then some other stuff, not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online, but Skyrim,
2071880	2077200	um, one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard, well that's been officially
2077200	2083440	announced now that Dawnguard will be the first, um, expansion to Skyrim and it'll be coming
2083440	2090280	out this summer and, of course, being, um, talked about during E3, um, and, you know,
2090280	2097200	the rumors, of course, um, that it's gonna feature, you know, uh, you know, crossbows
2097200	2102480	and, um, some other types of characters and races and stuff in there.
2102480	2108360	So, very interesting, um, might even be cool if they have, like, some of the, uh, because
2108360	2113200	remember when they had, like, this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's
2113200	2118120	like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit that, for Skyrim,
2118120	2119120	go!
2119120	2124160	And then they had, like, you know, spear throwing and, um, I wanna say that, like, the kill
2124160	2131440	cameras for Magic and stuff like that came out of that and, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure
2131440	2136880	crossbows probably will come out of that as well, so it would be neat to see some more
2136880	2137880	of that stuff in there.
2137880	2143240	I mean, they seem pretty creative, so, um, looking forward to that.
2143240	2147440	Um, and of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but, uh,
2147440	2152200	the Kinect update finally came out now for Skyrim for the Xbox 360 and they have 200
2152200	2154360	voice commands added in there as well.
2154360	2159200	Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC, but apparently there
2159200	2160200	are-
2160200	2162440	That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming foosurada!
2162440	2165640	Uh, apparently there's already mods available that have it.
2165640	2168860	And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those
2168860	2169860	voice mods to work.
2169860	2175360	You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange, but, you know, whatever, that's how
2175360	2176360	they did it.
2176360	2180640	All right, I'm gonna try again here, guys.
2180640	2184040	Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right
2184040	2185040	now.
2185040	2189280	Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen.
2189280	2190280	You know, it's live!
2190280	2191900	Anything can happen live!
2191900	2193320	He did know what time we were gonna-
2193320	2197280	He did, and I- well, he's in Arizona, but they're on the same time as us right now.
2197280	2200600	Arizona's a funky state, because sometimes during the year they're like an hour ahead
2200600	2201600	and sometimes they're not.
2201600	2203320	Because Arizona does things their way.
2203320	2205240	That's right, their way or the highway.
2205240	2209880	But yeah, I used world clock to make sure everybody was on board with 630, but you know,
2209880	2210880	he's got a big project right.
2210880	2216680	He just did some Kickstarter thing that, you know, made a ton of money, and there- probably
2216680	2222040	I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to, you know, do some voices
2222040	2226480	for his project right now, so he's just- I guess he's just a little busy right now.
2226480	2230760	So we will keep trying here in just a little bit.
2230760	2234520	But uh, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO.
2234520	2238920	I'm not, it's just because, you know, I had imagined, you know, okay, it's basically gonna
2238920	2243220	be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're gonna have,
2243220	2246900	you know, a lot of players running around and it's gonna be all time real.
2246900	2252320	That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, an MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like.
2252320	2255440	And then it was like, okay, it's gonna be a third person perspective.
2255440	2256440	Well, that's alright.
2256440	2259760	Oh, that's gonna have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs.
2259760	2264480	It's like crap, you know, so basically you're doing- you're copycatting everything that
2264480	2270800	other MMOs are doing, because you wanna, you know, draw more people to it so that they're
2270800	2275720	not afraid of it, instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get
2275720	2282520	the people that play your games normally to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter
2282520	2287440	since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot
2287440	2290640	of people that play, like, you know, World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with,
2290640	2292480	oh, it's first person perspective.
2292480	2293480	That's a little bit fresh.
2293480	2295040	It's a little different of an idea.
2295040	2299440	Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
2299440	2300440	click, click, oh, dead.
2300440	2304320	Alright, go, next game, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead, okay, I
2304320	2305880	mean, it just sounds really boring.
2305880	2309200	That's why I don't play MMOs.
2309200	2312520	Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right?
2312520	2315880	That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action,
2315880	2318120	it's hard to judge it, right?
2318120	2322480	I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right?
2322480	2331040	Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now.
2331040	2332040	Right.
2332040	2333040	Okay, alright.
2333040	2338800	Um, well, um, I guess let's try Mega again, it's been 10 minutes, I, I, unfortunately,
2338800	2343160	it's um, deducting money from the Skype thingy every time I try, it's like, I can't afford
2343160	2346640	too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything
2346640	2347640	I can.
2347640	2352480	I feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's
2352480	2353480	try it right now.
2353480	2356720	We're going to try one more time to get through here, after all it is live radio.
2356720	2357720	Yeah.
2357720	2358720	Oh, it's been forwarded.
2358720	2361000	Oh my gosh, is the phone even on?
2361000	2366800	Mega's phone may just not be on, maybe he was trying to nap, he's just so tired that
2366800	2367800	the darn phone isn't even on.
2367800	2369840	I think I'm going to send a tweet.
2369840	2372240	I actually already did, so we'll see.
2372240	2376960	I tweeted him, so hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops, yeah, there's this
2376960	2381380	one place in my house I was, I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal and I was standing
2381380	2383960	in it, so there it is.
2383960	2386320	Well, we do have more stories.
2386320	2389600	That's right, we do have some more stories we can go over, so I think we'll go ahead
2389600	2391560	and get to that.
2391560	2393480	Dark Sakura, why don't you read one for us?
2393480	2394480	Sure.
2394480	2399880	How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie?
2399880	2402560	Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie.
2402560	2409960	They had somebody lined up, they had one Carlos Fresnadio and he walked out saying that the
2409960	2416960	video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating.
2416960	2423160	So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it who wants to make it really scary, but the studio
2423160	2425880	doesn't want to pay for it really.
2425880	2430960	He wants to do a rated R version, not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less.
2430960	2434320	I mean, basically the quote was the little sisters and injections and the whole thing.
2434320	2438720	I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later you're still shivering
2438720	2439720	and going Jesus Christ.
2439720	2443080	I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that?
2443080	2446540	Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little
2446540	2449840	girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people.
2449840	2453680	And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this, this might be pushing
2453680	2454680	it for some people.
2454680	2458760	We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's
2458760	2459760	fine.
2459760	2462440	I mean, I would see it.
2462440	2466320	I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play
2466320	2467320	it while he was playing it.
2467320	2468320	Right, right.
2468320	2473480	So yeah, of course I don't mind stuff like that.
2473480	2476760	I mean, it's not the human centipede, so, so that's good.
2476760	2477760	Oh my God.
2477760	2479400	My friend is so excited about the third one.
2479400	2480400	Oh God.
2480400	2481400	They're making a third one.
2481400	2482400	Yeah.
2482400	2487400	I going, speaking of movies that have no hundred and 50 people, movies with no redeeming qualities
2487400	2493400	whatsoever and her grandmother love the human centipede.
2493400	2497520	That's like the grandma's watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape.
2497520	2498520	You've met my friend Carly.
2498520	2499520	Yeah.
2499520	2500520	Yeah.
2500520	2501520	It's her.
2501520	2503000	Well, I don't know her grandma, but she's sick.
2503000	2504000	You're German.
2504000	2506280	What's that have to do with anything?
2506280	2507280	I don't know.
2507280	2509480	You know, Germans are all sick people.
2509480	2513240	No, it's just very strong stomach.
2513240	2514240	Very stoic.
2514240	2515240	A hundred and 50 people.
2515240	2516240	Really?
2516240	2517240	It's going to be low key.
2517240	2520480	You should, you should audition for the part of one of the victims.
2520480	2523400	I don't think that they're casting it's going to be CG.
2523400	2529760	You know that, but anyway, I would see this.
2529760	2534600	I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede
2534600	2535600	movies.
2535600	2536600	Just saying.
2536600	2537600	Absolutely.
2537600	2539840	And then seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's
2539840	2542000	just a hundred person train?
2542000	2545280	I mean, seriously, I think that's going to happen.
2545280	2549600	I actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway, was watching bad
2549600	2552640	porn with, you know, perhaps, perhaps.
2552640	2553640	I don't know.
2553640	2554640	I don't know.
2554640	2555640	All right.
2555640	2557960	Um, here's what I'm going to do guys since it's six 45 and it's 15 minutes after the
2557960	2562120	time we scheduled a mega ran, I'm going to give it one more try, but this will be the
2562120	2563760	sixth try.
2563760	2567920	And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys, cause that's six
2567920	2569920	times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through.
2569920	2574120	So let's all, let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about mega ran and
2574120	2575920	maybe he'll get through this time.
2575920	2579680	So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network.
2579680	2585560	I better, you know, I, that's killer.
2585560	2586560	That's killer.
2586560	2589120	I'm going to, I'm going to do that whole like panicking thing.
2589120	2592040	Like am I calling the right number?
2592040	2597600	Did I put the right number into Skype and it's duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,
2597600	2598600	duh, duh.
2598600	2599600	Yep.
2599600	2600600	It's the same, right?
2600600	2601600	That's that.
2601600	2602600	That's the number.
2602600	2603600	You should leave him a message.
2603600	2604600	You see, let's leave a message.
2604600	2608080	I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it
2608080	2609080	here.
2609080	2610520	So why don't I go grab my cell phone?
2610520	2614560	I'm going to give mega ran a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going
2614560	2616800	to say, call it whenever you're ready.
2616800	2617800	That's a great idea.
2617800	2620400	That way you make a ramp fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight.
2620400	2622880	So I'm going to go do that right now.
2622880	2627120	And I realized I'm, I owe you guys a story, but maybe, maybe Loki will cover it for me.
2627120	2631640	I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers, Loki, maybe you could cover the story for
2631640	2632640	me.
2632640	2634480	And I'm going to go give mega ran a call on my personal line.
2634480	2635480	All right.
2635480	2639920	So you know how they have, you know, lay away and stuff like that.
2639920	2644080	Um, well, Microsoft want to kind of wants to do something similar to that for their
2644080	2645840	Xbox 360.
2645840	2649600	They are, there is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized
2649600	2655320	connect bundle available, um, starting next week.
2655320	2659680	And what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying
2659680	2661160	like a cell phone or a cell phone plan.
2661160	2665920	You get the cell phone at an increase, you know, a very big discount.
2665920	2670560	And then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly
2670560	2674040	fees, you know, and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200.
2674040	2681560	Or, you know, it's when they normally costs about 600 or 700 without the contract.
2681560	2685100	So that's going to be something similar with this.
2685100	2690500	Basically the Verge is saying that the bundle is going to be $100 upfront and you're going
2690500	2694640	to pay $15 a month each month for two years.
2694640	2699000	And it's also going to include, uh, the Xbox live gold service.
2699000	2706200	So it would be a way to kind of get people in the door, um, to, you know, buying a system
2706200	2711680	and being able to play with it for a couple of years, um, without having to drop, you
2711680	2714080	know, $400 right away.
2714080	2719720	Now you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you,
2719720	2721020	you know, bought it outright.
2721020	2723360	But I think that's more of a convenience.
2723360	2726480	I mean, cause you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like
2726480	2728000	that for a cell phone.
2728000	2734520	So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more, um, about $460 after
2734520	2737320	the end of the, um, service agreement.
2737320	2743280	Um, the good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems because
2743280	2746640	some of those old systems might last two years.
2746640	2748780	But uh, I don't know.
2748780	2750080	It's an interesting idea.
2750080	2753560	I could work, um, especially if you get people to do it.
2753560	2755840	I'm just going to, I don't know.
2755840	2759160	It'll be interesting to see how, how that works out.
2759160	2762560	You know, people paying $15 a month, but I guess that's not too much.
2762560	2766860	I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches.
2766860	2772080	So if you can spare a couple of lunches a month, I mean you can be playing an Xbox games
2772080	2773080	for a couple of years.
2773080	2775440	It's an EAD I guess.
2775440	2776440	Okay.
2776440	2778120	I'm back from making that phone call.
2778120	2779800	So I'll guys, I'll let you guys know what happens.
2779800	2782280	I really apologize to the Mega Ran fans.
2782280	2783280	These things happen.
2783280	2784280	It's live radio.
2784280	2786560	It legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now.
2786560	2787560	Just unplanned.
2787560	2790240	You know, haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll
2790240	2792200	be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at.
2792200	2794920	And then suddenly, Oh, no cell signal that could be happening with me.
2794920	2799000	I have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you know, you have to re reboot
2799000	2802520	it every once in a while because you know, people try calling you for days and you're
2802520	2805800	like, well, my cell phone's been on this entire time and no calls and he rebooted.
2805800	2807920	And you're like, Hey, why do I have all these missed calls?
2807920	2808920	Exactly.
2808920	2812240	So, uh, you know, again, Mega Ran fans who might be tuned into OLR for the first time
2812240	2813240	trying to hear this interview.
2813240	2816680	I just, you know, I want to say that we're not, we're not, we're not, uh, pulling a fast
2816680	2817680	one on you.
2817680	2819480	We are legit trying to get through.
2819480	2820520	We had things set up.
2820520	2821920	You'll notice Mega retweeted it.
2821920	2823040	So, you know, he knew about it.
2823040	2825160	It's just, you know, these things sometimes happen.
2825160	2829560	I'm hoping I gave him the number to call right through to the show.
2829560	2833660	Uh, and, uh, so maybe he'll just pop up during the show.
2833660	2834660	So we'll see.
2834660	2837080	So, uh, we'll let you know.
2837080	2838280	All right.
2838280	2843120	Anyhow, um, back to the Xbox story and the, uh, $99 Xbox.
2843120	2845760	So I just want to point something out with this.
2845760	2853120	When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year, and if
2853120	2858760	you forgot what that's all about, cause you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12 month
2858760	2864360	agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo three for free and you get a mount
2864360	2867360	and you get into the beta and all this stuff.
2867360	2868360	One little thing.
2868360	2869360	Yeah.
2869360	2871200	Finals week is not the best week to launch this game.
2871200	2872200	Okay.
2872200	2877840	Um, I said back when that happened, I said, Hey, uh, you know, it's just a matter of time
2877840	2882680	before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone
2882680	2885760	contracts style agreements.
2885760	2888740	Now granted, I didn't think about the system element.
2888740	2895520	I had thought, Oh, well sign up for two years of Xbox live gold and get free halo maps or
2895520	2898960	a free game or something like that giveaway and all this.
2898960	2901640	Um, and here we are.
2901640	2905440	We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing.
2905440	2910280	Now coming to consoles, let me take it a step further.
2910280	2914240	This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further.
2914240	2919960	We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out, not just the
2919960	2924920	Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it in the PlayStation four, whatever they end
2924920	2930600	up calling that these systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive
2930600	2932260	as hell.
2932260	2937400	I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation three
2937400	2939280	when it first rolled out.
2939280	2944120	Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price?
2944120	2945120	Yes.
2945120	2950480	And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation four
2950480	2958880	for $199 with a two year PlayStation plus agreement.
2958880	2959880	You know what?
2959880	2965100	If the thing is, um, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this,
2965100	2971400	this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know, Xbox live gold.
2971400	2972640	So $15 a month.
2972640	2976920	Yeah, it's more per year, but it's not that bad.
2976920	2978080	$15 is not bad.
2978080	2982800	Hell, I pay $15 for use in an access every month and I don't even remember.
2982800	2986000	I forget that even habits and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.
2986000	2987000	It got charged.
2987000	2989520	So $15 a month is not a big deal.
2989520	2992680	Just those little things that add up though, man, that in this economy, that's the stuff
2992680	2996380	that can really get you because it's like, you know, Oh, maybe I'll pay $15 for this
2996380	3001600	credit monitoring or I'll pay $20 a month for this Disneyland annual pass or a, you
3001600	3006480	know, 20 bucks for my 24 of our fitness membership and all that stuff starts to add up.
3006480	3009440	So, but it's an, it's an easy thing to fall for though.
3009440	3010440	Think about it.
3010440	3014200	If you own an iPhone and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else.
3014200	3018880	If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill.
3018880	3020440	It's basically the iPhone tax.
3020440	3021440	Yeah.
3021440	3022440	And you know what?
3022440	3023680	I don't care because my phone is sexy.
3023680	3025400	Yeah, it's, it's a hell of a phone.
3025400	3030200	And I have to say for everyone who's saying Diablo three and well to quote, Vogonator
3030200	3032440	kiss outside in any sense of social life.
3032440	3033440	Goodbye.
3033440	3041880	Just saying been playing well and Diablo three beta and the wow beta and I work full time
3041880	3046140	and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what?
3046140	3050200	I still got for pink berry and get laid.
3050200	3056580	Just saying it's possible and I'm going to Disneyland.
3056580	3060240	So just saying that was a great way to cap it all off by the way.
3060240	3062320	Just saying it's possible.
3062320	3066400	Time management, learn those skills.
3066400	3068640	And you have the show and I have the show.
3068640	3069640	Yes I do.
3069640	3075900	And potentially I would another little project with the lovely cell that I'll kind of don't
3075900	3076900	buy the horn.
3076900	3078000	You can chew, but I do love me some sill.
3078000	3079000	All right.
3079000	3080400	Go into our chat room at vog network.com.
3080400	3081800	Uh, it's right.
3081800	3082800	Penaxium.
3082800	3086960	I am a time management pro, uh, shadow next gen says the PlayStation four will not be
3086960	3087960	$699.
3087960	3089880	I was just throwing it out there.
3089880	3090880	What is an iPhone?
3090880	3091880	A little iPhone?
3091880	3094760	What does the iPhone cost unsubsidized?
3094760	3098960	If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost?
3098960	3103380	I'll tell you because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the
3103380	3106920	unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up.
3106920	3107920	$699.
3107920	3108920	Yeah.
3108920	3114600	I've been a place, I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone and
3114600	3119100	it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone four S, but an Android it's a, was a Samsung
3119100	3125960	galaxy two or Samsung was a galaxy S two or something like that.
3125960	3133320	Um, and luckily I bought my news, so I got it for about $300, but I mean it's still fucking
3133320	3134320	expensive.
3134320	3135320	All right.
3135320	3137480	I'm looking through some more comments.
3137480	3140680	Our chat room at vog network.com, uh, let's see.
3140680	3141680	Ross deal.
3141680	3144920	UT says, of course the PlayStation four won't be $699.
3144920	3146620	Sony learned that mistake.
3146620	3147620	Think about what I'm saying though.
3147620	3148620	Ross deal.
3148620	3152960	UT here's a way for them not to make that mistake yet still charge that price.
3152960	3153960	Think about it though.
3153960	3157720	And because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more
3157720	3161120	than, you know, recouping like two or $300.
3161120	3166280	That's recouping like double that you're talking, you know, $50 a month payments.
3166280	3171360	That's a still a little bit much, uh, what up G in our chat room at, uh, vognetwork.com
3171360	3172360	says.
3172360	3176120	Then again, they kept the Vita price at two 49, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped
3176120	3177120	the three DS price.
3177120	3178440	That's a good point.
3178440	3182360	They released the Vita cheaper and a lot of people thought they would and it sounded great
3182360	3184520	and then no, the DS is now cheaper.
3184520	3185520	I don't know.
3185520	3189360	It wasn't that bad cause they had, they added, they couldn't drop the price of the system
3189360	3193480	anymore, but they added value to it by including a eight gig memory card.
3193480	3194480	So that wasn't so bad.
3194480	3195480	The Vita is still a sexy piece of hardware.
3195480	3199320	I mean, I mean three DS is too, I'm not knocking it, but you know, the three DS doesn't do
3199320	3200320	Skype.
3200320	3201320	It does.
3201320	3203060	The Vita does the web a little better.
3203060	3206420	You know, there's some things that the Vita does have on the three DS right now.
3206420	3210240	Although I will say three DS has some pretty must have games right now.
3210240	3213800	I own them both.
3213800	3217320	Ross deal UT in chat says sky will the rent to own crowd be big enough?
3217320	3218320	I don't think so.
3218320	3220720	Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone.
3220720	3221800	iPhone's the biggest phone out there.
3221800	3227720	Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal and I bet
3227720	3231080	Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation four sold as iPhones.
3231080	3232080	And what are iPhones?
3232080	3234160	They're subsidized by contract.
3234160	3235720	Hmm.
3235720	3236720	It could happen.
3236720	3241560	All right, anyhow, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release
3241560	3246840	dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you.
3246840	3248180	There's not much this week.
3248180	3249960	It's it's really sad.
3249960	3252320	This week you're basically looking at two things.
3252320	3254200	You've got this really cheap ass game.
3254200	3258080	Um, it's like this foreign one action pack from South peak.
3258080	3262880	It's for games that were a PlayStation, never games you've probably never, ever heard of.
3262880	3268240	Um, that's on PS three this week and then also another PS three game star Hawk will
3268240	3269240	be out this week.
3269240	3270560	That's actually a pretty decent one.
3270560	3274560	Um, so that's coming out as well for PS three, nothing else.
3274560	3275560	Wow.
3275560	3278680	That's a pretty quick week.
3278680	3280600	What's the next like big, big title coming out?
3280600	3283080	Uh, would it be the week after Max Payne three?
3283080	3284400	Oh yeah, that's right.
3284400	3288640	Three and herp derp Diablo three, Max Payne three, the rise of Bruce Willis.
3288640	3292840	I always forget because you know, with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually
3292840	3295600	save the money to buy Diablo three, which is kind of nice.
3295600	3300080	Well then, you know, beyond that, uh, there's another $15 a month thing I pay for.
3300080	3303920	Well also was it the game of Thrones games going to be coming out, um, next week as well.
3303920	3305960	The week after next as well.
3305960	3310160	One does not simply pre-order the game of Thrones games.
3310160	3311160	It should be good.
3311160	3314400	I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books.
3314400	3318880	I mean, at least he wrote the story for it and it's got characters that aren't, it's
3318880	3326800	kind of like the, um, the enter, enter the matrix of the game of Thrones series.
3326800	3330760	It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they kind of, they're probably
3330760	3334120	going to cross into the series.
3334120	3340920	So all right, well I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but I'm like a lot
3340920	3341920	of things on this show tonight.
3341920	3342920	It just doesn't want to work.
3342920	3344400	So maybe we can go to Europe real fast.
3344400	3345400	Well maybe we can.
3345400	3348400	It's, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly.
3348400	3355600	Um, on May 9th in the UK we have Datura, which I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes
3355600	3359520	me think of all of the times I read clan of the cave bear cause that's what they called
3359520	3362160	like this one urban, anyway.
3362160	3368260	On the 11th we have Starhawk and Street Fighter cross Tekken for PC and then that's it for
3368260	3370260	this week.
3370260	3375600	I mean there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really
3375600	3376600	it for this week.
3376600	3377600	Hey, great.
3377600	3381320	I've got Japanese release dates for you, but remember that whole golden week we were talking
3381320	3382320	about last week?
3382320	3383320	It's over.
3383320	3387080	Well it's over, but you can still kind of feel its impact on the release dates and you
3387080	3391120	know a lot of the whole economical things that go into why there's no games coming out
3391120	3397040	in the US right now are also playing out in Japan because on the Nintendo 3DS, nothing.
3397040	3400200	Going to the Vita, nothing.
3400200	3402840	How about on the Playstation 3?
3402840	3405280	Starhawk is a release you have to look forward to this week.
3405280	3409080	Starhawk comes out on May 10th in Japan, so there is that.
3409080	3413880	And lastly going to the Wii or the 360, nothing on the Wii, but of course things on the Wii
3413880	3414880	are dying down.
3414880	3417080	Xbox 360 doesn't have anything this week either.
3417080	3422320	El Shaddai next week, but, oh that's even an Encore edition, that's just a price reduction,
3422320	3426760	but yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are.
3426760	3429120	You get a chance to check that out in Japan.
3429120	3430840	That's it for Japanese releases.
3430840	3435520	Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
3435520	3437960	Alright.
3437960	3444140	Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops and, you know, we talked about the
3444140	3447120	rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that, apparently they were correct.
3447120	3452360	I honestly thought it was called Eclipse, and actually it is technically called Eclipse.
3452360	3457960	That was the internal name for the game, as I found out.
3457960	3460800	So there's a little truth to that.
3460800	3467280	But yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th, and of course on Playstation
3467280	3470280	3, Xbox 360 PC confirmed.
3470280	3475000	I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something
3475000	3476000	like that.
3476000	3478480	But of course all that stuff will be announced later on.
3478480	3479840	It looks pretty interesting.
3479840	3485780	The game itself is actually going to be taking place in the future, you know, over the course
3485780	3486780	of a couple decades.
3486780	3492080	It's actually going to take place partly in the 80s, and then it's going to jump all the
3492080	3495240	way up through 2025.
3495240	3504480	And kind of talking about some of this unmanned warfare stuff, a lot of the drones and that
3504480	3505480	kind of stuff.
3505480	3510040	So basically the enemy takes over that and starts attacking LA and the US, and it's up
3510040	3515240	to real men, real soldiers on the ground to take out the enemies.
3515240	3519120	And so a very interesting looking thing, some of the new stuff that they're going to be
3519120	3529240	adding to the actual campaign of the game, including some branching missions and these
3529240	3537040	new type of missions called strike force, where it's almost a little bit open world.
3537040	3543160	I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff, where you kind of have a point A, point
3543160	3548980	B, but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things.
3548980	3554080	So that sounds kind of interesting, and then of course they're going to be adding the standard
3554080	3559480	multiplayer stuff, and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as
3559480	3561160	well.
3561160	3562560	I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it.
3562560	3564980	After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet.
3564980	3567840	So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up, and actually it kind of makes
3567840	3571200	me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing
3571200	3572280	that as well.
3572280	3576000	So you think that there's actually going to be money made off of sales of the old copy
3576000	3577000	then, huh?
3577000	3581120	Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game.
3581120	3585240	And then of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 day 1 preorders were actually
3585240	3592120	higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 preorders, so it's off to a good start.
3592120	3593120	Sounds that way.
3593120	3594120	Hey, guess what guys?
3594120	3595280	I have some great news.
3595280	3597000	Guess who just called me?
3597000	3598000	Random.
3598000	3599000	Awesome.
3599000	3603120	So, he said, he apologizes.
3603120	3604520	This has happened to you, right?
3604520	3605520	The phone died.
3605520	3609720	So you had to go plug in, but we're going to get him on now.
3609720	3613240	Thank you guys for being patient, and those of you that left, well, tough cookies.
3613240	3618600	For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing, you need to hear Random or MegaRan
3618600	3620040	right now.
3620040	3621040	Hello?
3621040	3623200	Hey, is this MegaRan?
3623200	3626240	Yes, it is, how are you?
3626240	3627240	What is up?
3627240	3630560	It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, here with DarkSakura and Loki.
3630560	3631560	How's it going?
3631560	3634960	The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live.
3634960	3636440	How you doing?
3636440	3641680	Sorry, I'm good, I had an adventurous day, sorry I'm late, sorry.
3641680	3642680	That is oka-
3642680	3648400	My flight was delayed, and the phone died, and all types of other things, but I'm here.
3648400	3651400	You could file that under, you know, Fashionable Superstar.
3651400	3655760	Yeah, that is A-okay, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity, is when you're
3655760	3661040	showing up fashionably late.
3661040	3664680	These things happen, don't even worry about it, we're good, I'm just happy that you're
3664680	3665680	here on the air.
3665680	3670760	And hey, if you guys have a question for Random, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you
3670760	3674640	can ask that question in chat right now, but while you guys get those questions out there,
3674640	3677720	I got some questions for Random that I want to ask.
3677720	3682760	Now Random, some of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio, you know, they might
3682760	3685400	be gamers, but they might not know about you.
3685400	3689560	So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated?
3689560	3700440	Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all
3700440	3705480	of those things together, you know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture
3705480	3710120	and history, and I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty
3710120	3712520	cool music.
3712520	3718920	A lot of it is video game based, what I do is I like to use the traditional sounds from
3718920	3724800	video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that,
3724800	3731000	and then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game,
3731000	3736800	sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes, and I put it all together
3736800	3741280	and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Ran.
3741280	3744420	That's awesome, and if you want to check out the music, of course you can visit Random
3744420	3750600	or Mega Ran at his website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for
3750600	3753760	download, and some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little
3753760	3757360	bit, so free is awesome, thank you for providing that.
3757360	3758360	So I have a question.
3758360	3759360	Free is always good.
3759360	3760360	Questions, yeah?
3760360	3761360	Yeah, Dark Sakura.
3761360	3763360	What do you teach?
3763360	3771040	Oh, I taught middle school, I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing, and history,
3771040	3774160	social studies, stuff like that, to middle school kids.
3774160	3778200	You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects, ever.
3778200	3781600	I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend.
3781600	3783600	Oh my, totally.
3783600	3790120	Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so, up until this past
3790120	3795840	year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time, and there
3795840	3798160	I am, so far I feel good.
3798160	3800200	That sounds awesome.
3800200	3803900	That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love, because Random, I gotta
3803900	3807800	tell you, I'm a teacher too, I'm a different type of teacher, I'm a corporate trainer,
3807800	3811920	so I teach people in my company, and that's my day job, but I've had this podcast with
3811920	3816640	my buddies for ten years, and I'd love to be able to quit, as much as I love my day
3816640	3820560	job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time, but you're doing it, you're
3820560	3822440	living the dream, and that's awesome.
3822440	3827280	Yeah, and I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do
3827280	3833520	in teaching as well in music, so there's always lessons and things, I love history, I love
3833520	3838000	poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff with my favorite books, I will talk
3838000	3842600	about them and rap about them, so it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as
3842600	3846440	well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it, I was already doing what I loved,
3846440	3851200	it was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's
3851200	3852200	all.
3852200	3856680	What was the first video game that inspired you to take it to music?
3856680	3859920	Was it Mega Man, or was there something else that maybe people don't know about?
3859920	3866000	What was the first video game that inspired you, like, this game is so awesome, I've gotta,
3866000	3869840	it really takes a special kind of game to take that extra step and make that fan creation
3869840	3872680	for it, whether it be a podcast or a website or a rap song.
3872680	3873680	What was the first for you?
3873680	3874680	That's true.
3874680	3881320	Oh, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that I first
3881320	3886560	decided or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies
3886560	3887560	2.
3887560	3893560	Now, Goonies 2 had a really cool, it was a good game, it had a really cool soundtrack,
3893560	3900440	and I had a Casio keyboard, and that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay
3900440	3910000	on my keyboard, I still remember it, but I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard,
3910000	3914320	and so not knowing, you know, when I'm, I don't know, 10, 11, 12 years old, that I was
3914320	3919280	actually making what is now considered to be fan art, but it was just me playing it
3919280	3924040	by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create.
3924040	3929280	I didn't necessarily do anything with that, but that was the first time that I ever experienced
3929280	3935200	a movie, not movie, but video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want
3935200	3938080	to try to create my own version of it.
3938080	3942880	Goonies 2 is an incredibly underrated 8-bit game, you know, looking back, and I am totally
3942880	3946880	with you, that game had a lot more depth than a lot of people gave it credit for, especially
3946880	3948280	for being a loose movie tie-in.
3948280	3955000	Oh yeah, I really loved that game, I had a huge plenty of hours of fun on that game.
3955000	3958560	Let's talk about other games that have really inspired you music, now I know a lot of folks
3958560	3962640	may know you through the Capcom stuff, you know, Splash Woman was huge for you, you had
3962640	3969200	the Mega Ran 9, Mega Ran 10, but it's not just Capcom games, you have this Black Materia
3969200	3973600	album that's out, you have a regular version, you have a remixed version, it's Final Fantasy
3973600	3976840	7, which is kind of a polarizing game in the fan community.
3976840	3980400	Some people love Final Fantasy 7, some people are sick of hearing about it.
3980400	3985320	What is it about Final Fantasy 7 that moved you to dedicate two albums to it?
3985320	3990900	Well, Final Fantasy 7 was a huge game for me, I was pretty much out of gaming when it
3990900	3996800	came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school, I didn't have time
3996800	4002800	for games anymore, I didn't have a system, until I watched one of my friends or suitemates
4002800	4007880	play it, and I was completely hooked, I saw some of the summons and just watched about
4007880	4014360	an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined roleplaying games to me, because
4014360	4020840	the 3D aspect and the character development was just so awesome, so I wound up getting
4020840	4026760	the Playstation almost flunking out of school playing this game, I mean, it's something
4026760	4032600	that completely enveloped me, so it's a huge part of my childhood, so that's what made
4032600	4037360	me go back, because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable
4037360	4043720	to me, that it changed the game to me, that was my introduction, well kind of reintroduction
4043720	4050040	to gaming, and so that was the game that got me back into console gaming, so I feel like
4050040	4055440	I owe a lot to it, so I decided to do a little homage to it, called Black Materia, luckily
4055440	4060440	a lot of people liked it, came out last year, and kind of took off a little bit, that might
4060440	4066400	be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music, it's because the demand
4066400	4072480	for it and for performances after that just became too much to handle with a full time
4072480	4078560	job, so it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood.
4078560	4081280	But you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the
4081280	4085960	only one out there that has such, some memories tied to that game, I know that was a huge
4085960	4091040	game for me in college, I probably failed a class or two because of Final Fantasy VII,
4091040	4098760	but it was so worth it, which maybe I shouldn't be telling a teacher.
4098760	4103760	Final Fantasy VII came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a Playstation, my
4103760	4108160	roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a Playstation, I had a SNES, I was
4108160	4114600	still playing Chrono Trigger, but I played the stew out of that and did time the nights
4114600	4120320	of the round with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing, did go long enough for me to make a
4120320	4121320	sandwich.
4121320	4122320	Wow.
4122320	4123320	It's true.
4123320	4128240	Alright, let me ask, let me ask, we only have so much time with Random Tonight, I want to
4128240	4132440	ask him about another game series, because this is one, this is a very recent addition
4132440	4139920	to your website at Mayoran.com and I was, in a way I was not surprised at all to see
4139920	4144920	this, I wasn't, I wasn't, Journey, a hip hop excursion, you were recently plugging this
4144920	4149880	on your website, oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either,
4149880	4155320	but the way you translated this into hip hop is something else, tell me more about the
4155320	4157680	process of creating Journey, a hip hop excursion.
4157680	4162600	Oh man, that was a lot of fun, I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched
4162600	4168680	and moved by the Journey video game, I was told and emailed constantly about playing
4168680	4171840	this game, but I just didn't have enough time, and people were like, you gotta play it, you
4171840	4176040	gotta play it, you're gonna love it, and I'm like, yeah, that's all I need is another game,
4176040	4180880	I have games here that are unopened, that I haven't been able to get to yet, but I don't
4180880	4184440	have time, and they're like, no, that's the best thing about it, it's just, it's an hour
4184440	4190280	long experience, you just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it, and so I did, I played
4190280	4195760	it, and I was instantly inspired, I mean, it's a great game, it's so cool how they just
4195760	4202040	created the entire scenario, I mean, there's no dialogue, you're basically creating your
4202040	4208160	own story and synopsis, and it's just such an experience, I don't even know any other
4208160	4213360	way to describe it except an experience, because it just kinda immerses you, so when I wound
4213360	4220200	up playing the game through Think Twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack, and then
4220200	4225240	I had a whole day, I think I was just, I was trying to raise funds with Kickstarter, and
4225240	4229640	we had got to a really, a certain level, I think it was maybe 10,000, and usually when
4229640	4236440	I get to round numbers, I try to give a, some sort of a surprise gift for the support, so
4236440	4239760	as I was playing the journey soundtrack, I said, well, why don't I work on making some
4239760	4245940	hip hop beats, so the entire day, I sat down, I use a program called Reason, so what I do
4245940	4250400	is just take the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little
4250400	4256240	bit, stretch them out, slow them down, go through them, add some drums, take out some
4256240	4261960	things, you know, bring them back in later, and wound up creating some really cool beats
4261960	4267920	with the very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel, and that was really what I wanted
4267920	4272120	to create, so it came out pretty well, I really like it, I still listen to it a lot.
4272120	4277720	It's great, and you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right?
4277720	4279920	I saw that tweet on your website, it's awesome.
4279920	4285360	Yeah, that was pretty cool, Austin Wintory actually listened to it, and told me he liked
4285360	4289240	it, told me it was a great job, and I'm like, wow, that's pretty cool, I mean, you gotta
4289240	4294720	love Twitter for that reason, just that everything is so accessible, everybody's one click away,
4294720	4299820	and I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey
4299820	4305720	remixes that they contacted him about it, like, hey Austin, have you heard this?
4305720	4310680	And so that's kind of what made him respond, and so that was really cool, like, props from
4310680	4313840	the man himself, you really can't beat that.
4313840	4317560	And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing, because this whole interview
4317560	4321380	tonight is being brought to you by Twitter, you know, we say we are the show where every
4321380	4325800	gamer has a voice, and we went to Twitter, and we said, hey tweets, who do you want to
4325800	4326800	see on the show?
4326800	4332640	And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on, and here we are,
4332640	4333640	here we are.
4333640	4337120	Yes, I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen.
4337120	4338120	That's right.
4338120	4342520	Now, you brought up Kickstarter a minute ago, and I kind of wanted to go in that direction,
4342520	4347460	because you know, Kickstarter's been a very big thing, it's been this buzzword in our
4347460	4352360	community for, you know, a few months, and it's been big for you too, and I know you've
4352360	4355640	done a couple projects on there, and this most recent one you did was called Language
4355640	4356640	Arts.
4356640	4361440	Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it, how did the
4361440	4364040	community help you achieve your goals with Language Arts?
4364040	4369280	Oh man, well, the community was just humongous, I don't, but we've done a Kickstarter in the
4369280	4376560	past, like I said, we've done one for, actually two, we've been wanting to create vinyl for
4376560	4381080	a Sam and Tom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album.
4381080	4388120	Then we did another later for a, to play a show with London, at the London Anime Con,
4388120	4393640	and both of those went decent, we got our goals, we didn't get necessarily way over
4393640	4399240	the goal, but we did pretty well, and I decided to go back and try it again, it was one of
4399240	4403440	those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy, everybody's doing it these
4403440	4408440	days, like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now, video game companies
4408440	4415080	are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now, and so I always
4415080	4419160	told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea,
4419160	4423680	so instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years,
4423680	4429000	almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience, so instead of just an album,
4429000	4432680	it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book.
4432680	4437640	Now of course I can't do all that on my own without having artists and developers help
4437640	4443760	me out, so I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out, so that then came
4443760	4448720	Kickstarter, so I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere
4448720	4454720	near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this, but I said we'll start small,
4454720	4467640	and lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000, so a 516% completion rate,
4467640	4473960	and just from the response has been overwhelming, I mean from Facebook, Twitter, to just the
4473960	4481640	guys on my email list, I went out to PAX East and performed, and it was probably right before
4481640	4485400	the Kickstarter really got underway, and I told a lot of people about it, and people
4485400	4490600	were like hey I want to support, and sure enough they did, we had over 300 backers who
4490600	4495200	are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comic,
4495200	4499960	so I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level, and that's what hopefully
4499960	4506240	this Kickstarter has allowed us to do, I think I want to do this in a whole new way, and
4506240	4509600	this could be the album that kind of defined me, you know I've done a lot of Final Fantasy
4509600	4515600	stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property, but
4515600	4520240	I really want to create my own legacy, and I think this Language Arts project will do
4520240	4523200	that when it's all done.
4523200	4528200	I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal, and just kind of cool to have this comic
4528200	4535080	book and video game and album that all tie together, yet it's not some movie franchise
4535080	4540680	being turned into this, it's you, it's your story, that's awesome.
4540680	4545640	That's what's cool about it, I wanted to make it based on my story, now granted the game
4545640	4551520	and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and
4551520	4558980	they are interweaving a bit, the album is much more realistic, I kind of take that hero
4558980	4565400	and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy
4565400	4571680	with some cool abilities, but he's for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around
4571680	4576040	shooting beams out of his eyes, but in the game of course, you know to make things a
4576040	4580680	lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it, and the comic as well.
4580680	4587120	So if you're taking my story, and my own original story, and original characters that myself
4587120	4595040	and the guys at J1 Studios created, and creating a universe around it, like almost a franchise,
4595040	4596680	so it's really exciting.
4596680	4602640	That is so awesome, looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at MegaRan.com,
4602640	4605400	we'll have more information on that when it's out I'm sure.
4605400	4609640	Random, I want to give, I know we're a little past our time here, hopefully I'm not keeping
4609640	4613760	you from everything, from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
4613760	4617680	and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight.
4617680	4620560	So Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners.
4620560	4625280	All right, vognetwork.com, if you want to ask some questions in chat, let me get you
4625280	4626920	an email question we got earlier in the week.
4626920	4631820	This is from Will O, sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Random
4631820	4636380	has a style that just seems effortless, and his sincerity bleeds through each track.
4636380	4640720	He honestly seems to love what he's doing, and I just wanted to throw that out there
4640720	4644400	that that's coming across, but here's the question, Random.
4644400	4648480	Do you think it would be possible, do you think it would be possible to be doing what
4648480	4652080	you're doing before the age of social media?
4652080	4656640	How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create
4656640	4657640	music or tour?
4657640	4661160	So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could
4661160	4663800	you do what you're doing without social media?
4663800	4666400	Wow, I don't think so.
4666400	4668280	No, I really don't.
4668280	4672000	And this whole, the whole Mega Ran story started because of social media.
4672000	4679320	I was contacted on MySpace in 2007 by Capcom, so if not for social media, I don't know
4679320	4684960	if I'd be here, you know, so I do owe a lot to it, you know, I've been, yeah, I'm
4684960	4690720	hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media, and I think it would make it to be
4690720	4694920	a little more fun going, you know, out and doing the old school method, because I do
4694920	4695920	that a lot.
4695920	4700360	I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm
4700360	4706480	not only, you know, all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or
4706480	4711520	two times a week, you know, I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm
4711520	4716040	out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people, so it's not just social media, but I feel
4716040	4720760	like social media is a huge part of it, but like I said, I think my leg up comes from
4720760	4727720	the fact that I'm out and about in the community, physically making appearances, as well as,
4727720	4730200	you know, taking full advantage of social media.
4730200	4733920	I think you're right on the money there, I think, you know, I may not be quite on the
4733920	4737920	superstar level, but I think that that's really the key is you gotta interact, you
4737920	4741400	know, not just online, but in person, the old school way, as well.
4741400	4747120	M.C. Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, M.C. Lars, that he's always told me that
4747120	4750620	you gotta get out and play, you know, you have to get out and play.
4750620	4754800	Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you
4754800	4760680	apart, so getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that.
4760680	4766060	Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the vog, or excuse me, vognetwork.com,
4766060	4771600	and I'm gonna go to a question from actdeft first, and I think this is a good question.
4771600	4773840	I'll take this question to the next level.
4773840	4778760	Who is Mega Ran's favorite video game music composer?
4778760	4781400	Oh, man.
4781400	4789480	I gotta say, I'm gonna go back a little bit, and I'm gonna say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro.
4789480	4796920	He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island, and a lot
4796920	4800940	of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite.
4800940	4801940	You're officially my hero.
4801940	4802940	He is the bomb.
4802940	4804640	We know Yuzo very well.
4804640	4810040	Mangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music, and of course, Actraiser.
4810040	4815320	The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to L.A., just saying.
4815320	4816320	Yes.
4816320	4817320	Oh, my God.
4817320	4818320	It's amazing.
4818320	4819320	Excellent.
4819320	4821320	I'll be able to listen to that tonight.
4821320	4822320	Excellent.
4822320	4823320	Excellent.
4823320	4827080	Let's go to another question from Brakeman, you know, because you're very well known for
4827080	4828080	the Mega Man stuff.
4828080	4834720	Brakeman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Man's favorite Mega Man theme?
4834720	4840000	Well, I could go with the easy choice.
4840000	4842440	There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves.
4842440	4848360	So Mega Man 2, WALL-E Stage 1, everybody loves that.
4848360	4850800	I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites.
4850800	4855360	I love Wood Man's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2.
4855360	4860080	The only one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is
4860080	4865880	Bomb Man from Mega Man 1, and what else?
4865880	4866880	Crash Man.
4866880	4867880	I love Crash Man.
4867880	4868880	Crash Man is great.
4868880	4874520	There's so many, and if you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never
4874520	4877920	used them, or I've never intended to remake them.
4877920	4881800	Crash Man, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it.
4881800	4884720	You know, WALL-E Stage 1, same thing.
4884720	4887800	Mega Man 3, Title Screen, same thing.
4887800	4891200	It's just so great, as is.
4891200	4893240	Proto Man's theme, another one I love.
4893240	4898480	So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to touch those out of respect
4898480	4900280	for how I feel about them.
4900280	4905840	You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do them justice based on the Mega Man 9 album,
4905840	4908480	but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from.
4908480	4909880	I think that's great.
4909880	4914360	Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I think I know where this guy's
4914360	4922160	going with this name, but the name is I Far Ted, what a great name in chat, wants to know,
4922160	4928360	is there any game that Mega Ran hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on?
4928360	4929360	Oh.
4929360	4935440	See, I'm afraid of questions like that, because I don't want to answer it, and then a couple
4935440	4936440	things could happen.
4936440	4943480	One, someone just takes it and does it, or two, I could never get to it, and people are
4943480	4946280	like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned?
4946280	4952120	But I will say, I have two that my eyes are on.
4952120	4961960	The Metal Gear Solid series, and Legend of Zelda, particularly A Link to the Past, so
4961960	4965680	those are what my eyes are on right now.
4965680	4969800	But the next plan, though, for next year is, myself and K-Murdock, we're doing an all Sega
4969800	4976840	album called Sega State or Sega City, and it's going to be all Sega, so from Master
4976840	4984280	System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast, it's going to be all Sega all the time, that'll
4984280	4985280	be our next one.
4985280	4990760	But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do, but story-wise, that's just such
4990760	4996360	a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that, you know, it would still
4996360	5001600	be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII, which is something
5001600	5003760	that took like a year to make, so.
5003760	5007360	You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that, Gio Vedeo screaming, yes, Metal
5007360	5011440	Gear, do it, so there you go.
5011440	5015720	Now we're way over time here, and I want to get to Megurand's song here, but quickly,
5015720	5016720	one last question from Dark Soccer.
5016720	5020680	I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line.
5020680	5024520	Oh, okay, I've taken requests before.
5024520	5030920	Well, the official game of Orange Bound Radio is the Guardian Legend.
5030920	5035360	So could we hope to have you tackle that someday?
5035360	5039280	You know what, I really, you know what, I did, I did a Guardian Legend track.
5039280	5040280	Really?
5040280	5045840	Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song, okay, there's a song called
5045840	5053760	Comtact, C-O-N dash tact, and it's all about com etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legends.
5053760	5054760	Awesome.
5054760	5055760	Okay.
5055760	5059520	It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to times, what you should and shouldn't
5059520	5060520	do.
5060520	5062520	It's very useful.
5062520	5066920	Is that, the Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed
5066920	5068520	by Fantasy Zone.
5068520	5069520	All right.
5069520	5074280	Oh my God, those are some great games, like, I love Guardian Legends.
5074280	5077160	So you were on the top of my hero list now.
5077160	5083000	Well, look, we got random way past time here, and you know, we got off to a late start tonight,
5083000	5087160	but Random, you know, I want to really thank you for taking the time out to come on Orange
5087160	5089120	Lounge Radio tonight and talk about your music.
5089120	5093840	Again, if people want to know more about your music, they can check you out at Megaran.com,
5093840	5096440	and you can also get the music at MegaranMusic.com.
5096440	5101320	Random, is there anything else you want to plug here on the show, before we get to the
5101320	5102320	song?
5102320	5107920	Well, let's see, anything I want to plug, I don't know, follow me on Twitter, at Megaran,
5107920	5115600	there's Megaran music on Facebook, I don't know, thanks for the support, keep listening.

5121960	5125240	yeah, I'll see you out in the funny papers.
5125240	5126240	All right.
5126240	5129720	Random, thanks again so much for taking the time out, and best of luck with everything
5129720	5130720	in the future, all right?
5130720	5131720	Oh, thank you, man.
5131720	5133720	All right, take care, buddy.
5133720	5139000	Hey, we're going to close out here with a track from Megaran, and this is actually a
5139000	5140360	really special deal here.
5140360	5145920	This is actually a duet that he did with MC Frontalot, which is pretty awesome.
5145920	5154440	You can check this out at MegaranMusic.com, it's Random and MC Frontalot with Wake Up
5154440	5170760	here on Orange Lounge Radio, check this out.
5170760	5189680	All right, I can do this, where are my glasses, come on, come on, I got to get out of here,
5189680	5190680	let me get out, here we go.
5190680	5210160	I got to get this, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
5210160	5221660	Here we go.
5221660	5227660	It's not all good, but I got my blessings, ma'am There's a lot to find a job, but a long
5227660	5230660	one you wanna do I had a daily double and came up on two
5230660	5234660	Three if you count, a loyal significant other This didn't seem half as hard when I lived
5234660	5237660	with my mother But I got tired of hearing it go on and get
5237660	5239660	serious Now I be flowing like regular periods
5239660	5244660	Growing as a theorist since my years in this And I learned so much, so I think it's time
5244660	5247660	to grow up Packin' my lunch Doritos and cold cuts
5247660	5250660	One more pay cut and I'm gone Time to wake up
5250660	5255660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5255660	5260660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind
5260660	5265660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5265660	5270660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind
5270660	5274660	No snooze, you wanted to be a rapper Now you got what you were after, wouldn't
5274660	5276660	rather Well you know you have to grab the mic
5276660	5280660	And make noises into it You and the beat get intimate
5280660	5283660	Send a report to the syndicate Indicating that you'll have a trap pretty soon
5283660	5287660	I'm in threads, incredulous at replies Swoon, win, win, then alarm, alarm
5287660	5290660	Oh no, I slipped into a dream Didn't get the rhyme written
5290660	5293660	The rig is in to quip And there's sound check in an hour
5293660	5296660	You know how you sometimes meet a nerd rapper Who hasn't showered
5296660	5299660	That was probably me, beg your forgiveness It's only through your largess
5299660	5303660	I'm even about to live this dream out So when I'm cussin' about my whack boss
5303660	5307660	Old man front runnin' his sweatshop Take a sad pause, share the long tear
5307660	5311660	Then remind, that every day I wake up There's an aid on, kindly
5311660	5316660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5316660	5321660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind
5321660	5326660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5326660	5331660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind
5331660	5336660	Wake up, don't tell me it's time to wake up Snoring like a bulldozer, going like the brakes cut
5336660	5341660	Eye boogers are starting to cake up 6.30 sharp, I gots to pick the pace up
5341660	5344660	Get my face up off of the pillow And ain't much time for a meal
5344660	5348660	So I grab the cake up French roast and get ghost and take lunch
5348660	5354660	If I'm late once more, I'm gone, case shut Netflix was on, shutting the stage up
5354660	5359660	Last night, watch Jimmy tear the stage up Hop the train, just missed the late bus
5359660	5364660	Get a taxi, he taxed me 28 bucks Running late but maybe I can make up time
5364660	5369660	Stay after hours and face up to the music No excuses, straight up
5369660	5374660	I mean I came to work, what else did they want? Head straight up the hall to A1
5374660	5379660	My secretary always had something to say but This time what she said left me straight crushed
5379660	5382660	You do know it's Saturday right? Say what?
5382660	5387660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5387660	5392660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb
5392660	5397660	If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet
5397660	5419660	It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb
5427660	5432660	Some people shower before bed, hello? You'll have that con funk that he talks about
5432660	5440660	Con funk, well he's already said hi on Facebook, not on Facebook, on Twitter
5440660	5443660	Totally follow him on Twitter, he's really cool
5443660	5447660	I wanna know, why did he tweet Anime Jam Session? He went on Anime Jam Session
5447660	5451660	Nah, it's all good, Rama was helping me screen the questions actually so he does get props
5451660	5457660	Listen to Anime Jam Session, this is a good show And I don't know how I missed the Guardian Legend one
5457660	5461660	He's got a lot, he's got a lot
5461660	5466660	That is going to be on my iPhone soon
5466660	5470660	Alright well if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music
5470660	5473660	That particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free
5473660	5476660	MegaRanMusic.com, go get it, MegaRanMusic.com
5476660	5483660	And thanks again, right on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it, right on to the management for setting that up
5483660	5485660	And for Random for appearing on our show tonight
5485660	5493660	And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan Language Arts video game and comic project Kickstarter
5493660	5499660	We will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD
5499660	5503660	As well as a signed comic to a lucky listener
5503660	5504660	Look at you
5504660	5508660	I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes by the way
5508660	5515660	Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while but for those of you that are sticking around
5515660	5519660	I knew some people would just be here to listen to MegaRan and then hit the road
5519660	5521660	Which I understand, it's all good
5521660	5527660	But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B
5527660	5529660	So just stay tuned, I'll get into that in a little bit
5529660	5532660	It's not as good as what Loki just talked about but it's still pretty cool
5532660	5534660	Alright, we got to get back into some news
5534660	5537660	We're running late now but that's alright, it was worth the wait
5537660	5540660	I don't remember how much of the Black Ops story we tackled
5540660	5542660	We were done with the Black Ops
5542660	5543660	We were done with the Black Ops story
5543660	5547660	Alright, so let's move on to one more story and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week here
5547660	5550660	This has to do with streaming service Gaikai
5550660	5554660	You might have heard of this, they're the ones that I believe were streaming the stuff on YouTube and some other places
5554660	5557660	They're kind of that competitor for OnLive of sorts
5557660	5562660	Well Gaikai is getting together with Wikipad to make a game streaming tablet
5562660	5568660	It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console quality gamepad controller
5568660	5570660	There's pictures of this on the internet
5570660	5576660	Just imagine the most giant stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life
5576660	5578660	Where you slammed an iPad in the middle
5578660	5580660	That's what this thing looks like
5580660	5584660	Honestly it looks a lot better than the one that Razor was looking at making
5584660	5589660	Yeah, yeah, so now apparently Wikipad isn't super popular yet
5589660	5591660	They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show
5591660	5593660	But they've already gone through some changes with it
5593660	5597660	It's got a 10.1 inch screen and a quad core processor now
5597660	5599660	Optional 3G for mobile
5599660	5601660	But here's the other thing, it ain't out yet
5601660	5603660	So it's one of those things that is coming soon
5603660	5605660	Gaikai is out there though if you want to check that out
5605660	5609660	And it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it
5609660	5611660	That's pretty big for a portable system
5611660	5614660	But I'd say if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere
5614660	5617660	Yeah, and people carry tablets too
5617660	5619660	And it's streaming gaming
5619660	5623660	So if you think about it, you're able to play console type games
5623660	5625660	Because the same stuff that OnLive is doing
5625660	5628660	Like Saints Row the Third or something of that quality
5628660	5630660	Through this pad
5630660	5635660	And the controls look pretty similar to a current gen console
5635660	5637660	So I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that
5637660	5639660	I'd rather have an iCade than an iPad
5639660	5641660	Just saying
5641660	5643660	Well isn't an iCade a device for an iPad?
5643660	5645660	Yeah
5645660	5647660	I'd rather have that, I'm fine with it
5647660	5649660	Or MAME on an Android, I mean what's the difference really
5649660	5653660	Well look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler
5653660	5657660	We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags
5657660	5661660	No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges
5661660	5663660	Hooked up to either a modem or your cable
5663660	5665660	A portable console
5665660	5667660	We didn't even have that over here
5667660	5669660	We had a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter
5669660	5671660	And plugging your Nintendo into it
5671660	5673660	Which some guy we knew had in his car
5673660	5675660	A Playstation in the car
5675660	5679660	We did that in middle school with a camp TV
5679660	5681660	That ran on D cells
5681660	5683660	We're going to go to a classic time
5683660	5685660	When things were a lot simpler
5685660	5689660	And take a look at the classic game of the week
5689660	5691660	Dark Soccer is going to dip into the video game vault
5691660	5693660	And find a game that she thinks
5693660	5695660	Hey, you kids ought to be playing this video game
5695660	5697660	You know, Random got the jump on you though
5697660	5699660	With the Goonies 2 nostalgia
5699660	5701660	But this one's pretty good too
5701660	5703660	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5703660	5705660	A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers
5705660	5707660	And I'm not going to spoil why
5707660	5709660	Galaga!
5709660	5711660	Yes, Galaga
5711660	5713660	Also known in Japan as Gyaraga
5715660	5717660	Which is...
5717660	5719660	Freaking intro music
5719660	5721660	Pew! Pew pew pew!
5721660	5723660	It's the game of pew pew is what it is
5723660	5729660	Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan
5729660	5731660	And published by Midway in North America in 1981
5731660	5735660	It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979
5735660	5737660	Why I didn't do Galaxian?
5737660	5739660	I don't know, I wanted to do Galaga
5739660	5741660	So whatever
5741660	5745660	Anyway, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen
5745660	5747660	You go back and forth
5747660	5749660	You don't get to go up or fly around
5749660	5751660	It's a simple, fixed shooter
5751660	5755660	And the enemies fly at you in formation
5755660	5759660	And you have to pew pew them all before they pew pew you
5759660	5761660	And once they're all vanquished
5761660	5763660	Then you move on to the next stage
5763660	5765660	Yahoo! Alright
5765660	5769660	Galaga was pretty, pretty popular
5769660	5771660	As I'm sure you all know
5771660	5773660	So we have many different sequels to Galaga
5773660	5775660	And many versions of Galaga
5775660	5779660	At any rate, Galaga for me was just the coolest
5779660	5789660	You could let your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing
5789660	5793660	And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode
5793660	5795660	Which was always super cool
5795660	5801660	It also had a few features that improved over Galaxian
5801660	5804660	Like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time
5804660	5807660	Your hit miss ratio, and the challenging stage
5807660	5812660	And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus
5812660	5817660	And like I said, you also could get captured
5817660	5822660	It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up
5822660	5824660	You could shoot it and get it down
5824660	5830660	And then there are actually full on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured
5830660	5832660	That's how a lot of people play
5832660	5839660	It also had a bug that was called, actually the bug would make your attackers stop firing bullets
5839660	5841660	It was actually a coding error
5841660	5845660	I just want to say the double, the whole two ships tied together thing
5845660	5847660	That's like the only way I can be decent at this game
5847660	5850660	I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can
5850660	5853660	Like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion
5853660	5855660	Well a lot of people based their strategy around it
5855660	5861660	Like I said, there's also a split screen bug that was like Impact Man
5861660	5864660	It's not quite the same thing
5864660	5867660	It's similar to the split screen bug in Impact Man
5867660	5871660	Where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0
5871660	5874660	And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine
5874660	5876660	It could cause the game to stall
5876660	5880660	And it means it has to be either reset or power cycled so that you can start a new game
5880660	5884660	So in the series of Galaxian
5884660	5886660	And I'm going to start with Galaxian
5886660	5896660	You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig
5896660	5903660	Galaga Legion in 2008, Galaga Legion DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011
5903660	5908660	Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave and Busters in Milpitas
5908660	5914660	They used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set
5914660	5917660	Which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in
5917660	5919660	With the 3 screens, now it's like some
5919660	5922660	I don't think I ever saw that, but that sounds amazing
5922660	5923660	The thing is still there
5923660	5924660	Wow
5924660	5926660	But the game is in it, they put another one
5926660	5930660	When you go back to the far back where they have the giant crane
5930660	5934660	And the thing that's to the left of it that you walk inside
5934660	5936660	That was the Galaxian machine
5936660	5938660	So, just saying
5938660	5942660	As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out
5942660	5947660	There's been the Atari 7800, the Famicon version, Game Boy
5947660	5950660	And also it was bundled with Galaxian
5950660	5954660	There was a GameTap, MSX, the MSX version is actually really good
5954660	5958660	Of course NES because the high we had a Famicon version
5958660	5961660	The Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 color computer
5961660	5964660	Which I played Galagon on it
5964660	5967660	That was the game, it was a clone called Galagon
5967660	5969660	And I played Stu out of this
5969660	5972660	Because my friend had one of these things
5972660	5975660	It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version
5975660	5977660	Xbox Live Arcade
5977660	5981660	IOS is the Galaga Remix which had the original on it
5981660	5984660	Nintendo 3DS which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions
5984660	5986660	And Roku
5986660	5990660	There has also been several versions of Namco Museum
5990660	5992660	Which are really way too many
5992660	5997660	We have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance
5997660	6000660	And Windows, there were two versions of each
6000660	6004660	PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3
6004660	6008660	And the Wii, which I have most of those
6008660	6012660	Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3
6012660	6014660	Is the game with the OLR cameo
6014660	6016660	Which makes it double awesome
6016660	6019660	That is the double awesome version, of course I had to
6019660	6021660	You gotta get that one out there
6021660	6023660	Jeez Rob
6023660	6027660	There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version
6027660	6029660	Of Tekken in 1995
6029660	6031660	You could play it as it loaded
6031660	6035660	In Point Blake 2 there were Galaga Challenge Stages
6035660	6039660	In the 20 year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit
6039660	6042660	That had Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga
6042660	6044660	There was that
6044660	6048660	The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too
6048660	6052660	It was even available on Palm Devices and Pocket PC
6052660	6055660	So Galaga really has an amazing legacy
6055660	6057660	Hold on
6057660	6059660	Sorry, my allergies are flaring up everybody
6059660	6061660	You alright over there?
6061660	6063660	That's why I sound like a 12 year old boy
6063660	6067660	At any rate, there were remakes
6067660	6069660	There was Galaga Arrangement
6069660	6072660	Which was part of the Namco Museum compilation
6072660	6076660	Galaga Destination Earth, it came out in 1998 for Windows
6076660	6078660	PlayStation and the Game Boy Color
6078660	6082660	Galaga Remakes came out in 2007 for the Wii
6082660	6086660	And you use your Wii remote as a gun
6086660	6090660	And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space
6090660	6093660	The video ran out so we have to hear that opening theme one more time
6093660	6109660	There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, Galaga 88
6109660	6112660	Were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app
6112660	6114660	Called the Galaga 30th Anniversary
6114660	6116660	That was done by Noki Bandai
6116660	6119660	Basically the app had Galaxian as a free game
6119660	6123660	And then they had to pay for a complete set for 8 bucks
6123660	6125660	But it had Galaga points
6125660	6129660	So you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs
6129660	6131660	Including the original art
6131660	6133660	Their world record for Galaga
6133660	6136660	Now keep in mind, this is twin galaxy stuff
6136660	6140660	It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krogman of Boca Raton
6140660	6141660	Florida
6141660	6144660	And the rapid fire setting
6144660	6147660	And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida
6147660	6151660	And it was also in this class of 81
6151660	6153660	Fast shot world record settings
6153660	6157660	Were both by John Krenkel of Battle Creek, Michigan
6157660	6162660	And I remember actually seeing some of the people who had the earlier ones
6162660	6164660	In King Fong
6164660	6166660	They had people just playing
6166660	6168660	The high score people gathered back together
6168660	6172660	When what's his face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score
6172660	6177660	Galaga, actually
6177660	6181660	There was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM
6181660	6184660	For him to practice for war games
6184660	6189660	Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game
6189660	6195660	And basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions
6195660	6201660	There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game
6201660	6204660	I have the Pac-Man one of those, just saying
6204660	6209660	And because the place I'm reading is not updated since
6209660	6213660	Galaga made an appearance in the Avengers
6213660	6216660	Just saying
6216660	6217660	But you'll say no more
6217660	6218660	But I'll say no more
6218660	6220660	Cause that guy over there is playing Galaga
6220660	6223660	He didn't think I'd notice, but I did
6223660	6224660	Alright, is that it?
6224660	6225660	That's the quote
6225660	6227660	Classic game of the week
6227660	6232660	Galaga, available everywhere, but most notably the arcade
6232660	6235660	Because shield helicarriers have joysticks, just saying
6235660	6241660	But we would prefer that you play the arcade version or the Playstation Network version that has the OLR cameo
6241660	6242660	Yes
6242660	6243660	So that's important too
6243660	6246660	Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize
6246660	6248660	A no prize, my favorite kind of prize
6248660	6250660	Alright, we're running way long for part A
6250660	6252660	I wonder why, perhaps the longer we
6252660	6255660	No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki, I'm allergic to California
6255660	6256660	It was worth it
6256660	6258660	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys
6258660	6262660	We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this
6262660	6264660	Don't go anywhere, we got more coming up in part B
6270660	6273660	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
6273660	6277660	Live on the VOG Network, voice of Geeks Network on this
6277660	6279660	May the 6th of 2012
6279660	6283660	We are live with the 456th episode of our show
6283660	6285660	You guys missed a fun part A
6285660	6287660	Little worried there at the beginning
6287660	6290660	Little worried there when things were delayed with our interview
6290660	6292660	But it was well worth the wait
6292660	6295660	Random aka Megaran telling us a lot about inspiration
6295660	6299660	We just kind of geeked out with him a little bit about old games that are awesome
6299660	6301660	And that's the best kind of interview
6301660	6302660	I want the Sega album
6302660	6304660	I know right, sounds awesome
6304660	6306660	I've got sonic boobs today ok
6306660	6310660	We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show
6310660	6312660	But you're wearing this shirt
6312660	6314660	I paid $10 for it
6314660	6320660	It's a Sonic shirt and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is
6320660	6321660	Yeah
6321660	6324660	So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies but
6324660	6326660	Can't help it, triple D, hi
6326660	6328660	Picks or it didn't happen
6328660	6330660	I put picks up
6330660	6332660	On Orange Lounge Radio.com? Oh awesome, alright there you go
6332660	6335660	And the other can of Vimto that I drink
6335660	6337660	This is pretty, I've never had Vimto before
6337660	6339660	Which our European listeners should know of
6339660	6342660	I've never had Vimto before but I'm having a Vimto light and it's really good
6342660	6344660	I've never had Vimto light before, I like the regular soda
6344660	6348660	It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one
6348660	6350660	It's just with sugar
6350660	6353660	It tastes a little bit like Hansen's black cherry, a little bit
6353660	6356660	It's black currant and raspberry soda
6356660	6357660	Ok I can see that
6357660	6360660	But I like the regular Vimto, I always drink it at a touch of Britain
6360660	6364660	And when I went to the Iraqi Deli today to get some shawarma
6364660	6367660	Because shawarma, there's a good place two bucks down
6367660	6369660	Which you won't get yet
6369660	6374660	I went and got, I saw they had Vimto light
6374660	6376660	So I bought a couple of cans of it
6376660	6378660	And it is pretty delicious
6378660	6380660	Although I have to say I do prefer the regular Vimto
6380660	6382660	It's not bad, I drink that
6382660	6384660	It's good stuff, alright anyway
6384660	6385660	Babylon Market
6385660	6387660	By the way we do have somebody staying up late
6387660	6389660	Listening to us all the way from the UK
6389660	6391660	Pekor Uno is with us saying I don't like Vimto
6391660	6393660	I prefer Robina, I don't know that word
6393660	6395660	Robina is not bad
6395660	6400660	But I tried, it's this, I like
6400660	6404660	Tizer, I think is what it's called, T-I-Z-E-R
6404660	6408660	I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good
6408660	6411660	Like a grapefruit soda, it's pretty good
6411660	6415660	Alrighty, you said you got that shirt at Kmart
6415660	6417660	I want to get that out too
6417660	6420660	Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock
6420660	6423660	By the Genesis ad it's coming
6423660	6425660	You know Genesis does what Nintendon't
6425660	6428660	But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart
6428660	6431660	Is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood
6431660	6434660	And Shermy needed stuff to pee on
6434660	6436660	So I got Shermy stuff to pee on
6436660	6438660	And I needed Sudafed
6438660	6443660	As you can all tell by my 12 year old boy puberty voice
6443660	6446660	So, just saying
6446660	6452660	So Kmart have that many copies of In the Groove there, huh?
6452660	6454660	They had a Mario shirt that I wanted
6454660	6456660	Alright
6456660	6459660	But when I saw Sonic, had to get it
6459660	6461660	The Sega fangirl and you had a squee
6461660	6464660	Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news
6464660	6466660	A few quick news stories for you guys
6466660	6471660	So Saints Row the Third, of course they had this April Fools joke
6471660	6475660	Testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing
6475660	6480660	Where it was Saints Row the Third enter the dominatrix
6480660	6483660	And everyone's like, wow that would be pretty cool
6483660	6485660	And so they're like, ah we fooled you
6485660	6488660	Because it's real and it's coming out
6488660	6491660	So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole
6491660	6494660	I don't know, copycat of
6494660	6497660	You know, Rockstar Games route
6497660	6501660	Where they're releasing this episode
6501660	6504660	Kind of expansion thing that's playable on its own
6504660	6506660	So this actual game will be coming out
6506660	6510660	The enter the dominatrix as a standalone expansion pack
6510660	6514660	It's a physical disc, it'll cost you 30 bucks
6514660	6517660	On PS3 and 360 and probably PC as well
6517660	6521660	It's going to give you, they're going to have like
6521660	6523660	Superpowers in there and stuff
6523660	6526660	Even though technically those were in the last expansion
6526660	6529660	But they only locked them to a certain mission on there
6529660	6533660	Which everyone was like, why the fuck did you lock these onto a certain mission
6533660	6536660	Instead of just allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want
6536660	6540660	Because I mean it is after Saints Row and it's not really realistic anyways
6540660	6545660	And apparently the whole premise of enter the dominatrix
6545660	6549660	Which is, other than being a complete ripoff of the Matrix
6549660	6551660	Because you know that's current
6551660	6556660	And so basically the Saints leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord
6556660	6560660	Named Zinyak and his benevolent race
6560660	6566660	And apparently they're trying to grab up all resources or something
6566660	6571660	And also I guess there's some character named Paul
6571660	6574660	Who's supposed to play some role in there
6574660	6575660	Hey Paul
6575660	6576660	You rock Paul
6576660	6578660	And I don't know
6578660	6580660	Stay awesome Paul, it's all for you
6580660	6582660	It's all about Paul
6582660	6584660	I'm a huge Paul fan
6584660	6587660	Paul, I live for Paul in Saints Row the Third
6587660	6588660	Who the fuck is Paul
6588660	6590660	I don't know who the fuck Paul is
6590660	6591660	Honestly
6593660	6595660	That was a movie
6595660	6597660	Well I know Paul was a movie
6597660	6599660	And that was probably funny
6599660	6603660	But it's just this whole Saints Row the dominatrix thing
6603660	6609660	It's neat and the whole thing it's supposed to be this virtual reality thing
6609660	6612660	So it's going to be similar to the Deckers missions almost
6612660	6617660	But at the same time I'm like, dude your DLC sucked so fucking bad
6617660	6624660	Do I really want to play this $30 expansion of shit that should have probably been unlocked anyways
6624660	6627660	With a DLC that I didn't buy because it was so shitty
6627660	6631660	It's like at the rate it's going right now
6631660	6638660	$7 DLC each was about an hour and a half worth of content
6638660	6639660	What is this game?
6639660	6642660	It would be like two hours long, an hour and 45 minutes
6642660	6644660	I mean I just
6644660	6646660	I don't know
6646660	6651660	I mean I kind of wish it was good but I'm just on the fence
6651660	6652660	I don't know
6652660	6654660	So we'll see it's coming out this fall
6654660	6657660	Maybe I'll pick it up because there's nothing else coming out
6657660	6659660	But I'm going to wait for reviews
6659660	6662660	This is not a day one thing for me for sure
6662660	6665660	Burned once, that was enough
6665660	6668660	So Adidas, my coach
6668660	6671660	Was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ
6671660	6677660	Also maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion on the Saints Row because they're in a little financial trouble
6677660	6682660	Well apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time
6682660	6688660	So now my coach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games
6688660	6691660	They have taken over the publishing rights for it
6691660	6696660	So it'll be launching this summer apparently
6696660	6698660	So I'll have to check that out
6698660	6699660	Maybe
6699660	6701660	I'm sure you have it on pre-order
6701660	6703660	Oh yeah, you know me and exercise
6703660	6707660	And last but not least, a game I actually took up a lot of my time this week
6707660	6709660	Perfect Strangers
6709660	6712660	It was an advert game
6712660	6718660	I mean it says right on the bottom the guy responsible for this actually does advert games for a bunch of different things
6718660	6720660	And he's done some pretty good stuff
6720660	6722660	You know what, it was a well fucking done advert game
6722660	6723660	It was excellent
6723660	6727660	And I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out
6727660	6733660	And of course it's advertising the release I guess of the episodes on iTunes
6733660	6735660	Which hey, it worked
6735660	6738660	It was unaware that the episodes were even out there on iTunes
6738660	6742660	I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game
6742660	6744660	Oh I never forget that show
6744660	6746660	But yes, it's a pretty fun game
6746660	6748660	Definitely worth checking out
6748660	6753660	If you want to check out the game which is entitled Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now
6753660	6759660	Which happens to be the theme song of the series and is actually what you play through
6759660	6763660	Just go to Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now dot com
6763660	6767660	And check it out, it's a great time
6767660	6769660	Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?
6769660	6773660	You know I watched some clips of him the other day
6773660	6775660	One kind of was asking myself the same question
6775660	6778660	I know he was in Langoliers and he got mauled at some point
6778660	6780660	I don't really know
6780660	6784660	The last thing I probably saw him was Beverly Hills Cop 3
6784660	6787660	And Mark Lynn Baker, whatever else did he do?
6787660	6792660	Other than being like a dead on ringer for the critic
6792660	6794660	I don't know
6794660	6796660	Let's just, let's just bask in the
6796660	6798660	Did you ever see Second Sight?
6798660	6800660	Let's bask in the awesomeness for a minute
6800660	6811660	Sometimes the world looks perfect
6811660	6814660	Nothing to rearrange
6814660	6815660	I feel inspired
6815660	6816660	The Mustang!
6816660	6818660	I forgot he drove a Mustang
6818660	6823660	Look at that, we just gave these guys a free commercial
6823660	6825660	But it was pretty fucking awesome
6825660	6827660	I did see Second Sight, Rob
6827660	6828660	That movie was funny
6828660	6830660	Because he was addicted to goobers
6830660	6833660	Alright, let me get some stories for you guys
6833660	6836660	But first, a PSA from our chatroom at vognetwork.com
6836660	6838660	Pete Garudo is telling us all
6838660	6840660	You Don't Know Jack on Facebook is now open to all
6840660	6843660	I know what I'm doing after the show tonight
6843660	6845660	Shane, I gotta cancel Mass Effect multiplayer
6845660	6847660	You Don't Know Jack is on Facebook now
6847660	6849660	I don't even know if he's listening
6849660	6852660	Alright, let's get to some other quick news here
6852660	6854660	Family Guy
6854660	6856660	I don't know if they've done a lot of games for Family Guy
6856660	6858660	I can't remember if there's been any others
6858660	6860660	One, and it was not good
6860660	6862660	That's right, that was the year they had Adam West at E3
6862660	6864660	It wasn't good
6864660	6867660	It wasn't good and they did an IOS game and it wasn't very good either
6867660	6869660	Well maybe this will redeem it
6869660	6871660	But we'll see
6871660	6874660	September 25th, Family Guy Back to the Multiverse
6874660	6876660	PlayStation 3 and 360
6876660	6879660	According to some Amazon stuff that leaked earlier today
6879660	6881660	And even earlier on our Twitter
6881660	6886660	Wink Wink, Activision is involved, I bet this will be an E3 showing
6886660	6888660	Uh, probably
6888660	6890660	And now, see I actually had to look it up
6890660	6892660	Because I haven't watched Family Guy in a few years
6892660	6894660	Mainly because I do this show
6894660	6896660	It happens to be on the same time
6896660	6898660	And also because it's not being funny after a while
6898660	6901660	But, you know, I'll give it a chance again
6901660	6903660	Don't remind the listeners that Family Guy is on
6903660	6905660	It's not funny, that's what I was trying to say
6905660	6907660	You're not missing anything
6907660	6909660	So, um, I had to look at what the Multiverse thing was
6909660	6911660	And I guess it was one of these episodes that they did
6911660	6913660	Where it's like, oh hey, we're in real, you know
6913660	6915660	Real life Family Guy
6915660	6917660	It's kind of like one of those episodes
6917660	6919660	Like, what if, blah blah blah
6919660	6921660	You know, it's
6921660	6923660	So that's what that is, I don't know
6923660	6925660	Hopefully it'll be as good as the Simpsons game
6925660	6927660	I mean, that was pretty good
6927660	6929660	That's true, that's true
6929660	6931660	Alright, also, if Family Guy isn't your kind of cartoon
6931660	6933660	Maybe you're a little more old school
6933660	6935660	Maybe you'll be excited about this
6935660	6937660	The worlds of Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo
6937660	6939660	Are lighting in a free to play
6939660	6941660	Online game
6941660	6943660	Cartoon Universe
6943660	6945660	It's a browser based online adventure
6945660	6947660	You could say it's for kids
6947660	6949660	But you know there's going to be some adults to check this out too
6949660	6951660	It's coming from WB Games Montreal
6951660	6953660	Cartoon Universe
6953660	6955660	It is kid friendly
6955660	6957660	It's Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo
6957660	6959660	You make your own toon avatar
6959660	6961660	You play puzzles and mini games
6961660	6963660	Meet new friends
6963660	6965660	And experience the joy of exploring a place
6965660	6967660	So, very cool
6967660	6969660	There's supposed to be popular characters
6969660	6971660	From both the franchises in there
6971660	6973660	But no playable version of this
6973660	6975660	Yet, I guess there's a beta
6975660	6977660	I'm sorry, there is a beta version I guess that's out there
6977660	6979660	But I think it's really bugged
6979660	6981660	From what the early reports are saying
6981660	6983660	But it is a beta
6983660	6985660	But you can check that out
6985660	6987660	cartoonuniverse.com
6987660	6989660	NA for North America
6989660	6991660	Pink Textures
6991660	6993660	It looks cute, but
6993660	6995660	I'm going to play MMO, I'm going to play Star Trek
6995660	6997660	Or DC Universe or something
6997660	6999660	Lastly, for those of you guys
6999660	7001660	That aren't cool enough to go to E3 anymore
7001660	7003660	Like, you know, us
7003660	7005660	At least you can feel like
7005660	7007660	You're there by sitting on the couch
7007660	7009660	With your bon-bons and your popcorn
7009660	7011660	Which you can't even have if you actually go to the real thing
7011660	7013660	Because they don't allow that stuff in these
7013660	7015660	Conference centers
7015660	7017660	And watch the E3 Presser on
7017660	7019660	Xbox Live or Spike TV
7019660	7021660	The Microsoft
7021660	7023660	Press Conference will be live
7023660	7025660	On Xbox Live and Spike TV
7025660	7027660	I will be spending
7027660	7029660	My time doing what I normally do
7029660	7031660	During these press conferences, which is kicking back
7031660	7033660	In the conference room at work
7033660	7035660	Eating a bowl of popcorn while watching this stuff
7035660	7037660	Well, you know, I have E3 week
7037660	7039660	Off anyway, and I'm at the point where I've been
7039660	7041660	At my job ten years and I get so much
7041660	7043660	Time off a year for being there that long
7043660	7045660	That I just take E3 week off to
7045660	7047660	Have it off, and you know
7047660	7049660	It's not a bad idea, I should do that
7049660	7051660	Another thing, I may actually
7051660	7053660	This year have to move
7053660	7055660	Our studio may be moving by the way
7055660	7057660	I may be moving that week
7057660	7059660	So I may miss out on
7059660	7061660	Some of this, we'll see
7061660	7063660	But regardless, for the rest of you guys
7063660	7065660	You can watch that live as it unfolds
7065660	7067660	I can't imagine it's gonna be
7067660	7069660	Any different for Sony and Nintendo
7069660	7071660	It's just, you know, maybe they'll be on G4
7071660	7073660	Or PlayStation Home
7073660	7075660	Or, you know, they'll be available
7075660	7077660	As well
7077660	7079660	They'll be on G4, so it's like
7079660	7081660	Now Spike has more gaming cred
7081660	7083660	Than G4, which, yeah, I can see that
7083660	7085660	Funny how that works
7085660	7087660	Funny how that works
7087660	7089660	Alright, anyhow, a few more stories for you guys
7089660	7091660	Than the Frugal Question of the Week
7091660	7093660	Oh yeah, me, huh
7093660	7095660	Well, there is going to be Cave Story Plus
7095660	7097660	On the 3DS eShop soon
7097660	7099660	But it's not gonna be
7099660	7101660	The Cave Story 3D, it's a separate one
7101660	7103660	All it is, is an update for the 3DS
7103660	7105660	In fact, Tyrone Rodriguez
7105660	7107660	The CEO of Nicholas said
7107660	7109660	That he really wanted it just to be
7109660	7111660	The update, so neither game would interfere
7111660	7113660	With the other if you happened to delete one
7113660	7115660	That's a little weird, isn't it?
7115660	7117660	That you would make a second, like, remake
7117660	7119660	Of your game? Well, Cave Story
7119660	7121660	3D is a separate game from
7121660	7123660	Cave Story Plus
7123660	7125660	They're two different games, so
7125660	7127660	Yo dawg, I heard you like Cave Story
7127660	7129660	So we put some Cave Story in your Cave Story
7129660	7131660	And
7131660	7133660	For our listeners in the UK
7133660	7135660	The UK Pride Xbox Connect bundle
7135660	7137660	Will be available in May
7137660	7139660	And I kinda want it
7139660	7141660	But, not really
7141660	7143660	It's going to be a
7143660	7145660	249 pound 99 pence
7145660	7147660	So, there you go
7147660	7149660	There's also going to be
7149660	7151660	A
7153660	7155660	A skin available
7155660	7157660	Jella Skins is gonna make
7157660	7159660	A pattern
7159660	7161660	For 30 bucks
7161660	7163660	And they also, though, do have
7163660	7165660	A Stars and Stripes bundle for
7165660	7167660	The American audiences, or anyone who happens to want
7167660	7169660	An American flag on their
7169660	7171660	Game, or something
7171660	7173660	Or the Confederate flag
7173660	7175660	I'm sure they have the Confederate flag too, you know
7175660	7177660	Oh, shush
7177660	7179660	And then Ratchet and Clank HD trilogy
7179660	7181660	Has been pushed back in Europe
7181660	7183660	It will be pushed
7183660	7185660	From the 16th of May until early
7185660	7187660	June, Insomniac has announced
7187660	7189660	The end
7189660	7191660	The end
7191660	7193660	Let's go to the
7193660	7195660	Fugal question of the week
7195660	7197660	Except, I'm failing
7197660	7199660	And I did this last week too, didn't I?
7199660	7201660	It's something about the network change
7201660	7203660	I don't have the music
7203660	7205660	Up for this segment
7205660	7207660	But every week we go to our Facebook
7207660	7209660	At facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
7209660	7211660	Or our Google Plus
7211660	7213660	Yes, we're on Google Plus
7213660	7215660	With all the Google employees that are still there
7215660	7217660	There are some very loyal Google Plus listeners
7217660	7219660	And I get it
7219660	7221660	Facebook does some real dumb shit
7221660	7223660	Did you hear about now what they're doing?
7223660	7225660	I get why people want to run off to Google Plus
7225660	7227660	The whole messenger thing will now
7227660	7229660	Have this actual Facebook
7229660	7231660	Messenger app
7231660	7233660	Look this up on the internet
7233660	7235660	If you don't believe me
7235660	7237660	The Facebook Messenger app on the iPhone
7237660	7239660	Will now send your location
7239660	7241660	With the messages that you send
7241660	7243660	You can turn that off
7243660	7245660	To be fair, you can't turn that off
7245660	7247660	But you know it will be on by default
7247660	7249660	Because nobody at Facebook knows
7249660	7251660	What opt-in is all about
7251660	7253660	And the other thing with this is that
7253660	7255660	Return receipts
7255660	7257660	You can now request a return receipt
7257660	7259660	For when somebody has read your message
7259660	7261660	You can't turn that off
7261660	7263660	So if you don't want someone to know you read their message
7263660	7265660	Too bad
7265660	7267660	That would be great for the stalkers that Facebook message you
7267660	7269660	Well, I'm sure you could use a third party app
7269660	7271660	For that
7271660	7273660	I don't know the specifics of how it worked
7273660	7275660	But when I read that I was like grrr
7275660	7277660	More importantly though, Ronma and Chad
7277660	7279660	Has informed us that Bronson Pinchot
7279660	7281660	Actually has a reality show on DIY
7281660	7283660	I was unaware of this
7283660	7285660	It sounds interesting
7285660	7287660	I'm sure it's not
7287660	7289660	And by the way, Rob
7289660	7291660	I don't use the messenger anyway
7291660	7293660	I always have it linked me as offline
7293660	7295660	I'm just saying
7295660	7297660	I don't know the specifics
7297660	7299660	But I look at this and I raise my eyebrow
7299660	7301660	Right
7301660	7303660	Anyway, let's go on to happier topics
7303660	7305660	I make everyone get AIM
7305660	7307660	We're going to go on to happier topics
7307660	7309660	And things that don't piss me off
7309660	7311660	And that is the FUGO Question of the Week
7311660	7313660	Every week we ask you a question
7313660	7315660	At our Facebook and our Google Plus
7315660	7317660	Facebook.com, social media, radio
7317660	7319660	I'm repeating myself
7319660	7321660	So let's get to some of the answers
7321660	7323660	I love this question of the week
7323660	7325660	Not just because I thought of it
7325660	7327660	But because the interview we had tonight and everything
7327660	7329660	How inspired you to create something
7329660	7331660	Artistic in the real world
7331660	7333660	For example, art, music, a website
7333660	7335660	Anything creative
7335660	7337660	What did you create and why did the game
7337660	7339660	Inspire you to do this
7339660	7341660	So Shane from Warthouse started us off
7341660	7343660	Sorry I'm too busy writing my
7343660	7345660	Male Shepard Caden fanfic
7345660	7347660	To answer this question
7347660	7349660	I've written fanfiction
7349660	7351660	Really? For what game?
7351660	7353660	For a number of games
7353660	7355660	I did Metroid
7355660	7357660	Back in the day
7357660	7359660	Just old stuff
7359660	7361660	The last thing I did was for Digimon
7361660	7363660	Of all things
7363660	7365660	Nice
7365660	7367660	I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto
7367660	7369660	And I was inspired to try to figure out
7369660	7371660	What the song
7371660	7373660	From DJ Hero 2 would sound like
7373660	7375660	The mashup between piano
7375660	7377660	And Shout
7377660	7379660	So I did that
7379660	7381660	And I've done fan art
7381660	7383660	Remember I did my Portal
7383660	7385660	To enter it for my final project
7385660	7387660	In 3D class
7387660	7389660	Alright let's get to some more of the answers over on Facebook
7389660	7391660	We have an answer
7391660	7393660	From Johnny B
7393660	7395660	Johnny Cage's
7395660	7397660	Ball Busta Move
7397660	7399660	Inspired me to create an athletic cup
7399660	7401660	Attached with nails and screws
7401660	7403660	I advertise this tool of protection
7403660	7405660	For men, women, and everyone in between
7405660	7407660	For a commercial project
7407660	7409660	In film school
7409660	7411660	Unfortunately this anti-hipster cup
7411660	7413660	Was the class's top prize
7413660	7415660	To be aired on local access
7415660	7417660	But it did earn me an A in the class
7417660	7419660	C, video games can help you
7419660	7421660	Get good grades in school
7421660	7423660	I think it's funny
7423660	7425660	But hey I have a tip for you
7425660	7427660	This is not a well known fact
7427660	7429660	About Rob Roberts
7429660	7431660	But before there was Orange Lounge
7431660	7433660	Before there was
7433660	7435660	Under Sedation Live
7435660	7437660	Before there was Rob on college radio
7437660	7439660	There was Rob on local public access
7439660	7441660	I had a TV show
7441660	7443660	When I was in high school
7443660	7445660	You will never see the tapes
7445660	7447660	I'm gonna make sure those
7447660	7449660	Fuckers are destroyed
7449660	7451660	Oh well I've seen some of it
7451660	7453660	I don't even know where the tapes are
7453660	7455660	I honestly don't
7455660	7457660	It is fantastic
7457660	7459660	It was fantastic
7459660	7461660	Seriously I'm being serious here
7461660	7463660	If shit like
7463660	7465660	Tim and Eric's awesome show
7465660	7467660	Great Job can do as well as it does
7467660	7469660	That public access show could have been a hit
7469660	7471660	Yeah you know it's a shame
7471660	7473660	I lost touch, well we're
7473660	7475660	Facebook friends but my friend Shannon
7475660	7477660	Who was like my bestie in high school
7477660	7479660	Did a comedy show on public access
7479660	7481660	And I'll tell you what
7481660	7483660	Kids in high school are such
7483660	7485660	Cock head bastard fucks
7485660	7487660	Like you know we used to get
7487660	7489660	Like the guys before us
7489660	7491660	Did this very conservative
7491660	7493660	Slanted show because they learned that
7493660	7495660	From their parents called
7495660	7497660	I'm gonna name names because I'm 33
7497660	7499660	And I don't give a fuck anymore
7499660	7501660	It was a show called Open Debate
7501660	7503660	And these guys
7503660	7505660	Would just sit there, they fucking would razz
7505660	7507660	Our show that was coming up
7507660	7509660	Like live on their show and the callers
7509660	7511660	Would call in and like talk about what
7511660	7513660	A fag I was on
7513660	7515660	Public access TV
7515660	7517660	I got bullied on television
7517660	7519660	You guys but it gets better don't worry
7519660	7521660	All I'm saying
7521660	7523660	Is you need to put claws in your will
7523660	7525660	That stuff gets released when you die
7525660	7527660	Unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of
7527660	7529660	Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately
7529660	7531660	Probably died with her as well
7531660	7533660	I'm just saying
7533660	7535660	Alright
7535660	7537660	Anyway let me get to the rest of the
7537660	7539660	Questions here on Facebook I didn't mean to get on the
7539660	7541660	Tangent but I just wanted to
7541660	7543660	You know in the 10 years we've been doing
7543660	7545660	Orange Lawn's radio I never talked about
7545660	7547660	How much I hated those fuckers on
7547660	7549660	Open Debate and I don't know what
7549660	7551660	They're doing now but if there's any justice
7551660	7553660	In the world janitorial work
7553660	7555660	Jizz mopping I
7555660	7557660	I don't want to belittle janitors
7557660	7559660	Because janitors do an important
7559660	7561660	Job
7561660	7563660	Anyhow
7563660	7565660	Hey Port Chop
7565660	7567660	Answered our question on Facebook
7567660	7569660	Not so much create but
7569660	7571660	Adapted the Final Fantasy soundtracks
7571660	7573660	Inspired me to adapt some of their songs
7573660	7575660	On guitars such as Eternity Light
7575660	7577660	Waves and Aerith's theme
7577660	7579660	The game's music always impressed me and was very
7579660	7581660	Memorable which made me want to learn these songs
7581660	7583660	For myself as a result of this
7583660	7585660	Nobui Matsu is also my favorite composer
7585660	7587660	That's almost if you think about it
7587660	7589660	That's almost the same story that Random told
7589660	7591660	About Goonies 2
7591660	7593660	I have to say
7593660	7595660	Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major
7595660	7597660	Very cool and I met him remember
7597660	7599660	I do remember that
7599660	7601660	I love this answer
7601660	7603660	From Stan H on Facebook says
7603660	7605660	Playing Journey as I type this
7605660	7607660	I want to knit the scarf and be crazy
7607660	7609660	Long
7609660	7611660	It was a Journey joke I love it
7611660	7613660	Lastly from Paul W
7613660	7615660	Is it weird that when you first
7615660	7617660	Said oh yeah he did a
7617660	7619660	Remix thing based on Journey that I thought
7619660	7621660	Of Journey the arcade game
7621660	7623660	I was worried
7623660	7625660	People would think that
7625660	7627660	Look
7627660	7629660	One more answer here from Facebook
7629660	7631660	And then I got one on Google
7631660	7633660	Paul W says back when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade
7633660	7635660	During the NES and Sega Master System days
7635660	7637660	I would create my own illustrations of enemies
7637660	7639660	Bosses when instruction manuals for game
7639660	7641660	Were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent
7641660	7643660	These were new creations I had
7643660	7645660	Imagined for sequels to games such as
7645660	7647660	Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast
7647660	7649660	I think a lot of us did that kind of crap
7649660	7651660	As a kid Paul because like I can tell you
7651660	7653660	I'm sure you must have done this too
7653660	7655660	And everybody that was you know
7655660	7657660	Grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this
7657660	7659660	Did the RPG on the notepad
7659660	7661660	Where you drew the dungeon
7661660	7663660	And like you'd make your friends go through the dungeon
7663660	7665660	It was like you wrote your own video game
7665660	7667660	On paper so it makes sense
7667660	7669660	I used to have a tablet of that stuff
7669660	7671660	And I'm so sad that I lost it
7671660	7673660	This is why we're friends because I knew you were that kid
7673660	7675660	I didn't even have to ask
7675660	7677660	We would have been playing that game when we were in the same school
7677660	7679660	Basically I was inspired by Contra
7679660	7681660	I used to love drawing mazes
7681660	7683660	And so that's what I'd do I'd create mazes
7683660	7685660	And then there were mazes with cannons in them
7685660	7687660	And then mazes with spikes and cannons
7687660	7689660	And alien monsters and stuff like that
7689660	7691660	So it was kind of like that
7691660	7693660	It was like bullet hell but on paper
7693660	7695660	Alright
7695660	7697660	Let's get to the one answer here on Google Plus
7697660	7699660	Jim H
7699660	7701660	You go Jim's the loyal Google user
7701660	7703660	Here it is sort of embarrassing to admit
7703660	7705660	This but in my documentary class in film school
7705660	7707660	I made a one minute doclet about my
7707660	7709660	Holy Priest character in Warcraft
7709660	7711660	I actually got an A on the project
7711660	7713660	And had to answer questions from my instructor
7713660	7715660	Like have you ever let another player
7715660	7717660	Die on purpose? Great story
7717660	7719660	Love it
7719660	7721660	I'm sure the answer was yes
7721660	7723660	Alright
7723660	7725660	There it is that's it for the foogle question of the week
7725660	7727660	Let's get back into some news
7727660	7729660	Loki
7729660	7731660	Alright so this is a little interesting
7731660	7733660	EA is putting out an indie bundle
7733660	7735660	And now of course it's getting a little bit of shade
7735660	7737660	Because EA is not exactly an indie company
7737660	7739660	But the titles that are being included
7739660	7741660	Warp, Shank, Shank 2
7741660	7743660	Gatling Gears, Deathspank
7743660	7745660	and Deathspank
7745660	7747660	The Thong of Virtue
7747660	7749660	And ironically enough
7749660	7751660	It's actually being released on Steam
7751660	7753660	As part of Steam Play
7753660	7755660	And
7755660	7757660	They're also having some other
7757660	7759660	Indies that are
7759660	7761660	Available as well
7761660	7763660	I guess Deathspank titles are currently
7763660	7765660	$7.50 individually
7765660	7767660	And then EA's rest, their indie titles
7767660	7769660	Are $5 each
7769660	7771660	And those are PC only
7771660	7773660	Where as the Deathspank titles are PC and Mac
7773660	7775660	And
7775660	7777660	And
7777660	7779660	Interesting enough though
7779660	7781660	They've also gotten some
7781660	7783660	Hate from
7783660	7785660	Just this guy that put out a game called
7785660	7787660	Minecraft
7787660	7789660	That's right Notch
7789660	7791660	Basically saying
7791660	7793660	What's a Minecraft?
7793660	7795660	Basically EA is releasing
7795660	7797660	How do you mine fish?
7797660	7799660	So EA is releasing an
7799660	7801660	Indie bundle
7801660	7803660	I'm not sure
7803660	7805660	How that works EA
7805660	7807660	Stop attempting to ruin everything you bunch of cynical
7807660	7809660	Bastards
7809660	7811660	Oh tweet drama
7811660	7813660	Well it's going down on Twitter
7813660	7815660	Y'all
7815660	7817660	You know what though it did strike me as really funny
7817660	7819660	That the EA Indie bundle was on Steam
7819660	7821660	And not on Origin
7821660	7823660	Cause no one buys
7823660	7825660	Anything on Origin
7825660	7827660	I think it was a very interesting way for
7827660	7829660	EA to like very subtly shade Steam
7829660	7831660	The whole thing was a setup
7831660	7833660	No I think it was a trap
7833660	7835660	I think it was because they thought they would get more sales
7835660	7837660	From Steam sadly enough
7837660	7839660	Because there was even
7839660	7841660	And it didn't make our
7841660	7843660	Show roll here but there was a thing that
7843660	7845660	Origin put out like a survey
7845660	7847660	Saying okay
7847660	7849660	What would you like to see us approve
7849660	7851660	On Origin because
7851660	7853660	Kind of almost admitting
7853660	7855660	That it hasn't been that great
7855660	7857660	So what would you guys like to see
7857660	7859660	Us do
7859660	7861660	To fix it
7861660	7863660	Close it down and put the games on Steam
7863660	7865660	They're not going to do that
7865660	7867660	Although you know what
7867660	7869660	Competition is healthy for the industry
7869660	7871660	So you know I don't want Steam to be the one and only
7871660	7873660	But you know I don't know if EA should really
7873660	7875660	Be given their own store but I will say this
7875660	7877660	You know despite the cynical bastard I am and all this
7877660	7879660	I will say something nice about Origin this week
7879660	7881660	I did play
7881660	7883660	And I didn't talk about this in my gaming week but I did play
7883660	7885660	That Mass Effect 3 data pad game
7885660	7887660	That helps you with your galactic readiness
7887660	7889660	Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry
7889660	7891660	Last week because I said that you have to
7891660	7893660	Play multiplayer
7893660	7895660	And I downloaded that thing
7895660	7897660	Well it does turn out and I do stand corrected
7897660	7899660	Thank you Chat Room that's the perk of doing a live show
7899660	7901660	That you can download this Mass Effect data pad
7901660	7903660	And raise your galactic readiness
7903660	7905660	Rating in a
7905660	7907660	I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much
7907660	7909660	One of those like Facebook-y type of games that
7909660	7911660	You know you send your ship out and wait
7911660	7913660	Three hours and you can check on it and what have you
7913660	7915660	And it helps raise your galactic readiness
7915660	7917660	And I got to say the way that all ties together
7917660	7919660	And how you do that on your iPhone
7919660	7921660	Yet it impacts
7921660	7923660	What happens on the Xbox
7923660	7925660	And you can check your multiplayer
7925660	7927660	Unlocks on the PC
7927660	7929660	That kind of synergy is neat
7929660	7931660	It is neat
7931660	7933660	And it's done
7933660	7935660	It's done well
7935660	7937660	So I will tip my hat
7937660	7939660	Slightly to that
7939660	7941660	I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs
7941660	7943660	Left and right wherever they can get it
7943660	7945660	But as far as the free stuff that's there
7945660	7947660	It's pretty cool
7947660	7949660	I will say that nice thing
7949660	7951660	About Origin but as far as the EA&D bundle
7951660	7953660	On Steam
7953660	7955660	You know what
7955660	7957660	I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought
7957660	7959660	It would be a clever thing and
7959660	7961660	Probably didn't go through all the necessary
7961660	7963660	Checks and now they're paying for it in the media
7963660	7965660	Just like everything else
7965660	7967660	Guess what else EA paid for
7967660	7969660	In the media this week
7969660	7971660	A big snafu in their rock band
7971660	7973660	IOS game
7973660	7975660	A big pop up
7975660	7977660	Showed up when logging into rock band on the iPhone
7977660	7979660	Or the iPad this week that said
7979660	7981660	On May 31st rock band will
7981660	7983660	No longer be playable on your device
7983660	7985660	Thanks for rocking out with us
7985660	7987660	And everybody was like what
7987660	7989660	The fuck
7989660	7991660	I bought this game and I bought the DLC
7991660	7993660	It's on my phone and EA is just gonna fucking shut it off
7993660	7995660	Yank pull the plug
7995660	7997660	Pull it from my phone can't play it anymore
7997660	7999660	And while that little pop ups going on
7999660	8001660	It's still being currently sold on
8001660	8003660	Their on IOS's app store
8003660	8005660	Blows your fucking mind
8005660	8007660	Right well before you all
8007660	8009660	Yell this out in chat there was a
8009660	8011660	Follow up to it not only did Harmonix
8011660	8013660	And John Drake you gotta love
8013660	8015660	John Drake he's a
8015660	8017660	Great industry guy and he's very
8017660	8019660	Active and out there in the community
8019660	8021660	And he basically washed his hands of the whole
8021660	8023660	Thing and he's like uh
8023660	8025660	We were not the
8025660	8027660	You know we were not the publishers of this
8027660	8029660	We're working to understand what's up
8029660	8031660	ASAP
8031660	8033660	Well came out later in the week
8033660	8035660	EA came out and said that prompt
8035660	8037660	Was made in error
8037660	8039660	And we will give you more information
8039660	8041660	Soon they said quote we apologize
8041660	8043660	For the confusion this caused we're
8043660	8045660	Working to clarify the issue that caused
8045660	8047660	The error and we'll share additional
8047660	8049660	Information as soon as possible
8049660	8051660	Clarify the issue fire the employee you know
8051660	8053660	Yeah because
8053660	8055660	They didn't like that how did this happen
8055660	8057660	The cat did not sneak
8057660	8059660	In in the middle of the night and type
8059660	8061660	Dear rockers on may 31st
8061660	8063660	Rock me that was an intentional
8063660	8065660	Message especially the thanks
8065660	8067660	For rocking out with us
8067660	8069660	Thanks for paying us money
8069660	8071660	But your game is no longer gonna work now here's
8071660	8073660	My thought I have a random ass theory and this
8073660	8075660	Ties back into mass effect
8075660	8077660	You know they announced this mass effect free
8077660	8079660	DLC that's coming out in the summer but they
8079660	8081660	Put an expiration date on it saying you
8081660	8083660	Can get it free until
8083660	8085660	2013 or 2014 something like that
8085660	8087660	And BioWare said note
8087660	8089660	We don't plan to ever not
8089660	8091660	Make it free but EA's
8091660	8093660	Policies require us to set an expiration
8093660	8095660	Date and you know
8095660	8097660	As long as they don't have to honor it
8097660	8099660	And also speaking of mass effect
8099660	8101660	When I bought mass effect 2 brand
8101660	8103660	New mind you I had a coupon
8103660	8105660	In the box for an online pass
8105660	8107660	Expires February
8107660	8109660	1st 2012 and it was
8109660	8111660	Like mid February by the time
8111660	8113660	I was ready to play it it still redeemed
8113660	8115660	But that expiration date was
8115660	8117660	There and I was about ready to go through the fucking
8117660	8119660	Roof cause I bought that new
8119660	8121660	Just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass
8121660	8123660	I almost went through the roof it did work
8123660	8125660	But this makes me wonder EA
8125660	8127660	Has this crackhead policy
8127660	8129660	Of having expiration dates
8129660	8131660	Why do they have expiration dates?
8131660	8133660	That's a great fucking question that I would like
8133660	8135660	EA to answer
8135660	8137660	See I don't understand why they have expiration dates
8137660	8139660	I don't understand like
8139660	8141660	They'll do that you know on certain things
8141660	8143660	Like for example Ultraviolet you may notice
8143660	8145660	With a lot of the you know DVD's
8145660	8147660	And Blu-rays that are out there now
8147660	8149660	Come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy
8149660	8151660	That you can redeem you know
8151660	8153660	By a certain date and I'm wondering
8153660	8155660	If it's just because they don't want to keep those copies
8155660	8157660	Up on their servers for you know
8157660	8159660	Forever or something
8159660	8161660	It doesn't even make any sense because you can
8161660	8163660	Once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection
8163660	8165660	You can always stream it
8165660	8167660	I just don't understand why on a paid
8167660	8169660	App they have it that it can
8169660	8171660	Expire like that and that that right there
8171660	8173660	Is a perfect example of why
8173660	8175660	Going digital only is a
8175660	8177660	Bad fucking idea
8177660	8179660	Because what's gonna stop EA or
8179660	8181660	Any company from going yeah we just want this game
8181660	8183660	To work anymore boom done and
8183660	8185660	That's it you have no recourse
8185660	8187660	And really Rockband is
8187660	8189660	On your phone and you play you don't
8189660	8191660	I mean I understand if they're shutting
8191660	8193660	Down the online music store
8193660	8195660	Or they're shutting down the multiplayer
8195660	8197660	Or whatever but how can they
8197660	8199660	Stop the entire app including
8199660	8201660	Single player from working
8201660	8203660	How very dare you EA
8203660	8205660	Or if it's a free app
8205660	8207660	I can see okay maybe this is gonna
8207660	8209660	Expire and a new one's gonna come out
8209660	8211660	There was a Disney Tron app that did that
8211660	8213660	But it was free but here's the thing though
8213660	8215660	And this is kind of pointed out as well
8215660	8217660	They did something similar with Tetris
8217660	8219660	Tetris for example it expired
8219660	8221660	And stopped working and guess what
8221660	8223660	Oh they sold a new version of Tetris
8223660	8225660	You can buy it again
8225660	8227660	What makes you think that they might not
8227660	8229660	Try this again well yet PopCap
8229660	8231660	Who is now owned by EA
8231660	8233660	PopCap did it a little better
8233660	8235660	Because they turned Bejeweled 2
8235660	8237660	They spun off Bejeweled Blitz
8237660	8239660	Into it's own game but they made it free
8239660	8241660	And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop
8241660	8243660	Working you know you still got that
8243660	8245660	Even though they have Bejeweled 3 they just
8245660	8247660	They kind of push people to go get Bejeweled 3
8247660	8249660	But they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working
8249660	8251660	At least I don't think and I don't want to check
8251660	8253660	On my phone but I just I think PopCap
8253660	8255660	Didn't screw it up the way
8255660	8257660	That EA did
8257660	8259660	You know if they're like well we have a policy that we have to have
8259660	8261660	Expiration dates why the fuck
8261660	8263660	Why do I care about your goddamn policies
8263660	8265660	Where is this explained that this might
8265660	8267660	Expire somewhere it there's no
8267660	8269660	Terms of service as far as
8269660	8271660	I'm aware
8271660	8273660	Bobby wants me to remind you guys and I even
8273660	8275660	Told Bobby I'd plug this and then promptly
8275660	8277660	Forgot
8277660	8279660	That we do if you are a steam
8279660	8281660	User and you are playing games online
8281660	8283660	In the community we now have a
8283660	8285660	VOG network community there is no
8285660	8287660	L army but you know we've been trying to push things
8287660	8289660	To the VOG network too steam
8289660	8291660	Community.com slash groups slash
8291660	8293660	VOG network if you want to join us there
8293660	8295660	And when the full I joined when the full
8295660	8297660	VOG network launches
8297660	8299660	Soon I can't tell you when
8299660	8301660	But it'll be sooner than you think
8301660	8303660	We'll have a link to that a little more directly
8303660	8305660	And yes I am still able to play Bejeweled
8305660	8307660	2 on my phone
8307660	8309660	There it is there's the music
8309660	8311660	I'm just
8311660	8313660	It doesn't
8313660	8315660	Surprise me that they would be the ones behind this
8315660	8317660	Yep
8317660	8319660	Alright we're gonna go to the
8319660	8321660	Mailbag dark soccer left the room
8321660	8323660	She'll be back in a minute here nope here she comes
8323660	8325660	Every week you guys send us emails
8325660	8327660	I'm allergic to mail
8327660	8329660	M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L
8329660	8331660	Both
8331660	8333660	Alright mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place
8333660	8335660	To send us your emails and dark soccer
8335660	8337660	Might read them
8337660	8339660	Dark soccer hopefully you have some emails
8339660	8341660	For us tonight
8341660	8343660	Alright first one Robert M here I'll skip the silliness
8343660	8345660	And irrelevance to simply state
8345660	8347660	That I just picked up Bastion on Steam
8347660	8349660	Now that the Mac version is on there
8349660	8351660	And was $6 mid week
8351660	8353660	I mid downloaded this time so I can't say if it's
8353660	8355660	An imperfect but competent port
8355660	8357660	Like Super Meat Boy say but I'm looking forward
8357660	8359660	To it speaking of
8359660	8361660	I know that content downloading from the store on PSB
8361660	8363660	If interrupted will have to start completely
8363660	8365660	Over which seems unfortunate for a portable
8365660	8367660	Even considering its age
8367660	8369660	Does the Vita have this issue or can software
8369660	8371660	Be loaded a little at a time
8371660	8373660	I don't know
8373660	8375660	Hey Vita people will it work
8375660	8377660	Will it blend
8377660	8379660	Are you even listening
8379660	8381660	I was kind of tuning out
8381660	8383660	Sorry
8383660	8385660	Who wants to know if you can download incrementally
8385660	8387660	On the Vita or will you have to start over like on the
8387660	8389660	PSP
8389660	8391660	Download incrementally
8391660	8393660	If you're in download or whatever
8393660	8395660	Or if you like happen to turn your system off
8395660	8397660	Or something like that it will restart where it's at
8397660	8399660	Yeah and doesn't the Vita really encourages you
8399660	8401660	To put it to sleep not to turn it off
8401660	8403660	You sleep it and while it's sleeping
8403660	8405660	It'll download your shit which is good
8405660	8407660	Yeah in fact I keep forgetting
8407660	8409660	That I have mine in sleep mode like in my bag
8409660	8411660	And then the battery is dead
8411660	8413660	Exactly that's why I was like oh shit
8413660	8415660	It charges again
8415660	8417660	It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP
8417660	8419660	They sell one
8419660	8421660	Oh do they of course they do
8421660	8423660	But I love that 3DS dock
8423660	8425660	It makes it so great to remember to charge it
8425660	8427660	And it's just a cheap piece of plastic but it works so well
8427660	8429660	By the way I almost skipped
8429660	8431660	This email because it said oral advertising
8431660	8433660	But I saw who sent it
8433660	8435660	Dearest members of the online
8435660	8437660	Video game radio Caspoon Didocracy
8437660	8439660	You thought it was some French spam
8439660	8441660	We get inundated with French spam
8441660	8443660	I don't understand
8443660	8445660	This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD
8445660	8447660	Collection being released on Vita
8447660	8449660	The very possibility of a collection of games
8449660	8451660	Such as this being released on the Vita
8451660	8453660	Brought the following questions to my mind
8453660	8455660	Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3?
8455660	8457660	Staycare Entertainment
8457660	8459660	This message has been brought to you
8459660	8461660	By oral advertising sent from my iPad
8461660	8463660	Well you don't even get
8463660	8465660	All three games
8465660	8467660	You only get two of the three
8467660	8469660	Metal Gear Acid 3
8469660	8471660	Who are you going to have to blow to get that?
8471660	8473660	Probably Kojima
8473660	8475660	And from what I understand he's not too into the blow
8475660	8477660	You'd have to get his ass
8477660	8479660	I would see Acid 3 more on
8479660	8481660	The 3DS
8481660	8483660	Because remember they had the whole
8483660	8485660	Remember that really weird
8485660	8487660	There was a Metal Gear
8487660	8489660	There also is a
8489660	8491660	Metal Gear something
8491660	8493660	I can't remember if it came out or not
8493660	8495660	They were demoing one a long time ago
8495660	8497660	A Metal Gear something on 3DS
8497660	8499660	It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D
8499660	8501660	Snake Eater
8501660	8503660	Snake Eater
8503660	8505660	So
8505660	8507660	Yes? That was it
8507660	8509660	Hey guys this is Honey Badger
8509660	8511660	AKA Blade 3
8511660	8513660	Okay I have to stop and apologize
8513660	8515660	Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night
8515660	8517660	While I was drunk off
8517660	8519660	Cheap Sangria
8519660	8521660	Off my Ghetto Sangria made from Menneshevitz
8521660	8523660	So I'm sorry
8523660	8525660	I was a little drunk
8525660	8527660	I just wanted to say the listeners will support you
8527660	8529660	No matter what changes you make
8529660	8531660	Also I have a question for you all
8531660	8533660	But I think Loki may have the most
8533660	8535660	Input. How close are we
8535660	8537660	To having essentially gaming computers
8537660	8539660	And fancy cases that are just
8539660	8541660	Locked down by Microsoft or Sony
8541660	8543660	Basically where does the line between high end
8543660	8545660	Console and gaming PCs start
8545660	8547660	Well pretty much that's
8547660	8549660	What they are now anyways I mean it's just
8549660	8551660	Gaming PCs but it's proprietary boards
8551660	8553660	And what not
8553660	8555660	And specialized chips that are made
8555660	8557660	Specifically for the systems
8557660	8559660	I wish it was a little bit more like
8559660	8561660	Gaming PCs but I understand why they have
8561660	8563660	Limitations but it would be
8563660	8565660	Kind of cool like if for example
8565660	8567660	You can have an Xbox 360
8567660	8569660	And be able to upgrade the RAM in it
8569660	8571660	Like say okay all the games have to
8571660	8573660	Run with this amount of RAM but if you want
8573660	8575660	The games to run a little bit smoother you can add extra RAM
8575660	8577660	Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space
8577660	8579660	I'd be worried though about those minimum system
8579660	8581660	Requirements slowly bumping up you know
8581660	8583660	It's the one thing that makes people a little leery of
8583660	8585660	PC gaming
8585660	8587660	Nowadays I mean I know but you know
8587660	8589660	Then it's the video card then it's you know
8589660	8593660	The operating system that your thing is running
8593660	8595660	Then it's the space on your hard drive
8595660	8597660	Then you know
8597660	8599660	Then one thing it's another
8599660	8601660	So next email
8601660	8603660	I just wanted to say real quick though since that was from Honey Badger
8603660	8605660	I love that name by the way because it always makes me think it is
8605660	8607660	It's the Honey Badger watch it run in
8607660	8609660	Slow motion
8609660	8611660	It's pretty bad ass look
8611660	8613660	It runs all over the place
8613660	8615660	I wish
8615660	8617660	Listen to Orange Dolls Radio
8617660	8619660	Don't fuck your shit up
8619660	8621660	If you're not you're a bitch
8625660	8627660	And by the way just to clarify
8627660	8629660	I did not mean to insinuate
8629660	8631660	That Kojima is gay he has not come out
8631660	8633660	But if he was it would be okay
8633660	8635660	It would be fine by us
8635660	8637660	The more the merrier
8637660	8639660	Two emails left
8639660	8641660	Hey guys it's Jim Sally
8641660	8643660	Do I have to do the choo choo noise?
8643660	8645660	I live in Canada sorry
8645660	8647660	And work as a party train conductor
8647660	8649660	Recently me and my wife started shopping
8649660	8651660	For Robot Butler but we can't decide
8651660	8653660	What features we want
8653660	8655660	Wait a minute he really is a train conductor?
8655660	8657660	I think he's full of shit
8657660	8659660	Let me finish the email
8659660	8661660	A party train conductor
8661660	8663660	A party train
8663660	8665660	Legit my dad for many years
8665660	8667660	He recently retired
8667660	8669660	But for about 45 years
8669660	8671660	He worked for the railroad
8671660	8673660	And he was a train conductor
8673660	8675660	So when I hear that I perk up
8675660	8677660	So I'm just saying
8677660	8679660	Chichi
8679660	8681660	I empathize with the train people
8681660	8683660	She loves data from Star Trek
8683660	8685660	But I'm more of an R2D2 kind of guy
8685660	8687660	Which fictional robot would you like to have
8687660	8689660	In your real life?
8689660	8691660	Anyway I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides
8691660	8693660	On the Sally Express
8693660	8695660	Love you and good night Jim Sally
8695660	8697660	Edie cause she's hot
8697660	8699660	Mass Effect reference that's all I have
8699660	8701660	On the brain recently
8701660	8703660	I think
8707660	8709660	You know maybe the
8709660	8711660	The gigalobot from
8711660	8713660	Artificial intelligence
8713660	8715660	Does a cylon count?
8715660	8717660	As a robot because
8717660	8719660	I don't want to
8719660	8721660	I don't want to spoil but there's a certain
8721660	8723660	Cylon that's really hot
8723660	8725660	What? Are they full on robots
8725660	8727660	Or are they cybernetic?
8727660	8729660	Um
8729660	8731660	Cause I could say Angelica Houston from Captain EO
8731660	8733660	That's a great choice
8733660	8735660	But she's cybernetic
8735660	8737660	So are the borgs, the borg don't count
8737660	8739660	You know what? It's our show
8739660	8741660	We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please
8741660	8743660	And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO
8743660	8745660	Yes
8745660	8747660	I want Angelica Houston
8747660	8749660	To service me
8749660	8751660	And I want a certain
8751660	8753660	Unsaid very hot cylon
8753660	8755660	That was revealed in the third season
8755660	8757660	Finale and we'll just leave it at that
8757660	8759660	So what about you Loki?
8759660	8761660	I want a portal turret, it's technically a robot
8761660	8763660	Then I'm gonna
8763660	8765660	Change mine to GLaDOS
8765660	8767660	I want to be her when I grow up
8767660	8769660	And die
8769660	8771660	Okay the last email
8771660	8773660	You know what?
8773660	8775660	I'll french fry you bitch
8775660	8777660	Bitch I will
8777660	8779660	Come back and julienne you
8779660	8781660	I will take you to In-N-Out and watch
8781660	8783660	Them put you in the blender
8783660	8785660	Anyway
8785660	8787660	You know what Rob?
8787660	8789660	What?
8789660	8791660	Aw I'm getting applause
8791660	8793660	Howdy OLR
8793660	8795660	I wanted to say
8795660	8797660	I wanted to call in
8797660	8799660	But something came up as usual
8799660	8801660	Therefore I'm writing you folks instead
8801660	8803660	I was having a discussion with
8803660	8805660	We're getting the manual work I see
8805660	8807660	I was having a discussion with a friend
8807660	8809660	About the future of Nintendo
8809660	8811660	He came to a conclusion that Nintendo
8811660	8813660	Might be better off if they gave up
8813660	8815660	On hardware and focused entirely on making
8815660	8817660	Good games. What do you think?
8817660	8819660	Would Nintendo be harmed by dropping hardware
8819660	8821660	Or is Mario still Mario regardless of what system
8821660	8823660	It's on? It comes from Panaxium
8823660	8825660	So you mean you want them to be Sega?
8825660	8827660	Yeah
8827660	8829660	It's a great thing
8829660	8831660	For the fanboys to fantasize
8831660	8833660	About. Ain't gonna happen
8833660	8835660	Ain't gonna happen
8835660	8837660	Not for a long time
8837660	8839660	That will happen over Miyamoto's
8839660	8841660	Dead body. Literally
8841660	8843660	Like
8843660	8845660	It's
8845660	8847660	It's a Japanese company
8847660	8849660	And there's a lot of
8849660	8851660	I don't want to sound rude or mean
8851660	8853660	But just look at the history
8853660	8855660	There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that
8855660	8857660	That they know what the people want
8857660	8859660	And that's not the way they want to go down
8859660	8861660	And if you wanted to look for another example
8861660	8863660	What I'm talking about
8863660	8865660	The history of this show. We talked a lot about Konami
8865660	8867660	And I had this conversation
8867660	8869660	With a friend just the other day
8869660	8871660	Konami
8871660	8873660	Konami should've had
8873660	8875660	Konami had every right to be the kings
8875660	8877660	Of music games in America
8877660	8879660	As well as Japan
8879660	8881660	But they fucked it up
8881660	8883660	By not taking the risks
8883660	8885660	They did for a little while when there was a guy in America
8885660	8887660	Influencing a lot
8887660	8889660	But then that guy wasn't around anymore
8889660	8891660	And music games and Konami fell the fuck apart
8891660	8893660	Case in point. Rock Revolution
8893660	8895660	I think Nintendo will die trying to stay
8895660	8897660	First party
8897660	8899660	Well it's easy to dismiss Nintendo
8899660	8901660	But don't forget
8901660	8903660	How fucking huge the Wii was
8903660	8905660	Don't count it out
8905660	8907660	The 3DS should've failed
8907660	8909660	But it didn't
8909660	8911660	Nintendo brought it back
8911660	8913660	So write off the Wii U if you want
8913660	8915660	I'm as skeptical as the rest of you
8915660	8917660	But Nintendo kinda seems
8917660	8919660	To know how to make it work
8919660	8921660	Granted it could end up being a Nintendo 64
8921660	8923660	Or a GameCube
8923660	8925660	But neither of those systems exactly killed
8925660	8927660	Nintendo. It would have to take
8927660	8929660	Something of Virtual Boy proportions on the Wii U
8929660	8931660	To actually kill Nintendo
8931660	8933660	And make them go third party
8933660	8935660	So I'll sit here and fantasize with you about Mario
8935660	8937660	On the Playstation. I just think realistically
8937660	8939660	It ain't gonna happen for a very
8939660	8941660	Long time. Off topic
8941660	8943660	Here I wanted to mention something since I was browsing
8943660	8945660	Through the Playstation store
8945660	8947660	I find it a bit ironic that the full game
8947660	8949660	Of Ridge Racer
8949660	8951660	Happens to be under the demo section
8951660	8953660	What?
8953660	8955660	Isn't that a little funny?
8955660	8957660	Is it really? Yes it is
8957660	8959660	I gotta pull that down right now. Are you sure?
8959660	8961660	No, no. The paid
8961660	8963660	The one you have to pay $25 for
8963660	8965660	But it's filed under demo
8965660	8967660	I thought you meant it's free. I was like, you screwed up again?
8967660	8969660	No, no. Meaning it's filed
8969660	8971660	Under demo
8971660	8973660	Because there's no content to it
8973660	8975660	I think that's funny
8975660	8977660	Alright
8977660	8979660	Is that it for email? Are we done?
8979660	8981660	Yes. Alright. Mailbag at
8981660	8983660	OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us
8983660	8985660	Emails for a future week
8985660	8987660	In the meantime, it's time to get renty
8987660	8989660	Yeah, Fuse of the Week
9003660	9005660	Fuck Children's Week
9005660	9007660	Fuck all the Zorphins
9007660	9009660	Fuck their candy
9009660	9011660	Fuck their kites
9011660	9013660	Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake
9013660	9015660	I don't care anymore
9015660	9017660	I had the three holidays left
9017660	9019660	There's three
9019660	9021660	Children's Week has fucked it for me
9021660	9023660	Burn in hell
9023660	9025660	And your Matron
9025660	9027660	Fuck her too
9027660	9029660	Loki
9029660	9031660	F you to my ceiling fan in my living room
9031660	9033660	For breaking
9033660	9035660	My wife decided to turn the fan on high
9035660	9037660	To cool off, or to dry the
9037660	9039660	Floors that she had recently mopped
9039660	9041660	And the switch broke
9041660	9043660	So we couldn't shut it off
9043660	9045660	So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan
9045660	9047660	To shut it off
9047660	9049660	Manually
9049660	9051660	But it gets hot in here now
9055660	9057660	F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland
9057660	9059660	In a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go
9059660	9061660	And my friend's graduating and I'll
9061660	9063660	Get to miss it, but
9063660	9065660	And F you to Jamie because she'll be
9065660	9067660	Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me
9067660	9069660	That's true, hooray
9069660	9071660	F you to poop
9071660	9073660	Unless it was a really good meal
9073660	9075660	She has been a little drippy lately
9075660	9077660	Oh great, can't wait
9077660	9079660	You're disgusting
9079660	9081660	Alright, just a few more stories
9081660	9083660	For you guys
9083660	9085660	And then we're going to open up the skype line
9085660	9087660	Just for a little bit tonight guys
9087660	9089660	We're running a little late because of the interview earlier
9089660	9091660	I think it was worth it, don't you?
9091660	9093660	Just a few more stories for you guys, Loki
9093660	9095660	Oh wait, quickly, quickly
9095660	9097660	I want to say this
9097660	9099660	Because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole
9099660	9101660	Nintendo and some folks brought up the iPhone
9101660	9103660	And I must say
9103660	9105660	Among all other things
9105660	9107660	I would see Nintendo going to a place
9107660	9109660	Like iOS first
9109660	9111660	Before straight up Microsoft and Sony
9111660	9113660	Type properties, why?
9113660	9115660	Because the investors have already been pressuring them to do it
9115660	9117660	And we have seen
9117660	9119660	Team Pokemon put something
9119660	9121660	One of those teams
9121660	9123660	Put something out on the iOS
9123660	9125660	Platform already
9125660	9127660	I could see something like that happening
9127660	9129660	Long before the
9129660	9131660	Sony and Xbox thing
9131660	9133660	That was something that was brought up in chat
9133660	9135660	What was it?
9135660	9137660	Legend of Zaku said iPhone
9137660	9139660	Enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that
9139660	9141660	Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories
9141660	9143660	Alright, let's talk about the dark side of
9143660	9145660	Kickstarter
9145660	9147660	So there was this Kickstarter for
9147660	9149660	A game titled Mythic
9149660	9151660	The Story of Gods and Men
9151660	9153660	Which is an RPG from this company
9153660	9155660	Called Little Monster Productions
9155660	9157660	It was, of course
9157660	9159660	This already sounds a little bit
9159660	9161660	Outlandish, but it said
9161660	9163660	To rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim
9163660	9165660	Built together by a team of
9165660	9167660	Former Activision Blizzard developers
9167660	9169660	And the project was asking
9169660	9171660	For $80,000
9171660	9173660	It raised $5,000
9173660	9175660	Up until a couple
9175660	9177660	You know, days ago
9177660	9179660	Basically what happened was
9179660	9181660	They actually cancelled the funding
9181660	9183660	Altogether
9183660	9185660	And that's because
9185660	9187660	Apparently all their assets that they were showing
9187660	9189660	On the site were stolen
9189660	9191660	Apparently
9191660	9193660	All the artwork for the
9193660	9195660	Game that was supposedly being made
9195660	9197660	Was stolen off of different people's
9197660	9199660	Deviant art sites
9199660	9201660	Also
9201660	9203660	Some of the
9203660	9205660	I guess pretty much all of the
9205660	9207660	Rewards were stolen from
9207660	9209660	Another Kickstarter page
9209660	9211660	The Banner Saga
9211660	9213660	And
9213660	9215660	Of course it made it to Reddit
9215660	9217660	And people were warning them online
9217660	9219660	And of course Little Monster Productions
9219660	9221660	Responded to the scam saying
9221660	9223660	It seems we've been subjected to
9223660	9225660	False claims of ownership rights
9225660	9227660	To our concepts
9227660	9229660	The game itself is well in progress
9229660	9231660	And it's not a scam of any kind
9231660	9233660	Thank you for understanding
9233660	9235660	If you have any further questions feel free to ask
9235660	9237660	And then of course since then
9237660	9239660	The Kickstarter
9239660	9241660	Account's been deleted and
9241660	9243660	They've kind of disappeared and vanished away
9243660	9245660	With all that money
9245660	9247660	Well no, technically not
9247660	9249660	Because they have to hit their funding goal
9249660	9251660	Of $80,000 in order to keep that money
9251660	9253660	So the $5,000 that was contributed
9253660	9255660	Or put down actually didn't go anywhere
9255660	9257660	It went back to the people that
9257660	9259660	Never left the people that put it down
9259660	9261660	I still think it's a wake up call
9261660	9263660	I mean Kickstarter has really
9263660	9265660	Taken off
9265660	9267660	Everybody wants a piece of it
9267660	9269660	For some people it's like an ATM machine right now
9269660	9271660	And it's a tricky thing
9271660	9273660	I still can't wrap my head around
9273660	9275660	How I really feel about Kickstarter because
9275660	9277660	There's some things like
9277660	9279660	What Random was talking about earlier
9279660	9281660	And I saw a great piece
9281660	9283660	On the internet this week, an awesome piece about
9283660	9285660	Amanda Palmer's
9285660	9287660	Kickstarter
9287660	9289660	And basically the gist of the article is
9289660	9291660	This is why Amanda Palmer gets to do
9291660	9293660	A Kickstarter and you don't
9293660	9295660	And I thought it was kind of a really neat article
9295660	9297660	It was really good
9297660	9299660	I just
9299660	9301660	If you're gonna get into the
9301660	9303660	Kickstarter thing, that's cool
9303660	9305660	But play smart
9305660	9307660	And this story is a great example
9307660	9309660	Of why, because it really seems like there's some people out there
9309660	9311660	Just donating to everything and anything
9311660	9313660	Hey it's your money, spend it on what you want
9313660	9315660	It can be dangerous and this is why
9315660	9317660	Educate yourself
9317660	9319660	Make sure that you're aware
9319660	9321660	Of who you're
9321660	9323660	Donating to
9323660	9325660	I also really think
9325660	9327660	This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter
9327660	9329660	Kickstarter needs to allow the person
9329660	9331660	And maybe they do
9331660	9333660	To be fair, maybe they already do this
9333660	9335660	And I just never see people do it
9335660	9337660	And maybe people should be encouraged to do it more
9337660	9339660	To set a limit
9339660	9341660	On how much money is gonna be raised
9341660	9343660	Because you know
9343660	9345660	When I see certain Kickstarters
9345660	9347660	That ask for thirty thousand
9347660	9349660	And I can't even put my head around what you do
9349660	9351660	With thirty thousand dollars
9351660	9353660	And get a hundred and twenty thousand dollars
9353660	9355660	It's like
9355660	9357660	Well they keep changing
9357660	9359660	They're allowed to I guess change their
9359660	9361660	Goals I guess on their
9361660	9363660	What they're gonna do
9363660	9365660	I don't know
9365660	9367660	As a consumer I want to know where every dollar is going
9367660	9369660	You know
9369660	9371660	As an investor
9371660	9373660	And when you invest in a company
9373660	9375660	There's these things called investor and shareholder
9375660	9377660	Meetings where you talk about the company
9377660	9379660	And the progress and where the money is going
9379660	9381660	But really all that you are guaranteed out of that
9381660	9383660	Is basically what you
9383660	9385660	Slot you fit into
9385660	9387660	As far as the rewards go
9387660	9389660	That's all you're guaranteed
9389660	9391660	And that's my problem with Kickstarter
9391660	9393660	Well then don't donate the stuff that you're
9393660	9395660	Unaware of
9395660	9397660	But I will admit there are some Kickstarters
9397660	9399660	And like the star control thing we talked about last week
9399660	9401660	I have to admit I kind of want that cartridge
9401660	9403660	That sounded pretty fucking awesome
9403660	9405660	And you know I hear about people like
9405660	9407660	Random and certainly
9407660	9409660	The pink elephant in the room
9409660	9411660	There's other Kickstarters that you know
9411660	9413660	Obviously we're well aware of
9413660	9415660	You know and I wish success for them
9415660	9417660	But it's
9417660	9419660	It's just
9419660	9421660	There's just something about it
9421660	9423660	Like I just feel like the other shoe is gonna
9423660	9425660	Drop on Kickstarter any day now
9425660	9427660	It's gonna burst
9427660	9429660	I don't know if I want to be there when it does
9429660	9431660	Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer
9431660	9433660	Anyway
9433660	9435660	Well I mean not everything gets
9435660	9437660	Not everything gets you know
9437660	9439660	Funded I mean there was the
9439660	9441660	Kickstarter for
9441660	9443660	It was a sequel to
9443660	9445660	Oh god I don't remember now what it's called
9445660	9447660	It was a PSP game it wasn't very popular
9447660	9449660	But they were trying to get a sequel for it
9449660	9451660	And that fell through
9451660	9453660	But there is some interesting
9453660	9455660	Things on there and this is another one of those
9455660	9457660	There's a
9457660	9459660	MMO on
9459660	9461660	There if you can even call it
9461660	9463660	It's called Class Realm it's being developed
9463660	9465660	By
9465660	9467660	Some people I want to say
9467660	9469660	They're in the education
9469660	9471660	System to
9471660	9473660	Basically motivate
9473660	9475660	Their students to read more
9475660	9477660	Participate in discussions more and study more
9477660	9479660	As well as learn
9479660	9481660	And you know it's called Class Realm
9481660	9483660	And it's kind of interesting
9483660	9485660	He says my kids are
9485660	9487660	They're the best promoters
9487660	9489660	As they're going around telling other students
9489660	9491660	How great it is and in my classroom the other kids
9491660	9493660	Come in from other classes from math and science
9493660	9495660	And they see the Class Realm
9495660	9497660	Stuff on my wall and they want to do it
9497660	9499660	And other teachers
9499660	9501660	Also have been hugely supportive and basically
9501660	9503660	What he's trying to do is he's creating this
9503660	9505660	Class Realm thing that's both free and paid
9505660	9507660	As well you can do the free
9507660	9509660	Sharing the tools with the other
9509660	9511660	Teachers and then the paid one
9511660	9513660	You get additional things
9513660	9515660	We covered this a few weeks ago
9515660	9517660	It's pretty cool
9517660	9519660	It's actually launched now and he's taking
9519660	9521660	Donations and stuff
9521660	9523660	You can pledge towards it
9523660	9525660	I think it's kind of neat
9525660	9527660	Alright
9527660	9529660	Well let's move on to another story here
9529660	9531660	We talked about harmonics earlier
9531660	9533660	In the show and I want to talk about them
9533660	9535660	Again because everybody's kind of wondering
9535660	9537660	What are they going to do next? Obviously they have
9537660	9539660	The Xbox Live and Playstation Network thing
9539660	9541660	That's coming but you know that can't be
9541660	9543660	The only thing they've been working on for the past few years
9543660	9545660	Well some rumors are leaking
9545660	9547660	Out about what we might see very soon
9547660	9549660	According to some different job listings
9549660	9551660	That were spotted harmonics
9551660	9553660	Is looking for a narrative content
9553660	9555660	And level designers
9555660	9557660	And one software engineer
9557660	9559660	They're going to be doing a project that's called
9559660	9561660	Quote a unique
9561660	9563660	Motion gaming IP
9563660	9565660	Hmmm
9565660	9567660	It seeks an accomplished narrative designer
9567660	9569660	To incorporate creative storylines
9569660	9571660	Into gameplay on a unique
9571660	9573660	Motion gaming IP
9573660	9575660	Could it be Dance Central 3
9575660	9577660	Or is this something brand brand new
9577660	9579660	Dance Central 2 kind of tried
9579660	9581660	To do the story thing but it was a little
9581660	9583660	Silly but you don't expect much out of a music
9583660	9585660	Game. Could harmonics be doing
9585660	9587660	Something, I mean maybe it's Dance Central 3
9587660	9589660	Maybe it's something totally
9589660	9591660	Different. They said unique
9591660	9593660	Yeah they did say unique
9593660	9595660	I mean harmonics
9595660	9597660	Everything they put out has been pretty good
9597660	9599660	Except for that free thing but
9599660	9601660	Harmonics does a pretty darn good job
9601660	9603660	Even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy
9603660	9605660	But it was really an interesting little tool
9605660	9607660	I'm really curious to see what they bring
9607660	9609660	With this
9609660	9611660	I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it
9613660	9615660	But we'll see
9615660	9617660	How about some other news
9617660	9619660	Well
9619660	9621660	Sega is making
9621660	9623660	A kind of a console
9623660	9625660	For you to pee on
9625660	9627660	It's called a Dreamcast
9627660	9629660	Just kidding
9629660	9631660	I love the Dreamcast
9631660	9633660	It's a urine powered
9633660	9635660	Video game system for Japanese toilets
9635660	9637660	That's to be installed
9637660	9639660	In bars and it
9639660	9641660	Measures
9641660	9643660	Urine speed but two different
9643660	9645660	Effects
9645660	9647660	And Hiroyuki Tanaka
9647660	9649660	Who is a Sega spokesman
9649660	9651660	It gives customers something to talk
9651660	9653660	About when they come back from the bathroom
9653660	9655660	It
9655660	9657660	It's basically called the toilet
9657660	9659660	Toilet
9659660	9661660	I get it
9661660	9663660	It gives men
9663660	9665660	Incentive to pee in the urinal
9665660	9667660	To play mini games
9667660	9669660	Instead of on the floor
9669660	9671660	And it makes cleaner restrooms
9671660	9673660	And
9673660	9675660	Tanaka says
9675660	9677660	We live in a day and age where you have to give
9677660	9679660	Incentive for grown men
9679660	9681660	Please
9681660	9683660	Don't go pee pee on the floor
9683660	9685660	And they've had good feedback
9685660	9687660	From customers that says toilet cleanliness
9687660	9689660	Has improved
9689660	9691660	Now get the price on this one Rob
9691660	9693660	There's 130 units out there
9693660	9695660	At 150,000 yen
9695660	9697660	A pop
9697660	9699660	Now just to be clear we have heard
9699660	9701660	About this system before
9701660	9703660	Cause there was the whole toilet jokes
9703660	9705660	I've watched an informative video on this before
9705660	9707660	But what Jamie's talking about is that
9707660	9709660	Now Sega's putting it out there where it's
9709660	9711660	Really accessible where anybody can get this
9711660	9713660	You can get this for your personal bathroom if you want
9713660	9715660	If you're like into water sports or something weird
9715660	9717660	Well to clarify
9717660	9719660	There's been a trickle of information
9719660	9721660	About this
9721660	9723660	The hardware itself is
9723660	9725660	140,000 which is about
9725660	9727660	1700 bucks
9727660	9729660	The mini games are
9729660	9731660	10,000 yen a piece which is 125 dollars
9731660	9733660	And you can get
9733660	9735660	A 10 yen coin box
9735660	9737660	That's 25,000
9737660	9739660	So that you can pay to
9739660	9741660	Pee I guess
9741660	9743660	312 bucks pretty much
9743660	9745660	For the box
9745660	9747660	That's a terrible idea, pay to pee
9747660	9749660	And they have home options
9749660	9751660	It'll be on Spirit Airlines
9751660	9753660	Next week
9753660	9755660	And now they have home version options
9755660	9757660	Where you can pay
9757660	9759660	2,000 dollars to
9759660	9761660	Pay to pee in your own house
9761660	9763660	But you can
9763660	9765660	GioVidea who is a lady is in our chat room
9765660	9767660	At vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households
9767660	9769660	Badly
9769660	9771660	Yes and in college restrooms
9771660	9773660	But this honestly
9773660	9775660	What do ladies have?
9775660	9777660	We can pee
9777660	9779660	Maybe not directionally pee like men
9779660	9781660	Cause you know it's really hard to aim when
9781660	9783660	You know it's close to the hoo-ha
9783660	9785660	But why take the fun out of trying?
9785660	9787660	We should have like poop pressure games
9787660	9789660	Ew
9789660	9791660	Ew
9791660	9793660	Ew
9793660	9795660	Ew about the pee too
9795660	9797660	At least pee is sterile
9797660	9799660	Going to our chat room
9799660	9801660	I really don't want to talk about this story anymore
9801660	9803660	But I really need to
9803660	9805660	You're the one who gave it to me
9805660	9807660	The show where every gamer has a voice
9807660	9809660	BlackWolf in our chat room at vognetwork.com
9809660	9811660	Says sign in the men's bathroom
9811660	9813660	Of the LAN center I did Friday night gaming at
9813660	9815660	You claim to have good aim
9815660	9817660	Now's your chance to prove it
9817660	9819660	Okay
9819660	9821660	When I was at the University of South Alabama
9821660	9823660	In the humanities building
9823660	9825660	On the second floor in the ladies bathroom
9825660	9827660	There was a little poem
9827660	9829660	Written on the wall in the stall
9829660	9831660	That I would usually use
9831660	9833660	If you must pee upon the seat
9833660	9835660	Wipe it off and keep it neat
9835660	9837660	There was also
9837660	9839660	Now get this
9839660	9841660	A toilet seat cover that I saw
9841660	9843660	On the top it says we aim to please
9843660	9845660	You lift it up
9845660	9847660	Please
9847660	9849660	I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms
9849660	9851660	We need to talk about this for a minute
9851660	9853660	Because we don't pee all over everything
9853660	9855660	I was at a gas station
9855660	9857660	Driving to LA and I was at the gas station at
9857660	9859660	3.30 in the morning because you know nature called
9859660	9861660	And I had to go but the men's restroom was closed
9861660	9863660	So there was not a soul
9863660	9865660	In this place so I said to my friend
9865660	9867660	I said Victoria I want you to stand outside this door
9867660	9869660	And if a woman comes don't let them in
9869660	9871660	So I went in the women's restroom
9871660	9873660	And you know I open the door and I'm like
9873660	9875660	There's like flowers and shit in here
9875660	9877660	It smells all
9877660	9879660	perfume-y
9879660	9881660	Like what the hell is this strange new
9881660	9883660	world
9883660	9885660	The only time I've seen like a nice bathroom
9885660	9887660	At this is like when you go to the steak house and have a nice
9887660	9889660	Dinner like those are the only men's restrooms
9889660	9891660	That get decorated where maybe like the little
9891660	9893660	Hand towels are in a basket
9893660	9895660	But fucking flowers and shit
9895660	9897660	At a gas station
9897660	9899660	Check who owns the gas station
9899660	9901660	I have been in some pretty
9901660	9903660	Shithole gas station bathrooms
9903660	9905660	For women so do not
9905660	9907660	Even go there it was
9907660	9909660	The chevron
9909660	9911660	On the way back from Pensacola
9911660	9913660	That's right when you get back into Mobile off the
9913660	9915660	Causeway ugh never go there it's
9915660	9917660	Awful
9917660	9919660	Alright we're gonna move on
9919660	9921660	To some other stories quite quickly
9921660	9923660	But I do want to point out cause everybody
9923660	9925660	In chat was like how many listeners did you lose
9925660	9927660	During that segment we gained
9927660	9929660	One suckas
9929660	9931660	You got told
9931660	9933660	When in doubt potty jokes
9933660	9935660	Alright moving on
9935660	9937660	We should talk more about that stuff
9937660	9939660	Let's talk about Microsoft
9939660	9941660	Coming soon to the VoG network
9941660	9943660	Poo poo pee pee show
9943660	9945660	I'm kidding I'm kidding
9945660	9947660	Microsoft has patented
9947660	9949660	Some sort of arm band
9949660	9951660	That has
9951660	9953660	EMG sensors as well as other
9953660	9955660	Electrodes in there
9955660	9957660	Basically what it does is it monitors your muscle
9957660	9959660	So for example
9959660	9961660	You know they would have it programmed
9961660	9963660	To where like if you made a fist or something like that
9963660	9965660	That your character would make a fist
9965660	9967660	Kind of like an extension to like
9967660	9969660	The motion tracking and stuff
9969660	9971660	And you know I guess it could be
9971660	9973660	Applied to other
9973660	9975660	Parts of your body like your leg or something like that
9975660	9977660	But it is kind of interesting
9977660	9979660	That they're gonna have some
9979660	9981660	Potentially gonna have some sort of device
9981660	9983660	That allows you to track yourself a little
9983660	9985660	Better
9985660	9987660	Pretty soon
9987660	9989660	I'm just worried about how far those things
9989660	9991660	Are gonna evolve
9991660	9993660	It is a device
9993660	9995660	That you wrap around an appendage
9995660	9997660	So the TTP for that
9997660	9999660	How soon?
10001660	10003660	If you don't know what that is
10003660	10005660	Just move right along
10005660	10007660	Alright a moment
10007660	10009660	Of silence please because
10009660	10011660	Like when I heard
10011660	10013660	This news this week
10013660	10015660	I almost wanted to call
10015660	10017660	The hotline
10017660	10019660	And send some help
10019660	10021660	Over to one of our authors
10021660	10023660	OrangeLawnTrader.com's house
10023660	10025660	To make sure he was okay
10025660	10027660	La Munana
10027660	10029660	In North America and Europe
10029660	10031660	Has been cancelled on WiiWare
10031660	10033660	And Dark Tetsuya
10033660	10035660	Bless his heart
10035660	10037660	Was really excited about that game
10037660	10039660	Like really excited about that game
10039660	10041660	And it was in development
10041660	10043660	And in development
10043660	10045660	And finally they just said
10045660	10047660	Fuck it we're not releasing
10047660	10049660	It on the Wii now there is some
10049660	10051660	Good news it is coming out on the PC
10051660	10053660	So you know maybe it'll be on Steam
10053660	10055660	Or something like that but uh
10055660	10057660	It was cancelled they did uh
10057660	10059660	I thought that was already on PC
10059660	10061660	Uh I think this is like a
10061660	10063660	Plus version or like an enhanced version
10063660	10065660	Of the game that's coming out
10065660	10067660	You know we were waiting on it for two years and basically
10067660	10069660	At the end of the day they just came out and said
10069660	10071660	WiiWare ain't profitable anymore
10071660	10073660	That's what everyone's been saying
10073660	10075660	That's something they need to fix
10075660	10077660	And a lot of that is Nintendo shitty guidelines
10077660	10079660	Where it's like you have to sell so many units before
10079660	10081660	You even get like a check
10081660	10083660	Keep that up and you won't have anybody but
10083660	10085660	Yourselves publishing on
10085660	10087660	That service
10087660	10089660	So uh
10089660	10091660	You know just uh a moment
10091660	10093660	Rest in peace La Munana
10093660	10095660	On the Wii
10095660	10097660	I mean at least it'll be coming out on the platform
10097660	10099660	It's a cute game I was interested in it
10099660	10101660	Why can't they put that on like you know Xbox
10101660	10103660	Indie games or how we'll get that on like
10103660	10105660	You know Xbox Live Arcade or something like that
10105660	10107660	Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it
10107660	10109660	But it seems like they don't like to talk much
10109660	10111660	Uh
10111660	10113660	Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show
10113660	10115660	Why Nintendo fails at digital distribution
10115660	10117660	Sj100Matt says but then again
10117660	10119660	It was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people
10119660	10121660	Are not placing the blame on the makers
10121660	10123660	Of La Mulana but they are placing the blame
10123660	10125660	Squarely at Nintendo's feet
10125660	10127660	And uh I can't say I disagree with
10127660	10129660	Shall we open up
10129660	10131660	The Skype line? We shall

10199660	10201660	As per orders of the great mighty powerful Rob
10201660	10203660	I went to Chinatown Fair
10205660	10207660	Yeah I'm curious to hear what you thought about
10207660	10209660	Chinatown Fair because what I read on Twitter
10209660	10211660	Was interesting
10211660	10213660	Uh oh
10213660	10215660	That sums it up right there
10215660	10217660	I
10217660	10219660	I wasn't
10219660	10221660	I wasn't expecting this
10221660	10223660	I really wasn't and I'm posting
10223660	10225660	A link to the complete total
10225660	10227660	Of eight photos I took
10227660	10229660	There because all I needed was eight
10229660	10231660	Photos
10231660	10233660	I mean
10233660	10235660	It's not even trying
10235660	10237660	To be a Dave and Busters
10237660	10239660	Wannabe
10239660	10241660	It's like

10243660	10245660	Of Dave and Busters that nobody
10245660	10247660	Talks to
10247660	10249660	Chuck E. Cheese?
10249660	10251660	Not even
10251660	10253660	Not even
10253660	10255660	There's some ski ball and the spinny wheel for tickets
10255660	10257660	And a basketball thing
10257660	10259660	Terminator salvation is cool
10259660	10261660	Guitar Hero arcade some people like
10261660	10263660	If you notice over in the corner
10263660	10265660	I only got one
10265660	10267660	But right next to that one big screen TV
10267660	10269660	There's another big screen TV
10269660	10271660	That's not even on
10271660	10273660	And
10273660	10275660	Damn you have HDMI cables hooked up
10275660	10277660	For the console
10277660	10279660	Hey they got a Plinko game
10279660	10281660	I didn't know they made those for the prices
10281660	10283660	Oh Rob you and Plinko
10283660	10285660	I mean it looks like a lot of
10285660	10287660	Ok it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember
10287660	10289660	Got replaced with ticket spitters
10289660	10291660	Welcome to every other arcade in America
10291660	10293660	I mean it's sad but that's what's happened
10293660	10295660	I know but I wasn't
10295660	10297660	Expecting something like this
10297660	10299660	Though I mean
10299660	10301660	From
10301660	10303660	When I spoke to one of the guys who told me
10303660	10305660	About this he flat out said
10305660	10307660	The new owner has no clue as to what
10307660	10309660	He's doing and he's trying to convince
10309660	10311660	The owner to get in some actual
10311660	10313660	Good games
10313660	10315660	Ok well that you know and it is
10315660	10317660	New arcade so let's give
10317660	10319660	I mean yes it's an old arcade
10319660	10321660	But it's new owners or whatever let's give
10321660	10323660	Them a chance
10323660	10325660	That's what everybody was saying because at first we're all
10325660	10327660	Outside sitting on the
10327660	10329660	Stoop bad mouthing
10329660	10331660	And cursing up a storm about
10331660	10333660	This and then we're like you know
10333660	10335660	We'll give them about
10335660	10337660	30 days just to see
10337660	10339660	Yeah go back in a month and see what
10339660	10341660	Changes if anything and if nothing changes
10341660	10343660	Well then shit they didn't learn anything
10343660	10345660	Um you know give it
10345660	10347660	A chance
10347660	10349660	We're trying and we're looking we're walking
10349660	10351660	Like the first thing we started
10351660	10353660	Raging about the fact that there's a pump it up machine
10353660	10355660	Because nobody plays pump it up
10355660	10357660	It's funny in the picture that's the
10357660	10359660	Only machine I see a crowd around
10359660	10361660	That's the sad part
10361660	10363660	It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets
10363660	10365660	Well there was a
10365660	10367660	Terminator salvation machine I saw there too
10367660	10369660	And a couple others I mean
10369660	10371660	Super bikes too
10371660	10373660	Hey you know what Chinatown fair looks like

10385660	10387660	Wavelength at that time for that five
10387660	10389660	Seconds Rob I'm so glad that the east

10427660	10429660	In just a little bit here on the show
10429660	10431660	I'm waiting until the very end because that's how I roll
10431660	10433660	Um
10433660	10435660	Let's see going to
10435660	10437660	Some of our tweets that we have tonight
10437660	10439660	Tiger Claw of course sent us a few tweets
10439660	10441660	Here uh one of them is about
10441660	10443660	Miyamoto's DS patent
10443660	10445660	That will offer upgraded
10445660	10447660	Tourist hunting techniques
10447660	10449660	That sounds kind of interesting I hadn't
10449660	10451660	Heard about this uh apparently
10451660	10453660	If this
10453660	10455660	Is a real deal
10455660	10457660	There could be some type of advancement in GPS
10457660	10459660	Technology in tourist heavy areas
10459660	10461660	Like museums and haunted house type
10461660	10463660	Places and I'm imagining things like Disneyland
10463660	10465660	Uh this patent would have a system
10465660	10467660	Where an overhead grid
10467660	10469660	Of infrared positional information
10469660	10471660	Transmitters reads a user's
10471660	10473660	DS to light up floor patterns
10473660	10475660	And potential walkways
10475660	10477660	The user can pick which route they'd like to take
10477660	10479660	Reading tourist facts along the way
10479660	10481660	That sounds kind of interesting
10481660	10483660	I guess the 3DS I didn't realize this already
10483660	10485660	The 3DS will give guided tours
10485660	10487660	Of the Louvre in France
10487660	10489660	And it's really a pretty good
10489660	10491660	The Louvre
10491660	10493660	Yo no speak French-o
10493660	10495660	Um it's doing a pretty good job I guess
10495660	10497660	From what they say
10497660	10499660	That's kind of interesting it's an interesting use of the technology
10499660	10501660	Technically
10501660	10503660	There's iPhone apps and stuff
10503660	10505660	That do all that but this
10505660	10507660	Is a different way of implementing that technology
10507660	10509660	That you know would be pretty stable
10509660	10511660	So sounds
10511660	10513660	Very interesting to me
10513660	10515660	Let's go to the phones and take another call
10515660	10517660	Hi you're on orange country who's this?
10517660	10519660	What's up buddy?
10519660	10521660	Nothing much just trying to reiterate what
10521660	10523660	Rama has said about CF
10523660	10525660	I heard it from my sources a few
10525660	10527660	You know a couple of days before
10527660	10529660	It opened that it was going to be radically different
10529660	10531660	Like nothing
10531660	10533660	It wasn't going to be anything near what
10533660	10535660	The old CF was
10535660	10537660	And I guess
10537660	10539660	In a way it's
10539660	10541660	You know I got to give them the benefit of the doubt that
10541660	10543660	Sure they may have like a
10543660	10545660	Rocky and
10545660	10547660	Some uneven open just for the fact that it's
10547660	10549660	It's out of place for what
10549660	10551660	People would normally
10551660	10553660	Refer to as CF
10553660	10555660	But then again if the owner doesn't like
10555660	10557660	The owner doesn't make a change
10557660	10559660	Quickly then he's going to lose
10559660	10561660	These folks for quite a while
10561660	10563660	Because they're going to go to Brooklyn to next level arcade
10563660	10565660	Where the remnants of CF
10565660	10567660	Who used to run the place are
10567660	10569660	Pretty much alive and you know thriving there
10569660	10571660	Especially the fighting community
10571660	10573660	Let me play devil's advocate
10573660	10575660	For a minute here because this is a question
10575660	10577660	I should have asked on the last call
10577660	10579660	Yeah they might lose the fans that used to go
10579660	10581660	But is it possible that they'll gain fans
10581660	10583660	I mean arcades do this for a reason right
10583660	10585660	Yeah but it might be a demographic
10585660	10587660	That doesn't
10587660	10589660	Doesn't like bode well
10589660	10591660	For that area
10591660	10593660	I mean the way I describe a CFer
10593660	10595660	Is someone who's basically male
10595660	10597660	About 20ish
10597660	10599660	Into video games very competitive
10599660	10601660	So that type of demographic
10601660	10603660	Pretty much held that place together
10603660	10605660	For the last years
10605660	10607660	Of its old existence
10607660	10609660	Because
10609660	10611660	It was mostly fighting games and to an extent
10611660	10613660	Our community
10613660	10615660	The DDR community
10615660	10617660	So to have something that barely
10617660	10619660	Resembles that and
10619660	10621660	Something where the old guard of CF
10621660	10623660	You know are pretty much
10623660	10625660	At their own place right now that caters
10625660	10627660	To that demographic it's like you're not going to
10627660	10629660	It's not going to do any justice right away
10629660	10631660	If it's basically
10631660	10633660	If that old location has
10633660	10635660	Nothing more than just
10635660	10637660	You know just like a mini D&B
10637660	10639660	I mean that's
10639660	10641660	Pretty much what I'm getting at
10641660	10643660	You have so much space
10643660	10645660	That they crammed with arcade machines
10645660	10647660	Left and right
10647660	10649660	Like just about every place
10649660	10651660	Wall to wall just literally just covered in arcades
10651660	10653660	And now they're just like
10653660	10655660	There's not that many at the moment
10655660	10657660	But as I said I give them the benefit of the doubt
10657660	10659660	So unless this new owner
10659660	10661660	Doesn't like
10661660	10663660	Doesn't like
10663660	10665660	Unless this owner actually does
10665660	10667660	Something in terms of writing
10667660	10669660	This course and trying to draw more people
10669660	10671660	In there in order to stay alive
10671660	10673660	Let me ask this question though
10673660	10675660	Is it maybe already a lost cause?
10675660	10677660	It depends
10677660	10679660	How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money
10679660	10681660	I know of another place
10681660	10683660	Like out in Queens in the city
10683660	10685660	Peter Pan Gaines
10685660	10687660	Is similar but it's more
10687660	10689660	Lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere
10689660	10691660	It's like the only
10691660	10693660	In other words New York's only 2DX machine
10693660	10695660	Is out there as well as like
10695660	10697660	An unlocked X2
10697660	10699660	But it has redemption games
10699660	10701660	But the thing is that these redemption aren't just like
10701660	10703660	Some Mickey Mouse prizes
10703660	10705660	They're like real big ticket items like iPads
10705660	10707660	And coupled with the fact that
10707660	10709660	It's on a strip mall
10709660	10711660	Which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood
10711660	10713660	So it's partly
10713660	10715660	What CF is but it's like
10715660	10717660	What CF is right now is at an infancy of what
10717660	10719660	Peter Pan Gaines is already at
10719660	10721660	So it's at a point where
10721660	10723660	Unless they start drawing in something
10723660	10725660	That will keep whales
10725660	10727660	Like myself
10727660	10729660	They'll draw them in there
10729660	10731660	In other words you'll have a clientele
10731660	10733660	That will constantly spend money there
10733660	10735660	And will keep your place alive
10735660	10737660	They're just doomed to failure
10737660	10739660	They're gonna need that type of customer
10739660	10741660	Or else they're just gonna succumb to whatever
10741660	10743660	They get if any
10743660	10745660	Alright
10745660	10747660	Well Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show
10747660	10749660	But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10749660	10751660	Other than
10751660	10753660	Cheating in MLB 2K12
10753660	10755660	I'm not a baseball fan but
10755660	10757660	The fact that people could game a
10757660	10759660	Could actually exploit a game just to make money
10759660	10761660	And 2K basically denying
10761660	10763660	Let them get away with it
10763660	10765660	That the exploit was illegal
10765660	10767660	Even though they originally said it was
10767660	10769660	I guess
10769660	10771660	They have egg in their face right now
10771660	10773660	It's like tainted that whole competition
10773660	10775660	They're gonna have a shitty finale
10775660	10777660	And they only have themselves to blame
10777660	10779660	Exactly
10779660	10781660	And they basically fell on their own sword
10781660	10783660	For basically denying
10783660	10785660	That said cheat
10785660	10787660	Was illegal even though it's technically
10787660	10789660	Allowed
10789660	10791660	Zaku I gotta let you go buddy
10791660	10793660	Have a good one
10793660	10795660	Alright that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
10795660	10797660	I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through
10797660	10799660	The live listeners, podcasters I'm so
10799660	10801660	Sorry but I only have one of these to give
10801660	10803660	Away and I do want to give it to somebody
10803660	10805660	Tonight that's stayed up with us
10805660	10807660	This late, don't worry Loki's competition
10807660	10809660	He talked about that'll be open to everybody
10809660	10811660	But we're gonna open this one up to just the live
10811660	10813660	Listeners for right now, here's what it is
10813660	10815660	I've got a code courtesy of
10815660	10817660	Ranma for an
10817660	10819660	Xbox 360 avatar
10819660	10821660	Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4
10821660	10823660	Hoodie so if you want your avatar on
10823660	10825660	Xbox to be wearing a hoodie
10825660	10827660	We're gonna give one of these away and the good news is
10827660	10829660	You can actually use this with male or female
10829660	10831660	There's a male code and a female code
10831660	10833660	So technically you get two codes
10833660	10835660	So I'm gonna give it to one person so maybe one for you
10835660	10837660	And one for your SO or what have you
10837660	10839660	All you have to do is send me a private

10859660	10861660	Random person
10861660	10863660	To receive a Sonic 4
10863660	10865660	Hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks
10865660	10867660	Network tonight, so there you go
10867660	10869660	And Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought

10873660	10875660	At
10875660	10877660	AnimeJamSession.com
10877660	10879660	Alright send those private messages into Skye right now
10879660	10881660	And while I collect those messages you have
10881660	10883660	About three minutes to do that
10883660	10885660	Loki
10885660	10887660	So yeah
10887660	10889660	I have to
10889660	10891660	I guess the last minute story
10891660	10893660	Taito put out a game for Akira
10893660	10895660	About 25 years ago
10895660	10897660	On the Famicom and it's finally been
10897660	10899660	Fan translated, so you can check that
10899660	10901660	There's a patch available for that
10901660	10903660	Yeah
10903660	10905660	So it's out there
10905660	10907660	Just Google it
10907660	10909660	Yeah
10909660	10911660	Yeah I was just gonna
10911660	10913660	I was gonna talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing
10913660	10915660	This kinda sucks
10915660	10917660	Basically the exploit they used is they
10917660	10919660	Adjusted the lineup of batters
10919660	10921660	On the opposing team
10921660	10923660	And removed the best players
10923660	10925660	And so it made it a little bit easier to
10925660	10927660	Pitch a perfect game with
10927660	10929660	People that can't hit a ball
10929660	10931660	Or can't hit a ball as well as some of the other people
10931660	10933660	Apparently
10933660	10935660	Some people didn't do that
10935660	10937660	But
10937660	10939660	I guess a portion of the top
10939660	10941660	8 did
10941660	10943660	And that kinda sucks
10943660	10945660	Including one actually
10945660	10947660	Completely admitted to doing that and
10947660	10949660	They have evidence of that
10949660	10951660	2k came out and
10951660	10953660	Originally they were like oh well that's against the rules
10953660	10955660	And then they're like well
10955660	10957660	No it's not or well we
10957660	10959660	Stand by you know
10959660	10961660	The people that we chose as the top 8
10963660	10965660	So they're just kinda rolling with it
10965660	10967660	And I mean if you think about it
10967660	10969660	They fucked up and they didn't program
10969660	10971660	This exclusive mode
10971660	10973660	For this the perfect pitch mode or whatever
10973660	10975660	Perfect game challenge
10975660	10977660	They fucked it up
10977660	10979660	And unfortunately
10979660	10981660	I guess they'll just next year
10981660	10983660	Patch that out but
10983660	10985660	It is unfortunate that they don't just
10985660	10987660	Start the whole thing over again
10987660	10989660	But that's the way that is
10991660	10993660	Alright
10993660	10995660	Any last minute stories? Sorry I'm not totally paying
10995660	10997660	I'm trying to collect the vog stuff
10997660	10999660	Alright guys we're gonna close it up
10999660	11001660	The contest here we go
11001660	11003660	I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read DarkSakura
11003660	11005660	And Loki these answers here you tell me which ones your favorite
11005660	11007660	I'm not gonna tell you who said it okay so here it is
11007660	11009660	And we'll pick a winner from this so reasons you love
11009660	11011660	VOG here we go I love
11011660	11013660	VOG because it supports and promotes the
11013660	11015660	Indie side of gaming music and geekdom
11015660	11017660	Because listening to
11017660	11019660	VOG at work makes my day enjoyable
11019660	11021660	Because we can chant VOG at
11021660	11023660	Wrestling events V-O-G
11023660	11025660	V-O-G
11025660	11027660	I love VOG because it's got a host who asks Jiggly
11027660	11029660	Kayente a question on the reunion of Drag Race
11029660	11031660	I love VOG because
11031660	11033660	I want that stupid Sonic hoodie for
11033660	11035660	Name Redacted because he would be so excited
11035660	11037660	And that would keep him quiet for the whole night
11037660	11039660	I love VOG because
11039660	11041660	Every gamer has a voice
11041660	11043660	OLR is a great reason I love VOG
11043660	11045660	Reason I love VOG
11045660	11047660	OLR is on it duh
11047660	11049660	I love VOG because I can make the initials mean
11049660	11051660	Dumb stuff
11051660	11053660	VOG is the only live podcast network I listen
11053660	11055660	To often and look forward to the
11055660	11057660	Bobby Blackwell Show and Orange Lounge Radio every week
11059660	11061660	It's a tough one
11061660	11063660	What do you guys think? You like the very first one?
11063660	11065660	I love VOG because it
11065660	11067660	Supports and promotes the Indie side of gaming music
11067660	11069660	And geekdom
11069660	11071660	I could go with that alright congratulations
11071660	11073660	SSJ100 Matt the code's yours
11073660	11075660	Good job
11075660	11077660	A winner is you
11077660	11079660	SSJ100 Matt I'll email that to you later
11079660	11081660	Alright good answers though
11081660	11083660	Thank you for playing
11083660	11085660	I bet one of those was Shane
11085660	11087660	Yes the Shane was the one with the Name Redacted
11087660	11089660	Because this sounded like
11089660	11091660	Something you would say
11091660	11093660	I would have picked the Jiggly Kayente one personally
11093660	11095660	But sorry I should have stated you'd have to woo the other host over too
11095660	11097660	Alright
11097660	11099660	Alright
11099660	11101660	So congratulations again SSJ100
11101660	11103660	Matt the code is yours
11103660	11105660	And honestly if I had not been aware of
11105660	11107660	RuPaul's Drag Race Jiggly
11107660	11109660	Kayante sounds like a flavor of a Jello
11109660	11111660	Jiggler
11111660	11113660	Alright
