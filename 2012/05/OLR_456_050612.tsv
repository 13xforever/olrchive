14143	23756	Tonight, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is a reality, and we talk to video game hip-hop artist MegaRan.
31584	37489	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37689	39550	Orange Lounge Radio.
39630	41192	We are live with episode number 456.
41292	43613	Yes, that's 456 of our show on this May the 6th.
48177	49879	That's 5-6, 2012.
50980	56706	A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show.
57126	62912	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.
63233	66276	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66656	73801	To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Men, to paraphrase I should say, but money isn't dead, but money is life!
74321	75442	Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Men?
75702	77343	He was the leader of the Disco Boys?
77663	79024	That was Eddie Izzard?
79185	82767	I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for that movie when I saw it.
82787	83607	That movie was great.
83628	86089	It was okay, but I saw it so long ago.
86109	88010	Avengers, Avengers, Avengers.
88231	91493	The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only Techmaster Loki!
91713	92994	I have also not seen the Avengers.
93294	93834	You both are lame.
111403	111603	Snake360Dude
133261	134563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
153459	153739	Yeah.
154219	156882	I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of, and he was on the show.
156902	161507	But I wasn't taking the interview because he did, you know, was he plugging the new game?
161848	165231	Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview.
165251	166393	Speaking of which, where is the new game?
167133	167574	Where is it?
167634	170157	He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on.
170197	170797	And you know what?
171218	172119	Beggars can't be choosers.
172860	173580	Let him take his time.
174421	180287	All right, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like, hey, guys, who do you want us to interview on the show?
180387	181188	Like, within reason.
181288	183690	You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-Aim√©, okay?
183990	186453	We're not, you know, a television network or something.
186473	187654	We're not going to get, you know, those folks.
187994	193540	And so we kind of fielded some of the responses, and one idea that I really liked was getting
194000	196182	I got a chick, I thought I was in love before, but I
220320	224363	That song is called Splash Woman, and you can hear it in the background, like that riff.
224563	230046	And then he has some verses that he's laying down about Splash Woman, or his Splash Woman.
230186	231347	It's brilliant.
231407	231727	I love it.
235240	236361	Anyway, I can't play the whole thing.
236401	240323	I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing there or iTunes or whatever.
240363	242744	But that's one of his bigger well-known songs, Splash Woman.
242844	243564	That was amazing.
243704	246806	Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got to do more.
246886	247746	So he's got like a Mega Man 9.
248086	248686	He's got a Mega Man 10.
248947	250968	And we're going to ask him about some of his other projects.
250988	252068	He's not just a Capcom guy.
252088	252948	He's got Final Fantasy.
252968	256130	We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact.
256150	260192	So if you're a Mega Man fan who saw the shout-out on Twitter and all that, who's waiting for him to come on the show...
261513	264136	6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here.
264216	266639	But join our chat room because we are a live show.
267640	270283	Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview.
270703	274808	And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com.
274828	276950	Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts.
276970	280514	But when we get going, when we get random on the phone, you can ask those questions.
281115	289780	All right, anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
290180	293942	Hope you'll join us live sometime, even if you missed our action-packed show tonight.
294583	308471	Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually like to kind of have a kickoff topic, and we kind of got into it a little bit already, but everybody's talking about, everybody, everybody in the geek world is talking about the Avengers.
310134	311836	DarkSakura, I know you were there.
312056	313337	I know you went and saw the Avengers movie.
314258	315138	You're a comic fan.
315199	316039	You're a Marvel fan.
316199	316620	And Joss.
317941	318141	What?
318241	319082	And Joss Whedon.
319242	320123	You're a Joss Whedon fan.
320483	321664	How was the Avengers movie?
322245	322705	Oh my God.
324907	326408	It was beautiful.
326589	329491	And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today.
330612	331333	I've had allergies.
332501	335143	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
355477	357038	But, I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass.
357078	357698	I mean, please.
359578	361599	I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me.
361899	362159	Anyway.
362960	363760	In full 3D.
364540	368441	Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie.
368621	368881	Alright.
369802	370562	I have a new ship.
372333	393693	I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because oh my god aren't there I know I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites but I think I read something about because you know I read all that trash I think I read something something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson they've been flirty like there's pictures of them on the red carpet flirty so hmm
394321	394841	You know what?
395382	396382	They're pretty.
396662	400585	I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett Johansson, so you know.
402726	406348	And it's all because of him is the whole reason I went to see that Mission Impossible movie.
406368	407589	Him and Simon Pegg, because hello.
409050	415994	So yeah, I can say, first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss death.
416054	416934	I will not tell you who.
417615	419155	And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye.
419936	420056	No.
420076	420116	No.
421828	426593	I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man!
427314	428375	Like I did with Wash.
428996	429356	Okay.
430958	431839	And stay during the credits.
432256	433777	Yes, oh my god.
433797	435918	What was that meme you showed me earlier?
436279	439841	One does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits.
440001	456892	Exactly, because now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the, because you know there's that lovely designed bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who was in it, who were in it, sorry, and then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil, but if nobody gets it, please ask me.
456933	461536	I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants.
462416	466099	And then... By the very end of the movie.
466180	469603	And really listen very carefully to the dialogue right before the credits.
469783	470663	That's all I'm having to say.
471104	471965	TigerClaw in our chat.
472345	473346	Chatters, don't spoil.
473366	475107	If you spoil, you're getting kicked.
475147	477510	Take your spoiling to the private messages.
477570	479611	Take your spoiling to the private messages.
479691	481653	Just double-click on somebody's name and you can private message them.
482374	484736	And you can talk... Double-click on DarkSakura.
484956	486938	I will gush to you while you're in the show, okay?
487118	487719	Talk to her.
488259	488499	But...
489540	494786	I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly.
494886	497268	Let's go to the chat room real quick at vognetwork.com.
497568	499811	Tiger Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner.
500031	501332	He's taken over the Bourne movies.
501713	505016	The Matt Damon Bourne Conspiracy, all that stuff.
505056	506878	Those Bourne movies are pretty awesome, actually.
507258	508039	I'm excited about that.
508099	508720	I'm glad you think so.
509981	511383	He's better than Matt Damon.
511423	512163	I mean, come on.
512223	514025	It's Matt Damon.
514105	515607	I just didn't care about the Bourne movies.
515747	518049	SSJ100Matt says, I give it to Joss Whedon.
518109	519971	He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts.
520011	520792	I think there were a lot of people.
521092	521612	Did you hear this?
522093	533664	Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter, you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but 200 million plus for the Avengers this weekend.
534165	534345	Mm-mm.
535346	555702	and this is the other real telling thing I thought Hunger Games beat that no, no, Hunger Games didn't beat it either I mean Hunger Games was huge but didn't beat it A plus CinemaScore and CinemaScore, those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie I actually polled for them once they were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was but they polled me on it
556162	560343	and they actually take, you know, they grade it A plus rating from CinemaScore.
561383	566264	That's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, hey, this movie doesn't suck.
566324	566844	Go see it.
567345	573826	And going to some other chats, Panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right, in the VOG Network chat room said, Avengers did something amazing.
573906	577627	It combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it.
578379	580520	because hello, who else could do that but the Joss?
580820	581220	I'm sorry.
582000	588522	So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, everybody was characterized perfectly.
589282	591463	The interaction was perfect.
592183	602706	And for those of you who read Ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first, it really does seem like it's based a bit more off of Ultimates with a good splash of 616 Universe in it.
604106	607170	So yeah, it's really good.
607310	609893	And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks.
611474	613036	Although I'd pay to see that, that's for sure.
613056	617261	I would pay for that Star Wars slash Avengers movie.
617301	624368	I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is, and it's not a spoiler, because they did the first half of it in the trailer.
625009	630730	is this whole scene where Iron Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing the party to you.
631070	637092	Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on her face saying, I don't see how this is a party.
637892	639672	That's the best line in the whole movie.
639852	642173	All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.
642533	645753	It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day.
645793	647634	And there was an Avengers video game.
648474	651217	Well, actually, I was going to ask, where is the video game?
651417	652038	It is coming.
652198	655000	Strike while the iron is hot.
655100	658844	I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always... Rush the game out?
659384	660566	Okay, that's perfect.
660606	661627	Let's have a sub-party.
661647	664830	Well, if you'd planned better, it would have been out for the movie.
665650	670195	I want them to do something like Ultimate Alliance, honestly, because that was both...
670815	673257	The second one did the whole Civil War thing and it was kind of crap.
673698	676280	But the first one, I love the gameplay in both of the games.
676320	677261	They were just fantastic.
677341	682545	I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in Ultimate Alliance style.
683004	684285	All right, so going to our chat room.
684565	685326	There is a hater.
685726	687307	We do have a hater in the chat room.
687527	689929	You know, every big fandom is going to have its haters.
690409	693291	Ranma's in the chat room saying, Fuck Joss Whedon.
693431	695812	James Cameron will come back strong with Avatar 2.
695872	699214	Yeah, because he came out strong with Avatar 1.
699535	701016	That was some cheesy piece of shit.
701876	702617	Okay, look, Loki.
702697	702957	Okay.
703137	710305	Yeah, because everybody bought into, oh my god, I have to see this in 3D, my eyes will be blown out of my head.
710825	713028	It was just such a terrible story.
713168	714329	It wasn't bad.
714489	715370	It was terrible.
715390	719494	It's one of those movies people don't want to admit they like, just like Titanic.
719755	720816	Guys, may I please?
721537	721617	No.
722077	725519	Don't worry about rip-offs and who's going to come out on top.
725979	730762	There hasn't been a real original idea since the 60s maybe.
731622	732983	They're all going to take your money.
733203	733704	Let's be real.
734044	738386	One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative.
739026	740547	Deal the fuck with it.
740627	742328	They're going to make Titanic more 3D.
742388	743409	It's what's going to happen.
744594	745195	Deal with it.
746177	746939	Falling sunglasses.
747240	754775	Technus in our chatroom says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good.
754895	755376	What do you think?
755791	756111	Agreed.
756792	764676	And honestly, given the big preview of the next movie, Joss has to do it.
764816	771119	There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and please forgive me for saying this, Chris Claremont.
771459	773000	Please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers.
773240	773780	No!
774401	776822	They'll just have Treyarch do it, and then they'll add zombies.
777645	788752	I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that, and yeah, he did kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont was the man.
789092	790753	He's the one who gave us Dark Phoenix.
791273	799458	He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel bin and made it the top A player it is now, so...
800426	806012	I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward to a lot.
806092	809336	The Avengers, I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but I'm into it.
809376	810537	I like the Iron Man movie.
810557	811458	It was good, and all the movies were good.
811758	812279	I'll go see it.
812319	813680	I just don't want to see it opening weekend.
813700	815262	I knew the crowds were going to be insane.
815402	819346	One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget, Joss Whedon also wrote comics.
819386	821388	He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out.
822049	824431	but there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to.
824631	827493	One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care.
828393	830215	I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week.
830315	830895	I want to see it.
830995	833657	And I know people are like, it looks stupid.
835218	839461	The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival.
839821	841682	But that's what made it awesome.
841822	849788	I'm a little worried because I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot but if they did it right, it's going to be a fun time.
849828	851469	So I'm looking forward to that cautiously.
852229	854711	and Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw-free goddess.
855611	856972	Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw-free goddess.
856992	857772	Helena Bonham Carter.
858433	859553	Also a flaw-free goddess.
859593	861895	Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about.
861975	862515	I know, right?
862575	863596	With Michelle Pfeiffer.
863736	864236	Amazing.
864676	865717	I'll see anything with her in it.
865737	867218	I have that on HD DVD.
867418	874202	I sat through an Oprah Book of the Month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer because I love her that much.
875202	897007	and hello the best the only Catwoman which leads me to I am still excited a lot about this Batman movie really really excited about the third Batman movie you know I'm kind of two thoughts about that one but you know what preview I saw that I will be there to see because I love the original so much Frank and Weenie
898510	899432	I'm serious.
900174	901357	That looks adorable.
901417	903482	And I freaking love Frank and Weenie, so shut up.
904103	904524	Don't judge.
904624	905366	I see you judging.
905426	906148	I'm judging a little bit.
906388	906890	Stop judging me.
908697	914921	Video games, as much as we love to talk movies and all that It's all about the Tron series starting in June Tron!
915161	933595	We can all agree on that, Tron is king, yes Disney XD, I am there Finally, OLR Avengers assemble, Tron OLRians assemble Thank god we agree on something As long as I get to be Hawkeye There's no Hawkeye in Tron, you fool
934675	937579	This should be Hawkeye and Tron.
937719	938920	Oh, I have to say, I have to say.
939741	941823	Hurry up, we gotta get to games.
941943	944506	You know why there were all these Disney trailers before?
944826	947870	There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel.
948551	954217	But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers, Duntron style.
955077	955678	Yes, I saw that.
955698	956278	It was amazing.
956378	958119	Yeah, they were epic.
958399	959500	I loved them as Marvel.
959540	960660	But anyway, okay.
960780	962541	All right, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
962561	964162	Join us in our chat, vognetwork.com.
964482	966003	Yeah, the Spider-Man trailer was good.
966063	967264	Okay, games, games, games.
967384	968184	Games hat.
968364	969225	How was your gaming week?
969365	970605	What kinds of games did you play this week?
970625	975928	I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet has been crap all week.
976088	977489	And it's the last week before finals.
978109	980150	I've also had a crap ton of design work to do.
980590	983232	So Mass Effect came out of the box.
983792	984492	Oh my gosh.
984512	985973	It didn't get played, but it got opened.
987573	988153	You tease.
988593	989033	I know.
990134	991814	And yes, Frankenweenie, really.
991934	992814	Frankenweenie's awesome.
992834	993194	Shut up.
993775	994295	Zombie dogs.
994655	994915	Anyway.
997576	1004737	I actually did play through some Portal 2, and I played a little bit of WoW, but like, okay, this is what was so stupid.
1005838	1006158	Alright.
1006778	1010559	I get in queue, and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me
1012301	1013262	Fart, angry farts.
1013762	1014022	Okay.
1015022	1018264	I was trying to play WoW, and I was in queue.
1019004	1022947	And then I didn't realize how close I was to a level, so I did a cooking daily.
1023347	1024607	Level, got kicked out of queue.
1025488	1025988	Oh, shoot.
1026909	1029110	At 13 minutes of waiting in queue, so I get kicked out.
1029350	1029650	Whatever.
1030190	1033052	So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily.
1033812	1054363	um so then I get back in another queue and we all get in everything's happy we're in there yay queue and then oh I'm gonna leave log off fine offline what everybody leaves the party as soon as I get my quest I'm like all of you suck and I just logged off for the day dying 100 fires
1056081	1058643	Make the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.
1058663	1065947	And you didn't even get... Here I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and your anger rant about Children's Week.
1066587	1069209	And speaking of things... I'm saving that for the FUs of the week.
1070469	1074972	Because I cannot get my Drake this year because of Children's Week.
1075933	1076313	Whores.
1077938	1079079	She just wanted her virtual pony.
1079099	1081940	Is this like bring your child to your virtual world day?
1081960	1089725	No, it's bring your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little five-year-old wander behind you while you're in the firelands.
1090045	1090445	She's right.
1090725	1091225	It's exactly like that.
1091245	1091706	That's what it is.
1093066	1095448	It's like I was telling... That seems very unsafe.
1096568	1101151	I was telling Becky, and Becky doesn't, she's not really into WoW, she doesn't play it, nothing of that.
1101211	1103832	I was telling her about Children's Week and her reply was, oh my god.
1105473	1122462	that's fucked up and it's the best place to when you have to do the five dailies thing the fastest place to get it done is Firelands if you're 85 so just run them through oh this thing is setting you on fire oh you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going this is cool
1123928	1126068	And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement.
1126369	1126929	Yes, you do.
1127489	1128549	Called bad example.
1128829	1129529	Yes, you do.
1129589	1130189	That was great.
1130489	1134210	And then you give them a gun and a kite.
1135390	1139451	I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday, actually.
1139511	1140231	It's kind of disturbing.
1140251	1144692	And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron.
1144732	1145692	She has to deal with you now.
1145732	1146533	You're not my problem.
1146553	1148993	So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem.
1149073	1151914	Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe?
1152314	1153194	Or is it just like...
1153334	1153834	Thanks for watching!
1175022	1175843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1199390	1201874	Zeba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for DarkSakura.
1202335	1203456	Just stop playing WoW then.
1203817	1204218	Shut up.
1204818	1206561	Picaruna wants me to be on Horde House, Rob.
1206741	1207402	We can arrange that.
1207583	1208524	You should come back on Horde House.
1208985	1209606	I love it.
1211148	1214092	HordeHouse.com is the spinoff show all about Warcraft.
1215053	1217355	Other games, Loki, I know you got something else to talk about.
1218135	1237308	Yeah, I don't play a while, so I play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and honestly, that's all I really played this week because I only played it at work, and the rest of the time I've been working on my Portal 2 papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, about 99% done with the body of the portal turret.
1237808	1242771	Did you see that amazing Portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a cake falling through a portal?
1242832	1243812	It was on my Tumblr.
1243832	1244052	Yeah.
1244072	1244373	Oh, yeah.
1244413	1244793	You gotta see it.
1244973	1245653	It's great.
1245994	1247375	I'll find it and link my Tumblr.
1247415	1248675	Everyone should be looking at my Tumblr.
1249076	1250136	It's Kuro Tsubasa.
1250977	1259803	You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guest Omega Ran and the Fugo question we're gonna get into is, you know, creating art inspired by video games.
1260283	1267068	What is it about, and you're basically making art based on Portal 2, granted it might be on a template that's already out there or whatever with your own flair,
1267768	1272412	What is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real world?
1272613	1273413	Because they're funny.
1273513	1275135	They're funny little things.
1275195	1277597	And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some.
1278778	1281661	And I don't count the stuffed ones because they look stupid.
1281701	1292211	But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA, for example, made a full-size portal turret that talked in like, you know, shot airsoft BBs or something like that, I would probably buy two or three.
1293031	1295332	Um, but I don't know.
1295352	1299113	I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it because it was a cheap project.
1299793	1303434	Um, although now that I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want to look a little bit better.
1303494	1313017	So now I have to use Bondo and Plex, or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a load of fun, except it's not.
1313417	1317118	Um, so I, I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.
1317418	1317938	Uh, we'll see.
1318578	1320499	But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now.
1321897	1327698	I did a Portal Tour in Maya as one of my final projects.
1328358	1329399	Yeah, I remember seeing that.
1330219	1332519	I don't know.
1332699	1333339	It was just fun.
1334219	1335080	So, that's what I did.
1335320	1343021	I've been looking at getting Portal 2 for... Redeeming my copy of Portal 2 on Steam that I have for my PS3.
1343821	1346282	I still have to do that or look at it or whatever.
1346802	1348322	I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever.
1348402	1349563	I mean, it's so cheap now.
1349603	1351483	I'm sure I can get it for a few bucks.
1351963	1356566	and then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too because of all the cool mods that they have.
1356846	1362070	Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation 3 just because I'm missing out on all these darn mods.
1362630	1369275	I thought Sony said they were... Maybe I was just hallucinating but I thought Sony said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation 3.
1370756	1374118	Well, what did they ever do with the Steam stuff for Portal 2?
1374218	1374558	Nothing.
1374639	1376720	I mean, it's... I don't know.
1378460	1379901	I may do that.
1380902	1385044	I guess I played a little bit of the Perfect Strangers advergame thing.
1385164	1385964	That was kind of fun.
1386825	1399032	Actually, I played it a few times because I liked reading the dream board that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and stuff of that nature.
1399452	1400432	It was kind of funny.
1402788	1404689	Yeah, that's pretty much all I played.
1407070	1408691	That's pretty much it.
1408751	1410892	I did want to play some Skyrim this week.
1411552	1417335	I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I dive back in, that's going to be another three months of my life.
1418536	1424178	Well, it's going to be more than three months, because by the time I get to about three months, they'll release the expansion.
1424238	1425059	It's just...
1425979	1426780	Just over from there.
1426800	1429002	That's why I was like, oh, no, Skyrim Online.
1429082	1430043	Or not Skyrim Online.
1430063	1430944	The Elder Scrolls Online.
1430984	1432685	I'm like, ah, crap.
1433186	1434687	I'm going to have to play this, aren't I?
1435227	1440012	And then I started reading up on it, and I was like, well, maybe not.
1441989	1442329	All right.
1443609	1444270	My Gaming Week.
1445290	1446830	Not a lot of new stuff.
1446870	1447390	Mass Effect.
1447931	1449371	Yes, I played a lot of Mass Effect.
1449391	1450311	Let's get that out of the way.
1450931	1452652	Mass Effect 3, I'm playing more.
1453112	1455633	Lots of side missions, working on the main missions.
1455673	1460034	I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys.
1460554	1464475	I'll just say something involving the Citadel happened, and it was pretty awesome.
1465536	1467377	and then multiplayer.
1467577	1469279	That's the thing that gets me.
1469779	1473943	I am really into multiplayer in this game which you guys have to understand.
1474823	1485092	I don't really play a lot of Xbox Live games online especially things that are kind of like shooters although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter but it's a shooter.
1485112	1486974	It's like a shooter RPG hybrid.
1486994	1489436	It's more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG.
1489716	1500348	I guess, but my point is, I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox Live outside of arcade games and music games, like Rock Band, that I've played online that I truly enjoyed.
1500668	1502510	Like, one of the last ones is like Halo 2.
1503271	1504553	You wanna go back that far.
1504833	1532292	with your pink guy but I love Mass Effect 3 online and I think a big part of that and the community is great sometimes I hear random people yelling at people across the room in their own house but you don't hear the same stuff like FU and the racial slurs and the sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated with Xbox Live I don't hear it in Mass Effect 3
1532992	1533453	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1548510	1554893	But anyway, yeah, the fact that it's co-op, I think really leads to a different kind of community for the game.
1554933	1557233	And, you know, I'm sure it's not perfect.
1557434	1560635	Every community has their, you know, dumbasses.
1561035	1564576	But this game's pretty awesome so far from my experience.
1564596	1567678	And I'm motivated to continue to play it online.
1567978	1573460	I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits and doing all that stuff.
1573520	1576021	So, yeah, Mass Effect, good times.
1577001	1603369	So Mass Effect 3 gets a big endorsement from me I haven't gotten to that ending yet I still am not spoiled on the ending yet I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it But let me tell you what I've been on this Mass Effect bandwagon I just started back in February And I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect 1 40 hours of Mass Effect 2 Maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect 3 That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played
1603889	1610571	The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob what was a great experience.
1611532	1629397	I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up, or kind of say, that was shitty, or compare it to the ending of The Sopranos, which wasn't that great either, but I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of Mass Effect 3, it's so terrible, and the ending just ruined it for me.
1630098	1630258	So...
1631258	1632399	I'm going to our chatroom at chat.
1632879	1633980	Excuse me, I almost said the old one.
1634280	1636462	Going to vognetwork.com.
1637122	1639724	TigerClaw says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kaden.
1640064	1647629	Technus says, Mass Effect 2 was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect game, but the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is.
1648190	1653193	However, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat so I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side.
1653433	1677070	Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect 3 All that crap, out of the way All that crap, out of the way So, alright, one other game MegaRan's coming on in just a minute, we gotta call him But I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week A new game, Fez, on Xbox Live Arcade Because everybody's telling me Rob, this is like an 8-bit looking game with great music It's a puzzler, it is right up your fucking alley Go play this game
1677290	1678050	You play Fez now?
1678230	1678810	Fez is cool?
1679231	1679811	Fez is cool.
1679911	1680291	I like it.
1680311	1681211	Sorry, Doctor Who reference.
1681391	1682111	Oh, I see.
1682932	1683472	Well, whatever.
1683572	1687293	Doctor Who reference or not, it's a pretty fun game.
1688113	1693915	Quickly, the concept, it's the 2D world that you're in getting turned into a 3D world.
1694095	1703157	So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2D scroller is suddenly like has four different sides because you don't really go up or down.
1703197	1704717	So it's just like the four sides of a cube.
1705278	1705798	And, you know...
1706718	1707938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1735669	1738231	How to unlock an antecube is in one of the achievements.
1738651	1739812	Minor spoiler, but whatever.
1740272	1741033	It's a gamer tip.
1741393	1741773	Take that.
1743314	1744255	So a lot of depth to it.
1744275	1745496	And I thought I saw Picaruno.
1745516	1751660	Somebody in our chat said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight because I was trying to get one of those freaking cubes in Fez to unlock.
1752061	1758065	So apparently it's like Castlevania Symphony of the Night where there's a pretty easy game in the beginning.
1758525	1760587	And then just when you thought you beat it,
1761147	1764210	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1779306	1780927	Video game, hip-hop artist.
1781027	1782287	He goes by Random as well.
1782427	1784709	I like Mega Ran because, you know, Mega Man and all that stuff.
1784729	1787010	And obviously, that was a lot of what he became famous for.
1787410	1788850	But Airman can't be beaten.
1790211	1793132	But yeah, you know, we played a clip from Splash Woman earlier.
1793152	1795674	We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview.
1796034	1798615	Just a talented guy, really into the art.
1798695	1799815	And he, you know, he's made it.
1799915	1805098	Like Bobby joked on his show earlier, he got on SportsCenter with a rap about Jeremy Lin.
1805118	1807539	So it's not just restricted music.
1807799	1808659	to video games.
1809019	1813200	So, and I understand, even better, this guy is a teacher during the day.
1813260	1818381	He's a teacher IRL, as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side.
1818721	1824702	So I want to talk to him about his art, and I want to open it up to you guys for your questions on vognetwork.com.
1824742	1826822	So let's get random on the show right now.
1826862	1828703	I've punched in his number, and we're giving him a call.
1829063	1831603	It is live radio, folks.
1832163	1837084	Anything can happen, just like the phone getting forwarded to an automatic voicemail.
1837544	1853122	let's try it one more time maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick it is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail let's try it one more time here
1856966	1860068	Oh, boy.
1861829	1866092	I think he might be on the other line or something right now.
1866172	1866773	So, all right.
1866813	1867233	That's all right.
1867293	1868534	These things happen in live radio.
1868895	1871517	We'll try him again in about three minutes.
1871857	1876280	So, if you're a friend of Mega's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to get through.
1876861	1877141	All right.
1877841	1880663	Meanwhile, let's go to our first news story tonight.
1881084	1883426	Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to Mega, okay?
1883766	1884406	That's fine.
1885467	1887389	Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls Online.
1888009	1893554	It's being developed by ZeniMax Online, not necessarily Bethesda, but it's owned by the same company.
1894275	1898198	And it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series.
1898679	1906546	It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with some of the places being locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on.
1907166	1914588	But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh, elsewhere and that kind of stuff.
1914608	1926110	Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like, the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of the game.
1926430	1928071	At least some of the screenshots, uh...
1929231	1934313	One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third-person perspective.
1934393	1951500	Now, I know that's an option in the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third-person perspective, but I really like the first-person aspect of it, and I understand that the reason that they wanted to go that route is because it'd be less of a learning curve for people that are from other MMOs.
1952020	1956522	But the problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to World of Warcraft, and that's kind of...
1957922	1958522	Star Wars The Old Republic
1973087	1975048	Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine.
1975068	1975909	I mean, it's weird.
1995840	1996501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2017555	2024440	Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is 35 after right now, and it is live radio, and he could be anywhere right now.
2024520	2029644	He could be in the basement writing his next hit, and the cell signal might not be catching.
2029684	2031805	So let's see if maybe he's come to the surface.
2031825	2034067	I'm going to try to get through again real quick here.
2035828	2037169	Oh boy, that's really not good.
2037269	2037650	All right.
2039631	2041873	Let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that.
2042573	2051275	Alright, and then, let's see, they also, you know, they're showing off some of the different kind of artwork for the game.
2051295	2056636	A lot of it's still very early, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game.
2056836	2060737	I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing.
2061177	2065138	But then again, I guess I got used to it with Final Fantasy XI and that kind of stuff.
2066098	2093817	and then some other stuff not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online but Skyrim one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard well that's been officially announced now that Dawnguard will be the first expansion to Skyrim and it will be coming out this summer and of course being talked about during E3 and the rumors of course that it's going to feature
2097699	2102082	and some other types of characters and races and stuff in there.
2102483	2104164	So, very interesting.
2105324	2117733	Might even be cool if they have some of the... Because remember when they had this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit for Skyrim.
2118453	2118653	Go!
2119074	2127687	And then they had spear throwing and I want to say that the kill cameras for magic and stuff like that came out of that.
2128408	2128528	And...
2130920	2133642	I'm pretty sure Crossbows probably will come out of that as well.
2134142	2137544	So it would be neat to see some more of that stuff in there.
2137564	2142546	I mean, they seem pretty creative, so I'm looking forward to that.
2143327	2151111	And of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but the Kinect update finally came out now for the Xbox 360, and they have 200 voice commands added.
2153132	2153892	added in there as well.
2154372	2158133	Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC.
2158633	2162334	That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming Fus Ro Dah!
2162695	2164895	Apparently there's already mods available.
2165615	2169696	And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those voice mods to work.
2169736	2172617	You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange.
2173377	2174558	But, you know, whatever.
2174798	2175818	That's how they did it.
2179062	2180503	Alright, I'm going to try again here, guys.
2180543	2184346	Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right now.
2185027	2188289	Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen.
2189270	2190091	You know, it's live.
2190551	2191412	Anything can happen live.
2191872	2192733	Thanks for watching!
2209848	2210769	He's got a big project right.
2210789	2214412	He just did some Kickstarter thing that made a ton of money.
2215653	2223539	I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to do some voices for his project right now.
2223619	2225861	So I guess he's just a little busy right now.
2226462	2228323	So we will keep trying here.
2229384	2230184	in just a little bit.
2230645	2234447	But, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO.
2234507	2234727	I'm not.
2234747	2246713	It's just because, you know, I imagined, you know, okay, it's basically going to be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're going to have, you know, a lot of players running around, and it's going to be all the time in real life.
2246753	2252175	That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, the MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like.
2252315	2255577	And then it was like, okay, it's going to be a third-person perspective, and
2255837	2256477	Oh, that's all right.
2256797	2259758	Oh, that's going to have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs.
2260598	2261319	It's like crap.
2261659	2271442	So basically you're copycatting everything that other MMOs are doing because you want to draw more people to it so that they're not afraid of it.
2271682	2278744	Instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get the people that play your games normally...
2279804	2292347	to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot of people that play World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with, oh, it's first-person perspective.
2292407	2293367	That's a little bit fresh.
2293447	2294828	It's a little different of an idea.
2295948	2300189	Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, oh, dead.
2300769	2302070	All right, go, next game.
2302130	2304030	Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead.
2304130	2306011	Okay, I mean, it just sounds really boring.
2306271	2306971	That's why I don't play MMOs.
2309215	2312197	Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right?
2312417	2316940	That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action, it's hard to judge it, right?
2318221	2322004	I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right?
2322984	2330549	Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now.
2330569	2331230	Right.
2331250	2331410	Right.
2332389	2333810	Okay, all right.
2334070	2336212	Well, I guess let's try Mega again.
2336292	2337153	It's been 10 minutes.
2338214	2342197	Unfortunately, it's deducting money from the Skype thing every time I try.
2342277	2347241	I can't afford too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything I can.
2347921	2353247	I'm going to feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's try it right now.
2353287	2355049	We're going to try one more time to get through here.
2355529	2356650	After all, it is live radio.
2356991	2357591	Yeah.
2357631	2358512	Oh, it's been forwarded.
2358672	2359393	Oh my gosh.
2359413	2360294	Is the phone even on?
2360915	2362356	Mega's phone may just not be on.
2362416	2363497	Maybe he was trying to nap.
2363978	2367902	He's just so tired that the darn phone isn't even on.
2367922	2369484	I think I'm going to send a tweet.
2370104	2370845	I actually already did.
2371086	2372007	So we'll see.
2372367	2372888	I tweeted him.
2373008	2375231	So hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops.
2376192	2380717	Yeah, there's this one place in my house I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal.
2380817	2381658	And I was standing in it.
2381758	2383020	So there it is.
2383996	2386017	Well, we do have more stories.
2386137	2386577	That's right.
2386597	2388098	We do have some more stories we can go over.
2388158	2390760	So I think we'll go ahead and get to that.
2391460	2392781	DarkSakura, why don't you read one for us?
2393421	2393881	Sure.
2394322	2399365	How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie?
2400445	2402506	Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie.
2402546	2403726	They had somebody lined up.
2403766	2415929	They had one Carlos Fresnadillo, and he walked out saying that the video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating.
2416909	2425811	So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it, who wants to make it really scary, but the studio doesn't want to pay for it, really.
2426671	2428412	He wants to do a rated R version.
2428552	2430494	Not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less.
2431094	2434276	I mean, basically the quote was, the little sisters and injections and the whole thing.
2434436	2439620	I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later, you're still shivering and going, Jesus Christ.
2440239	2442961	I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that?
2442981	2449766	Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people.
2449806	2454330	And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this might be pushing it for some people.
2454370	2459134	We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's fine.
2460415	2462016	I mean, I would see it.
2462536	2467140	I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play it while he was playing it.
2467340	2467720	Right, right.
2468121	2468301	So...
2469642	2473464	Yeah, of course, I don't mind stuff like that.
2473504	2476786	I mean, it's not the human centipede, so that's good.
2477067	2479088	Oh my god, my friend is so excited about the third one.
2479952	2481273	Oh God, they're making a third one?
2481453	2482374	Yeah.
2482634	2485076	Speaking of movies that have no redeeming... 150 people.
2485736	2488138	Movies with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
2488158	2492822	She and her grandmother love the human centipede.
2493242	2497045	That's like the grandmas watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape.
2497065	2498366	You've met my friend Carly.
2498386	2498726	Yeah, yeah.
2498926	2499426	Yeah, it's her.
2500792	2501853	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2520609	2522370	I don't think that they're casting anybody from over here.
2522430	2523971	It's gonna be CG, you know that.
2525492	2526513	I don't think it will be.
2527093	2528955	But anyway, I would see this.
2528995	2529795	They don't have the budget for CG.
2529875	2534918	I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede movies.
2534938	2535379	Just saying.
2535979	2536539	Absolutely.
2536599	2541261	And then, seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's just a hundred person train?
2543081	2544002	I mean, seriously.
2544182	2545302	I think that's been done.
2545962	2548523	Actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway?
2549103	2551344	Was watching bad porn with, you know, a chain?
2551384	2551644	Perhaps.
2551864	2552284	Perhaps.
2552765	2553165	I don't know.
2553245	2553565	I don't know.
2554125	2554385	All right.
2554885	2555926	Here's what I'm going to do, guys.
2556006	2561307	Since it's 6.45 and it's 15 minutes after the time we scheduled MegaRan, I'm going to give it one more try.
2561367	2563548	But this will be the sixth try.
2563708	2569849	And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys because that's six times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through.
2569889	2575971	So let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about MegaRan and maybe he'll get through this time.
2576011	2578472	So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network.
2579732	2583793	I better, you know, I... Oh, that's killer.
2585447	2586148	That's killer.
2586188	2591015	I'm just gonna... I'm gonna do that whole, like, panicking thing, like, am I calling the right number?
2591976	2594279	Did I put the right number into Skype?
2594379	2597684	And it's da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
2597724	2599226	Yep, it's the same number, right?
2599246	2600247	That's the number.
2600267	2601589	Perhaps you should leave him a message.
2601769	2601950	You see...
2602330	2603110	Let's leave a message.
2603891	2608513	I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it here.
2608613	2616136	So why don't I go grab my cell phone I'm going to give MegaRan a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going to say call it whenever you're ready.
2616836	2617657	That's a great idea.
2617697	2620018	That way you MegaRan fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight.
2620338	2627101	So I'm going to go do that right now and I realize I owe you guys a story but maybe Loki will cover it for me.
2627141	2628602	I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers.
2629822	2634046	Loki, maybe you could cover the story for me, and I'm going to go give MegaRan a call on my personal line.
2634767	2635127	All right.
2635287	2639250	So you know how they have layaway and stuff like that?
2640732	2645176	Well, Microsoft kind of wants to do something similar to that for their Xbox 360.
2646357	2653563	There is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized Kinect bundle available starting next week.
2655234	2661080	and what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying like a cell phone or a cell phone plan.
2661100	2675313	You get the cell phone at a very big discount and then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly fees and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200 or one that normally costs about $600 or $700.
2679817	2680658	XBOX Live Gold Service
2698949	2713564	So, it would be a way to kind of get people in the door to buying a system and being able to play with it for a couple years without having to drop $400 right away.
2714064	2721051	Now, you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you bought it outright, but...
2721892	2723332	I think that's more of a convenience.
2723472	2727893	Because you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like that for a cell phone.
2727933	2729914	So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more.
2730834	2737356	About $460 after the end of the service agreement.
2738396	2743017	The good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems.
2743077	2745838	Because some of those old systems might not last two years.
2746518	2746658	But...
2748218	2749939	I don't know, it's an interesting idea.
2750480	2753262	It could work, especially if you get people to do it.
2753702	2758866	I'm just going to, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see how that works out.
2759126	2761107	You know, people paying $15 a month.
2761167	2762748	But I guess that's not too much.
2763089	2766211	I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches.
2766831	2772755	So if you can spare a couple lunches a month, I mean, you can be playing Xbox games for a couple years.
2773936	2774817	It's an idea, I guess.
2775993	2778053	Okay, I'm back from making that phone call.
2778093	2779614	So I'll let you guys know what happens.
2780154	2782094	I really apologize to the MegaRan fans.
2782174	2782954	These things happen.
2783034	2783735	It's live radio.
2784055	2787215	He legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now, just unplanned.
2787715	2793557	Haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at, and then suddenly, oh, no cell signal?
2793977	2794997	That could be happening with MegaRan.
2795017	2800278	I could have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you have to reboot it every once in a while because...
2800718	2801579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2830235	2844569	and so maybe he'll just pop up during the show so we'll see so we'll let you know all right anyhow back to the Xbox story and the $99 Xbox so I just want to point something out with this
2845618	2853001	When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year.
2853041	2863205	And if you forgot what that's all about because you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12-month agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo 3 for free.
2863645	2865966	And you get a mount and you get into the beta and all this stuff.
2867347	2867887	One little thing.
2868067	2868247	Yeah.
2868708	2870908	Finals week is not the best week to launch this game.
2871269	2871709	Okay, sorry.
2873087	2884950	I said, back when that happened, I said, hey, you know, it's just a matter of time before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone contract style agreements.
2885750	2888751	Now, granted, I didn't think about the system element.
2888871	2898413	I had thought, oh, well, sign up for two years of Xbox Live Gold and get free Halo maps or a free game or something like that, a giveaway and all this.
2899774	2900534	And here we are.
2901534	2906495	We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing now coming to consoles.
2907375	2908536	Let me take it a step further.
2910196	2913217	This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further.
2914117	2919498	We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out.
2919578	2925660	Not just the Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it, and the PlayStation 4, whatever they end up calling that.
2926670	2931191	These systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive as hell.
2932331	2938432	I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation 3 when it first rolled out.
2939673	2943553	Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price?
2944254	2944494	Yes.
2944914	2952075	And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation 4 for $199 with a two-year PlayStation Plus agreement.
2958840	2959781	You know what?
2960001	2968572	The thing is, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this, this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know...
2970353	2971174	XBOX Live Gold
2989417	2989717	DarkSakura.com
3009326	3009806	Think about it.
3009866	3013748	If you own an iPhone, and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else.
3014168	3020452	If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill that's basically the iPhone tax.
3020792	3021912	Yeah, and you know what?
3021932	3023353	I don't care because my phone is sexy.
3024011	3025272	Yeah, it's a hell of a phone.
3025332	3046150	And I have to say, for everyone who's saying Diablo 3 and WoW, to quote Voginator, kiss outside in any sense of social life goodbye, just saying, been playing WoW and Diablo 3 beta and the WoW beta and I work full time and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what?
3046231	3047612	I still go out for pink berry and get laid.
3050074	3050594	Just saying.
3050914	3051435	It's possible.
3054877	3055877	And I'm going to Disneyland.
3056537	3057198	So, just saying.
3057898	3059659	That was a great way to cap it all off, by the way.
3060099	3061320	Just saying.
3061380	3062020	It's possible.
3062180	3062921	Time management.
3062961	3063561	Learn those skills.
3066342	3067103	And you have this show.
3067723	3068584	And I have this show.
3068684	3069124	Yes, I do.
3069524	3073066	And potentially another little project with the lovely Sylve.
3074539	3077962	Don't bite off more than you can chew, but I do love me some still.
3078263	3082366	Alright, going to our chatroom at vognetwork.com That's right, Panaxium.
3082587	3083788	I am a time management pro.
3084668	3087371	Shadow Next Gen says the PlayStation 4 will not be $699.
3087851	3089773	I was just throwing it out there.
3089833	3090594	What is an iPhone?
3090694	3091354	A little iPhone.
3091855	3093876	What does the iPhone cost, unsubsidized?
3094764	3098426	If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost?
3099006	3106929	I'll tell you, because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up.
3107149	3106929	$699.
3107469	3118094	I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone, and it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone 4S, but an Android.
3118154	3119694	It was a Samsung Galaxy 2...
3121945	3133848	or Samsung Galaxy S2 or something like that and luckily I bought mine used so I got it for about $300 but I mean it's still fucking expensive
3135456	3143247	Alright, I'm looking through some more comments in our chatroom at vognetwork.com Let's see, RossDLUT says, of course the PlayStation 4 won't be $699.
3144869	3146050	Sony learned that mistake.
3146531	3148293	Think about what I'm saying though, RossDLUT.
3148674	3151878	Here's a way for them not to make that mistake, yet still charge that price.
3152919	3160947	It would all depend though, because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more than recouping $200 or $300.
3161067	3163509	It's recouping double that.
3163529	3165711	You're talking $50 a month payments.
3165951	3167533	That's still a little bit much.
3168714	3177202	WhatUpG in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Then again, they kept the Vita price at $249, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped the 3DS price.
3177790	3178370	That's a good point.
3178410	3182311	They released the Vita cheaper than a lot of people thought they would, and it sounded great.
3182471	3184512	And then, no, the DS is now cheaper.
3184572	3184872	I don't know.
3184952	3193274	It still wasn't that bad because they couldn't drop the price of the system anymore, but they added value to it by including a gig memory card.
3193734	3195274	The Vita's still a sexy piece of hardware.
3195294	3196595	I mean, 3DS is too.
3196615	3199975	I'm not knocking it, but the 3DS doesn't do Skype.
3200856	3203276	The Vita does the web a little better.
3203316	3205777	There's some things that the Vita does have on the 3DS right now.
3206397	3209778	Although I will say 3DS has some pretty must-have games right now.
3209798	3211259	I own them both.
3213880	3217302	Ross Steel UT in chat says, Sky, will the rent-to-own crowd be big enough?
3217442	3218162	I don't think so.
3218382	3219903	Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone.
3220463	3221763	iPhone's the biggest phone out there.
3221783	3226605	Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal.
3227366	3230927	And I bet Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation 4s sold as iPhones.
3231047	3231807	And what are iPhones?
3231907	3233188	They're subsidized by contract.
3234915	3245343	hmm it could happen all right anyhow moving on let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you
3246701	3247221	Starhawk
3275077	3277158	Wow, that's a pretty quick week.
3278599	3280581	What's the next big, big title coming out?
3281221	3282902	It'll be the week after Max Payne 3.
3283282	3284223	Oh yeah, that's right.
3284243	3285384	And Diablo 3.
3285464	3286164	Herp Derp Diablo 3.
3286224	3288666	Oh, you mean Max Payne 3, The Rise of Bruce Willis?
3288786	3295230	I always forget because with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually save the money to buy Diablo 3, which is kind of nice.
3295478	3300042	Well, then, you know, beyond that... There's another $15 a month thing I pay for.
3300082	3303565	Well, also, the Game of Thrones game is going to be coming out next week.
3303826	3305227	Well, the week after next as well.
3305947	3308870	One does not simply pre-order the Game of Thrones games.
3310171	3311052	It should be good.
3311092	3314595	I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books.
3314956	3316797	I mean, at least he wrote the story for it.
3317358	3319720	And it's got characters that aren't... It's kind of like the...
3323127	3326693	Enter the Matrix of the Game of Thrones series.
3326753	3332302	It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they're probably going to cross into the series.
3334085	3335247	So, I don't know.
3337532	3344194	All right, well, I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but like a lot of things on this show tonight, it just doesn't want to work, so maybe we can go to Europe real fast.
3344314	3347935	Well, maybe we can, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly.
3349215	3360698	On May 9th in the UK, we have Datura, which, I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes me think of all of the times I read Clan of the Cave Bear, because that's what they called, like, this one herb in it.
3360718	3361018	Anyway.
3362118	3366681	On the 11th, we have Starhawk and Street Fighter X Tekken for PC.
3367441	3368882	And then that's it for this week.
3370343	3376386	I mean, there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really it for this week.
3377187	3377707	Hey, great.
3377727	3379428	I've got Japanese release dates for you.
3379468	3382110	But remember that whole golden week we were talking about last week?
3382190	3382550	It's over.
3382961	3384122	Thanks for watching!
3400168	3401608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3423135	3426397	Yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are.
3426957	3428278	You get a chance to check that out in Japan.
3428979	3430259	That's it for Japanese releases.
3430740	3434302	Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
3436420	3436800	All right.
3437841	3440583	Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops.
3441183	3446247	And, you know, we talked about the rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that.
3446267	3447067	Apparently they were correct.
3447267	3448828	I honestly thought it was called Eclipse.
3448988	3451490	And actually it is technically called Eclipse.
3452271	3457514	That was the internal name for the game, as I found out.
3457914	3459896	So there's a little truth to that.
3460736	3478455	but yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th and of course on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC confirmed I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something like that but of course all that stuff will be announced later on
3478855	3479716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3499426	3500347	Unmanned Warfare
3515184	3517367	and so very interesting looking thing.
3517688	3531584	Some of the new stuff that they're going to be adding to the actual campaign of the game including some branching missions and these new type of missions called like
3532325	3559891	Strikeforce where it's almost like a little bit open world I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff where you kind of have a point A point B but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things so that sounds kind of interesting and then of course they're going to be adding the standard multiplayer stuff and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as well
3561191	3562352	I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it.
3562432	3564552	After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet.
3564913	3566873	So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up.
3566913	3571815	And actually, it kind of makes me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing that as well.
3572215	3576237	So you think that there's actually going to be money to make off of sales of the old copy then, huh?
3576990	3580575	Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game.
3581055	3588404	And then, of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 Day 1 pre-orders were actually higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 pre-orders.
3589024	3591327	So, you know, it's off to a good start.
3591968	3592488	Sounds that way.
3593149	3593990	Hey, guess what, guys?
3594030	3594891	I have some great news.
3595212	3596032	Guess who just called me?
3597168	3599190	Random, awesome.
3599270	3602213	So he said he apologizes.
3603053	3604134	This has happened to you, right?
3604515	3605255	The phone died.
3606917	3608138	So he had to go plug in.
3608578	3609739	But we're going to get him on now.
3609799	3611101	Thank you guys for being patient.
3611161	3613283	And those of you that left, well, tough cookies.
3613583	3616425	For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing.
3616445	3619388	You're going to hear Random or MegaRan right now.
3621630	3623312	Hey, is this MegaRan?
3624443	3625223	Yes, it is.
3625363	3625843	How are you?
3626163	3626764	What is up?
3626824	3630745	It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio here with DarkSakura and Loki.
3630845	3631325	How's it going?
3631465	3634546	The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live.
3635626	3636166	How you doing?
3636426	3637847	Sorry, I'm good.
3637867	3639407	I had an adventurous day.
3639527	3640347	Sorry I'm late.
3640527	3641028	Sorry.
3641528	3642108	That is okay.
3643502	3648865	That is A-OK, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity is when you're showing up fashionably late.
3660873	3661934	These things happen.
3661974	3663155	Don't even worry about it.
3663195	3663755	We're good.
3663896	3665317	I'm just happy that you're here on the air.
3665377	3672662	And hey, if you guys have a question for Ranma, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you can ask that question in chat right now.
3673122	3677125	But while you guys get those questions out there, I got some questions for Ranma that I want to ask.
3677705	3685050	Now, Ranma, some of our listeners here at Orange Launch Radio, they might be gamers, but they might not know about you.
3685391	3688713	So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated?
3690597	3701665	Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all of those things together.
3701785	3706308	You know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture and history.
3706528	3711832	And I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty cool music.
3712612	3714574	A lot of it is video game based.
3714594	3717596	What I do is I like to use the traditional...
3718231	3723553	Sounds from video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that.
3724574	3734998	And then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game, sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes.
3735919	3740441	And I put it all together and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Man.
3741144	3741644	That's awesome.
3741664	3750767	And if you want to check out the music, of course, you can visit Random or Megaran's website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for download.
3750787	3754128	And some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little bit.
3754268	3755909	So free is awesome.
3756069	3757129	Thank you for providing that.
3757609	3758129	I have a question.
3758149	3759790	Free is always good.
3761170	3761770	Yeah, DarkSakura.
3762231	3762831	What do you teach?
3764831	3766112	Oh, I taught middle school.
3766172	3769613	I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing.
3770565	3773768	and history, social studies, stuff like that to middle school kids.
3774048	3777070	You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects ever.
3778371	3781173	I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend.
3783475	3784575	Oh my, totally.
3785096	3788498	Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so.
3789179	3796724	Up until this past year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time and here I am.
3796744	3797465	So far I feel good.
3798120	3799061	That sounds awesome.
3799081	3805284	That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love because Ranma, I got to tell you, I'm a teacher too.
3805344	3806384	I'm a different type of teacher.
3806424	3807445	I'm a corporate trainer.
3807745	3810447	So I teach people in my company and that's my day job.
3810687	3815509	But I've had this podcast with my buddies for 10 years and I'd love to be able to quit.
3815830	3818891	As much as I love my day job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time.
3818931	3820412	But you're doing it.
3820492	3821913	You're living the dream and that's awesome.
3822816	3829620	Yeah, and I mean, I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do in teaching as well in music.
3829680	3831801	So there's always lessons and things.
3832742	3835763	I love history, I love poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff.
3836224	3839085	Some of my favorite books I will talk about and rap about them.
3839145	3845069	So it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it.
3845129	3846309	I was already doing what I loved.
3846890	3850872	It was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's all.
3852086	3852486	That's true.
3852506	3855648	Well, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that
3880797	3886661	I first decided, or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies 2.
3886701	3890004	That game was great.
3890524	3891304	It was a good game.
3891344	3892765	It had a really cool soundtrack.
3893426	3895127	And I had a Casio keyboard.
3895768	3901311	And that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay on my keyboard.
3901391	3902132	I still remember it.
3906335	3909277	But I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard.
3909893	3923916	and so not knowing when I'm 10, 11, 12 years old that I was actually making what is now considered to be fan art but it was just me playing it by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create.
3924076	3937258	I didn't necessarily do anything with that but that was the first time that I ever experienced video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want to try to create my own version of it.
3938209	3939170	Oh yeah, I really love that game.
3952884	3954605	Huge, plenty of hours of fun on that game
3982674	3988595	Well, Final Fantasy VII was a huge game for me.
3988775	3990515	I was pretty much out of gaming.
3990735	3996196	When it came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school.
3996256	3997677	I didn't have time for games anymore.
3998257	4005158	I didn't have a system until I watched one of my friends or suitemates play it, and I was completely hooked.
4005238	4011319	I saw some of the summons and just watched about an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined
4011912	4018556	roleplaying games to me because, you know, the 3D aspect and just the character development was just so awesome.
4019636	4024639	So I wound up, you know, getting the PlayStation, almost flunking out of school playing this game.
4025380	4028321	I mean, it's just something that completely enveloped me.
4028382	4037767	So it's a huge part of my childhood, you know, so that's what made me go back because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable to me.
4038604	4040664	that it changed the game to me.
4040684	4044625	You know, that was my introduction, well, kind of reintroduction to gaming.
4045245	4048886	And so that was the game that got me back into console gaming.
4048946	4050826	So I feel like I owe a lot to it.
4050926	4054507	So I decided to do a little homage to it called Black Materia.
4055167	4056428	Luckily, a lot of people liked it.
4056868	4060128	It came out last year and kind of took off a little bit.
4060168	4068350	That might be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music is because the demand for it and for performances after that
4068962	4072903	Just became too much to handle with a full-time job.
4073743	4077604	So it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood.
4078444	4085246	Well, you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the only one out there that has some memories tied to that game.
4085286	4087747	I know that was a huge game for me in college.
4088227	4092208	I probably failed a class or two because Final Fantasy VII, but it was so worth it.
4093428	4094889	Which maybe I shouldn't be telling the teacher.
4095309	4095689	Absolutely.
4098570	4120722	Final Fantasy 7 came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a PlayStation my roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a PlayStation I had a SNES I was still playing Chrono Trigger but I played the stew out of that and did time that Knights of the Round did with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing did go long enough for me to make a sandwich
4122171	4122471	Wow.
4123212	4123612	It's true.
4146392	4154418	Oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either, but the way you've translated this into hip-hop is something else.
4154498	4157760	Tell me more about the process of creating Journey, a hip-hop excursion.
4158921	4160282	Oh man, that was a lot of fun.
4160322	4164465	I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched and moved by the Journey video game.
4165265	4173031	I was told and emailed constantly about playing the game, but I just didn't have enough time and people were like, you gotta play it, you gotta play it, you're gonna love it.
4174089	4176030	Yeah, that's all I need is another game.
4176070	4180133	I have games here that are unopened that I haven't been able to get to yet.
4180753	4181393	I don't have time.
4181413	4183254	And they're like, no, that's the best thing about it.
4183334	4185416	It's an hour-long experience.
4185436	4188497	You just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it.
4189058	4189878	And so I did.
4189958	4192119	I played it, and I was instantly inspired.
4192139	4193320	I mean, it's a great game.
4194241	4197422	It's so cool how they just created the entire scenario.
4197442	4199203	I mean, there's no dialogue whatsoever.
4200765	4205167	You're basically creating your own story and synopsis.
4205287	4206728	And it's just such an experience.
4206748	4211751	I don't even know any other way to describe it except an experience because it just kind of immerses you.
4212291	4218775	So when I wound up playing the game through, I think, twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack.
4219615	4221176	And then I had a whole day.
4221196	4224158	I think I was just trying to raise funds for Kickstarter.
4225018	4227239	And we had gotten to a really certain level.
4227299	4227880	I think it was maybe $10,000.
4229159	4235384	and usually when I get to the round numbers, I try to give some sort of a surprise gift for the support.
4235944	4240427	So, as I was playing the Journey soundtrack, I said, well, why not work on making some hip-hop beats?
4241068	4244470	So, the entire day, I sat down, I used a program called Reason.
4245591	4258520	So, what I do is just pick the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little bit, stretch them out, slow them down, filter them, add some drums, take out some things, you know, bring them back in later.
4259307	4266532	and wound up creating some really cool beats with a very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel.
4266612	4268533	And that was really what I wanted to create.
4268914	4269874	So it came out pretty well.
4270415	4270955	I really like it.
4270995	4271936	I still listen to it a lot.
4272056	4272416	It's great.
4272456	4277739	And you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right?
4277760	4279441	I saw that tweet on your website.
4279481	4279881	It's awesome.
4279901	4281262	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
4281362	4285565	Austin Winstery actually listened to it and told me he liked it.
4285645	4286726	Told me it was a great job.
4286766	4287286	I'm like, wow.
4288188	4288808	That's pretty cool.
4288868	4290489	I mean, you gotta love Twitter for that reason.
4290549	4292109	Just that everything is so accessible.
4292629	4293870	Everybody's one click away.
4293890	4303212	And I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey remixes that they contacted him about it.
4303252	4305013	Like, hey Austin, have you heard this?
4305633	4307914	And so that's kind of what made him respond.
4308094	4309774	And so that was really cool.
4309914	4311455	Like, props from the man himself.
4312055	4312895	You really can't beat that.
4313753	4316315	And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing?
4316355	4319658	Because this whole interview tonight is being brought to you by Twitter.
4319918	4322300	You know, we say we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
4322600	4326603	And we went to Twitter and we said, hey, tweets, who do you want to see on the show?
4326723	4330927	And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on.
4331147	4332148	And here we are.
4332588	4333048	Here we are.
4334173	4336695	I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen.
4336875	4337136	Thanks.
4357172	4360455	Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it.
4361155	4363898	How did the community help you achieve your goals with language arts?
4364218	4364738	Oh, man.
4364898	4367100	Well, the community was just humongous.
4367280	4370262	I don't... Well, we've done a Kickstarter in the past, like I said.
4370282	4373565	We've done one for... Actually, two.
4373905	4380290	We did one to create vinyl for Forever Famicom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album.
4380851	4381091	Then...
4381724	4387108	We did another later to play a show in London at the London Anime Con.
4387969	4389630	And both of those went decent.
4389670	4390771	We got our goals.
4391832	4395134	We didn't get necessarily way over the goal, but we did pretty well.
4396015	4398697	And I decided to go back and try it again.
4398717	4402300	It was one of those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy.
4402420	4403921	Everybody's doing it these days.
4404461	4406623	Like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now.
4407625	4412047	Video game companies are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now.
4412807	4418950	And so I always told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea.
4419090	4427194	So instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years, almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience.
4427674	4431976	So instead of just an album, it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book.
4432616	4434857	Now, of course, I can't do all that on my own without
4435481	4438041	having artists and developers help me out.
4438121	4441182	So I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out.
4441762	4443823	So that then came Kickstarter.
4444383	4452344	So I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this.
4452424	4453624	But I said, we'll start small.
4454524	4460546	And lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000.
4460586	4460626	So
4464534	4467377	A 516% completion rate.
4467537	4471420	And just from the response has been overwhelming.
4471460	4475144	I mean, from Facebook, Twitter, to just the guys on my email list.
4475924	4477826	I went out to PAX East and performed.
4478146	4483211	And it was probably right before the Kickstarter really got underway.
4483271	4484552	I told a lot of people about it.
4485073	4486534	And people were like, hey, I'm going to support.
4486614	4488135	And sure enough, they did.
4488175	4488936	We had over 300 backers.
4490560	4495122	who are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comics.
4495182	4502206	So I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level and that's what hopefully this Kickstarter has allowed us to do.
4502486	4508389	I think I want to do this in a whole new way and this could be the album that kind of defines me.
4508409	4516353	I've done a lot of Final Fantasy stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property but I really want to
4518478	4544658	I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal and just kind of cool to have like this comic book and video game and album that all tie together yet it's not like it's not some movie franchise being turned into this or some you know it's you it's your story that's awesome that's awesome right that's what's cool about it I wanted to make it based on my story now granted the the
4545222	4553491	Game and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and they are interweaving a bit.
4553951	4556254	The album's much more, I guess, realistic.
4557175	4568026	I kind of take that hero and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy with just, you know, some cool abilities, but
4569015	4573079	for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around shooting beams out of his eyes.
4573219	4580505	But in the game, of course, you know, to make things a lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it and the comic as well.
4581066	4595358	So it's taking my story and my own original story and original characters that myself and the guys at J1 Studios created and creating a universe around it, you know, like almost a franchise, you know, so it's
4597177	4598178	That is so awesome.
4598759	4602562	Looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at Megaran.com.
4602582	4604584	We'll have more information on that when it's out, I'm sure.
4605865	4608948	Random, I know we're a little past our time here.
4608988	4617635	Hopefully I'm not keeping you from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight.
4617675	4620338	So, Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners.
4620918	4621819	Absolutely do.
4622139	4625020	Alright, VOGnetwork.com if you want to ask some questions in chat.
4625040	4626840	Let me get to an email question we got earlier in the week.
4626860	4636303	This is from Will O. Sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Ranma has a style that just seems effortless and his sincerity bleeds through each track.
4636363	4639184	He honestly seems to love what he's doing.
4639204	4642045	And I just wanted to throw that out there that that's coming across.
4642105	4643926	But here's the question, Ranma.
4644386	4651468	Do you think it would be possible to be doing what you're doing before the age of social media?
4652048	4657553	How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create music or tour?
4657813	4662977	So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could you do what you're doing without social media?
4664398	4664859	Wow.
4665399	4666200	I don't think so.
4666680	4668782	No, I really don't.
4668822	4671944	The whole MegaRam story started because of social media.
4671964	4676128	I was contacted on Myspace in 2007 by Capcom.
4676208	4680331	So if not for social media, I don't know if I'd be here.
4681750	4683451	I do owe a lot to it.
4684832	4688175	I'm hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media.
4689116	4695520	I think it would make it to me a little more fun going out and doing the old school method because I do that a lot.
4696001	4707309	I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm not only all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or two times a week.
4708281	4713167	I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people.
4714048	4717812	So it's not just social media, but I feel like social media is a huge part of it.
4718292	4730025	But like I said, I think my leg up comes from the fact that I'm out and about in the community physically making appearances as well as taking full advantage of social media.
4730293	4733756	MC Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, MC Lars, that he's always told me that you gotta get out and play, you know?
4733776	4734577	You have to get out and play.
4734597	4737859	Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you apart, so...
4756198	4760399	getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that.
4761040	4771443	Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the VOG, or excuse me, vognetwork.com and I'm going to go to a question from Actdeft first and I think this is a good question.
4771863	4773644	I'll take this question to the next level.
4773824	4777345	Who is MegaRan's favorite video game music composer?
4780786	4781266	Oh, man.
4781486	4784487	I gotta say, I'm going to go back a little bit and
4785143	4787925	I'm going to say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro.
4789345	4795989	He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island.
4796641	4800705	and a lot of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite.
4800805	4801846	You're officially my hero.
4801886	4802847	He is the bomb.
4802887	4804248	We know Yuzo very well.
4804588	4807491	Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music.
4807811	4809193	And of course, Actraiser.
4809993	4815078	The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to LA, just saying.
4815138	4815498	Yes.
4816339	4817660	Oh my God, it's amazing.
4818461	4819042	Excellent.
4819062	4820363	I think I'm going to go listen to that tonight.
4821994	4822715	Excellent, excellent.
4823235	4827859	Let's go to another question from Breakman, you know, because you're very well known for the Mega Man stuff.
4827919	4832643	Breakman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Ran's favorite Mega Man theme?
4834665	4835606	Ooh, all right.
4836266	4839489	Well, I could go with the easy choice.
4839849	4842111	There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves.
4842411	4846515	So Mega Man 2, WALL-E, Stage 1, everybody loves that.
4848436	4850758	I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites.
4850998	4855041	I love Woodman's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2.
4855201	4862346	Another one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is Bomb Man from Mega Man 1.
4863767	4864768	And what else?
4865769	4866509	Crashman.
4866690	4867550	I love Crashman.
4867590	4869632	Crashman is great.
4869712	4876737	There's so many, and as you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never used them, or I've never intended to remake them.
4877831	4881074	Crashman, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it.
4881735	4883758	You know, WALL-E, Stage 1, same thing.
4884659	4887602	Mega Man 3, title screen, same thing.
4887802	4891126	It's just so great as is.
4891186	4893048	Proto Man's theme, another one I love.
4894190	4896873	So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to
4900249	4908496	You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do him justice based on the Mega Ran 9 album, but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from.
4908536	4909357	I think that's great.
4909858	4918186	Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I know where this guy's going with this name, but the name is iFarTed.
4919066	4920127	What a great name in chat.
4920428	4921208	He wants to know...
4922169	4928091	Is there any game that MegaRan hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on?
4929811	4936313	I'm afraid of questions like that because I don't want to answer it and then a couple things can happen.
4936553	4938954	One, someone just takes it and does it.
4939714	4945415	Or two, I could never get to it and people are like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned?
4945976	4950317	But I will say I have two that my eyes are on.
4952048	4981754	the Metal Gear Solid series and Legend of Zelda particularly A Link to the Past so those are what my eyes are on right now but the next plan though for next year is myself and K Murdock we're doing an all Sega album called Sega State or Sagacity and it's going to be all Sega so from Master System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast
4982332	4983873	It's going to be all Sega all the time.
4984113	4984993	That'll be our next one.
4985014	4987435	But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do.
4988235	4995059	But story-wise, that's just such a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that.
4995559	5000142	You know, it would still be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII.
5000598	5002918	which is something that took like a year to make.
5003679	5005739	You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that.
5005759	5008060	Do you have a day of screaming, yes, Metal Gear, do it.
5008460	5010660	So, there you go.
5011420	5017221	Now, we're way over time here and I want to get to Mega Ran's song here but quickly, one last question from DarkSakura here in the studio.
5017241	5020002	I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line.
5021602	5022442	Oh, okay.
5022883	5024423	I've taken requests before.
5024743	5027964	Well, the official game of Orange Lounge Radio is The Guardian Legend.
5028684	5028884	Oh,
5030831	5033373	So could we hope to have you tackle that someday?
5035335	5035855	You know what?
5036155	5037697	I really, you know what, I did.
5037797	5039158	I did a Guardian Legend track.
5039298	5039598	Really?
5039638	5044582	Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song?
5044662	5053189	Okay, there's a song called Contact, C-O-N-T-A-C-T, and it's all about con etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legend.
5053869	5054390	Awesome.
5055110	5055410	Okay.
5055671	5059674	It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to cons, what you should and shouldn't do.
5059694	5059774	Okay.
5062695	5068202	The Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed by Fantasy Zone.
5069378	5096911	Alright, so Oh my god, those are some great games, like, I love Guardian Legends So you were on the top of my hero list now Well, look, we got random way past time here And, you know, we got off to a late start tonight But random, you know, I want to really thank you for taking the time out To come on Orange Lounge Radio tonight and talk about your music Again, if people want to know more about your music They can check you out at Megaran.com And you can also get the music at MegaranMusic.com

5115539	5120701	The Language Arts album will be out for everybody May 22nd, so mark that on your calendar.
5122509	5124693	Yeah, I'll see you out in the funny papers.
5132741	5133762	Alright, take care buddy.
5133822	5140124	Hey, we're going to close out here with a track from Mega Ran and this is actually a really special deal here.
5140244	5145505	This is actually a duet that he did with MC Frontalot, which is pretty awesome.
5145885	5155608	You can check this out at MegaRanMusic.com It's Random and MC Frontalot with Wake Up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5155728	5156289	Check this out.
5156309	5156289	... ...
5251574	5253477	Thank you for watching!
5286311	5287272	Thank you for watching!
5309721	5314483	Wake up, don't tell me it's time to wake up, snoring like a bulldozer, going like the brick
5386832	5388273	Thank you for watching!
5404008	5410511	That is Random or MegaRan with Wake Up here on Orange Launch Radio and that song features MC Frontalot.
5410691	5412652	That's a great song and it's a great message too.
5412732	5415273	It's like, you know, get up or you ain't gonna eat.
5416934	5417294	It's good.
5417334	5419495	It's an inspirational song and that was a great interview.
5419815	5421656	Even if it started a little late, it was worth the wait.
5421716	5423997	Also, you should get up because you might not shower.
5425157	5426018	That's right.
5426058	5427758	You have to get up from playing games.
5427778	5429219	Some people shower before bed.
5429279	5429659	Hello.
5429699	5433961	You'll have that con funk that he talks about in the Guardian Legends song.
5434521	5439344	Well, he's already said hi on Facebook.
5439564	5440584	Not Facebook, on Twitter.
5440604	5441685	I know, that's awesome.
5441945	5442925	Totally follow him on Twitter.
5442965	5443785	He's really cool.
5443845	5445986	I want to know, why did he tweet Anime Jam Session?
5446066	5447227	He wasn't on Anime Jam.
5447267	5448167	No, it's all good.
5448568	5451869	Ranma was helping me screen the questions, actually, so he does get props and stuff.
5451929	5452689	Listen to Anime Jam Session.
5452709	5453330	This is a good show.
5453350	5454050	Really awesome.
5454090	5454651	Really awesome.
5454751	5457512	And I don't know how I missed the Guardian Legend one.
5457952	5458653	Yeah.
5458673	5459293	He's got a lot.
5459633	5459894	Yeah.
5459934	5460554	He's got a lot.
5461514	5466197	That is going to be on my iPhone soon.
5466437	5466637	All right.
5466657	5473461	Well, if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music, that particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free.
5473881	5474942	Megaranmusic.com.
5474982	5475382	Go get it.
5475642	5476663	Megaranmusic.com.
5476743	5477363	And thanks again.
5479064	5481365	Write on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it.
5481445	5485786	Write on to the management for setting that up and for Random for appearing on our show tonight.
5485986	5503651	And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan language arts video game and comic project Kickstarter, we will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD as well as a signed comic to a lucky listener.
5503951	5504493	Look at you.
5505477	5505999	Giving.
5506601	5508869	I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes, by the way.
5510348	5520873	Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while, but for those of you that are sticking around, because I knew some people would just be here to listen to Megaran and then hit the road, which I understand.
5521453	5521994	It's all good.
5522434	5529317	But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B. So just stay tuned.
5529337	5530457	I'll get into that in a little bit.
5530477	5533119	It's not as good as what Loki just talked about, but it's still pretty cool.
5533579	5533799	All right.
5533999	5535099	We've got to get back into some news.
5535139	5536800	We're running late now, but that's all right.
5536860	5538221	It was worth the wait.
5538641	5539542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5563479	5569381	It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console-quality gamepad controller.
5569461	5570722	There's pictures of this on the internet.
5571102	5579405	Just imagine the most giant, stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life where you slammed an iPad in the middle.
5579505	5580745	That's what this thing looks like.
5581225	5585088	Honestly, it looks a lot better than the one that Razer was looking at making.
5585228	5586809	Yeah, yeah.
5587270	5590292	Now, apparently, Wikipad isn't super popular yet.
5590332	5594415	They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show, but they've already gone through some changes with it.
5594475	5599578	It's got a 10.1-inch screen and a quad-core processor now, optional 3G for mobile.
5599598	5600319	But here's the other thing.
5600419	5601059	It ain't out yet.
5601980	5604001	So it's one of those things that is coming soon.
5604421	5609704	Gaikai is out there, though, if you want to check that out, and it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it.
5610024	5615307	That's pretty big for a portable system, but I'd say, eh, if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere.
5615367	5629134	Yeah, and then people carry tablets, too, and it's also streaming gaming, so if you think about it, you'll be able to play console-type games, because the same stuff that OnLive is doing, like Saints Row III or something of that quality,
5629975	5630916	through this pad.
5630956	5638127	I mean, and the controls look pretty similar to, you know, a current-gen console, so I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that.
5638227	5639769	I'd rather have an IK than an iPad.
5640250	5640691	Just saying.
5641191	5642934	Well, isn't IK a device for an iPad?
5643174	5643314	Yeah.
5644963	5645644	I'd rather have that.
5646044	5647246	I'm fine with it.
5647326	5648327	Or MAME on an Android.
5648367	5649388	I mean, what's the difference, really?
5649689	5653153	Look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler.
5653233	5657058	We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags.
5658099	5663626	No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges hooked up to either a modem or your cable.
5663866	5675796	A portable console was getting a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter and plugging your Nintendo into it, which some guy we knew had in his car, a PlayStation in the car.
5675816	5681981	We did that in middle school with a camp TV that ran on D-cells.
5682181	5692729	We're going to go to a classic time when things were a lot simpler and take a look at the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to dip into the video game vault and find a game that she thinks, hey!
5693530	5695271	You kids ought to be playing this video game.
5695291	5695992	This one's moldy.
5696112	5699394	You know, Random got the jump on you, though, with the Goonies 2 nostalgia.
5699754	5701055	But this one's pretty good, too.
5701495	5703336	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5703536	5708339	A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers, and I'm not going to spoil why.
5708940	5709380	Galaga!
5711161	5714003	Yes, Galaga, also known in Japan as Gyaraga.
5715771	5723873	which is the game of pew pew is what it is.
5725753	5732214	Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan and published by Midway in North America in 1981.
5733234	5735475	It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979.
5736635	5738295	Why I didn't do Galaxian?
5738655	5739136	I don't know.
5739256	5740856	I wanted to do Galaga, so whatever.
5742928	5746511	In any way, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen.
5746531	5747471	You go back and forth.
5747491	5749252	You don't get to go up or fly around or anything.
5749313	5751154	It's a simple, fixed shooter.
5752114	5758639	And the enemies fly at you in formation, and you have to pew-pew them all before they pew-pew you.
5759439	5763062	And once they're all vanquished, then you move on to the next stage.
5763282	5763842	Yahoo!
5763962	5764443	Alright.
5765884	5770187	Galaga was pretty, pretty popular, as I'm sure you all know.
5770607	5774330	So we have many different sequels to Galaga and many versions of Galaga.
5774910	5789381	At any rate, Galaga, for me, was just the coolest because you could get your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing.
5789981	5793904	And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode, which was always...
5794464	5795465	Super cool!
5797866	5807630	It also had a few features that improved over Galaxium, like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, your hit-miss ratio, and the challenging stage.
5808650	5812151	And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus.
5813952	5818956	And like I said, you also could get captured.
5820357	5822999	It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up.
5823039	5824640	You could shoot it and get it down.
5826421	5830964	And then there are actually full-on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured.
5831865	5832886	That's how a lot of people play.
5833586	5840251	It also had a bug that was called... Actually, the bug would make your attacker stop firing bullets.
5840611	5841632	It was actually a coding error.
5842273	5853273	I just want to say the double the whole two ships tied together thing that's like the only way I can do decent at this game I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion
5854028	5856529	Well, a lot of people based their strategy around it, like I said.
5856849	5862130	There's also a split-screen bug that was like in Pac-Man.
5862671	5865171	It's not quite the same thing.
5865271	5871573	It's similar to the split-screen bug in Pac-Man, where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0.
5872713	5880876	And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine, it could cause the game to stall, and it means it has to be either reset or power-cycled so that you can start a new game.
5881796	5886879	So in the series of Galaxian, and I'm going to start with Galaxian.
5887539	5893462	You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Gaplus or Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig, Galaga Legions in 2008, Galaga Legions DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011.
5904927	5919723	Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave & Buster's in Milpitas, they used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set, which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in, with the three screens, and that was like some...
5920732	5920992	DarkSakura.com
5940145	5950457	As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out, there's been the Atari 7800, the Famicom version, Game Boy, and also it was bundled with Galaxian.
5950917	5952599	There was a GameTap, MSX.
5952619	5954521	The MSX version is actually really good.
5955422	5958326	Of course, NES, because we had a Famicom version.
5958726	5964828	the Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer, which I played Galagon on it.
5965888	5966568	That was the game.
5966649	5971810	It was a clone called Galagon, and I played Stu out of this, because my friend had one of these things.
5973491	5985875	It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version, Xbox Live Arcade, iOS is the Galaga Remix, which had the original on it, Nintendo 3DS, which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, and Roku.
5987615	5992419	There has also been several versions of the Namco Museum, which are really way too many.
5992479	5998485	I mean, like, we have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Windows.
5998505	5999826	There were two versions of each.
6000566	6007112	PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii, which I have most of those.
6009267	6014130	Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3 is the game with the OLR cameo.
6014731	6014831	Yes.
6014851	6015831	Which makes it double awesome.
6016072	6017272	That is the double awesome version.
6017332	6020494	Of course I had to... Jeez, Rob.
6020514	6021415	You gotta get that one out there.
6021435	6023796	Jeez, Rob!
6023876	6029580	There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version of Tekken in 1995.
6030040	6031201	You could play it as it loaded.
6032401	6035282	In Point Blake 2, there were Galaga Challenge stages.
6036662	6041383	In the 20-year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit that had Ms.
6041423	6044504	Pac-Man and Galaga, there was that.
6045984	6048685	The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too.
6049685	6053206	It was even available on Palm devices and Pocket PC.
6053486	6056047	So Galaga really has an amazing legacy.
6056207	6056487	Hold on.
6058800	6060582	Sorry, my allergies are flaring up, everybody.
6060623	6061504	You all right over there?
6061664	6063326	That's why I sound like a 12-year-old boy.
6066530	6068411	At any rate, there were remakes.
6068431	6073474	There was Galaga Arrangement, which was part of Namco Museum compilation.
6073895	6079279	Galaga Destination Earth came out in 98 for Windows, PlayStation, and the Game Boy Color.
6079499	6082561	Galaga Remix came out in 2007 for the Wii.
6083241	6087084	And you use your Wii remote as a gun.
6087744	6090226	And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space.
6091427	6094069	The video ran out, so we have to hear that opening theme one more time.
6098734	6100095	I can't sing.
6100275	6100995	Not with my voice like this.
6101856	6108379	There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, sorry, Galpus.
6109400	6116283	Galaga 88 were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app called Galaga 30th Anniversary that was done by Namco Bandai.
6116863	6123747	And basically the app had Galaxian as a free game and then the main three actually had to pay for the complete set for $8.00.
6124807	6131170	But it had Galaga points, so you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs, including the original art.
6132331	6134011	They're a world record for Galaga.
6134111	6136312	Now keep in mind, this is Twin Galaxy stuff.
6137353	6141855	It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krugman of Boca Raton, Florida.
6142856	6147518	And the rapid fire setting... And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida.
6148740	6151022	was used, and it was also in Ms.
6151042	6157746	Pat Mangala, Class of 81, Fast Shot, World Records, and they were both by John Klinkel of Battle Creek, Michigan.
6158707	6172117	And so, I mean, and I remember actually seeing some of the people that had the earlier ones in King of Kong, because they had people just playing, you know, the high score people gathered back together when What's-His-Face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score.
6173938	6195671	Galaga, actually there was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM for him to practice for war games Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game and basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions
6197052	6201515	There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game.
6201895	6203276	I have the Pac-Man one of those.
6203456	6203876	Just saying.
6205297	6212823	And because the place I'm reading is not updated since, Galaga made an appearance in The Avengers.
6214304	6214744	Just saying.
6216929	6217670	But you'll say no more.
6217830	6218531	But I'll say no more.
6218551	6221193	Because that guy over there is playing Galaga.
6221213	6222655	He didn't think I'd notice, but I did.
6223736	6224857	Alright, is that it?
6225137	6225718	That's the quote.
6225758	6227400	Classic game of the week.
6228060	6228821	Galaga.
6229021	6230723	Available everywhere.
6231023	6232605	But most notably in the arcade.
6232725	6234667	Because shield helicarriers have joysticks.
6234947	6235348	Just saying.
6236668	6242370	We would prefer that you play the arcade version or the PlayStation Network version that has the OLR cameo.
6242570	6243270	Yes.
6243610	6246491	Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize.
6247071	6247791	A no prize.
6247831	6248572	My favorite kind of prize.
6248832	6251232	We're running way long for part A. I wonder why.
6251252	6254053	No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki.
6254093	6255613	I'm allergic to California.
6255894	6256594	It was worth it.
6256874	6258354	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
6258494	6262455	We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6262495	6262996	Don't go anywhere.
6263016	6264156	We've got more coming up in part B.
6270604	6280015	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on the VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network, on this May the 6th of 2012.
6280095	6283539	We are live with the 456th episode of our show.
6283899	6287143	You guys missed a fun part A. A little worried there at the beginning.
6287543	6288424	A little worried there when...
6289005	6290746	I want the Sega album I got sonic boobs today, okay?
6307778	6312100	We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show, but you're wearing this shirt.
6312741	6314501	I paid $10 for it.
6314542	6320564	It's a Sonic shirt, and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is.
6320704	6321025	Yeah.
6321345	6324126	So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies.
6324806	6325527	Can't help it.
6325967	6326928	Triple D, hi.
6327368	6328368	Pixar didn't happen.
6328708	6329569	I put pics up.
6330706	6331587	On OrangeLunchRadio.com?
6331827	6332227	Oh, awesome.
6332247	6332827	All right, there you go.
6332987	6333388	Check that out.
6333408	6335809	And the other can of Vimto that I drank.
6336429	6337470	I've never had Vimto before.
6337490	6339451	Which our European listeners should know of.
6339931	6342813	I've never had Vimto before, but I'm having a Vimto Light, and it's really good.
6342993	6343293	I like this.
6343353	6344554	I've never had Vimto Light before.
6344574	6345534	I like the regular soda.
6345614	6348796	It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one.
6349416	6350277	It's just with sugar.
6350457	6353199	It tastes a little bit like Hanson's Black Cherry.
6353299	6353679	A little bit.
6354680	6357081	Black Current, Raspberry Soda
6381960	6382600	It's not bad.
6382640	6383441	I drink that.
6383601	6384041	It's good stuff.
6384081	6384541	All right, anyway.
6384741	6385441	Babylon Market.
6385701	6389223	By the way, we do have somebody staying up late listening to us all the way from the UK.
6389263	6391284	Peker Uno is with us saying, I don't like Vimto.
6391964	6392884	I prefer Rubina.
6393024	6393544	I don't know that one.
6393564	6394225	Rubina?
6394285	6395265	Rubina is not bad.
6395985	6396285	All right.
6396306	6403148	But I tried, it's this, I like Tizer, I think is what it's called.
6403188	6403948	T-I-Z-E-R.
6405329	6409651	I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good, like a grapefruit soda.
6410231	6410711	It's pretty good.
6412725	6413206	All righty.
6414567	6415988	You said you got that shirt at Kmart.
6416068	6417869	I want to get that out too.
6417889	6421112	Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock because it's Kmart.
6421833	6423394	By the Genesis ad, it's coming.
6423634	6425055	You know, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.
6425756	6431200	But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood.
6432021	6434283	And Shermie needed stuff to pee on.
6434884	6436885	So I got Shermie stuff to pee on.
6437265	6438366	And I needed Sudafed.
6439347	6442769	As you can all tell by my 12-year-old boy puberty voice.
6444010	6446331	So, just saying.
6446772	6451254	So K-More had that many copies of In the Groove there, huh?
6452875	6454596	They had a Mario shirt that I wanted.
6455737	6456117	Alright.
6456297	6459779	But when I saw Sonic, had to get it.
6459799	6461340	The Sega fangirl and you had a squeed.
6462321	6464622	Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news.
6464662	6466063	A few quick news stories for you guys.
6466678	6475123	So, Saints Row the Third, of course they had this, you know, April Fool's joke, testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing.
6476924	6483629	Where it was Saints Row the Third, enter the dominatrix, and everyone's like, wow, that would be pretty cool.
6484149	6488171	And so they're like, ah, we fooled you, because it's real, and it's coming out.
6489452	6494215	So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole, I don't know, copycat of...
6495876	6497097	Thank you for watching!
6512054	6513215	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6542437	6551323	And apparently the whole premise of Enter the Dominatrix, which is other than being a complete ripoff of The Matrix, because, you know, that's current.
6552244	6561090	And so basically the saint's leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord named Zinyak and his benevolent race.
6561430	6566433	And apparently they're trying to grab up all of Earth's resources or something.
6567294	6571156	And also, I guess there's some character named Paul.
6572477	6594743	who's supposed to play some role in there yay Paul you rock Paul stay awesome Paul it's all for you I'm a huge Paul fan I live for Paul in Saints Row the 3rd who the fuck is Paul I don't know who the fuck Paul is honestly that was a movie
6595518	6599300	Well, I know Paul is a movie, and that was probably funny.
6599440	6606084	But it's just this whole Saints Row, the dominatrix thing, it's neat.
6606524	6612728	And the whole thing, they say it's supposed to be like this virtual reality thing, so it's going to be similar to kind of like the Deckers missions almost.
6613288	6618111	But at the same time, I'm like, dude, your DLC sucked so fucking bad.
6618671	6619952	Do I really want to play this $30...
6621973	6622693	I mean, I just...
6646045	6647627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6664705	6665205	That was enough.
6666386	6671988	So Adidas MyCoach was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ.
6672508	6677430	Also, maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion of the Saints Row, because they're in a little financial trouble.
6679030	6682972	Well, apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time.
6683352	6688634	So now MyCoach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games.
6688754	6692095	They have taken over the publishing rights for it, so...
6693729	6696031	It'll be launching this summer, apparently.
6696911	6697912	So I'll have to check that out.
6698812	6700473	Maybe.
6700734	6701974	I'm sure you have it on pre-order.
6702295	6702575	Oh, yeah.
6702995	6703916	You know me and exercise.
6704776	6709439	And last but not least, a game that actually took up a lot of my time this week, Perfect Strangers.
6710260	6712822	It was an adver... It was an adver game.
6713122	6718806	I mean, it says right on the bottom, the guy that's responsible for this actually does adver games for a bunch of different things.
6718906	6720287	And he's done some pretty good stuff.
6720307	6720687	You know what?
6720707	6722848	It was a well-fucking-done adver game, so props.
6723009	6723649	It was excellent.
6724149	6743710	and um I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out um and of course it's advertising the uh release I guess of the episodes on iTunes which hey it worked I was unaware that the episodes were even out there I was unaware I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game oh I never forget that show
6744210	6746591	Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?
6771846	6776149	You know, I watched some clips of him the other day when I was asking myself the same question.
6776169	6779031	I know he was in Langoliers and he got mauled at some point.
6780151	6780912	I don't really know.
6781993	6784674	The last thing I probably saw him was Beverly Hills Cop 3.
6785195	6786295	And Mark Lynn Baker.
6786516	6787896	Whatever else did he do?
6789437	6794401	Other than being like a dead-on ringer for the critic, I don't know.
6795081	6797663	Let's just bask in the awesomeness for a minute.
6814887	6815648	I feel inspired.
6815668	6816468	The Mustang.
6817288	6818808	I forgot he drove a Mustang.
6821308	6821669	Look at that.
6821709	6824089	We just gave these guys a free commercial.
6824649	6826269	But it was a pretty fucking awesome show.
6826289	6827510	I did see Second Sight, Rob.
6827650	6828470	That movie was funny.
6828670	6828890	Yeah?
6829010	6830230	Because he was addicted to goobers.
6832310	6834072	Alright, let me get some stories for you guys.
6834092	6836896	But first, a PSA from our chatroom at vognetwork.com.
6837497	6841121	Pete Garuto is telling us all, you don't know Jack on Facebook is now open to all.
6842063	6843505	I know what I'm doing after the show tonight.
6844375	6846257	Shane, I gotta cancel Mass Effect Multiplayer.
6846438	6847799	You don't know Jack is on Facebook now?
6848860	6849721	I don't even know if he's listening.
6849761	6853105	Alright, let's get to some other quick news here.
6853466	6854387	Family Guy.
6855148	6857150	I don't know if they've done a lot of games for Family Guy.
6857190	6858512	I can't remember if there's been any others.
6858632	6859713	One, and it was not good.
6859933	6862116	That's right, that was the year they had Adam West at E3.
6862396	6863117	It wasn't good.
6863397	6867921	It wasn't good, and they did an iOS game, and it wasn't very good either.
6868021	6870984	Well, maybe this will redeem it, but we'll see.
6871164	6874307	September 25th, Family Guy, back to the multiverse.
6874888	6879492	PlayStation 3 and 360, according to some Amazon stuff that leaked earlier today.
6879732	6880833	And even earlier on our Twitter.
6882294	6882654	Wink wink.
6883054	6884514	Activision is involved.
6884694	6886935	I bet this will be an E3 showing.
6887856	6888256	Probably.
6888616	6892998	I actually have to look it up because I haven't watched Family Guy in a few years.
6893518	6894698	Mainly because I do this show.
6894738	6895759	It happens to be on at the same time.
6895779	6898200	And also because it stopped being funny after a while.
6899040	6901321	But I'll give it a chance again.
6902001	6903702	Don't remind the listeners that Family Guy is on.
6904525	6905606	It's true, it's true.
6927998	6929760	Family Guy is a browser-based online adventure.
6946396	6949697	You could say it's for kids, but you know there's going to be some adults that check this out too.
6949737	6951658	It's coming from WB Games Montreal.
6952158	6953198	Cartoon universe.
6953278	6954239	It is kid-friendly.
6954359	6956019	It's Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo.
6956340	6958280	You make your own Toon avatar.
6958320	6965703	You play puzzles and mini-games, meet new friends, and experience the joy of exploring a place that doesn't actually exist.
6966343	6966483	So...
6966883	6967423	Very cool.
6968084	6974248	There's supposed to be popular characters from both the franchises in there, but no playable version of this yet.
6974348	6975249	I guess there's a beta.
6975289	6975549	I'm sorry.
6975589	6981153	There is a beta version, I guess, that's out there, but I think it's really bugged from what the early reports are saying.
6981193	6983514	But it is a beta, but you can check that out.
6983574	6985716	CartoonUniverse.com.
6985736	6986076	Excuse me.
6986316	6987497	N-A for North America.
6987877	6988718	CartoonUniverse.com.
6988738	6989278	Pink textures, Rob.
6989298	6989958	Pink textures.
6990759	6996503	It looks cute, but if I'm going to play a free-to-play MMO, I'm going to play Star Trek or DC Universe or something.
6997083	6997363	Alright.
6998484	7013696	Lastly, for those of you guys that aren't cool enough to go to E3 anymore, like, you know, us, at least you can feel like you're there by sitting on the couch with your bonbons and your popcorn, which you can't even have if you actually go to the real thing, because they don't allow that stuff in these, uh...
7014597	7020603	conference centers and watch the E3 presser on Xbox Live or Spike TV.
7020723	7025848	The Microsoft press conference will be live on Xbox Live and Spike TV.
7026248	7035878	I will be spending my time doing what I normally do during these press conferences which is kicking back in the conference room at work and eating a bowl of popcorn while watching this stuff.
7036218	7038400	Well, you know, I have E3 week off anyway.
7038660	7046806	And I'm at the point where I've been at my job 10 years and I get so much time off a year for being there that long that I just take E3 week off to have it off.
7046886	7047907	It's not a bad idea.
7047947	7048567	I should do that.
7048947	7049988	But here's the thing.
7050529	7053291	I may actually this year have to move.
7054191	7055392	Our studio may be moving, by the way.
7055893	7059996	I may be moving that week, so I may miss out on some of this.
7060016	7060356	We'll see.
7061037	7065741	But regardless, for the rest of you guys, you can watch that live as it unfolds.
7066201	7069323	I can't imagine it's going to be any different for Sony and Nintendo.
7069404	7076109	It's just, you know, maybe they'll be on G4 or PlayStation Home or, you know, they'll be available as well.
7076129	7083455	Well, you know, Xbox used to be on G4, so it's like now Spike has more gaming cred than G4, which, yeah, I can see that.
7084217	7085240	Funny how that works.
7085321	7086103	Funny how that works.
7086545	7086725	All right.
7086765	7089173	Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys in the Fugle Question of the Week.
7090596	7091376	Oh yeah, me, huh?
7092456	7099858	Well, there is going to be Cave Story Plus on the 3DS eShop soon, but it's not going to be the Cave Story 3D.
7099898	7100538	It's a separate one.
7100618	7102799	All it is is an update for the 3DS.
7103499	7113121	In fact, Tyrone Rodriguez, the CEO of Nicholas, said that he really wanted it just to be the update, so neither game would interfere with the other if you happened to delete one.
7113781	7115181	That's a little weird, isn't it?
7115261	7118162	That you would make a second remake of your game?
7118422	7122524	Well, Cave Story 3D is a separate game from Cave Story Plus.
7123224	7124025	They're two different games.
7126006	7129488	Yo, dog, I heard you like Cave Story, so we put some Cave Story in your Cave Story.
7131159	7140823	and for our listeners in the UK, the UK Pride Xbox Connect Bundle will be available in May and I kind of want it, but not really.
7141343	7143324	It's going to be ¬£249.99, so there you go.
7143344	7144165	There's also going to be a...
7154306	7160832	A skin available, Jealous Skins is going to make a pattern for $30.
7161472	7171060	And they also, though, do have a Stars and Stripes bundle for the American audiences or anyone who happens to want an American flag on their game or something.
7173162	7174263	Or the Confederate flag.
7174283	7176205	I'm sure they have the Confederate flag, too, you know.
7176528	7177109	Oh, shush.
7177669	7180733	And then Ratchet & Clank HD Trilogy has been pushed back in Europe.
7181373	7187740	It will be pushed from the 16th of May until early June, Insomniac has announced.
7190102	7190443	The end.
7190823	7191244	The end.
7192475	7199277	Let's go to the Fugle question of the week, except I'm failing, and I did this last week too, didn't I?
7199317	7200557	It's something about the network change.
7200597	7211620	I don't have the music up for this segment, but every week we go to our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus.
7211800	7215121	Yes, we're on Google Plus with all the Google employees that are still there.
7215541	7218463	There are some very loyal Google Plus listeners, though, and I get it.
7219383	7221164	Man, Facebook does some real dumb shit.
7221185	7222545	Did you hear about now what they're doing?
7223046	7224867	I get why people want to run off to Google Plus.
7225427	7231111	The whole Messenger thing will now have this actual Facebook Messenger app that's coming.
7231131	7233952	And look this up on the Internet if you don't believe me.
7234232	7241497	The Facebook Messenger app on the iPhone will now send your location with the messages that you send
7242017	7243218	You can turn that off.
7243598	7244758	So to be fair, you can't turn that off.
7244778	7250061	But you know it'll be on by default because nobody at Facebook knows what opt-in is all about.
7250381	7257425	And the other thing with this is that return receipts, you can now request a return receipt for when somebody's read your message.
7257805	7258886	You can't turn that off.
7259606	7262047	So if you don't want someone to know you read their message, too bad.
7262908	7265409	That would be great for the stalkers that Facebook message you.
7266846	7269687	Well, I'm sure you could use a third-party app for that.
7270288	7270508	Rob?
7271108	7274709	I don't know the specifics of how it worked, but when I read that, I was like, grr.
7274830	7281853	More importantly, though, Ranma in chat has informed us that Bronson Pinchot actually has a reality show on DIY.
7284274	7285014	I was unaware of this.
7285274	7286154	It sounds interesting.
7286495	7287015	I'm sure it's not.
7287115	7290216	And by the way, Rob, I don't use the messenger anyway.
7290276	7291817	I always have it linked me as offline.
7293141	7299732	I'm just saying, I don't know the specifics, but I look at this and I raise my eyebrow and I go, do not want.
7302436	7303798	Anyway, let's go on to happier topics.
7303818	7305621	I make everyone get AIM.
7306943	7307564	FUGLE QUESTION OF THE WEEK
7326127	7331310	Has a video game ever inspired you to create something artistic in the real world?
7331890	7335152	For example, art, music, a website, anything creative.
7335552	7338474	What did you create and why did the game inspire you to do this?
7339554	7341315	So Shane from Horde House started us off.
7341935	7346338	Sorry, I'm too busy writing my Mail Shepherd Caden fanfic to answer this question.
7347678	7349019	I've written fanfiction.
7349599	7349900	Really?
7349960	7350400	For what game?
7351147	7354390	For a number of games, I mean, just stuff I played.
7354490	7356391	I did Metroid back in the day.
7357812	7358633	Just old stuff.
7358773	7363197	I mean, the last thing that I did was actually for Digimon, of all things.
7363717	7364017	Nice.
7364298	7367420	I used to put together, well, I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto.
7367620	7377988	And remember, I was inspired to try to figure out what the song from DJ Hero 2 would sound like, the mashup between piano and shout, so I did that.
7379230	7381072	and I've done fan art.
7382233	7386377	Remember I did my portal turret for my final project in 3D class.
7386397	7389579	All right, let's get some more of the answers over on Facebook.
7390340	7400930	We have an answer from Johnny B. Johnny Cage's ball bust a move inspired me to create an athletic cup attached with nails and screws.
7401570	7405474	I advertise this tool of protection for men, women and everyone in between.
7406034	7406735	I think it's funny.
7406795	7407896	But hey, I have a tip for you.
7428567	7429388	Rob on Public Access
7448985	7450346	Oh, I've seen some of it.
7450387	7452529	Yeah, you saw, I don't even know where the tapes are.
7452609	7453530	I honestly don't.
7453610	7454290	I mean, who uses VHS tapes?
7454350	7456292	It is fantastic, I have to say.
7456753	7458354	It was fantastic.
7459976	7461898	Seriously, I'm being serious here.
7462899	7469806	If shit like Tim and Eric's awesome show Great Job can do as well as it does, that Public Access show could have been a hit.
7470290	7471512	Yeah, you know, it's a shame.
7471632	7472393	I lost touch.
7472774	7480005	Well, we're Facebook friends, but my friend Shannon, who was like my bestie in high school, and I did a comedy show on public access.
7480406	7481427	And I'll tell you what.
7481848	7483350	Kids in high school are such...
7484284	7501096	Cockhead bastard fucks Like, you know, we used to get Like the guys before us did this very, you know, conservative slanted show Because they learned that from their parents Called, I'm gonna name names Because I'm 33 and I don't give a fuck anymore It was a show called Open Debate
7502466	7531537	and these guys would just sit there they fucking would razz our show that was coming up like live on their show and the callers would call in and like talk about what a fag I was on public access TV I got bullied on television you guys but it gets better don't worry all I'm saying is you need to put a clause in your will or something like that that stuff gets released when you die unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately probably died with her as well I mean
7533356	7537758	I don't want to belittle janitors Because janitors do an important job
7562771	7563111	Anyhow.
7565213	7567274	Hey, Porkchop answered our question on Facebook.
7568155	7570036	Not so much create, but adapted.
7570477	7577021	The Final Fantasy soundtracks inspired me to adapt some of their songs on guitar, such as Eternity Lightwaves and Aerith's Theme.
7577462	7582445	The game's music always impressed me and was very memorable, which made me want to learn these songs for myself.
7582845	7585808	As a result of this, Nobuo Uematsu is also my favorite composer.
7586128	7590291	If you think about it, that's almost the same story that Random told about Goonies 2.
7591499	7595162	I have to say, Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major.
7595903	7596403	Very cool.
7596483	7597785	And I met him, remember?
7598525	7599366	I do remember that.
7601067	7605791	I love this answer from Stan H on Facebook says, playing Journey as I type this.
7606212	7608374	I want to knit the scarf and be crazy long.
7609995	7610916	It was a Journey joke.
7610996	7611396	I love it.
7612517	7621462	Lastly, from Paul W. Is it weird that when you first said, oh yeah, he did a remix thing based on Journey that I thought of Journey the arcade game?
7623203	7625645	I was worried people would think that.
7625725	7626005	All right.
7626565	7630550	Look, one more answer here from Facebook, and then I got one on Google.
7630791	7641865	Paul W. says, Back when I was in second or third grade during the NES and Sega Master System days, I would create my own illustrations of enemies' bosses when instruction manuals for game were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent.
7642225	7648029	These were new creations I had imagined for sequels to games such as Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast.
7648349	7656714	I think a lot of us did that kind of crap as a kid, Paul, because I can tell you, you must have done this too, and everybody that grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this.
7657094	7666280	Did the RPG on the notepad where you drew the dungeon and you'd make your friends go through the dungeon and it was like you wrote your own video game on paper?
7666500	7666841	Yes.
7667261	7670543	I used to have a tablet of that stuff and I'm so sad that I lost it.
7670663	7673345	This is why we're friends, because I knew you were that kid.
7673485	7674606	I didn't even have to ask.
7674626	7679390	See, it started off because I used to like, okay, basically I was inspired by Contra.
7679530	7682232	I used to love drawing mazes, and so that's what I'd do.
7682272	7689297	I'd create mazes, and then they were mazes with cannons in them, and then mazes with spikes and cannons and alien monsters and stuff like that.
7689778	7691859	So it was kind of like that.
7691879	7693681	It was like bullet hell, but on paper.
7695362	7697244	All right, let's get to the one answer here on Google+.
7698348	7699989	Jim H. You go.
7700429	7701809	Jim's the loyal Google user.
7701869	7702229	Here it is.
7702589	7709551	Sort of embarrassing to admit this, but in my documentary class in film school, I made a one-minute doclet about my holy priest character in Warcraft.
7710092	7716493	I actually got an A on the project and had to answer questions from my instructor like, have you ever let another player die on purpose?
7717154	7717994	Great story.
7718374	7718674	Love it.
7719134	7720595	I'm sure the answer is yes.
7723396	7723656	All right.
7723676	7723976	There it is.
7724016	7725876	That's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
7725936	7727957	Let's get back into some news, Loki.
7728547	7731910	Warp, Shank, Shank 2, Gatling Gears, Deathspank, and Deathspank the Thong of Virtue
7748602	7774384	and ironically enough it's actually being released on Steam as part of Steam Play and they're also having some other indies that are available as well I guess Death's Bank titles are currently $7.50 individually and then EA's rest of their indie titles are $5 each and those are PC only whereas the Death's Bank titles are PC and Mac um
7776045	7786737	And, uh, interesting enough, though, uh, you know, they've also gotten some, um, hate from, you know, just, just this guy that put out a game called Minecraft.
7787197	7791522	Um, that's right, Notch, uh, basically saying- What's a Minecraft?
7791842	7792823	Yeah, what's a Minecraft?
7793224	7796528	Yeah, basically said, EA's releasing- How do you mine fish?
7798419	7802041	So EA's releasing an indie bundle.
7803382	7805142	I'm not sure how that works, EA.
7805403	7808384	Stop attempting to ruin everything, you bunch of cynical bastards.
7810025	7811065	Oh, tweet drama.
7812506	7814067	It's going down on Twitter, y'all.
7815067	7815687	You know what, though?
7816228	7821430	It did strike me as really funny that the EA indie bundle was on Steam and not on Origin.
7823151	7823731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7847936	7850320	What would you like to see us approve on Origin?
7850380	7855487	Because, you know, kind of almost admitting that it hasn't been that great.
7855827	7860574	So what would you guys like to see us do, you know, to fix it?
7861595	7863097	Close it down and put the games on Steam?
7864419	7867262	They're not going to do that Although, you know what?
7867563	7879677	Competition is healthy for the industry So, you know, I don't want Steam to be the one and only But, you know, I don't know if EA should really be giving their own store But I will say this You know, despite the cynical bastard I am in all this I will say something nice about Origin this week
7880951	7887115	I did play, and I didn't talk about this in my gaming week, but I did play that Mass Effect 3 datapad game that helps you with your galactic readiness.
7887395	7892478	Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry last week because I said that you have to play multiplayer?
7892638	7893719	And I downloaded that thing.
7893799	7893999	Yeah.
7894359	7904446	Well, it does turn out, and I do stand corrected, thank you chat room, that's the perk of doing a live show, that you can download this Mass Effect datapad and raise your galactic readiness rating in a...
7905046	7931699	I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much one of those like Facebooky type of games that you know you send your ship out and wait three hours and you can check on it what have you and it helps raise your galactic readiness and I gotta say the way that all ties together and how you do that on your iPhone yet it impacts what happens on the Xbox and you can check your multiplayer unlocks on the PC that kind of synergy is neat it is neat
7932529	7934470	And it's done well.
7935130	7938531	So I will tip my hat slightly to that.
7938911	7943053	I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs left and right wherever they can get it.
7943153	7946394	But as far as the free stuff that's there, it's pretty cool.
7947355	7950196	So I will say that nice thing about Origin.
7950216	7952197	But as far as the EA Indie Bundle on Steam...
7954793	7955373	You know what?
7955513	7965377	I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought it would be a clever thing and probably didn't go through all the necessary checks and now they're paying for it in the media just like everything else.
7966417	7968758	Guess what else EA paid for in the media this week?
7970018	7973499	A big snafu in their Rock Band iOS game.
7974840	7983603	A big pop-up showed up when logging into Rock Band on the iPhone or the iPad this week that said, on May 31st, Rock Band will no longer be playable on your device.
7984023	7985383	Thanks for rocking out with us.
7985863	7987284	And everybody was like, what?
7988044	7988565	The fuck?
7989246	7993953	I bought this game and I bought the DLC, it's on my phone, and EA's just gonna fucking shut it off.
7994493	7997097	Yank, pull the plug, pull it from my phone, can't play it anymore.
7997117	8004468	Not to mention that while that little pop-up's going on, it's still being currently sold on iOS's App Store.
8004588	8005068	and DarkSakura.
8031641	8033163	Well, came out later in the week.
8033463	8040349	EA came out and said, that prompt was made an error, and we will give you more information soon.
8040389	8043152	They said, quote, we apologize for the confusion this caused.
8043452	8049438	We're working to clarify the issue that caused the error, and we'll share additional information as soon as possible.
8049458	8051560	Clarify the issue, fire the employee, you know.
8051940	8054642	Yeah, because... Ah, they didn't like that.
8054742	8055803	How did this happen?
8056344	8061688	The cat did not sneak in in the middle of the night and type Dear Rockers on May 31st.
8062528	8064750	That was an intentional message.
8065050	8066912	Especially the thanks for rocking out with us.
8068160	8071262	Thanks for paying this money, but your game is no longer going to work.
8071362	8072283	Now here's my thought.
8072323	8074904	I have a random ass theory, and this ties back into Mass Effect.
8075905	8085771	You know they announced this Mass Effect free DLC that's coming out in the summer, but they put an expiration date on it saying you can get it free until 2013 or 2014, something like that.
8086091	8094397	And Bioware said, note, we don't plan to ever not make it free, but EA's policies require us to set an expiration date.
8095257	8123337	and you know as long as they don't have to honor it and also speaking of Mass Effect when I bought Mass Effect 2 brand new mind you I had a coupon in the box for an online pass expires February 1st 2012 and it was like mid February by the time I was ready to play it it's still redeemed but that expiration date was there and I was about ready to go through the fucking roof because I bought that new just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass I almost went through the roof it did work but
8124217	8129382	This makes me wonder, EA has this crackhead policy of having expiration dates.
8129502	8131004	Why do they have expiration dates?
8131084	8134267	That's a great fucking question that I would like EA to answer.
8135225	8137366	See, I don't understand why they have expiration dates.
8137446	8142409	I understand they'll do that on certain things, like, for example, Ultraviolet.
8142449	8151795	You may notice with a lot of the DVDs and Blu-rays that are out there now, come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy that you can redeem by a certain date.
8152195	8156298	And I'm wondering if it's just because they don't want to keep those copies up on their servers forever.
8156858	8158759	You know, forever or something.
8158939	8163981	It doesn't even make any sense because once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection, you can always stream it.
8164621	8170363	But I just don't understand why on a paid app it can expire like that.
8170443	8177266	And that right there is a perfect example of why going digital only is a bad fucking idea.
8177546	8182488	Because what's going to stop EA or any company from going, Yeah, we just want this game to work anymore.
8183609	8184149	and that's it.
8184209	8185030	You have no recourse.
8185370	8197061	And really, Rock Band is on your phone and you don't need... I mean, I understand if they're shutting down the online music store or they're shutting down the multiplayer or whatever, but how can they...
8197902	8201705	Stop the entire app, including single player, from working.
8201985	8203706	How very dare you, EA.
8204066	8209390	Or if it's a free app, I can see, okay, maybe this is going to expire and a new one's going to come out.
8209510	8212392	There was a Disneytron app that did that, but it was free.
8212692	8215294	But here's the thing, though, and this is kind of pointed out as well.
8215694	8217656	They did something similar with Tetris.
8217796	8220658	Tetris, for example, it expired and stopped working.
8220798	8221478	And guess what?
8221718	8223380	Oh, they sold a new version of Tetris.
8223440	8224400	You can buy it again.
8225921	8228282	What makes you think that they might not try this again?
8228442	8235044	Well, yet PopCap, who is now owned by EA, PopCap did it a little better because they turned Bejeweled 2.
8235164	8239986	They spun off Bejeweled Blitz into its own game, but they made it free.
8240326	8242327	And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop working.
8242367	8244307	You still got that, even though they have Bejeweled 3.
8244347	8249269	They kind of pushed people to go get Bejeweled 3, but they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working.
8250129	8250830	Thanks for watching!
8271957	8272277	I joined it.
8295248	8303272	When the full VOG Network launches soon, I can't tell you when, but it'll be sooner than you think, we'll have a link to that a little more directly.
8304013	8306314	And yes, I am still able to play Bejeweled 2 on my phone.
8307415	8307735	There it is.
8307755	8308215	There's the music.
8313138	8315739	It doesn't surprise me that they would be the ones behind this.
8316650	8316830	Yep.
8317871	8320813	Alright, we're going to go to the mailbag.
8320913	8321774	DarkSakura left the room.
8321794	8322595	She'll be back in a minute here.
8322855	8323415	Nope, here she comes.
8324356	8325557	Every week you guys send us emails.
8325597	8326478	I'm allergic to mail.
8328119	8329500	M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L?
8330681	8331001	Both.
8331422	8334664	Alright, mailbag at orangeloungetrader.com is the place to send us your emails.
8334744	8336186	And DarkSakura might read them.
8338227	8340228	DarkSakura, hopefully you have some emails for us tonight.
8358579	8367007	Speaking of, I know that content downloading from the store on PSP, if interrupted, will have to start completely over, which seems unfortunate for a portable, even considering its age.
8367387	8371110	Does the Vita have this issue, or can software be loaded a little at a time?
8371631	8372071	I don't know.
8373052	8374453	Hey Vita people, will it work?
8375054	8375534	Will it work?
8376735	8377235	Will it blend?
8378296	8379457	Are you even listening?
8380498	8381319	I was kind of tuning out.
8381980	8382260	Sorry.
8383103	8388406	He wants to know if you can download incrementally on the Vita or will you have to start over like on the PSP?
8388606	8391167	Yes, you can download incrementally.
8391548	8397251	If you're in download or whatever, or if you happen to turn your system off or something like that, it will restart where it's at.
8397331	8401493	Yeah, and the Vita really encourages you to put it to sleep, not to turn it off.
8401853	8405295	You sleep it, and while it's sleeping, it'll download your shit, which is good.
8405535	8411601	Yeah, in fact, I keep forgetting that I have mine in sleep mode, like in my bag for like a... And then the battery's dead three days later.
8411641	8411841	Oh, exactly.
8411861	8414224	That's why I was like, oh, shit, I better charge this again.
8414664	8416626	It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP.
8416646	8419109	I'm sure someone sells one, but... They sell one.
8419349	8419749	Oh, do they?
8419929	8420029	Yes.
8420049	8420650	Well, of course they do.
8420970	8422572	But I love that 3DS dock.
8422792	8424734	It makes it so great to remember to charge it.
8424834	8427477	And it's just a cheap piece of plastic, but it works so well.
8428534	8432798	By the way, I almost skipped this email because it said oral advertising, but I saw who sent it.
8434619	8437902	Dearest members of the online video game radio cast Pundidocracy.
8438422	8439983	You thought it was some French spam for a minute.
8440003	8441424	We get inundated with French spam.
8441464	8442185	I don't understand.
8443086	8447229	This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD collection being released on Vita.
8447609	8453093	The very possibility of a collection of games such as this being released on the Vita brought the following questions to my mind.
8453694	8455555	Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3?
8456696	8457877	Stay care, bettertainment.
8458258	8462041	This message has been brought to you by oral advertising sent from my iPad.
8463642	8465704	Well, you don't even get all three games.
8465744	8466705	You only get two of the three.
8467205	8467486	Right.
8467966	8468647	Metal Gear Acid 3.
8468707	8470789	Who are you going to have to blow to get that?
8470889	8472390	Probably... Kojima.
8472570	8473931	Yeah, Kojima, I think.
8474052	8475973	And from what I understand, he's not too into the blow.
8475993	8477014	You'd have to get his ass.
8478015	8483180	I would see Acid 3 more on the 3DS than... Because remember they had the whole...
8483940	8488543	Remember that really weird, like, binoculars garbage that you had to put on there?
8488603	8490444	There also is a Metal Gear something.
8490464	8492745	I can't remember if it came out or not.
8492765	8496528	I don't think it's out yet, but they were demoing one a long time ago, a Metal Gear something on 3DS.
8496708	8497648	Yeah, that came out already.
8497708	8500490	It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.
8501831	8503311	Snake Eater.
8504432	8505753	So, yes?
8508492	8523986	Hey guys, this is Honey Badger, aka Blade 3 Okay, I have to stop and apologize Because Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night While I was drunk off cheap sangria Off my ghetto sangria made from Manischewitz So I'm sorry, I was a little drunk
8525508	8528951	I just wanted to say the listeners will support you no matter what changes you make.
8529712	8534137	Also, I have a question for you all, but I think Loki may have the most input.
8534677	8541184	How close are we to having essentially gaming computers and fancy cases that are just locked down by Microsoft or Sony?
8541505	8545449	Basically, where does the line between high-end console and gaming PCs start?
8547171	8548712	Pretty much that's what they are now anyways.
8548752	8557437	I mean, it's just gaming PCs, but it's proprietary boards and whatnot, and specialized chips that are made specifically for these systems.
8557918	8563021	I wish it was a little bit more like gaming PCs, but I understand why they have limitations.
8563121	8569145	But it would be kind of cool if, for example, you could have an Xbox 360 and be able to upgrade the RAM in it.
8569445	8572627	Like, say, okay, all the games have to run with this amount of RAM,
8572887	8575688	But if you want the games to run a little bit smoother, you can add extra RAM.
8575708	8577408	Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space.
8577468	8580949	I'd be worried, though, about those minimum system requirements slowly bumping up.
8580989	8584190	You know, it's the one thing that makes people a little leery of PC gaming.
8584690	8586091	But RAM's so cheap nowadays.
8586171	8588912	I know, but, you know, then it's the video card.
8588992	8593673	Then it's, you know, the operating system that your thing's running.
8593733	8595954	Then it's the space on your hard drive.
8595974	8596574	Then, you know...
8597213	8598133	If any one thing is another.
8600154	8601074	So next email.
8601374	8603815	I just wanted to say real quick, though, since that was from Honey Badger.
8604015	8606036	I love that name, by the way, because it always makes me think it is.
8606056	8608477	Watch it run in slow motion.
8609877	8611017	It's pretty badass.
8611137	8612738	Look, it runs all over the place.
8612758	8615279	We should get Randall to do a bumper for us.
8615639	8616099	I wish.
8616739	8618100	Listen to Orange Dolls Radio.
8618120	8620180	Don't fuck your shit up.
8620360	8621501	If you're not, you're a bitch.
8626043	8626604	Hey guys, it's Jim Sally.
8627125	8627925	Do I have to do the choo-choo noise?
8644252	8647613	I live in Canada, sorry, and work as a party train conductor.
8648233	8653075	Recently, me and my wife started shopping for Robot Butler, but we can't decide what features we want.
8653095	8653535	Wait a minute.
8653655	8654916	He really is a train conductor?
8655476	8656576	I think he's full of shit.
8656596	8659317	Or is that a... No, I mean like... Let me finish the email.
8659337	8661518	My dad... A party train conductor.
8661778	8661998	Oh, okay.
8662058	8662999	Party train.
8663119	8664079	Legit, legit.
8664279	8668361	My dad, for many years, he recently retired, but for about...
8669861	8674223	45 years he worked for the railroad and he was a train conductor.
8674743	8676364	So when I hear that, I perk up.
8676584	8678405	So I'm just saying.
8678425	8681606	I empathize with the train people.
8683287	8686349	She loves data from Star Trek, but I'm more of an R2-D2 kind of guy.
8686769	8689070	Which fictional robot would you like to have in your real life?
8689850	8692871	Anyway, I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides on the Sally Express.
8693011	8694192	Love you and good night, Jim Sally.
8696321	8696561	E.D.
8696641	8712835	cause she's hot Mass Effect reference that's all I have on the brain recently I think you know maybe the the gigalobot from Artificial Intelligence
8714028	8717029	Does a Cylon count as a robot?
8717490	8719511	Are they cybernetic?
8719631	8724093	I don't want to spoil, but there's a certain Cylon that's really hot.
8724513	8726814	Are they full-on robots or are they cybernetic?
8728966	8731546	Because I can say Angelica Houston from Captain EO.
8732587	8733527	That's a great choice.
8733567	8734788	But she's cybernetic.
8735988	8736868	So are the Borgs.
8737068	8737549	You know what?
8737989	8738689	It's our show.
8738769	8740790	We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please.
8740810	8743391	And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO.
8745011	8747772	Yes, I want Angelica Houston to service me.
8749938	8756100	and I want a certain unsaid very hot Cylon that was revealed in the third season finale.
8757080	8757840	We'll just leave it at that.
8758641	8759421	So what about you, Loki?
8759881	8760701	I want a portal turret.
8760981	8761962	It's technically a robot.
8763422	8764983	Then I'm going to change mine to GLaDOS.
8766303	8768284	I want to be her when I grow up and die.
8770064	8770904	Okay, the last email.
8770944	8771905	You want to be in a potato?
8773185	8773765	You know what?
8774505	8775586	I'll french fry you, bitch.
8777472	8779752	Bitch, I will come back and julienne you.
8779912	8783493	I will take you to In-N-Out and watch them put you in the blender thing.
8785593	8786594	Anyway.
8786774	8787414	You know what, Rob?
8787934	8788154	What?
8789674	8790654	Aw, I'm getting applause.
8791054	8791895	Getting the slow clap.
8792655	8793555	Howdy, OLR.
8793815	8797676	I wanted to call in, but something came up as usual.
8798016	8798316	Really?
8798436	8799496	Is that why they're calling it these days?
8800176	8801896	Therefore, I'm writing you folks instead.
8802256	8805277	I was having a discussion with... We're getting the manual work, I see.
8805817	8806978	So you mean you want them to be Sega?
8826297	8827679	They want them to go first to third.
8828900	8832205	It's a great thing for the fanboys to fantasize about.
8833086	8833927	Ain't gonna happen.
8834668	8837211	Ain't gonna happen, not for a long time.
8837332	8841257	I mean, that will happen over Miyamoto's dead body, literally.
8842578	8852807	Like, you know, it's a Japanese company, and there's a lot of... I don't want to sound rude or mean, but just look at the history.
8852827	8859653	There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that, that they know what the people want, and that's not the way they want to go down.
8859753	8865618	And if you wanted to look for another example of what I'm talking about, the history of this show, we talked a lot about Konami.
8865938	8870582	And Konami, and I had this conversation with a friend just the other day, Konami...
8871042	8882351	Screw, Konami should have had the music, Konami had every right to be the kings of music games in America as well as Japan, but they fucked it up by not taking the risks.
8882671	8891658	They did for a little while when there was a guy in America influencing a lot, but then that guy wasn't around anymore and music games at Konami fell the fuck apart.
8891958	8893239	Case in point, Rock Revolution.
8893579	8894500	I think Nintendo will
8916838	8917058	Yeah.
8917078	8917298	Yeah.
8941193	8945055	Off topic here, I wanted to mention something since I was browsing through the PlayStation Store.
8945516	8951219	I find it a bit ironic that the full game of Ridge Racer happens to be under the demo section.
8954505	8955366	Isn't that a little funny?
8955506	8956006	Is it really?
8956166	8956666	Yes, it is.
8957327	8958428	I gotta pull that down right now.
8958448	8958948	Are you sure?
8959208	8959689	No, no.
8961370	8964692	The one you have to pay $25 for, but it's filed under demo.
8964712	8965633	Oh, I thought you meant it's free.
8965653	8967154	I was like, they screwed up again?
8967194	8967534	No, no.
8968394	8972958	Meaning it's filed under demo because there's no content to it.
8974519	8975099	I think that's funny.
8976403	8976723	All right.
8978124	8978805	Is that it for email?
8979245	8979566	Are we done?
8979606	8979786	Yes.
8980146	8980446	All right.
8980687	8985210	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us emails for a future week.
8985651	8987853	In the meantime, it's time to get renty.
8989174	8989794	Yeah, Fuse of the Week.
9004106	9005007	Fuck Children's Week.
9006576	9007517	Fuck all the Zorphans.
9009158	9009998	Fuck their candy.
9010399	9011099	Fuck their kites.
9012500	9013921	Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake.
9014782	9015582	I don't care anymore.
9016903	9018744	I had the three holidays left.
9019365	9019805	There's three.
9020365	9022167	Children's Week has fucked it for me.
9023327	9023948	Burn in hell.
9025129	9025809	And your matron?
9026309	9026950	Fuck her too.
9028311	9028591	Loki.
9029704	9033248	Effie to my ceiling fan in my living room for breaking.
9033748	9041876	My wife decided to turn the fan on high to dry the floors that she had recently mopped and the switch broke.
9042317	9043358	So we couldn't shut it off.
9043778	9048543	So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan to shut it off manually.
9049224	9051446	But it gets hot in there now.
9055711	9062673	F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland in a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go and my friend's graduating and I'll get to miss it.
9063054	9065114	And F you to Jamie because she'll be, you know.
9065635	9067555	Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me.
9067595	9068216	That's true.
9068516	9068896	Hooray.
9068936	9069496	I can't wait.
9070376	9070957	F you to poop.
9074758	9076479	Unless it was a really good meal.
9076559	9078279	She has been a little drippy lately.
9078519	9079160	Oh, great.
9079260	9079720	Can't wait.
9081104	9081884	You're disgusting.
9081984	9084306	All right, just a few more stories for you guys.
9084326	9087047	And then we're going to open up the Skype line just for a little bit tonight, guys.
9087067	9090649	We're running a little late because of the interview earlier, but I think it was worth it, don't you?
9091009	9092169	Just a few more stories for you guys.
9092229	9092490	Loki.
9093250	9094871	Oh, wait, quickly, quickly.
9095271	9101534	I want to say this because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole Nintendo, and some folks brought up the iPhone.
9102474	9103275	And I must say...
9104304	9105045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9125638	9131166	I could see something like that happening long before the Sony and Xbox thing.
9131206	9134351	That was something that was brought up in chat.
9135012	9135492	What was it?
9136213	9138937	Legend of Zaku said iPhone enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that.
9139778	9141341	Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories.
9141401	9141601	Loki.
9141761	9145185	Alright, let's talk about the dark side of Kickstarter.
9146025	9155415	So there was this Kickstarter for a game titled Mythic the Story of Gods and Men, which is an RPG from this company called Little Monster Productions.
9155975	9157197	It was, of course...
9157757	9168060	This already sounds a little bit outlandish, but it said, to rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim, built together by a team of former Activision Blizzard developers.
9168660	9170221	And the project was asking for $80,000.
9170381	9178243	It raised $5,000 up until a couple days ago.
9178823	9182444	Basically what happened was they actually canceled the funding altogether.
9183264	9211992	and that's because apparently all their assets that they were showing on the site were stolen apparently all the artwork for the game that was supposedly being made was stolen off of different people's deviant art sites also some of the I guess pretty much all of the rewards were stolen from another Kickstarter page the Banner Saga
9213412	9226756	and of course it made it to Reddit and people were warning them online and of course Little Monster Productions responded to the scam saying it seems we've been subjected to false claims of ownership rights to our concepts.
9227116	9231577	The game itself is well in progress and it's not a scam of any kind.
9231617	9232637	Thank you for understanding.
9232677	9235098	If you have any further questions feel free to ask.
9235778	9243682	and then of course since then the Kickstarter account's been deleted and they've kind of disappeared and vanished away.
9244543	9245243	With all that money.
9245584	9255809	Well no, technically not because they have to hit their funding goal of $80,000 in order to keep that money so the $5,000 that was contributed or put down actually didn't go anywhere.
9255829	9259191	It went back to the people that or actually never left the people that put it down.
9259611	9261872	I still think it's a wake-up call.
9262072	9264973	I mean, Kickstarter has really taken off.
9265553	9267053	Everybody wants a piece of it.
9267154	9269934	Because, I mean, for some people, it's like an ATM machine right now.
9270435	9271355	And it's a tricky thing.
9271395	9275216	And I still can't wrap my head around how I really feel about Kickstarter.
9275256	9279097	Because there's some things like, you know, what Random was talking about earlier.
9279137	9280198	And I'm like, you know, cool.
9280258	9282379	And I saw a great piece on the internet this week.
9282399	9283559	An awesome piece about...
9285139	9286860	Amanda Palmer's Kickstarter.
9287180	9293002	And why... And basically the gist of the article is this is why Amanda Palmer gets to do a Kickstarter and you don't.
9293162	9295603	And I thought it was kind of a really neat article.
9296423	9298184	It was really good.
9299325	9299625	I just...
9300945	9305086	If you're going to get into the Kickstarter thing, that's cool, but play smart.
9305806	9308107	And this story is a great example of why.
9308127	9311227	Because it really seems like there's some people out there who are just donating to everything and anything.
9311267	9312788	And, you know, hey, it's your money.
9312848	9313708	Spend it on what you want.
9313728	9314188	Exactly.
9314208	9315828	It can be dangerous, and this is why.
9316048	9316988	Educate yourself.
9317689	9322650	Make sure that you're aware of who you're donating to.
9322750	9324210	I also really think...
9325190	9327391	This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter.
9327971	9339255	Kickstarter needs to allow the person, and maybe they do, and to be fair, maybe they already do this and I just never see people do it, and maybe people should be encouraged to do it more, to set a limit.
9340275	9341836	on how much money is going to be raised.
9342276	9356922	Because when I see certain Kickstarters that ask for $30,000 and I can't even put my head around what you do with $30,000 and get $120,000, it's like... Well, they keep changing.
9356962	9361084	They're allowed to, I guess, change their goals, I guess, on there.
9361444	9365246	But where... I don't know.
9365406	9368067	As a consumer, I want to know where every dollar is going.
9369405	9370225	I'm an investor.
9371166	9378868	And when you invest in a company, there's these things called investor and shareholder meetings where you talk about the company and the progress and where the money is going.
9378888	9386590	But really, all that you are guaranteed out of that is basically what slot you fit into as far as the rewards go.
9386630	9387610	That's all you're guaranteed.
9387630	9389831	And that's my problem with Kickstarter.
9391383	9394585	Well, then don't donate the stuff that you're unaware of.
9394645	9399768	But I will admit, you know, there are some Kickstarters I take interest in, like the Star Control thing we talked about last week.
9399848	9401429	I have to admit, I kind of want that cartridge.
9402069	9403490	That sounded pretty fucking awesome.
9403550	9409393	And, you know, I hear about people like, you know, Random, and certainly the Pink Elephant in the Room.
9409413	9415756	There's other Kickstarters that, you know, obviously we're well aware of, you know, and I wish success for them.
9415937	9418458	But it's just...
9420063	9421445	There's just something about it.
9421505	9425270	Like, I just feel like the other shoe is going to drop on Kickstarter any day now.
9425330	9426391	The bubble's going to burst.
9427352	9429014	And I don't know if I want to be there when it does.
9429795	9431157	Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer.
9432882	9435805	Anyway, well, I mean, not everything gets we still love you, Rob.
9435945	9438007	Not everything gets, you know, funded.
9438067	9446556	I mean, there was the Kickstarter for it was a sequel to God, I remember now what it's called is a PSP game.
9446676	9449659	It wasn't very popular, but they were trying to get a sequel for it.
9450200	9451421	And that fell through.
9452241	9455824	But there is some interesting things on there, and this is another one of those.
9456445	9461489	There's a MMO on there, if you can even call it.
9461749	9463010	It's called Class Realm.
9463050	9470056	It's being developed by some people, I want to say they're in the education system.
9470536	9478279	to basically motivate their students to read more and participate in discussions more and study more as well as learn.
9479640	9481961	And it's called Class Realm.
9483021	9484122	And it's kind of interesting.
9484162	9487443	He says, my kids are the best promoters.
9487523	9490144	He says, they're going around telling other students how great it is.
9490224	9493926	And in my classroom, the other kids come in from other classes for math and science.
9494426	9497508	and they see the classroom stuff on my wall and they want to do it.
9498009	9501171	And other teachers also have been hugely supportive.
9501211	9506314	And basically what he's trying to do is he's creating this classroom thing that's both free and paid as well.
9506375	9512579	You can do the free sharing the tools with the other teachers and then the paid one you get additional things.
9513479	9514940	We covered this a few weeks ago.
9515700	9516801	It's pretty cool.
9517141	9521023	It's actually launched now and he's taking donations.
9521663	9523564	You can pledge towards it.
9523584	9526265	I think it's kind of neat.
9527546	9527846	Alright.
9528427	9529908	Well, let's move on to another story here.
9530248	9536631	We talked about Harmonix earlier in the show, and I want to talk about them again because everybody's kind of wondering, what are they going to do next?
9536851	9543834	Obviously, they have the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network thing that's coming, but you know that can't be the only thing they've been working on for the past few years.
9544634	9547756	Some rumors are leaking out about what we might see very soon.
9547796	9557583	According to some different job listings that were spotted, Harmonix is looking for a narrative content and level designers and one software engineer.
9557603	9563227	They're going to be doing a project that's called, quote, a unique motion gaming IP.
9565049	9572994	Harmonix seeks an accomplished narrative designer to incorporate creative storylines into gameplay on a unique motion gaming IP.
9574431	9575472	Could it be Dance Central 3?
9575932	9577273	Or is this something brand, brand new?
9577293	9582217	Because, you know, Dance Central 2 kind of tried to do the story thing, but it was a little silly.
9582237	9584059	But you don't expect much out of a music game.
9584459	9586220	Could Harmonix be doing something?
9586260	9587461	I mean, maybe it's Dance Central 3.
9587541	9590143	Maybe it's something totally different.
9590163	9590604	You said unique.
9591827	9614396	they did say unique so I like Harmonix Harmonix does a pretty darn good job even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy but it was really an interesting little tool I'm really curious to see what they bring with this I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it but we'll see
9615233	9617054	Well, how about some other news?
9631321	9633683	It's basically, it's called the Toilet.
9633723	9633963	Toilet.
9660683	9671205	and it gives men incentive to pee in the urinal and to play the mini games instead of on the floor and it makes cleaner restrooms.
9674116	9680161	We live in a day and age where you have to give incentive for grown men.
9680782	9683765	Please don't go pee-pee on the floor.
9684205	9686507	And they've had good feedback from customers.
9686568	9688509	It says toilet cleanliness has improved.
9689110	9690772	Now get the price on this one, Rob.
9691632	9692934	There's 130 units out there at 150,000 yen a pop.
9692974	9693554	That's almost $2,000.
9697717	9702920	Now, just to be clear, we have heard about this system before because there was the whole, like, toilet jokes.
9702940	9705501	I've watched an informative video on this before.
9705761	9711384	But what Jamie's talking about is that now Sega's putting it out there where it's really accessible where anybody can get this.
9711404	9715686	You can get this for your personal bathroom if you're, like, into water sports or something weird.
9715706	9723750	Well, to clarify, and there's been a trickle of information about this, the hardware itself is $140,000, which is about $1,700.
9723851	9724011	Okay.
9728092	9731933	The minigames are 10,000 yen a piece, which is $125.
9732653	9740295	And you can get a 10 yen coin box that's 25,000 so that you can pay to pee, I guess.
9742375	9744195	312 bucks, pretty much, for the box.
9744996	9746416	That's a terrible idea.
9746456	9747056	Pay to pee.
9747696	9750057	And they have home options.
9750077	9752237	It'll be on Spirit Airlines next week.
9753240	9761566	and now they have home version options where you can pay $2,000 to pay to pee in your own house.
9761806	9768731	But you can... Well, Giovedea, who is a lady, is in our chat room at vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households badly.
9769031	9771533	Yes, and in college restrooms.
9771593	9775076	But this, honestly, what do ladies have?
9775397	9775977	We can pee.
9777218	9783383	Maybe not directionally pee like men because, you know, it's really hard to aim when, you know, it's close to the hoo-ha.
9783403	9784845	But why take the fun out of trying?
9785065	9786846	We should have, like, poop pressure games.
9789068	9789229	Ew!
9791771	9791971	Ew!
9792591	9794593	Well, ew about the pee, too.
9795374	9796575	At least pee is sterile.
9800265	9817095	I really don't want to talk about this story anymore but I really need to You're the one who gave it to me The show where every gamer has a voice Blackwolf in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says Sign in the men's bathroom of the LAN center I did Friday Night Gaming at You claim to have good aim Now's your chance to prove it
9818917	9831022	Okay, when I was at the University of South Alabama in the humanities building on the second floor in the ladies bathroom, there was a little poem written on the wall in the stall that I would usually use.
9831782	9834643	If you must pee upon the seat, wipe it off and keep it neat.
9837484	9840826	There was also, now get this, a toilet seat cover that I saw.
9841526	9843387	On the top it says, we aim to please.
9844127	9846008	You lift it up, you aim too, please.
9847324	9849445	I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms.
9849465	9850586	We need to talk about this for a minute.
9850606	9853008	Because we don't pee all over everything.
9853328	9860452	I was at a gas station driving to LA and I was at the gas station at 3.30 in the morning because, you know, nature called and I had to go.
9860492	9861993	But the men's restroom was closed.
9862374	9864195	So there was not a soul in this place.
9864335	9868938	So I said to my friend, I said, Victoria, I want you to stand outside this door and if a woman comes, don't let them in.
9869939	9875962	So I went in the woman's restroom and, you know, I opened the door and I'm like, suddenly I'm like, there's like flowers and shit in here.
9875982	9876263	Yeah.
9877043	9877543	Thanks for watching!
9898038	9899459	Check who owns the gas station.
9900119	9906664	I have been in some pretty shithole gas station bathrooms for women, so do not even go there.
9906764	9915390	The Chevron on the way back from Pensacola that's right when you get back into Mobile off the causeway, never go there.
9915470	9915991	It's awful.
9917892	9918212	All right.
9918572	9926458	We're going to move on to some other stories quite quickly, but I do want to point out, because everybody in chat was like, how many listeners did you lose during that segment?
9927048	9929809	We gained one, suckas!
9930310	9931070	You got told!
9931090	9932491	When in doubt, potty jokes!
9933151	9934872	Alright, moving on.
9934892	9937153	We should talk more about that stuff.
9937573	9937794	Right?
9937854	9939294	Let's talk about Microsoft.
9939334	9942596	Coming soon to the VOG Network, Poop Poop Pee Pee Show!
9944397	9945257	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9946318	9954581	Microsoft has patented some sort of arm band that has EMG sensors as well as other electrodes in there.
9955162	9957863	Basically, what it does is it monitors your muscle movements.
9958423	9965306	So, for example, they would have it programmed to where if you made a fist or something like that, that your character would make a fist.
9965726	9969228	Kind of like an extension to the motion tracking and stuff.
9970488	9975411	and I guess it could be applied to other parts of your body like your leg or something like that.
9975471	9983875	But it is kind of interesting that they're potentially going to have some sort of device that allows you to track yourself a little bit better.
9986637	9987357	Pretty soon.
9987797	9990439	I'm just worried about how far those things are going to evolve.
9990459	9990539	Yeah.
9991736	9998175	It is a device that you wrap around an appendage, so the TTP for that, how soon?
10001732	10005474	If you don't know what that is, just move right along.
10005534	10024343	A moment of silence, please, because when I heard this news this week, I almost wanted to call the hotline and send some help over to one of our authors at OrangeLawnTrader.com's house to make sure he was okay.
10024363	10025804	Okay.
10026964	10031746	La Mulana in North America and Europe has been cancelled on WiiWare.
10032147	10036789	And Dark Tetsuya, bless his heart, was really excited about that game.
10036809	10039130	Like, really excited about that game.
10039530	10045073	And it was in development, and in development, and in development, and finally they just said...
10046173	10048455	Fuck it, we're not releasing it on the Wii.
10048775	10056761	Now there is some good news, it is coming out on the PC, so maybe it'll be on Steam or something like that, but it was cancelled.
10056781	10058862	I thought that was already on PC.
10060123	10065147	I think this is like a plus version or like an enhanced version of the game that's coming out.
10065567	10071652	You know, we were waiting on it for two years, and basically at the end of the day they just came out and said, WiiWare ain't profitable anymore.
10072230	10073471	That's what everyone's been saying.
10073571	10075092	That's something they need to fix.
10075172	10081297	And a lot of that is Nintendo's shitty guidelines where it's like you have to sell so many units before you even get like a check.
10081637	10086421	Keep that up and you won't have anybody but yourselves publishing on that service.
10088010	10091053	So, you know, just a moment.
10092455	10093816	Rest in peace, La Mulana.
10094797	10095278	On the Wii.
10095478	10096879	I mean, at least it'll be coming out on the play.
10096940	10098241	It did look like a cute game.
10098441	10099502	I was interested in it.
10099522	10101925	Why can't they put that on, like, you know, Xbox Indie games?
10101945	10103627	That's a great effing question.
10104087	10105929	You know, Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.
10105949	10107771	Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it.
10107811	10109393	But it seems like they don't like to talk much.
10111819	10130934	Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show why Nintendo fails at digital distribution SJ100 Matt says but then again it was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people are not placing the blame on the makers of La Mulana but they are placing the blame squarely at Nintendo's feet which I can't say I disagree with Shall we open up the Skype line?
10130994	10131534	We shall.
10131554	10138420	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call Ranma just announced that he's a classy whore
10139383	10142465	Thank you for that on our program.
10143125	10152951	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or again our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give our show a call and talk about any news stories we may have missed or your opinion on what have you.
10153812	10155953	Sadly, Random is long gone now.
10156013	10157254	He's off to work on something else.
10157314	10160456	We can't let you ask him a question but we can talk about what he talked about.
10161236	10164058	In the meantime, do we have any last-minute stories here in studio?
10164078	10169341	I'm going to fire up the Twitter and see if anyone sent us anything to talk about on twitter.com slash OLR.
10171162	10175445	But first... Oh, never mind.
10175485	10176146	A call's coming in.
10176326	10176706	Look at that.
10176766	10177626	Saved from last-minute stories.
10177967	10178887	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10178907	10179227	Who's this?
10179908	10181389	It's that classy whore Ranma.
10184003	10186865	and I. Hey ho, what's up?
10189186	10190146	Not too much.
10190166	10195128	I do have a couple things I want to cover before I get out of here and start off my hellish work week.
10195868	10196089	Yep.
10197229	10204192	First things first, as per orders of the great and mighty powerful Rob, I went to Chinatown Fair.
10206313	10210795	Yeah, I'm curious to hear what you thought about Chinatown Fair because what I read on Twitter was interesting.
10211508	10212669	Uh-oh.
10213590	10214830	That sums it up right there.
10218333	10221655	I wasn't expecting this.
10222015	10222796	I really wasn't.
10223196	10230141	And I'm posting a link to the complete total of eight photos I took there because all I needed was eight photos.
10232079	10233679	I'm scared.
10234499	10238400	It's not even trying to be a Dave & Buster's wannabe.
10238760	10246541	It's like the kid brother little bastard of Dave & Buster's that nobody talks to.
10248042	10248622	Chuck E. Cheese?
10249902	10250582	Not even!
10251622	10252483	Not even.
10252623	10256923	There's some skee-ball and the spinny wheel for tickets and a basketball thing.
10256943	10258344	Terminator Salvation's cool.
10259084	10260924	Guitar Hero Arcade some people like.
10262395	10276817	and if you notice over in the corner I only got one, it's a picture but right next to that one big screen TV there's another big screen TV that's not even on and they don't even have HDMI cables hooked up for the console
10278888	10280069	Hey, they got a Plinko game.
10280109	10282330	I didn't know they made those for the prices, right?
10282350	10283231	Oh, Rob, you and Plinko.
10283271	10285712	Look at all... I mean, it looks like a lot of... The ditter.
10286012	10289414	Okay, it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember got replaced with ticket spitters.
10289755	10291496	Welcome to every other arcade in America.
10291656	10293637	I mean, it's sad, but that's what's happened.
10294678	10298000	I know, but I wasn't expecting something like this, though.
10298180	10298500	I mean...
10301355	10308320	When I spoke to one of the guys who told me about this, he flat out said the new owner has no clue as to what he's doing.
10308620	10312923	And he's trying to convince the owner to get in some actual good games.
10314284	10316605	Okay, well that, you know, and it is a new arcade.
10317085	10320768	So let's give, I mean, yes, it's an old arcade, but it's new owners or whatever.
10321288	10322169	Let's give them a chance.
10323424	10332188	That's what everybody was saying, because at first we're all outside, sitting on the stoop, bad-mouthing and cursing up a storm about this.
10332868	10336369	And then we're like, you know, we'll give them about 30 days.
10336750	10337310	Just to see.
10337570	10340791	Yeah, go back in a month and see what changes, if anything.
10340831	10343572	And if nothing changes, well then, shit, they didn't learn anything.
10344893	10346033	You know, give it a chance.
10347874	10349915	We're trying, and we're walking around like...
10350799	10355541	The first thing we started raising with the fact that it is a pump-it-up machine because nobody plays pump-it-up.
10356341	10359022	It's funny, in the picture, that's the only machine I see a crowd around.
10360303	10361143	That's the sad part.
10361763	10363504	It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets.
10365165	10368106	Well, there was a Terminator Salvation machine I saw there too, and a couple others.
10369270	10371131	and Superbikes2.
10371191	10374013	Hey, you know what Chinatown Fair looks like right now?
10374574	10375935	Roseville Golf Land.
10376435	10377516	Welcome to my world.
10377996	10381018	The funny thing is that's the first thing that came to mind.
10381098	10384660	I'm like, maybe, I think this is it.
10384720	10388263	Maybe we were on the same wavelength at that time for that five seconds, Rob.
10388343	10391985	I'm so glad that the East Coast now has a place where video games go to die.
10392045	10392786	Congratulations.
10395345	10398006	Yes, we'll take that with a badge of honor.
10398246	10398607	All right.
10399007	10400988	Ranma, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
10404769	10407391	No, I'm just still in disgust from Chinatown Fair.
10408671	10410152	I'm going to pretend I never saw that.
10410312	10411172	All right, go take a shower.
10411613	10411873	All right.
10412953	10415134	There's not enough bleach in the world, damn it.
10415734	10418756	All right, bye, Ranma.
10418896	10419336	Bye.
10419356	10423358	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10424235	10428839	Speaking of Ranma, he passed along a little giveaway we're going to have in just a little bit here on the show.
10429179	10431401	I'm waiting until the very end because that's how I roll.
10433602	10434083	Let's see.
10434283	10437726	Going to some of our tweets that we have tonight.
10438066	10440108	Tigerclaw, of course, sent us a few tweets here.
10441188	10447233	One of them is about Miyamoto's DS patent that will offer upgraded tourist hunting techniques.
10448054	10449375	That sounds kind of interesting.
10449415	10450356	I hadn't heard about this.
10451156	10451737	Apparently...
10453337	10463779	If this is a real deal, there could be some type of advancement in GPS technology in tourist-heavy areas like museums and haunted house type places, and I'm imagining things like Disneyland.
10464620	10475042	This patent would have a system where an overhead grid of infrared positional information transmitters reads a user's DS to light up floor patterns and potential walkways.
10475442	10479783	The user can pick which route they'd like to take, reading tourist facts along the way.
10480123	10480603	Thanks for watching!
10502068	10509316	Technically, there's iPhone apps and stuff that do all that, but this is a different way of implementing that technology that you know would be pretty stable.
10510037	10512921	So, sounds very interesting to me.
10513722	10515043	Let's go to the phones and take another call.
10515083	10516545	Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.
10516565	10517025	Who's this?
10517085	10518067	Hey, Zaku, what's up, buddy?
10519208	10523492	Nothing much, just trying to reiterate what Ranma has said about CF.
10523973	10529878	I heard it from my sources a couple of days before it opened that it was going to be radically different.
10530058	10534603	It wasn't going to be anything near what the old CF was.
10536173	10552894	And I guess, in a way, I've got to give them the benefit of the doubt that, sure, they may have a rocky and uneven open just for the fact that it's out of place for what people would normally refer to as CF.
10553752	10571822	But then again, if the owner doesn't make a change quickly, then he's going to lose these folks for quite a while because they're going to go to Brooklyn to Next Level Arcade where the remnants of CF who used to run the place are pretty much alive and thriving there, especially the fighting game community.
10572743	10576765	Let me play devil's advocate for a minute here because this is a question I should have asked on the last call.
10577390	10581891	Yeah, they might lose the fans that used to go, but is it possible that they'll gain fans?
10581911	10583891	I mean, arcades do this for a reason, right?
10584151	10591613	Yeah, but it might be a demographic that doesn't bode well for that area.
10591713	10599834	I mean, the way I describe a CFer is someone who's basically male, about 20-ish, into video games, very competitive.
10600434	10603895	So that type of demographic pretty much held that place together for...
10604795	10607430	for the last years of its old existence.
10608820	10614261	because it was mostly fighting games and to an extent our community, the DDR community.
10615341	10635326	So to have something that barely resembles that and something where the old guard of CF are pretty much at their own place right now that caters to that demographic, it's not going to do any justice right away if that old location has nothing more than just a mini DMV.
10639301	10641162	I mean, that's pretty much what I'm getting at.
10642662	10646524	You have so much space that they crammed with arcade machines left and right.
10647024	10651586	Like, just about every place, wall to wall, just literally, just covered in arcades.
10651626	10657388	And now they're just like, there's not that many at the moment, but as I said, I give them the benefit of the doubt because they just opened up.
10657808	10662590	So, unless this new owner doesn't like, doesn't take in, you know, doesn't like...
10663630	10671498	Unless this owner actually does something in terms of writing this course and trying to draw more people in there in order to stay alive.
10671518	10672720	Let me ask this question, though.
10672980	10674722	Is it maybe already a lost cause?
10674962	10676343	It depends.
10676464	10678746	How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money?
10679466	10705456	I know of another place like out in Queens in the city Peter Pan Games which is almost similar but it's more lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere it's like the only best you know in other words New York's only 2DX machine is out there as well as like an unlocked X2 but it has redemption games but the thing is that these redemption aren't just like some Mickey Mouse prizes they're like real big ticket items like iPads
10705976	10718797	and the coupled with the fact that it's on a strip mall with which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood so it's partly it's almost like what CF is but it's like what CF is right now is an infancy of what Peter Pan games is already at
10720393	10729177	So it's at a point where unless they start drawing in something that will keep whales like myself, they'll draw them in there.
10729317	10734299	In other words, you'll have a clientele that will constantly spend money there and will keep your place alive.
10734839	10735900	They're just doomed to failure.
10736580	10742822	They're going to need that type of customer or else they're just going to succumb to whatever tourists they get, if any.
10744283	10744643	All right.
10745123	10747184	Well, Zaku, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10747204	10748545	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10749861	10768427	Other than cheating in MLB 2K12, I'm not a baseball fan, but the fact that people could actually exploit a game just to make money and 2K basically denying that the exploit was illegal, even though they originally said it was.
10769508	10771731	I guess they just have egg in their face right now.
10771751	10773893	It's like tainted that whole competition.
10773934	10777678	They're going to have a shitty finale and they only have themselves to blame.
10778579	10779060	Exactly.
10779140	10788091	And they basically fell on their own sword for basically denying that said cheat was illegal even though it's technically allowed.
10789022	10790183	Zaku, I gotta let you go, buddy.
10790323	10790663	Take care.
10790743	10791163	Have a good one.
10791303	10792003	Have a good one.
10816512	10821913	for an Xbox 360 Avatar Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4 hoodie.
10821973	10826934	So if you want your Avatar on Xbox to be wearing a hoodie, we're going to give one of these away.
10826994	10830014	And the good news is you can actually use this with male or female.
10830034	10831555	There's a male code and a female code.
10831575	10832875	So technically you get two codes.
10833215	10837596	So I'm going to give it to one person, so maybe one for you and one for your SO or what have you.
10837996	10844837	All you have to do is send me a private message in our chat room at vognetwork.com right now with one reason...
10845532	10873703	you love VOG one reason you love VOG make it up, I don't care tell me one reason you love VOG it can be as silly or as serious as you want send Sky, just double click on my name and send me one reason you love VOG and we're gonna pick a random person to receive a Sonic 4 hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks Network tonight so there you go, and Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought to you by Anime Jam Session yes, fair enough, fair enough check out Anime Jam Session
10875310	10876373	at AnimeJamSession.com.
10877054	10879119	All right, send those private messages into Sky right now.
10879641	10883410	And while I collect those messages, you have about three minutes to do that.
10884412	10884673	Loki.
10886661	10908071	uh so yeah I have uh I guess the last minute story uh Taito put out a game for Akira about 25 years ago on the Famicom and it's finally been fan translated so you can check that there's a patch available for that um yeah so it's out there just google it um
10910000	10913445	Yeah, I was just going to talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing.
10913866	10914366	It kind of sucks.
10914767	10922799	Basically, the exploit they used is they adjusted the lineup of batters on the opposing team and removed the best players.
10923460	10925122	And so it made it a little bit easier to...
10925683	10926564	Pitch a Perfect Game
10955864	10956345	No, it's not.
10956866	10961717	Or, well, we stand by the people that we chose as the top eight.
10963584	10992226	so they're just kind of rolling with it and I mean if you think about it they fucked up and they didn't program this exclusive mode for this the perfect pitch mode or whatever perfect game challenge they fucked it up and unfortunately I guess they'll just next year patch that out but it is unfortunate that they don't just start the whole thing over again but that's the way that is alright
10993263	10994344	Anything else in the last minute stories?
10994684	10996146	Sorry, I'm not totally paying attention.
10996166	10997267	I'm trying to collect the VOG stuff.
10997607	10998147	All right, guys.
10998568	11001030	We're going to close it up, the contest.
11001070	11001410	Here we go.
11001490	11002271	I'm going to read you.
11002491	11004693	I'm going to read DarkSakura and Loki these answers here.
11004733	11005634	You tell me which one's your favorite.
11005654	11006494	I'm not going to tell you who said it.
11007215	11008476	So here it is, and we'll pick a winner from this.

11016923	11019305	Because listening to VOG at work makes my day enjoyable.
11019986	11022207	because we can chant VOG at wrestling events.
11022487	11023987	V-O-G, V-O-G.
11025107	11029508	I love VOG because it's got a host who asked Jiggly Kayente a question on the reunion of Drag Race.
11030789	11037610	I love VOG because I want that stupid Sonic hoodie for name redacted because he would be so excited and that would keep him quiet for the whole night.
11038671	11040571	I love VOG because every gamer has a voice.
11041491	11043032	OLR is a great reason I love VOG.

11047439	11050281	I love VOG because I can make the initials mean dumb stuff.

11060025	11060645	It's a tough one.

11082067	11082888	Thank you for playing.
11083629	11084910	I bet one of those was Shane.
11085911	11087693	Yes, the Shane was the one with the name redacted.
11088874	11090716	Because this sounded like something you would say.
11091077	11096263	I would have picked the Jiggly Kayente one personally, but sorry, I should have stated you'd have to woo the other host over too.
11096863	11097164	Alright.
11099606	11102828	Alright, so congratulations again, SSJ100 Matt, the code is yours.
11102868	11110232	Honestly, if I had not been aware of RuPaul's Drag Race Jiggly Kayente sounds like a flavor of a Jello Jiggler.
11113854	11120858	Alright, that's about going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry, but not before we go around and collect everybody's final thoughts.
11121638	11124500	My final thought tonight, I'm hungry, I'm ready to eat.
