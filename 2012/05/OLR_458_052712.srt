2
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:39,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,783
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with my co-host here in studio.

4
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:49,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back tonight, the one and only DarkSakura.

5
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:50,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

6
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, you missed a fun show last week.

7
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:55,526
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't because I was eating a bucket of meat.

8
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that is a little better, but we'll talk more about that in a minute.

9
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was very sad though.

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent you my support from afar as I was eating barbecue chicken.

11
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Now for those that don't know what Bucket of Meat is, dot dot dot.

12
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the Big Thunder Barbecue restaurant at Disneyland.

13
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:10,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

14
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:13,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Where it's like 30 bucks a head and you get all you can eat meat.

15
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:22,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Like beef ribs, sausages, chicken, cornbread, coleslaw, beans.

16
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:26,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all come in these big shiny, well not kind of shiny, but big iron buckets.

17
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:32,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Which a couple people ran off with one Are you a fan of finding big sausages at Disneyland?

18
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:42,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, oh yes Rob Alright, also say hello joining us tonight to Tech Master Loki That sounds like a southern Brazilian barbecue

19
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of does a little bit.

20
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,985
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brazilian barbecue is amazing.

21
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, though.

22
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:49,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornbread could make it better.

23
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,047
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

24
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they did have cornbread.

25
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,012
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, the people there on the stage performing did You Got a Friend in Me, all kind of bluegrassy.

26
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:57,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, how fun.

27
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,353
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

28
00:01:58,653 --> 00:01:58,934
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

29
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,577
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go around and talk about how our weeks were in video games.

30
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, I want to start off tonight talking about what happened last week.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the podcasters are sitting here going, wait a minute, Dark Sakura was on the last show.

32
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:12,624
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a show on the feed last week.

33
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have to say one thing for Geovidea.

34
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,666
[SPEAKER_08]: That place did have vegetarian options.

35
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:21,269
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a skewer with peppers and vegetables and tofu.

36
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, isn't that special?

37
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:24,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was delicious.

38
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, off food, on show.

39
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:30,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, it's cool that they have vegetarian options, but I mean, it's bucket of meat.

40
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,096
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was bucket of salad, I wouldn't be touching the place.

41
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:37,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Same if I was a vegetarian and I went to a place that's called bucket of meat, probably wouldn't be my thing.

42
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, look, last week's show.

43
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:45,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So, live, we were here last week live, and no, this is not a case of me being lazy and not updating the podcast feed.

44
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:46,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what happened.

45
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:56,154
[SPEAKER_06]: We were live, we were doing a show, and while we were in the middle of the classic Game of the Week segment, which as you know is always at the end of the first half, the power went out.

46
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,976
[SPEAKER_06]: The power shut off in the apartment.

47
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just my place.

48
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:01,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the whole unit.

49
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the whole stretch.

50
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,080
[SPEAKER_06]: We still don't know to this tonight what caused the issue.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, what happened is that it caused the live listeners got to hear at least half a show.

52
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:18,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But because we were unable to retrieve the MP3 from backup, which, you know, if you want to get technical, it's not really an MP3.

53
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,289
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a raw Adobe Audition file.

54
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was all wrong.

55
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It was too much to be able to fix.

56
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And props to Travis from Understation Live.

57
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,076
[SPEAKER_06]: He tried to fix it.

58
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: He tried to go in and move the little packets that were out of order.

59
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,902
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said after about 10 minutes worth of show, he gave up.

60
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't blame him.

61
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the patience for that either.

62
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:40,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like trying to knit something.

63
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, last week's show is gone.

64
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to catch you up a little bit on what you missed last week.

65
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:52,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So last week we were joined here in studio by Flaco Jones, who you might know if you listen to Horde House.

66
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,657
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the number one fan of Horde House, my Warcraft show.

67
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think he'd been on OLR.

68
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,539
[SPEAKER_06]: He certainly had never been on as a host before.

69
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:03,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he'd even been on as a guest in a very long time.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,242
[SPEAKER_06]: He talked a lot about his days working at Konami and some of the stuff he got to beta test.

71
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:11,123
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a league tester on the Winx games, which I'm really sad.

72
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:14,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the part of the show you guys... Do you still have that raw file?

73
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:20,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, and it's like, that's the part of the show I might have to string together and put on Twitter so you guys can hear it.

74
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, you should just send it to me and maybe I'll... Yeah, we'll see.

75
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:26,315
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, oh man, that's the part of the show you really have to hear, if anything else.

76
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:36,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a couple important revelations that came up last week, too, that for the OLR continuity, because believe it or not, this show has a storyline over the past 10 years.

77
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:41,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very important you understand one of the discussions we had last week, so we're going to re-have it a little bit here tonight.

78
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I play a lot of Minecraft.

79
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,651
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Minecraft.

80
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,052
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Minecraft.

81
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very sad when I see you signing on and you're not playing Minecraft.

82
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer usually.

83
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:09,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,551
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the deal.

85
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,333
[SPEAKER_06]: As you guys know, a few months ago on the show, we talked about, you know what?

86
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:16,933
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried Minecraft.

87
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get it.

88
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:19,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

89
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,336
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you that are into Minecraft, it's cool.

90
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,557
[SPEAKER_06]: But for us, we don't understand.

91
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,518
[SPEAKER_06]: All hell broke loose when the 360 version came out.

92
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:31,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for me, it was about, oh, there's a tutorial mode that is explaining the point.

93
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,483
[SPEAKER_06]: This game now has a point.

94
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:43,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And once I kind of was able to get the basic parts down, and plus it's important to note that the 360 version really simplifies crafting and da-da-da-da-da.

95
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I understood all that, I was like, okay, I'm into this.

96
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki, I'm imagining it's a similar thing for you.

97
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

98
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:56,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through part of the tutorial, not even the whole tutorial, just the very basic stuff.

99
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:05,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And once I figured out, okay, this is iCraft stuff, this is how you do this, this is what this is for, okay, I'm just going to start my own world and did that.

100
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:06,582
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

101
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:06,943
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

102
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:07,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Tacos.

103
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:14,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DarkSakura has yet to try Minecraft on the 360 and she has not been turned yet, but we're working on her.

104
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,069
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

105
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,770
[SPEAKER_08]: If I have to pay for it, probably not.

106
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:18,476
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

107
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:58,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's another important comparison I brought up last week that the podcasty folks didn't get to hear because we realize there's been a lot of slamming on the 360 by the PC fans because it's not as advanced.

108
00:06:58,554 --> 00:06:59,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's based on an earlier version of the game.

109
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:08,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other big, big, big one I hear is the finite size of the map is only, what, 1024 by 1024, which for me is big enough.

110
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I got enough to work with, but I understand where the PC fans, especially if you're playing a bunch of people on one of those servers, really...

111
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:16,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Civilization 4, Civilization 5

112
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:54,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Really quick when you don't have hours and hours and hours to play Civ 5 because Civ 5 can go for hours and hours and hours.

113
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But Civ Rev is a really good way to kind of get a quick fix.

114
00:07:57,147 --> 00:08:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So I enjoyed both games and I think that's where I'm at with Minecraft now.

115
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:06,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of me getting into the 360 version, Alan has been obsessed with the PC version lately.

116
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, I see just like kind of getting ideas.

117
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first things I did after I built a few things was...

118
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:17,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what are cool things I could build on the 360 version?

119
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did a bunch of internet searches on YouTube, well, just YouTube searches and stuff.

120
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:25,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just kind of bookmarked a bunch of things that I wanted to make.

121
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I did that.

122
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of cool mods like Industry Craft and stuff like that that you could build machines that will do mining for you and ridiculous stuff like power drills and batteries and stuff.

123
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:44,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Piping, and all sorts of crazy stuff But, I mean, it's really cool And I hope they implement

124
00:08:45,225 --> 00:09:10,527
[SPEAKER_06]: within the next week I want to go back and give another game a try that I originally kind of I didn't really diss it on the show but I just kind of gave it a review of I don't get it lol and that's the game Terraria because supposedly that's the 2D Minecraft so now that I get Minecraft I'm going to try Terraria again and I'll let you guys know next week how that goes because that's something else I want to explore oh by the way since we did bring it up Civ 5 is on sale on Steam today for $7.49

125
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,376
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend's been playing it on Xbox.

126
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:13,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Becky's husband.

127
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:57,880
[SPEAKER_06]: there is no Civ 5 on Xbox you must be thinking Civilization Revolution which is the game I mentioned a minute ago but I've been watching that and it actually is pretty cool except you know that's totally not my thing just like Minecraft 360 it's a good way to get your feet wet with the series other things you might have missed last week we had an exclusive story but we're going to repeat that at the top of tonight's show so we'll come back to that in a minute

128
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys missed a lot last week.

129
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was also the Classic Game of the Week.

130
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:14,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for housekeeping purposes, we decided because Jim was not able to finish his Classic Game of the Week, we're not going to have that officially be the Classic Game of the Week.

131
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,954
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to invite him back on the show whenever he wants to come back as a fourth host even and let him finish what he started.

132
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:27,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie said she would kindly give over the Classic Game of the Week segment whatever week he comes back so he can finish what he started that night.

133
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So just, and if you didn't, if you don't know what the classic game is, well, I have to leave some suspense.

134
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll just have to figure it out in a later week.

135
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was about it.

136
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was all the stuff that came up last week that was important and worth mentioning.

137
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:46,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get into how is your gaming, oh, VOG Network.

138
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:48,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say really quickly about VOG Network.

139
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday night, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

140
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:56,790
[SPEAKER_06]: The next phase of VOG will be revealed.

141
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:13,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm teasing a teaser, but I think if you guys are really interested in what we're up to and what the full vision is here, and I know there's a lot of people out there who still have questions like, why did you leave where you were at before just to do yet another radio network?

142
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:17,068
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more to it than a radio network, and some of that is going to be unveiled soon.

143
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:18,389
[SPEAKER_06]: on Friday.

144
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:19,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited about that.

145
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, Friday, 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, right here at vognetwork.com.

146
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:29,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to have an interview at 6.30 tonight, and I teased that on the Twitter a little bit.

147
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:30,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Her name is Susan.

148
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,401
[SPEAKER_06]: She's with the website hackedonexbox.com.

149
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:39,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to talk a little bit about what... She's basically the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week.

150
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that with love.

151
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:42,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Nancy Drew.

152
00:11:43,149 --> 00:12:05,887
[SPEAKER_06]: but she really got down to the bottom of what is really going on on Xbox 360 with what they're not calling Xbox hackings but Xbox jackings and we'll talk a little bit about the difference and why that is hopefully we get her on the show here in 10 minutes unfortunately just we don't see her it's kind of like that interview we had two weeks ago where the dude disappeared for a little bit

153
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard from her on Twitter or Skype today these things happen especially because her piece got picked up by a lot of the big gaming blogs she might just be very popular and in demand right now so we're gonna see if we can't get her on if we can't we'll just roll it over to a later week when she can come on but we'll check in with you guys in 10 minutes

154
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,859
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you've been out for a week.

155
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:29,680
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming weeks?

156
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually played stuff.

157
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Played lots of things.

158
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:35,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I still haven't played Mass Effect.

159
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:36,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very sorry.

160
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:42,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a lot of Portal 2 while I was out.

161
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:48,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Words with Friends because I figure since I already paid for it, Zynga already got my damn money.

162
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, while I'm at work, it's kind of something I can keep up with Dan.

163
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been keeping up with that.

164
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I did try to play Draw Something, but I'm using the free version just because I want to see what all the fuss is about.

165
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:00,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

166
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:04,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

167
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:07,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I started playing a lot more Fractal.

168
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:13,679
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, if you look on my Facebook fan page for Jamie Summers, hint, hint,

169
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I posted a screencap of what Fractal looks like.

170
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:22,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to be actually showcasing a different game on Steam that I'm playing.

171
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So that everyone can see what it is.

172
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be starting Fallout New Vegas again.

173
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:28,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Just starting over from scratch.

174
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:30,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm playing Droplets.

175
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:31,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Droplets on iPhone.

176
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:34,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of weird and not as fun as playing it on Steam.

177
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And I played some WoW.

178
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,121
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've really been playing Diablo 3.

179
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a crap ton of it last night.

180
00:13:42,223 --> 00:14:06,532
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was like you know what this is like playing Ragnarok online without people this is great so I've really been getting into Diablo and because it was free because I signed over the blood pact it was free with a big footnote yeah well as you saw what you know when I told my friend on Facebook that it was free he said great how Dan said she signed her life away for a year for a year

181
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, you know, is what?

182
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,590
[SPEAKER_08]: A third over?

183
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's not bad.

184
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think everyone's playing Diablo because I'll log on to WoW and say, Hey, where's all my peeps at?

185
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're all on Diablo.

186
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:23,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

187
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I've been playing some more Puzzle Bobble again.

188
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:29,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust a Move.

189
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:33,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I really love that game and it's really great to play when...

190
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:41,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is, but when I'm sick, and I'm over my cold, guys, I just sound like I'm on the tail of it, but I slept for two days.

191
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:42,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It was glorious.

192
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really sick two weeks ago, you might remember, and I'm still coughing.

193
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still having coughing fits.

194
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,091
[SPEAKER_08]: People at my work.

195
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:53,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And see, I had that sinus attack, and then I had it bad at Disneyland, and then I came back to a full-blown cold.

196
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:54,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran a fever.

197
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I just remembered?

198
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I have coffee brewing in the kitchen.

199
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you do.

200
00:14:58,218 --> 00:14:58,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

201
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:07,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so when I'm sick, it's like I don't really have this mental focus.

202
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:13,126
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I think when my brain shuts down, I become really fantastic at puzzle games.

203
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:17,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was like clearing out levels on Fractal that I had never been able to pass before.

204
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And for anyone, it's not an easy game.

205
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:27,294
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is not very easy because you've got so much to keep in mind with the direction of how your little things move.

206
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I still tell everyone, get Fractal.

207
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:31,076
[SPEAKER_08]: It is worth the money.

208
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It is such a fun game.

209
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:35,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's called Fractal.

210
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:36,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Make blooms, not war.

211
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:42,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope that they pay me for my sponsorship because I am doing that for free.

212
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:52,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm also supposed to be sitting down because our friend loaned us the Street Fighter Cross Tekken.

213
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:57,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm kind of afraid to try it because I do not want to play against the Mega Man.

214
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,994
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm thinking about it.

215
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So, meh.

216
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play anything other than Minecraft?

217
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:05,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Minecraft.

218
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of Minecraft.

219
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:07,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

220
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,908
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

221
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,422
[SPEAKER_06]: He built the Deep Run Tran.

222
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:34,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he did.

223
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:41,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we are talking that Loki started playing Minecraft, we're not fucking around.

224
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:44,710
[SPEAKER_06]: He is really into Minecraft.

225
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's great is when I go into Loki's world, I can hear Nelly laughing in the background whenever something stupid happens.

226
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's got to be into this a little bit too, right?

227
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:54,837
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not into it at all.

228
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:57,999
[SPEAKER_05]: She keeps asking me, aren't you sick of this game yet?

229
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,980
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the point of this game?

230
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, there is no point.

231
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like Legos.

232
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Legos for men!

233
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:08,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And girls.

234
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been playing Minecraft more than Call of Duty this week.

235
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play Call of Duty, though.

236
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:20,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got to check out the new... Well, they're maps technically for the new game type face-off.

237
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,376
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can use them for anything.

238
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:29,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been playing on them for just our deathmatch maps since we only have like two to four people usually playing at a time.

239
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, three to four people, but

240
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:37,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It's perfect for what we use it for, so we've been actually enjoying those quite a bit.

241
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: However, one of the new maps, Ground, it's quite apparent that the spawn points in there aren't that random.

242
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:57,379
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one time I literally killed somebody and they spawned again right in front of me, so I knifed them to death and then they spawned again right in the next room.

243
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, that's pretty close.

244
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see other things.

245
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:04,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go back to Minecraft.

246
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing I did in Minecraft this week is I explored the whole map or as much of the map as I could because I was looking for a spot to dig with dynamite.

247
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I did because I duped a bunch of dynamite and that kind of stuff.

248
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:23,910
[SPEAKER_05]: We also made a portal to the nether and went there and I got my glowstone and I don't remember what it's called.

249
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the dirt that's all in the ender that you can set on fire and that will burn forever.

250
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:29,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool.

251
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:36,027
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's some other like sand soul sand or something that makes people walk slow I don't really know what the point would that be for um

252
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

253
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:07,438
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm slowly hollowing it out for I don't know what purpose.

254
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just doing it right now.

255
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,601
[SPEAKER_08]: You should fill it with candy.

256
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have candy.

257
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't fill it with candy yet.

258
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,295
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Minecraft isn't a 10.

259
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:14,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only about a 9.

260
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:20,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You should fill it with whatever those things that try to kill you are.

261
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no coffee and there's no candy.

262
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are... Well, see, you're Jewish.

263
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:24,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill it with sheep.

264
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say there are pork chops, which is pretty exciting.

265
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:28,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, there is cake.

266
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:29,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Fill it with cake.

267
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:31,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Fill it with cake and sheep.

268
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, throw sheep down the hole.

269
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,300
[SPEAKER_05]: You apparently can.

270
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,601
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I don't know if you've noticed, if you pick up an egg... Have you tried throwing an egg?

271
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll create a chicken.

272
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:43,248
[SPEAKER_06]: www.DarkSakura.com

273
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:16,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, are you talking about an automated death machine for chickens?

274
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I've actually thought of that.

275
00:20:19,237 --> 00:20:19,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is safe.

276
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've thought of that for the pigs, and I actually built a trap to catch the pigs, but it doesn't seem to work too well because when you sleep or whatever, the animals respawn and they don't stay in the pen that I made, which is kind of lame.

277
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,103
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

278
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,218
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

279
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:31,781
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I tried putting a glass top ceiling in one of the caves under the ocean and I kept drowning myself when I did that so I said, eh, fuck that.

280
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:32,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not doing that.

281
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, at least.

282
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:35,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I did.

283
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I also played the Pocket Edition.

284
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:38,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Pocket Edition's pretty fun.

285
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,283
[SPEAKER_06]: More Minecraft.

286
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:42,605
[SPEAKER_06]: My Gaming Week.

287
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:47,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play a lot of new stuff, mostly because I've been content playing Diablo 3.

288
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:57,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3 has got a big multiplayer thing going on this weekend, and I don't know what made me think I would even remotely possibly hit that goal of promoting three people during the weekend, but, you know, I've

289
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,983
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

290
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:25,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought an iPad.

291
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I bought one of the new iPads and, you know, I wanted one.

292
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really not going to give you any better reason than that.

293
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:32,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted one.

294
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:49,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a slightly different position at work now where I might be doing some more travel-oriented things again and I thought the iPad would come in very handy for that because my laptop is kind of getting a little bit old and there is some stuff you can do with an iPad and some of that does include remote taping and broadcasting a podcast.

295
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:50,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I've thought of that too.

296
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:56,505
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, before I get to all that busy, busy work stuff, I'm doing fun stuff on the iPad, like playing games.

297
00:22:56,906 --> 00:23:00,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the games that I got addicted to is Temple Run.

298
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:05,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of those games that's really stupidly simple in design.

299
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:07,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the game itself could have been on the Atari 2600 for all I know.

300
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:14,907
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you swipe up to jump, you swipe down to slide, left and right to go left and right.

301
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:20,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole kitsch of the game is you're running fast to escape these monkeys that if they catch you, they're going to eat you.

302
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I guess you took their treasure or whatever.

303
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so, so, so simple and so stupid, yet it is so addicting.

304
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stop playing it.

305
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Temple Run is what I've been playing a lot on my iPad.

306
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:34,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the iPad go-to game right now.

307
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:37,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And the screen's really pretty, you guys.

308
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We were watching Archer.

309
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's pretty for a cartoon.

310
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:42,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't shake your head at me.

311
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:43,828
[SPEAKER_06]: That's you judging me.

312
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.

313
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:45,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

314
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was pretty much my week.

315
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:49,309
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

316
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:53,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little bit of housekeeping and then we're going to get into some news and so forth.

317
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Housekeeping.

318
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:56,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to mention...

319
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:58,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya Ready Player One

320
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:45,436
[SPEAKER_06]: and he ran this whole virtual contest where people had to like play and joust and find the hidden easter egg screen and adventure and just you know cute fun stuff you know there's there was no point no seriousness just let's have fun on the internet and that's really what it was and it has a winner so I want to congratulate Orange Right won the hunt this week so yay Orange Right you win

321
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:47,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Something.

322
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:50,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to send Orange Wright something from OLR Studios.

323
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I will find a... Get his address later.

324
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,490
[SPEAKER_06]: A lock of my hair.

325
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he... Do you mean that?

326
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll go... All right.

327
00:24:58,593 --> 00:25:04,056
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to send Orange Wright a lock of DarkSakura's hair and something else actually useful from OLR Studios.

328
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know what we can send him.

329
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:06,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Some cat litter.

330
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:06,958
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

331
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,599
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not sending him cat litter.

332
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:10,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It's useful.

333
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,981
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use cat litter for a whole bunch of stuff, Rob.

334
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:13,582
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

335
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:17,184
[SPEAKER_08]: You know if you spill oil, if oil drips from your car, you can put cat litter on it?

336
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:18,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have posters over there.

337
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:19,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just stop.

338
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:20,267
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what?

339
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:21,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, we could send him a post.

340
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, posters are kind of a bitch to mail.

341
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking we have a bunch of these little guys here, so I'll send him one of these.

342
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:27,674
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

343
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,416
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

344
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:37,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I know he's a Bomani fan, and in the other room I have literally stacks and stacks of promo CDs we were going to give away at live events we never did.

345
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:42,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to put a bunch of those in a box and be all like, LOL, have fun, and I think he'll get a kick out of that.

346
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:44,248
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

347
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:46,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

348
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:47,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place, you get nothing.

349
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:48,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

350
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Tough life lesson learned.

351
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:51,950
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

352
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

353
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,671
[SPEAKER_06]: The other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention was that we will not be here live next week.

354
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:58,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to say.

355
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:01,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going to be at Bucket of Meat or Disneyland.

356
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:07,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to make the most out of my past because the prices just went up and there's no way I'm renewing at the end of the year.

357
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:34,262
[SPEAKER_06]: so I am going this next week so there will be no live show we are going to try to pre-tape a show earlier in the week we just have to find something that blends with all of our schedules so I'm sorry live listeners you won't have anything here but think of it as fair because last week you got a show that the podcasters never heard so next week you're going to have to get the podcast show just like a lot of other people do so that's next week's show

358
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:37,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it I have for housekeeping.

359
00:26:37,703 --> 00:26:39,344
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, the other thing I have for housekeeping.

360
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:45,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We were supposed to be having an interview right now with Susan from hackedonexbox.com.

361
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:49,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, she's not online.

362
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,631
[SPEAKER_06]: This is almost exactly what happened with MegaRan a couple weeks ago.

363
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,192
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about our show?

364
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we scary?

365
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:55,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

366
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:57,154
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

367
00:26:57,234 --> 00:27:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at her personal Twitter, and it said something about, I got two hours of sleep last night.

368
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: That was yesterday.

369
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:02,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, was it?

370
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:03,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was today.

371
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,639
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:25,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to use this interview to talk about something that's been going on in the news this week.

373
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:29,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, hopefully you can talk about it instead since Susan's not here.

374
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:29,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

375
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently there was some stuff going on with the whole we think we know how some accounts are getting stolen.

376
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:48,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so basically Susan had actually put together an article on her website talking about how she kind of figured out how some of this is going now.

377
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm not sure how she came about the website.

378
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:58,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming just web searches because doing the same similar type of web search was able to pull up the same information.

379
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,926
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

380
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:32,471
[SPEAKER_05]: and it doesn't matter what sort of safe you know any sort of passwords questions whatever it doesn't matter because they find a way to get that information from Microsoft or the third party companies representing Microsoft customer service or whatever it is.

381
00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they basically, there was this, it was on, I'm trying to remember which website it was now.

382
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know Kotaku picked it up.

383
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was originally hacked on Xbox.com and then Kotaku picked it up, right?

384
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where it really kind of blew up.

385
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

386
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:58,554
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, the one of the websites, I can't remember what the original website that had this step-by-step information was.

387
00:28:59,034 --> 00:28:59,334
[SPEAKER_05]: GameTagJackers

388
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:29,675
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

389
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,831
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

390
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, they talk about the strategy to do it.

391
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:15,198
[SPEAKER_05]: First, you go to Xbox.com, you click support, and basically at the bottom of the page, there's a contact us stuff.

392
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:28,810
[SPEAKER_05]: On that page, you click the email us link, and then Xbox Live, and then you basically, at that point, they impersonate an employee of Microsoft.

393
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So they put, you know, an email address at Microsoft.com.

394
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:36,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They put the agent's name, somebody that they, I guess, talk to.

395
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:40,838
[SPEAKER_05]: They could, you know, call up customer service and, hi, blah, blah, blah, my name is blah, blah.

396
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:43,940
[SPEAKER_05]: They write it down, you know, and they go through this web form.

397
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: You put the customer.

398
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:51,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you fill out a little note to them.

399
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Customer, and you put the name.

400
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Verify the 16-digit credit card number.

401
00:30:57,883 --> 00:31:01,764
[SPEAKER_05]: He has made an inquiry about how he has forgotten his account's information.

402
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:06,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I am a Tier 1 agent, I am unable to view the customer's gamer tag.

403
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:13,787
[SPEAKER_05]: He has requested to have an answer changed to... And then you put some realistic answer, I guess, for the question.

404
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:17,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox Live Gamertag is... And you put the Gamertag down.

405
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:23,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the person's name is supposedly contacting them that you're spoofing.

406
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, they're working it by... Because Microsoft is so big...

407
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:44,433
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's so many departments that don't talk to each other essentially they're impersonating department to department they're impersonating the many branches of Microsoft in order to get your gamer tag and there ain't shit you can do about it except don't put a credit card on Xbox

408
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:51,073
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really nothing you can do about it because they're literally going and finding the answers to the questions that you put down.

409
00:31:51,233 --> 00:32:00,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you put down which city were you born in and you put down Abraham Lincoln or something like that, they can still get the answer to it and they're basically changing it to whatever they want.

410
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:12,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, now, unfortunately, you know, one of the things I wanted to ask Susan tonight from hackedonexbox.com, and I gotta hand it to the chatters at, uh, vognetwork.com, ssh100matt says, even the best show hosts get cancelled on.

411
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Carson Letterman have been cancelled on, too.

412
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:17,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And WhatUpG says, when the interview comes on, it should be good even late.

413
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:18,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree.

414
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, maybe she forgot it was Memorial Day weekend.

415
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

416
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, uh, we'll hopefully get her on.

417
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:24,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's always another time.

418
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:24,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

419
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll figure something out.

420
00:32:26,563 --> 00:32:34,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, one thing I want to ask her about was that apparently Microsoft responded via Kotaku to her report.

421
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:34,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that?

422
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:35,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did see that.

423
00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:39,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they basically said, well, you can't do this anymore.

424
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay.

425
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:51,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see... They're basically, you know... Well, they're trying... I thought it was irritating because they really tried to poo-poo her story.

426
00:32:51,691 --> 00:33:19,354
[SPEAKER_06]: and it it kind of pissed me off because it's kind of like well you never Microsoft you never acknowledged that this was happening and now you're trying to poo-poo it like well you can't do it anymore and I understand that Microsoft certainly to save their image doesn't want to admit that they had a problem but at the same time being that they are I mean they are on the stock market yes they're a publicly traded company right yeah isn't there some sort of responsibility that they should be reporting this shit's happening

427
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they basically said, hey, here's what their Microsoft or Kotaku asked for a comment from them.

428
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:34,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Their response was, there are several different methods malicious users employ to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

429
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Social engineering is one of them.

430
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:46,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We are aware of vulnerabilities that social engineering pose and continue to address these through tools and training to help our members keep our members safe and secure.

431
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right there, that sounds like tools and training.

432
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,152
[SPEAKER_05]: They're members.

433
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like us.

434
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:55,222
[SPEAKER_05]: They're teaching us how to not be social engineered, which...

435
00:33:56,397 --> 00:34:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, but that doesn't really seem to apply to us because we're not the ones being contacted by these people.

436
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:04,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your customer service reps.

437
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:07,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another thing I really wanted to get into.

438
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:18,657
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I respect what Susan's done this week and what she's been able to find out and put out what needed to be out there on the internet, she put out what people needed to hear this week, and I so respect her for that.

439
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:22,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it is the sole reason this stuff is happening.

440
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm having a hard time remembering when I was hacked.

441
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:28,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was about six months ago at this point.

442
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:37,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to recall my password was never changed, which would tell me that this didn't happen to me because they're resetting your password in this, right?

443
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:38,887
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

444
00:34:56,008 --> 00:35:00,829
[SPEAKER_05]: and then obviously they're not going to get a response because they're not at that email.

445
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:10,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You call up Xbox 30 minutes later and after the answer you say that you got disconnected from a Tier 2 agent and asked to be transferred back.

446
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:19,492
[SPEAKER_05]: After they transfer you to a Tier 2 agent, you give them the number, the one that you wrote, the one that I guess your customer... Once they pull it up, say...

447
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll say it'll take a little while to change it call back say you forgot your email but you know what the security question or the secret question answer is and they will ask for your gamertag and answer them and they will give you the email so now so I guess let's see here

448
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:56,799
[SPEAKER_05]: so basically now you have their email and I guess their security question I'm not really sure how I guess I don't know if that allows you to change it immediately I thought they would send you a

449
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I just want to deny, deny, deny.

450
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:03,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like I want to deny that I couldn't have been phished either.

451
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:09,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm just being a little hard-headed, but I kind of think, why would someone want my account?

452
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, maybe, although I don't think I have much of a public face, I have a public face thanks to this podcast nonetheless, so maybe some a-hole out there wanted it.

453
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they used it to play FIFA 13

454
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:37,638
[SPEAKER_06]: which I don't.

455
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:39,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I have a name people want.

456
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's not necessarily that or sometimes accounts get hacked because you're a member of live for X number of years.

457
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,870
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be.

458
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That I would agree.

459
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why someone would want to account for that but

460
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:58,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I have friends who were hacked that hadn't touched their Xbox in years.

461
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not clicking for me.

462
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:03,565
[SPEAKER_05]: They could just probably find random people.

463
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just try it on one or another.

464
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:13,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps it's given the amount of time it's gone since it's been used, it makes it an easy target because it's someone less likely to check.

465
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like this story has blown a hole in it, but it hasn't still yet shown us everything that's going on.

466
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:24,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me quickly go to the chatroom because there's some good comments here from the chatroom.

467
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:34,794
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Morpheus from Understation Live Saturday nights here on VOG says, Has anyone considered the possibility if there is inside help within the Xbox call centers for the Jackers?

468
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:36,956
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a scary thought, isn't it?

469
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:38,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not unheard of.

470
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:39,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not unheard of.

471
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:41,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's an example.

472
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:52,669
[SPEAKER_08]: When I worked for the mortgage servicer I used to work for, one of our clients had a bunch of information stolen by one of their employees stealing a laptop.

473
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

474
00:37:54,370 --> 00:38:03,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had something like, I want to say, 3,000 bank account information.

475
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,138
[SPEAKER_08]: New bank accounts.

476
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

477
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens within companies.

478
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, it does.

479
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:15,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I work in the insurance industry and there's laws set in place to prosecute people who use the information that they find in malicious ways.

480
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:24,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, imagine if you could access a celebrity's medical records, the things that might happen there, you know, but there's laws in place to protect everybody.

481
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like with my job now.

482
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:28,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I run into the same thing, you know, with inspections.

483
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

484
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:34,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read this comment from Actdeft in our chatroom as well because I like this too at vognetwork.com.

485
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:36,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, let me put it this way.

486
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:40,679
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Network handled their hacking issue horribly, but they handled it nonetheless.

487
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:46,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam handled their forums being hacked really well and kept the users informed and users of what was happening.

488
00:38:47,461 --> 00:39:09,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft handling the Xbox livejackings is non-existent which is worse of what Sony did and DJ Morpheus added to that remember this is Microsoft they never admit issues until necessary look at Vista and how it was a disaster and Actdeft said yeah pretty much what I'm saying Microsoft denying the whole issue is worse than what Sony did and we're talking that Sony didn't handle the problem that well to begin with

489
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've said this for months now as much as we give Sony shit and yes they do deserve quite a bit of shit over what happened and you know kind of how they made themselves a target and everything although we give them shit at least they said what was going on and they did take their network down when it was a problem and you know most of all they never had money actually stolen

490
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:42,435
[SPEAKER_06]: yet here we are on Xbox this much later and we're still hearing stories about how it's done.

491
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:46,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go to that website, hackedonexbox.com, it is still happening.

492
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:55,239
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have not changed your password on Xbox Live in the past six months, you are a fool to not do it now.

493
00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:05,002
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do not change your password on Xbox Live, if you have sat through all of these stories and have still not changed your Xbox Live password, you are a fool.

494
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish you the best of luck Now that I've berated everybody Hopefully that wasn't anybody actually listening Oh gee, I should go change my password right now I forgive you if it's the first time you've ever heard me ranting Maybe you didn't think to change it before But if you've been sitting here for the past six months And you still haven't changed it You're just asking for it I've done mine twice since then Because I routinely change my passwords every three months

495
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:37,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the weird thing, too, and this actually just came up in the past week and a half.

496
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:46,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an email, or I tried to log in to Xbox.com or something, and it made me change my password, but it wasn't a reset or something.

497
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:51,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some type of, somebody's been trying to log into your account too many times, you better change your password.

498
00:40:51,776 --> 00:41:02,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that made me, you know, the first thing I went to, my bank account, to make sure no more money had been stolen or any of that crap is going on, but I looked in the game history, have they been in there, been able to play anything?

499
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:03,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, no.

500
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:08,628
[SPEAKER_06]: No one actually got in there, but it made me go, they're still fucking trying.

501
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:13,956
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

502
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:15,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

503
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:19,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, it was hackforums.net is where this stuff originated from.

504
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:24,048
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the whole Priv 7, how to jack any Xbox account.

505
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where all that information was from on her website.

506
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:27,890
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

507
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:38,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm hoping we can get her on here to tell us more about the story about how she found it and kind of her opinions really having heard so many of these stories on what Microsoft should do.

508
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:39,818
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll have to get that in a later week.

509
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Rising 3 Death Rising 3

510
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:07,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

511
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,468
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:59,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hey, so by the way, man, tell your friend who liked this post that I'm the new face of Dead Rising 3, lol.

513
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:01,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw he works for video games.

514
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:05,148
[SPEAKER_05]: The trailer should be coming out soon in the next month or two.

515
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

516
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:09,011
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent me to this place called MOVA in San Francisco.

517
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:10,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Insane technology.

518
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:11,453
[SPEAKER_05]: They did Benjamin Button.

519
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:12,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks so real.

520
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll post it on here when they give it to me.

521
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Just real quick, are you sure the name's not Jorge?

522
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's Jorge.

523
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Auto Mechanic, LA, Illegal Immigrant, Aliens, Controversy

524
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:03,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Rising 3

525
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:34,225
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.

526
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:38,968
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll probably be one of, like, Xbox or PlayStation's things.

527
00:44:39,248 --> 00:44:39,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sure.

528
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:41,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

529
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,351
[SPEAKER_06]: No Frank West or the other guy?

530
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: No, of course not.

531
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:44,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

532
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:45,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet.

533
00:44:46,473 --> 00:44:46,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Until DLC.

534
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:47,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, man.

535
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:52,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Frank West, you know, the whole Dead Rising 2 off the record bombed, so...

536
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:58,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because I think a lot of people kind of saw it as a... I think a lot of people saw it for what it was.

537
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:04,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a cheap attempt to try and get Dead Rising 2 more popularity when it just should have been there to begin with.

538
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:05,819
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

539
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:10,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are starting to call Capcom out on a lot of this shit, and it's kind of fun to watch.

540
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like watching a soap opera.

541
00:45:13,901 --> 00:45:14,401
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

542
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:21,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, hey, just like, you know, all the on-disc DLC for Street Fighter X, Tekken, and Dragon Dog, Dragon's Dogma.

543
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:21,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

544
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:24,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk Minecraft.

545
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet Loki will be excited about this.

546
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you never thought this would be something happening on OLR.

547
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:30,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Minecraft segment.

548
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:31,324
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

549
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we used to talk about Minecraft updates all the time.

550
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:34,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have you now.

551
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here we go.

552
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is some serious Minecraft news.

553
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live Arcade, what game is being played the most online?

554
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:45,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's still Modern Warfare 3.

555
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:51,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But Minecraft has now edged out Call of Duty Black Ops for the number two spot.

556
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:53,999
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

557
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I guess the next update for Minecraft is going to be 1.7.3, which will add pistons into the game.

558
00:46:20,502 --> 00:46:21,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is awesome.

559
00:46:21,162 --> 00:46:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the next thing that Xbox is slated to get.

560
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But at some point, 1.8, which was the adventure update on the PC, that will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

561
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:35,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The quote from 4J Studios, they're the ones who ported the game for Xbox Live Arcade.

562
00:46:53,383 --> 00:47:00,612
[SPEAKER_06]: The game isn't Minecraft on the Xbox, it's Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition, so it isn't really a direct port of the PC game.

563
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:06,779
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of them trying to weave these tangled words of, we didn't promise you everything.

564
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:09,184
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

565
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I imagine there'll still be a casual mode that won't have that element in it.

566
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:54,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So Minecraft, sales figures, 6 million sold on the PC, 9 million across all platforms when you factor in Xbox, Android, and iOS.

567
00:47:55,564 --> 00:47:57,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe 9.2 million.

568
00:47:57,566 --> 00:48:00,849
[SPEAKER_06]: That's according to Daniel Kaplan with Mojang.

569
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:01,870
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot.

570
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,530
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot.

571
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,252
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot, especially considering I don't think the iOS and... I can't imagine those sold a lot.

572
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:08,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think in the millions.

573
00:48:09,173 --> 00:48:10,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a million a pop.

574
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:13,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Xbox One's probably sold at least a million and a half at this point.

575
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:17,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Well, they said they were profitable within 10 hours.

576
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:29,380
[SPEAKER_06]: That is... This is the type of thing they're going to look back on in 10 years and be all like, hey, remember in the 2010s when people played Minecraft?

577
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like we kind of look back and go...

578
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:33,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, remember the pet rock?

579
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think it'll be that whole thing where it's still... I just have a feeling that Lego is just kicking themselves going, Damn it, we could have done something like this.

580
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,089
[SPEAKER_05]: We could have so done something like this.

581
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,971
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see this on VH1 in 10 years.

582
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:54,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Ian Black commenting on VH1's I Love the 10s.

583
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we even do that anymore?

584
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:57,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I Love the 10s.

585
00:48:57,794 --> 00:48:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Minecraft?

586
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:03,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when we used to have this show?

587
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:06,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Do countdowns of decades and stuff?

588
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:08,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just stopped.

589
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

590
00:49:12,395 --> 00:49:14,096
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's going on in Minecraft world.

591
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura, if you want to talk about a different game, now would be a good chance.

592
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:22,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I said if people want me to play the damn game, they need to buy it for me on PC.

593
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cute.

594
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You think you live in a world where that will happen.

595
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,446
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means I don't have to play it.

596
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:29,366
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

597
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even try to get out of it like that.

598
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download the classic version completely free on their website.

599
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:37,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So I tried to tell her.

600
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:38,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Wars Star Wars

601
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,992
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a new Star Wars franchise unveiled next week.

602
00:49:58,613 --> 00:49:59,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a bold vision.

603
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:01,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't know what the crap it is.

604
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,576
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be on GTTV.

605
00:50:04,516 --> 00:50:05,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So, good.

606
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:06,798
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on Thursday.

607
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,461
[SPEAKER_08]: What it was said, though, is that it actually had a pretty high caliber team on it.

608
00:50:14,022 --> 00:50:15,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be very bold.

609
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:16,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Very bold.

610
00:50:16,643 --> 00:50:17,404
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't know what it is.

611
00:50:18,124 --> 00:50:26,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, hopefully it's going to be better than the MMO because the MMO was losing people and it really wasn't all that great that I saw.

612
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:27,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not impressed by it.

613
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:32,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Except I do kind of like the alignment change thing, but that's about it.

614
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:33,630
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really about it.

615
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:34,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

616
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:37,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a new Battlefront series, and that sounds awesome.

617
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: You think?

618
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:38,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

619
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:39,425
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be worth it.

620
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:41,486
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to call it something different.

621
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: How about a return to the Super Nintendo-style side-scroller games?

622
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:47,250
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be rad.

623
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be cool.

624
00:50:49,832 --> 00:50:56,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, a lot of times when I think about LucasArts, I think about the point-and-click adventure games from back in the day, like Loom and Indiana Jones and shit.

625
00:50:56,536 --> 00:51:05,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So how about a fucking, like, you know, hey, Telltale's kind of made that industry cool again with the whole Walking Dead's doing very well.

626
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:12,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Since they're already stealing from Blizzard, why don't they just keep doing it and do like a Diablo style?

627
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,128
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, point like that.

628
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:19,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Since they're already, I'm sorry, borrowing from Blizzard.

629
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:26,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I am with Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com as long as it's not Han Solo's dance party for the Kinect.

630
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:30,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what Han Solo's dance party would be?

631
00:51:31,137 --> 00:51:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Him shooting people.

632
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:32,758
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

633
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:40,612
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I just hope they don't make a sequel to that game because it was terrible.

634
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:44,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably sold okay, but man, it was a terrible game.

635
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:51,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of terrible, there's been some terrible things going on at 38 Studios and Big Huge Games.

636
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,297
[SPEAKER_05]: They've laid off their entire staff.

637
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:54,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching.

638
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:55,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see you next time.

639
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

640
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:28,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:33,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a tweet that something like they had sold 1.2 million or something?

642
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:38,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that like shipped versus sold in that whole clever math that we see in the gaming industry?

643
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:45,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't know when that update was, but it sold well under 3 million units, that's for sure.

644
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:51,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that stuff takes time, but not enough time to repay their debts.

645
00:52:51,576 --> 00:52:56,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just there was a whole bunch of just...

646
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible stuff going on there.

647
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading things.

648
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, 1.22 million units in the first 90 days is what they said.

649
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:12,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, like, I heard stuff where some of the employees that were relocated to work for this company.

650
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:15,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way, you know that house that we bought for you?

651
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we never paid for it.

652
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:23,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We took a second mortgage out on your home just so you know.

653
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:24,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard about that.

654
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:25,720
[SPEAKER_06]: You have another mortgage now.

655
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sucks.

656
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kind of stuff can really fuck your credit.

657
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the really sad thing about this, you know.

658
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:43,209
[SPEAKER_06]: But hooray to the gaming industry for at least trying to... Because usually you think of the gaming industry and you think of the people on Xbox Live, you know.

659
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:45,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you know.

660
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,791
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I mean, considering that there was almost...

661
00:53:48,771 --> 00:54:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: 380 employees at 38 studios so they you know people on Twitter have been kind of rallying to you know with 38 the hashtag 38 jobs also Facebook group 38 jobs and they've got you know people including like Alex Rubens you know game journalist and he's been you know collecting like stuff into a Google Doc with all these different studios with openings and stuff and

662
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:37,999
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's also job fairs going on in their area and they're kind of letting these people know he might be a listener of the show because him and I have followed each other on Twitter for a while and so I actually kind of saw his tweets about that when he was putting it together his whole Google Docs thing and I thought that was a really cool idea so props to him I'm glad you're getting your especially because I know he's an aspiring game journalist this is a good thing you know good begets good you know what I mean so good for him

663
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:42,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a clever retort Okay, what is your retort, young lady?

664
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:08,915
[SPEAKER_08]: The douches keep girl bits clean, so how is that bad?

665
00:55:12,597 --> 00:55:17,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, whatever he is, he's apparently not the best businessman in the world.

666
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:18,881
[SPEAKER_06]: We can certainly say that.

667
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:33,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, what about the repercussions that are being felt for the fact that his name basically got a state to believe in his company enough to give them this huge loan that now they're going to have to eat?

668
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

669
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of money.

670
00:55:56,598 --> 00:56:03,504
[SPEAKER_06]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, Amalur wasn't that bad of a game, but the timing for its release couldn't get out from Skyrim Shadow.

671
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I mean, I don't know.

672
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:08,208
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people had already burned through Skyrim by the time it had come out.

673
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:11,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't blame Skyrim, because it was a few months after Skyrim.

674
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:15,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I would blame Mass Effect 3, because it came out literally like three weeks before Mass Effect 3.

675
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not even that, but maybe it's just me and the fact that I don't watch a lot of TV or when I do, I watch it without commercials.

676
00:56:23,698 --> 00:56:29,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't really heard a lot about this game, which, you know, considering I do this show, you'd think... To be honest, it's the first I've ever heard of it.

677
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

678
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's a problem.

679
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is a problem considering it's EA the one publishing it and they usually pimp the shit out of their games.

680
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:41,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I heard about it and stuff and I saw, you know, they had a demo and...

681
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:49,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really see any TV advertisement for it, but then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so it's possible that they had stuff for it.

682
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:54,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not like Madden or something, they'd spend a lot of money on it.

683
00:56:55,636 --> 00:56:59,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Phantasm, our chatroom says, Reckoning had a bad release window with Skyrim and Mass Effect 3.

684
00:56:59,978 --> 00:57:02,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible that the game just released at a bad time?

685
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, I'm not going to blame Skyrim.

686
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Skyrim was two months before it.

687
00:57:07,901 --> 00:57:11,382
[SPEAKER_08]: It could contribute, but I think there might be other factors.

688
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:20,966
[SPEAKER_06]: What about just the fact that maybe the month it released usually isn't a big month for games, especially maybe they should have held it off until summer because those first few weeks really do make or break your game.

689
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:22,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm going to blame?

690
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:25,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to blame the fucking online pass because it was a game that had an online pass.

691
00:57:25,886 --> 00:57:29,867
[SPEAKER_05]: They literally called it an online pass for a game that had no online component.

692
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:32,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

693
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:33,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That was this game.

694
00:57:33,308 --> 00:57:40,850
[SPEAKER_05]: They had no online component, but the online pass, they literally called it an online pass, was just bonus DLC.

695
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that didn't help.

696
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:43,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean...

697
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:46,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Just call it bonus DLC.

698
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:49,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if you don't buy it at launch, you don't get the bonus DLC.

699
00:57:50,074 --> 00:57:54,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And all you can do is go, well, damn, I should have bought the game at launch.

700
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:56,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't see how that's a bad thing at all.

701
00:57:56,816 --> 00:57:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, you're calling an online pass.

702
00:57:58,077 --> 00:57:59,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you've got to pay this extra money to get...

703
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:17,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Get online and download this extra DLC I don't really know what the spin was on that Alright, well continuing with things that might drive the gaming industry further into a hole You've got to hear about this patent that was discovered this week Sony Computer Entertainment America, or SCEA

704
00:58:17,868 --> 00:58:19,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Filed for this patent in 2011.

705
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It usually takes a little time for these patents to be found.

706
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, it's an older patent, but it's just being found now.

707
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:31,958
[SPEAKER_06]: The patent was for an advertising system where a game will be suspended during play for an advertisement to come up.

708
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:33,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the game will continue.

709
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of it like how TV commercials interrupt your show.

710
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:38,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Hulu.

711
00:58:39,043 --> 00:58:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Hulu.

712
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:49,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Adds would be preceded by a warning and a slowdown of gameplay, with another warning displayed when gameplay is about to resume.

713
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like, ad incoming, everything slowed down.

714
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:55,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Movie sign!

715
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, Pepsi!

716
00:58:57,862 --> 00:58:59,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's get back into the game.

717
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, seriously, that reminds me of Mr. Sensei with the movie sign.

718
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: um now just because they filed the patent doesn't mean it will be implemented it's just you know again patents are to kind of protect ideas or what have you which is weird because i thought i i thought ios games did this shit already doesn't word with friends kind of do something like this where you play and then you get mad if you have the um free version yeah if you i i i have the paid version of words with friends that never does that crap to me

719
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:33,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, would this be terrible if it was to support free full console games?

720
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:35,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, ad-supported stuff?

721
00:59:36,252 --> 00:59:42,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Say I want to get LittleBigPlanet 2 and I get an ad-supported version that stops gameplay once in a while to pimp me Pepsi or something?

722
00:59:43,443 --> 00:59:49,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably, I'd probably just want to buy the regular game, which is what they want you to do in the first place, but they can make more ad revenue.

723
00:59:50,028 --> 00:59:54,090
[SPEAKER_05]: If this shit pops up in a fucking retail game, I'm not fucking buying that.

724
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,012
[SPEAKER_06]: This was in Wipeout as well, wasn't it?

725
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorta?

726
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:57,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorta?

727
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it didn't really pause gameplay, but it was in like the loading screens.

728
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:01,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's one thing.

729
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,395
[SPEAKER_08]: If they have it as something that's not going to be obtrusive.

730
01:00:06,975 --> 01:00:12,040
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not going to interrupt your gameplay, I don't so much have a problem with it.

731
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cool with the billboards in racing games.

732
01:00:15,663 --> 01:00:22,049
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that if they're doing this as a way to bring in more revenue, they need to decrease the price of the game.

733
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:23,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

734
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:28,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Brad from PodCulture is in our chat room and says, don't effing get me started on patents.

735
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Had my phone delayed in customs a week or so ago because of a BS Apple patent.

736
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:38,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, a lot of folks are saying the patent industry in this country is really screwed up right now.

737
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a lot of just offensive and defensive maneuvers.

738
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when Twitter came out and said, we have all of these patents.

739
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:49,691
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually put out a press release that said, we have acquired all these patents and we only plan to use them defensively.

740
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:52,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's a fucking game of chess.

741
01:00:52,974 --> 01:00:54,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the patent industry in this country has become.

742
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, maybe Sony is not even going to do anything with this.

743
01:00:57,939 --> 01:01:03,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just we just want to defend ourselves against when somebody tries to call us on it or something.

744
01:01:03,184 --> 01:01:09,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And to throw my political two cents into it, this is what happens when you allow certain businesses to go deregulated.

745
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:15,371
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Morpheus is in our chat room and gives us an example of what could come to a PlayStation game near you.

746
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll return you to your blood carnage marathon game after this message from some feminine yeast infection product.

747
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,491
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be freaking hilarious.

748
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:33,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that I could support just for the comic value alone because I'd want to see reaction videos to that on the interwebs.

749
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:34,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be hilarious.

750
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:43,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maybe this is related news, but Sony Online Entertainment, or SOE, has announced a free-to-play game called Bullet Run.

751
01:01:44,515 --> 01:01:47,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a revamped game from Acony Games.

752
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:48,777
[SPEAKER_06]: What was this?

753
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:52,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Head1 or Headin was the game with a new title?

754
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:53,598
[SPEAKER_06]: H-E-D-O-N-E.

755
01:01:53,638 --> 01:01:53,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Head1?

756
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:53,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Head1?

757
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:55,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had one.

758
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: known for such games as APB and Battleforge meaning they haven't had a lot of luck so far but maybe this will be it and maybe this will make Sony money because oh I'm about to score a headshot on my opponent and have you tried Summer's Eve speaking of douches it'd be funnier it's just relative to the conversation yes it'd be funnier if it was in Max Payne 3 bullet time advertisement

759
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullet time over Advertisement gone

760
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:57,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

761
01:02:57,738 --> 01:03:01,401
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, You know those ads that appear in billboards in games and such?

762
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:04,224
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually find ways to block those ads from loading in games.

763
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:06,946
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that ad that pops up on the Xbox Live dashboard?

764
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,428
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little tweak you can make that blocks it so it doesn't load.

765
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:15,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember reading something about that once where it's like on your router, you block a certain domain or something.

766
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:17,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You never have to see that shit.

767
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:25,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you redirect certain IPs to your local domain so that it doesn't load those things up.

768
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:44,633
[SPEAKER_05]: um but yeah i mean you could do that it would it depends but you'd all you would be you'd be interrupted with a blank screen instead you know what my favorite way of getting rid of ads is i'm not giving a fuck ignore it how about that don't give a fuck

769
01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:48,204
[SPEAKER_05]: or just don't, I mean, this is the age of the internet.

770
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:51,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna know when there's gonna be some sort of software out there that has ads in it.

771
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:53,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be on fucking blogs.

772
01:03:53,327 --> 01:04:00,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, can you imagine this next God of War game has fucking ads for like, you know, Subway in the middle of the damn game.

773
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:02,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you out of fucks to give?

774
01:04:02,732 --> 01:04:04,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Try new Folgers Instant Coffee.

775
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It will perk you right back up.

776
01:04:06,394 --> 01:04:07,415
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have plenty of fucks.

777
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:09,055
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my thing.

778
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:15,597
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's free or a very inexpensive service, I don't really care if there's ads.

779
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:20,078
[SPEAKER_08]: If it keeps the cost low or free, fine.

780
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:22,578
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

781
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And then offer a paid option if you don't want to see the ads.

782
01:04:26,959 --> 01:04:28,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That, I think, is fair.

783
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:36,962
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you've already paid the money for the game, and then you have your game interrupted, that's a little too far.

784
01:04:37,062 --> 01:04:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you.

785
01:04:37,602 --> 01:04:44,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that and the microtransaction stuff, the Facebook-style game in your $60 game.

786
01:04:44,664 --> 01:04:45,965
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit pisses me the fuck off.

787
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to keep doing it because they can charge $60 for a game and someone's going to pay for it.

788
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:51,546
[SPEAKER_06]: If they charge $20 for the game.

789
01:04:51,746 --> 01:04:54,087
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's going to be another video game industry crash.

790
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:54,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

791
01:04:54,787 --> 01:05:11,736
[SPEAKER_08]: If they paid, now if they charged $20 for a game and then had, I refuse to use the word, had individual transactions within the game, that I could understand a little bit more because then you're paying for the cost of development, you're paying for the cost of advertising, and you're paying for the shipping.

792
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:17,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're a supporter of Ridge Racer for the Vita, which was basically a $30 game that came with nothing.

793
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It was basically a six, six, no, I'm sorry, six cars, three tracks.

794
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:23,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That game can ask my D.

795
01:05:24,147 --> 01:05:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

796
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:30,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid two bucks for Best Move, and I paid for all the maps, all the puzzles.

797
01:05:31,134 --> 01:05:32,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I ended up spending six bucks on that game.

798
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but two versus 30 is a huge difference.

799
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm saying as an example.

800
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:39,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, going to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.

801
01:05:39,332 --> 01:05:44,298
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Too much effort for something that really doesn't mean anything.

802
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:46,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that's in regards to blocking the ads.

803
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:50,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Sepwin says, I don't have a problem with ads when they fit.

804
01:05:50,505 --> 01:05:54,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Like ads in a sports game that look like the ads you see at a real game.

805
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, believe it or not, I don't...

806
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit about those at all.

807
01:05:57,171 --> 01:05:58,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of adds to the experience, really.

808
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:00,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it more realistic.

809
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it really does.

810
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,353
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube ads, however.

811
01:06:04,773 --> 01:06:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Infanel says, stupid ads like on Xbox Dashboard make me want to avoid that product or service.

812
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what you do.

813
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I go that far with it.

814
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what you do, ad people.

815
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is pure ad genius right here.

816
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:23,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You make a fighting game a la Smash Brothers or Sony mascot Battle Royale, whatever they're calling it.

817
01:06:24,097 --> 01:06:28,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you just make it with the mascots from those advertisements.

818
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

819
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:31,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one big ad that actually fits within the game.

820
01:06:31,543 --> 01:06:34,285
[SPEAKER_08]: But there were whole games around, um, mascots.

821
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, like, the Yo!

822
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:39,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Noid and Cool Spot and... Exactly, and I'm saying... Oh, yeah, Mick Kids.

823
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:40,989
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

824
01:06:58,237 --> 01:07:01,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Those Burger King games were one of the best things I've seen, actually.

825
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, although the games were stupid, I mean, just the fact that they even made them is quite astounding.

826
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:10,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, quickly, I want to read this comment from chat, and then we need to move on for time.

827
01:07:10,624 --> 01:07:15,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Blender in our chatroom says, I bought a Subway sandwich for the Uncharted 3 freebies.

828
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:17,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, that was a really good promotion, too.

829
01:07:17,308 --> 01:07:17,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It really was.

830
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:22,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bought a Subway sandwich for those Uncharted 3 freebies as well, and they didn't give up to me!

831
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's your individual Subway's fault.

832
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, like, multiple Subways for the, I've been getting, like, the large, you know, they're all, yeah, buy a large drink and you get code for some Battleship thing.

833
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yet to get a fucking code in, like, five different Subways.

834
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:39,476
[SPEAKER_05]: A Battleship thing?

835
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, like, for money.

836
01:07:40,637 --> 01:07:41,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

837
01:07:41,177 --> 01:07:42,778
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's tying in with the movie.

838
01:07:43,118 --> 01:07:44,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a fail.

839
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:45,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

840
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

841
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're sub-sandwiches.

842
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

843
01:07:52,123 --> 01:07:53,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You figured it out.

844
01:07:58,606 --> 01:08:04,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the best article on Oh No They Didn't, which is one of my favorite websites on the entire internet.

845
01:08:04,388 --> 01:08:11,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an article that was just, here is the complete bits of dialogue that Rihanna had in the movie Battleship.

846
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:18,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it was just, it was great.

847
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:19,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on.

848
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:20,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game news.

849
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:21,850
[SPEAKER_06]: How about something that's actually cool?

850
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:22,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Less Battleship, yes.

851
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,551
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some Kojima news?

852
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:31,434
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some artwork revealed for a particular game that I know a lot of people are super excited about.

853
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:32,094
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that is?

854
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:33,195
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

855
01:08:33,395 --> 01:08:34,836
[SPEAKER_08]: A new zone of the Enders.

856
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:43,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The Enders project is in an experimental phase and he's trying to develop the game using the Fox engine.

857
01:08:44,640 --> 01:09:09,752
[SPEAKER_08]: so hopefully we can see this out before too long right now though it's supposed to be a fully fledged sequel to Zone of the Enders the second runner and so hopefully we can see that out before too long and there's also been plenty of artwork tweeted by people who were at the press event I'd like to see a new Zone of the Enders game that would be fun

858
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:13,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And this event actually was specific for the Ender's HD Collection.

859
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:15,973
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with all these HD Collections?

860
01:09:16,872 --> 01:09:17,552
[SPEAKER_06]: People are buying them.

861
01:09:17,852 --> 01:09:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

862
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:18,913
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's up with them.

863
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:27,115
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's travel around the world and look at some games that are going to be coming out a whole lot sooner, as in this week, as we travel the world with release dates.

864
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:27,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, US.

865
01:09:28,155 --> 01:09:29,936
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot coming out this week.

866
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some re-releases, I guess, or I don't know.

867
01:09:34,297 --> 01:09:44,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Batman Arkham City Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out this week on PS3 and Xbox 360 with that wonderful Harley Quinn's Revenge.

868
01:09:46,301 --> 01:09:48,182
[SPEAKER_05]: DLC and crap thrown in.

869
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I like how they talk about... I know people genuinely excited about that and it sounds pretty robust.

870
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:55,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into it.

871
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Robust, like Catwoman.

872
01:09:58,948 --> 01:10:00,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's robust bust.

873
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:02,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

874
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

875
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, other fun things this week.

876
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:12,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Deer Drive, Legends on the 3DS, get your deer hunting on in 3D.

877
01:10:13,227 --> 01:10:17,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Otlier Maruru, The Apprentice of Arland on PlayStation 3 this week.

878
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance, Burning Skies on the Vita.

879
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:23,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Might have to check that out, that looks pretty neat.

880
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,822
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot this week.

881
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:29,484
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it getting cancelled.

882
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:34,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Max Payne 3, special edition and the regular edition on PC coming out as well.

883
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:34,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

884
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's travel to Japan.

885
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:49,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out the games that are coming out over there in Japan on the Nintendo 3DS.

886
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:54,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't think there's a Disney game this week, but for some reason a bunch of character cases are coming out.

887
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:59,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've ever wanted to stitch character case, import one from Japan because there's a bunch of those coming out there from Hori.

888
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:03,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It must tie into Dream Drop Distance somehow, it must.

889
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:18,881
[SPEAKER_06]: uh but what is coming out on the 3ds this is kind of a big deal Dragon Quest Monsters Terry No Wonderland 3d so it's not in the main series of Dragon Quest games but still it carries the name it is from Square Enix so it'll be a little bit of a deal there

890
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:22,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Guild 01 from level 5 comes out as well.

891
01:11:22,585 --> 01:11:24,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all again on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

892
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking a look at the other handheld real quick, the Vita.

01:11:28,912 --> 01:11:29,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing this week.

894

[SPEAKER_06]: The next big game is Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny on June the 7th.

895
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking a look at the consoles real quick on the PlayStation 3.

896
01:11:38,443 --> 01:11:43,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Atlier Meru, Alchemist of Arlen 3 gets a price drop into the best collection.

897
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:47,408
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also Atlier Rorona gets that same price drop.

898
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:55,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out from Sega this week, Jisen Pachislot, Hishihoho, Hokuto, Noken, F, Sekimatsu, Kaishu Seisu, Densetsu.

899
01:11:56,133 --> 01:11:57,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically another Pacino game.

900
01:11:58,254 --> 01:11:58,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Pachinko.

901
01:11:58,815 --> 01:11:59,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Pachinko game.

902
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like Al Pacino.

903
01:12:00,376 --> 01:12:01,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard Legend in there somewhere.

904
01:12:01,756 --> 01:12:03,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a Sega Pachinko game.

905
01:12:03,897 --> 01:12:04,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you get.

906
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:22,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13 but that is in English but it's getting a Japanese release and hey Portal 2 gets a price reduction so if you want to hear what GLaDOS sounds like in Japanese there you go lastly on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week Portal 2 gets that same price reduction and that's really it

907
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:24,563
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

908
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Three things.

909
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:31,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Mad Riders for Xbox 360 and Resistance Burning Skies for Vita on the 30th.

910
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:36,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have on June 1st Max Payne 3 for PC.

911
01:12:37,573 --> 01:12:38,614
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

912
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

913
01:12:43,197 --> 01:12:44,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, Loki.

914
01:12:44,933 --> 01:12:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.

915
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about... This is kind of funny.

916
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:51,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect.

917
01:12:51,374 --> 01:12:53,195
[SPEAKER_05]: They have new technology now.

918
01:12:53,555 --> 01:12:56,476
[SPEAKER_05]: New technology where they can detect you sitting down.

919
01:12:57,016 --> 01:12:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

920
01:12:57,516 --> 01:13:00,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect Software Development Kit Update 1.5.

921
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:06,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Now features the ability to connect with you sitting on the couch.

922
01:13:08,338 --> 01:13:37,550
[SPEAKER_06]: and now it can't tell if I'm wearing pants or not right because you know I have this legit fear about the Kinect that if I you know it's my house I'll do what I want and if I'm sitting in front of the Xbox 360 not wearing pants and playing Minecraft I don't want that image broadcast to the internet and I have this fear in the back of my mind I put a little box in front of the Kinect when I don't want to be seen by the internet um yeah they don't have that ability in here it's not one of the listed features but um

923
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:41,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Other fun stuff, they've got a development kit for face tracking.

924
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, some human interface guidelines and other improvements.

925
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:48,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're saying that...

926
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: They have full seated skeletal tracking mode, which is to track people sitting down.

927
01:13:57,685 --> 01:14:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said also that, I think this is more, obviously this is only on PC, but I think a little bit, since most people on PC are probably sitting down to interface with stuff, I would hate to have to stand up to read an email or something like that with Kinect.

928
01:14:17,116 --> 01:14:22,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it'll be nice, too, that now you can play Kinect without actually having to move.

929
01:14:23,322 --> 01:14:25,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the nice, you know, antithesis.

930
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:30,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure, I mean, the Kinect does detect you sitting down.

931
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:35,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for some things, like, you can browse menus and stuff like that in the Xbox Kinect, just...

932
01:14:36,233 --> 01:14:37,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I think sitting down.

933
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:40,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you have to stand up to browse video menus and stuff like that.

934
01:14:41,675 --> 01:14:50,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I'm not stupid enough to hook up Kinect to do that when I could go, Huh, controller is faster.

935
01:14:50,958 --> 01:15:01,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, why would I need... I never understood why I need to browse those menus with my arm when I can just put the controller in my hand and just do that.

936
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:02,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I...

937
01:15:03,662 --> 01:15:04,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's faster.

938
01:15:04,785 --> 01:15:05,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is faster.

939
01:15:06,328 --> 01:15:13,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Voice searches, that's kind of cool, but moving my hand around to select things, that is slower.

940
01:15:15,546 --> 01:15:18,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we will see what this brings into games later on.

941
01:15:18,387 --> 01:15:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, couldn't you play Joyride sitting down?

942
01:15:20,427 --> 01:15:22,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it supposed to be able to see your hands driving the car?

943
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:24,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I didn't play that long.

944
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:26,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's because it was only looking at your hands.

945
01:15:26,468 --> 01:15:27,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't looking at the rest of your body.

946
01:15:27,568 --> 01:15:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

947
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:35,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's somewhat of an in-joke amongst the community of Konami fans that have been following them for some time, and it's called Konami Will Sue.

948
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:39,950
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe this week the joke should be changed to Konami Will Be Sued.

949
01:15:40,371 --> 01:15:42,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Konami was sued this week, and, uh...

950
01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:45,613
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be pretty impressed what it's for.

951
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:46,273
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty crazy.

952
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:51,938
[SPEAKER_06]: City National Bank is the one that's filed the suit against Konami and Autumn Games.

953
01:15:52,538 --> 01:15:53,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's over fraud.

954
01:15:54,680 --> 01:16:02,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why is because the bank hasn't received any return on a $15 million line of credit that it approved to both Konami and Autumn Games.

955
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:09,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And the court documents claim that the financial state of Autumn and Konami were false.

956
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: at the time that they were made and that defendants never had any intention of repaying the loan as promised.

957
01:16:15,974 --> 01:16:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all a quote from the court documents and so is this.

958
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:32,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Rather than paying game-related proceeds directly to CNB or City National Bank as agreed, defendants have kept all game-related proceeds for themselves and have refused to remit any such proceeds to City National Bank.

959
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I think the problem is.

960
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:43,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they think that those games or, you know, Def Jam Rapstar was going to be successful and they're like, where's our percentage of, you know, of the profits?

961
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we only getting like $10?

962
01:16:45,207 --> 01:16:48,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is your percentage, actually.

963
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't divide by zero, stupid.

964
01:16:52,752 --> 01:16:56,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that's how much, that's how many copies we sold.

965
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:57,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a big fat check for $20.

966
01:16:58,635 --> 01:16:59,636
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

967
01:17:24,713 --> 01:17:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

968
01:17:45,151 --> 01:17:46,152
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were no lawsuits.

969
01:17:46,452 --> 01:17:47,393
[SPEAKER_06]: There were no laws.

970
01:17:47,733 --> 01:17:48,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, right.

971
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:51,255
[SPEAKER_06]: There were no laws in this game, actually.

972
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a perfect day.

973
01:17:52,156 --> 01:17:53,397
[SPEAKER_07]: It was lawless land.

974
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:58,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to travel back in time and visit the classic game of the week.

975
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:09,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, DarkSakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brat, your new fangled crap.

976
01:18:10,308 --> 01:18:13,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and play something old school like this.

977
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:14,951
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

978
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:15,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo 2 Diablo 3

979
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:37,310
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Ragnarok Online, which was my crack.

980
01:18:37,931 --> 01:18:41,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have, from time to time, been known to go back on a free server.

981
01:18:41,974 --> 01:18:49,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also one of the people who basically has a permanent account on IRO, the International Ragnarok Online, because I played in the beta.

982
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:54,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I played in the Korean beta, I played in the Japanese beta, and I played in the US beta.

983
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've played a lot of Ragnarok.

984
01:18:57,286 --> 01:19:00,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And my last, I think... Fuck, even I remember this music.

985
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,380
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

986
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's made by Gravity.

987
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:27,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It is based off of the Mantua, which is called Ragnarok.

988
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:32,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a Ragnarok 3 animation based off of it.

989
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually a pretty good little anime.

990
01:19:36,294 --> 01:19:37,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It really captured the game very well.

991
01:19:39,195 --> 01:19:43,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got different types of gameplay that are in it.

992
01:19:43,776 --> 01:19:47,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You have PvE, you have Guild vs. Guild, and PvP.

993
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:50,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can initiate PvP anywhere.

994
01:19:52,861 --> 01:19:56,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Guild vs. Guild, I really, really, really liked that function.

995
01:19:57,245 --> 01:19:59,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was a big capture the flag kind of thing.

996
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:12,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's something that... Now while I'm not a PvP fan, that is kind of the only reason why I like Battlegrounds at all in WoW.

997
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:15,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because it kind of reminds me of this, even though I didn't do it that often.

998
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, honestly, I was a PvE person.

999
01:20:18,082 --> 01:20:19,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always a PvE person.

1000
01:20:20,664 --> 01:20:22,285
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sprite-based.

1001
01:20:22,746 --> 01:20:27,469
[SPEAKER_08]: It is with different 3D environments.

1002
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:36,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And you basically travel all over this little world in the game getting different creatures.

1003
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:41,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And for as long as I played this damn game, Rob, I have not been everywhere in it.

1004
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It is big.

1005
01:20:44,661 --> 01:21:00,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, I've been to everything on the main map, but there's all the little caves and the dungeons and the special areas, and I haven't been everywhere in the game, although I have been to certain areas of the games many times, like the freaking Toy Factory.

1006
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:01,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Prontera.

1007
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:02,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Pronterra.

1008
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Warp to prompt, please.

1009
01:21:03,971 --> 01:21:04,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Warp to prompt, please.

1010
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:10,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that they took out that warping thing because that was such a pain.

1011
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:17,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, priests could teleport and they could open warp portals and they did something because that's not there anymore.

1012
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:18,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1013
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:24,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It really was based heavily off of Norse mythology.

1014
01:21:26,484 --> 01:21:28,565
[SPEAKER_08]: You have different classes.

1015
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:34,709
[SPEAKER_08]: They also offered transcendent classes that keep going forward.

1016
01:21:35,549 --> 01:21:37,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, with the different versions you have your jobs.

1017
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:40,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone starts off as a novice.

1018
01:21:41,373 --> 01:21:46,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you actually can become a super novice where you get different aspects of other classes.

1019
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:50,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you have a swordman who can become a knight or a crusader.

1020
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:54,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And then rebirth classes where you start over and rebuild them with more goodies.

1021
01:21:56,242 --> 01:22:01,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically your first job class is swordsman, mage, archer, merchant, thief, acolyte.

1022
01:22:02,187 --> 01:22:09,949
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you can expand to guns you also have expanded classes such as Gunslinger Ninja or Taekwon which playing a Taekwon is actually really fun

1023
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,843
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room was getting upset with the music because it's the only music you ever heard in the game.

1024
01:22:14,883 --> 01:22:17,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So I switched it because there was more than one song in Ragnarok Online.

1025
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:19,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love that music.

1026
01:22:19,406 --> 01:22:20,486
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Juno, isn't it?

1027
01:22:21,907 --> 01:22:22,968
[SPEAKER_08]: That music is so pretty.

1028
01:22:23,008 --> 01:22:23,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that area.

1029
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:24,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1030
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:26,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you might approve.

1031
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:30,293
[SPEAKER_08]: After the 2-1, you can actually become a Night Wizard, Hunter, Blacksmith, Assassin, or Priest.

1032
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a Blacksmith for a while named Tony Stark.

1033
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:33,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1034
01:22:34,195 --> 01:22:41,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Mecha, Crusader, Sage, Bard, Dancer, Alchemist, Rogue, Monk Lord Knight, High Wizard, Sniper, Master Smith, Assassin, Cross, High Priest Paladin, Scholar, Minstrel, Gypsy, Biochemist, Stalker, Champion

1035
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:02,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have to say that minstrels are pretty fun.

1036
01:23:04,215 --> 01:23:08,237
[SPEAKER_08]: For female ones, you had a dancer who basically looks like a harem chick.

1037
01:23:09,538 --> 01:23:10,819
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a soundtrack come out.

1038
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:13,180
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of stuff for this.

1039
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:21,824
[SPEAKER_08]: There are pay-to-play servers, and then there's tons of freemium stuff that goes on with it, too, like the Caffra shop.

1040
01:23:21,844 --> 01:23:22,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy different stuff.

1041
01:23:24,146 --> 01:23:28,368
[SPEAKER_08]: With free-to-play servers, basically, you can play for free, but to support...

1042
01:23:29,328 --> 01:23:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: The servers, they usually have special freebie goods or special goods that you can pay for.

1043
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:39,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for one server I played on, there used to be these little dolls you could get that sit on top of your head.

1044
01:23:39,816 --> 01:23:40,737
[SPEAKER_08]: They were selling doll hats.

1045
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:42,819
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a sprite artist who would make doll hats.

1046
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:45,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And you paid like 20 bucks and you got a doll hat.

1047
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:49,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was good because it kept the server paid for.

1048
01:23:49,022 --> 01:23:51,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it does cost money to keep these going off.

1049
01:23:52,062 --> 01:24:00,384
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also Ragnarok Mobile that you can use to focus on your characters.

1050
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:03,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the Ragnarok RPG that I've been playing.

1051
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:10,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a version on Game Boy that I... You got me the Japanese version of it, didn't you?

1052
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:10,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1053
01:24:11,127 --> 01:24:39,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the crap out of that because I could read Prontera and I knew where I was on the damn map and I think an English version of that since came out too but it is really fun I would say that if you're looking for just like a little freebie RPG to get into Ragnarok Online is really fun and like my favorite class still to this day is Assassin because it's like pow pow pow pow it's just all speed it was awesome so yeah my game is Ragnarok Online

1054
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:44,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Ragnarok Online for the PC.

1055
01:24:45,945 --> 01:24:48,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And various spin-offs on other devices that DarkSakura named.

1056
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:49,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1057
01:24:49,407 --> 01:24:51,247
[SPEAKER_06]: A game I haven't played in about ten years.

1058
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:54,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I have, I've been playing the one on the iPhone lately, and it's pretty fun.

1059
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:55,149
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1060
01:24:55,289 --> 01:24:55,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1061
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:57,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that out.

1062
01:24:57,089 --> 01:24:58,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you play a total... On my shiny new iPad.

1063
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,810
[SPEAKER_08]: You play a total asshole, though.

1064
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: He's so fun.

1065
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1066
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1067
01:25:06,182 --> 01:25:13,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a break here live as we are taping our episode number 458B here live on May the 27th of 2012.

1068
01:25:13,748 --> 01:25:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a quick break here, but don't go anywhere, guys.

[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty more show to come.

[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

[SPEAKER_06]: Well go back and listen to the first part of the show if you want to know why it is 458B.

01:26:09,023 --> 01:26:13,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm getting some people that are just sending me their ideas for VOG stuff, and I love it.

1082
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:15,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Bobby wants to hear it.

1083
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,410
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura would like to hear it.

1084
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, anybody you can talk to that's one of the hosts on VOG somewhere...

1085
01:26:21,034 --> 01:26:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, Travis, whoever you know we love hearing the ideas and I'm talking to somebody about one idea right now I'm like well that is a good idea actually yes we should do that and so I love it because it's you know just like Orange Lounge Radio where every gamer has a voice was never really just about us VOG Network isn't really just about us either so it's about me it's about everybody no it's about me and my fabulousness stop hating Rob stop hating she's being a parody alright stop hating let's move on

1086
01:26:47,646 --> 01:26:49,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the gaming news now.

1087
01:26:49,087 --> 01:26:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to travel around and check out some quick stories in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1088
01:26:54,351 --> 01:26:54,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1089
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:55,691
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1090
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:59,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little bit about some upcoming games.

1091
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:04,597
[SPEAKER_05]: XCOM Enemy Unknown actually has been announced to be coming out on October 9th.

1092
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:16,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I thought when I first saw this that this means, ah, damn, I guess we're not going to have any Grand Theft Auto V game announcement for October.

1093
01:27:17,846 --> 01:27:28,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not so sure if that's going to be the case anymore because actually there was an announcement for... Was it Take-Two put out their estimates for their fiscal years?

1094
01:27:29,488 --> 01:27:37,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And for 2013, which would cover up through now through... Was it March of... March 31st, 2013.

1095
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:41,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll play some awesome music.

1096
01:27:43,651 --> 01:28:06,004
[SPEAKER_05]: they have about 700 million dollars or you know unaccounted revenue in there and even if like some of these games do really well I don't think they're gonna hit that spot so people are thinking uh maybe that's Grand Theft Auto 5 in there somewhere which honestly if it were to come out in October it would um it probably would compete very well

1097
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,262
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't cannibalize stuff.

1098
01:28:11,263 --> 01:28:12,544
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope it's October.

1099
01:28:13,565 --> 01:28:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so yes, XCOM Enemy Unknown, October 9th, and I guess 13th internationally as well.

1100
01:28:22,933 --> 01:28:23,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

1101
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:34,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, there's rumors, spoiler, I don't know, that EA's next Need for Speed game is actually going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted.

1102
01:28:35,951 --> 01:28:38,194
[SPEAKER_05]: and perhaps a reboot of that franchise.

1103
01:28:38,214 --> 01:28:39,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, they already had a Most Wanted.

1104
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:40,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they did.

1105
01:28:40,577 --> 01:28:44,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They also had a Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but that didn't stop them from having that last year.

1106
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:48,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So perhaps Most Wanted could be, you know...

1107
01:28:52,597 --> 01:28:55,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Apple's methodology.

1108
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,280
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the new most wanted.

1109
01:28:58,421 --> 01:28:59,702
[SPEAKER_06]: More wanted-er.

1110
01:29:00,823 --> 01:29:01,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe most wanted-to.

1111
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:02,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1112
01:29:03,485 --> 01:29:11,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there's a schedule going around showing the game's going to be shown on...

1113
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:23,062
[SPEAKER_05]: EA's booth, and also apparently there was a Twitch TV feed or something like that for E3 that also has that listed on there as well, amongst some other TBA titles from Ubisoft.

1114
01:29:23,682 --> 01:29:33,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we'll probably see something from EA for Need for Speed Most Wanted, whether it be... I hope it's not the same damn title, because that's going to be confusing, because it didn't come out that long ago.

1115
01:29:33,692 --> 01:29:35,653
[SPEAKER_05]: That was only like five years ago.

1116
01:29:36,254 --> 01:29:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not that long in game time.

1117
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:44,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, Carmageddon Reincarnation has hit their goal with 10 days left to go.

1118
01:29:45,278 --> 01:29:53,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I guess that means we're going to be getting a remade Carmageddon game.

1119
01:29:53,882 --> 01:30:00,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding some DLC to it now and probably going to be setting some different stretch goals for that as well.

1120
01:30:01,065 --> 01:30:04,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And funding will be done in a few more days.

1121
01:30:06,647 --> 01:30:08,408
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on with some other news.

1122
01:30:09,649 --> 01:30:12,151
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever been to a website where you have to punch in CAPTCHA?

1123
01:30:12,772 --> 01:30:17,615
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like if you want to like download something or if you want to register for an account, you have to put in CAPTCHA.

1124
01:30:18,316 --> 01:30:20,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes the words are very like nonsense.

1125
01:30:20,618 --> 01:30:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this mock-up where somebody put kill me in the CAPTCHA.

1126
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:25,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I love this.

1127
01:30:25,241 --> 01:30:27,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there is... I had destroyed enemies once.

1128
01:30:28,204 --> 01:30:28,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you really?

1129
01:30:28,704 --> 01:30:29,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1130
01:30:29,184 --> 01:30:29,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1131
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:35,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I guess there's a new Detroit-based startup company and they're called Are You a Human?

1132
01:30:35,947 --> 01:30:42,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they aim to do, they want to replace the Captcha box that people use with mini-games.

1133
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1134
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It accomplishes the same thing.

1135
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't be able to beat the game if you weren't actually a human.

1136
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:55,574
[SPEAKER_06]: The tool they're developing is called Playthrough and it's going to allow a website owner to fight bots and spammers by using simple mini-games.

1137
01:30:55,934 --> 01:31:12,023
[SPEAKER_06]: for example there could be a level where you put tools in a toolbox or you put toppings on a pizza some websites that are already using this Quicken Loans and Fathead I don't know what Fathead does but Fathead makes giant posters on the wall of sports figures oh

1138
01:31:12,743 --> 01:31:14,145
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I had no idea who they were.

1139
01:31:14,205 --> 01:31:15,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't own any of those.

1140
01:31:15,467 --> 01:31:16,909
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have a sweet Tron poster.

1141
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:23,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own any of those either, but the reason I know they do that is because they also have that option for your Xbox Live avatar.

1142
01:31:23,257 --> 01:31:26,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, why the fuck would I want a six foot tall picture of my avatar on the wall?

1143
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:28,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I really have a big problem with your Tron poster.

1144
01:31:28,985 --> 01:31:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1145
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:35,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it looks like all those little teleporting effects are just really bad use of the blur tool.

1146
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:36,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry.

1147
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:42,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Tron, I did happen to see that that episode of Tron Uprising was on Disney last night.

1148
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:44,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, ooh, that's right.

1149
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We're only a couple weeks away from actual new episodes.

1150
01:31:46,851 --> 01:31:53,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what I found out is that, funny enough, a week from tonight, they are going to be doing some type of kickoff event at Downtown Disney.

1151
01:31:53,413 --> 01:31:54,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess where I'm gonna be, yo?

1152
01:31:55,254 --> 01:31:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So I plan to bring you a VOG.

1153
01:31:57,196 --> 01:31:58,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You better bring me Tron stuff.

1154
01:31:58,837 --> 01:32:01,699
[SPEAKER_06]: You better have a neon blue carpet.

1155
01:32:01,819 --> 01:32:02,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so going.

1156
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:05,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And there will be a full report on VOG for sure.

1157
01:32:07,304 --> 01:32:08,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not expecting much though.

1158
01:32:08,845 --> 01:32:13,068
[SPEAKER_06]: For all I know, they're just going to have a giant screen out in the middle of downtown Disney that's playing it.

1159
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:13,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1160
01:32:13,749 --> 01:32:16,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get kidnapped by a recognizer.

1161
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:17,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be awesome if Paul Rubens was there.

1162
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:19,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, it'd be awesome.

1163
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see, we'll see.

1164
01:32:20,338 --> 01:32:21,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to hold my breath.

1165
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know who was at Disneyland, by the way, last weekend when we were there?

1166
01:32:25,466 --> 01:32:26,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Lady Gaga.

1167
01:32:27,637 --> 01:32:28,818
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1168
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:50,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, don't ask me how I know that.

1169
01:32:50,193 --> 01:32:51,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1170
01:32:52,575 --> 01:32:55,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumors about a new Castlevania game on the 3DS.

1171
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the name has leaked out.

1172
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Castlevania Mirror of Faith.

1173
01:33:00,219 --> 01:33:02,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly this is a game that's going to be shown at E3.

1174
01:33:02,701 --> 01:33:03,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense to me.

1175
01:33:03,582 --> 01:33:05,803
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time there's a new Castlevania game out on a handheld.

1176
01:33:05,923 --> 01:33:08,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no reason to disbelieve this.

1177
01:33:09,325 --> 01:33:14,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially because it's funny because this particular site is a site Nintendo Netherlands or whatever.

1178
01:33:14,973 --> 01:33:19,039
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember OLR blew the story on that about six years ago.

1179
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,462
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the DS games we had the exclusive on.

1180
01:33:21,482 --> 01:33:23,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have no reason to doubt them.

1181
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:23,846
[SPEAKER_06]: They're sloppy.

1182
01:33:24,026 --> 01:33:24,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The names get out.

1183
01:33:26,974 --> 01:33:27,494
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1184
01:33:47,967 --> 01:34:13,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, they're claiming it's directly from Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft would know some of this shit because they are doing some of the launch games which include, for Ubisoft Rayman Legends, The Avengers, Assassin's Creed 3 and Just Dance 4 a game called Killer Freaks from Outer Space supposed to arrive a few weeks after launch those are some pretty specific, I mean, granted about three of those are a duh but Killer Freaks from Outer Space, you can't guess that that was announced at E3 last year oh was it?

1185
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that one yeah, they even had a video of it

1186
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:19,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so maybe it's just somebody using logic, but we'll see.

1187
01:34:19,912 --> 01:34:22,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a cross between the Rabbids and Critters.

1188
01:34:22,813 --> 01:34:25,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the Rabbids were like evil alien things.

1189
01:34:25,674 --> 01:34:26,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U does DirectX 11.

1190
01:34:27,514 --> 01:34:28,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already running Unreal Engine 4.

1191
01:34:29,835 --> 01:34:33,336
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 gigs of RAM, 560 megs of that dedicated to the OS.

1192
01:34:34,196 --> 01:34:40,138
[SPEAKER_06]: November 23rd, the launch date, but remember that's coming out of Milan, so could be a little bit around there for other regions.

1193
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:43,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch price hasn't yet been decided, but they're saying $350 to $450, which tells me $399.

1194
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiple versions of the console out there with developers.

1195
01:34:50,022 --> 01:34:53,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Graphics being powered by a Radeon HD 6770 chipset.

1196
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:56,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed 3 is 60 frames a second at 1080p.

1197
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:59,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It is only running 720p on the other consoles right now.

1198
01:35:01,246 --> 01:35:03,147
[SPEAKER_06]: November 23rd would be a Friday.

1199
01:35:03,207 --> 01:35:04,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they launch it.

1200
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that's Milan.

1201
01:35:06,088 --> 01:35:07,449
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not America.

1202
01:35:07,769 --> 01:35:09,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So there sometimes is some shift with the days.

1203
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:11,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know the other thing?

1204
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:11,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Those Italians.

1205
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:12,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Italians.

1206
01:35:12,691 --> 01:35:24,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's a problem I have with Ubisoft, this information coming from Ubisoft Milan, because Ubisoft Milan would be a, it's basically a portion of the company that does development for certain games.

1207
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So which game are they working on that they would be privy to this information?

1208
01:35:28,114 --> 01:35:40,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, Ubisoft Milan, let's see, let's... I'm sorry, I can't hear Ubisoft Milan without hearing in the back of my head RuPaul saying, London, Paris, Milan.

1209
01:35:42,614 --> 01:35:43,455
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1210
01:35:59,142 --> 01:36:05,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Most interesting about this, Valve working on a digital distribution platform and portal ports.

1211
01:36:05,963 --> 01:36:09,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be very interesting if Valve is involved with the Wii.

1212
01:36:09,684 --> 01:36:16,405
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to bring a heck of a lot of core gamer quote-unquote oomph to the Wii U. That would be amazing.

1213
01:36:16,845 --> 01:36:21,106
[SPEAKER_06]: One other thing I'll say here, the new button supposedly has some link to the Wii Vitality Sensor.

1214
01:36:21,466 --> 01:36:23,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe a new form of it or something like that.

1215
01:36:23,967 --> 01:36:25,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I figured it would be a biometric button.

1216
01:36:27,839 --> 01:36:34,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's it for the Wii U rumors, so let's move on with some more rapid fire news.

1217
01:36:35,293 --> 01:36:43,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Rob, well, how about some stuff having to do with touchscreen graffiti controls for Jet Set Radio?

1218
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:45,879
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for the Vita release.

1219
01:36:47,200 --> 01:37:01,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, well, and there's still not a date on it yet, but they're saying that they're bringing in touchscreen controls and camera integration so that I guess you can, for customizing your tags in the game, so that should be pretty cool.

1220
01:37:02,649 --> 01:37:17,181
[SPEAKER_08]: and then this is the thing that I lusted over yesterday and oh my god I want this so bad it like seriously makes me moist um girl the Street Fighter um

1221
01:37:19,302 --> 01:37:48,612
[SPEAKER_08]: 25th Anniversary Collector Set that comes in a big black box has a review figure 15 discs that includes on it Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition and the DLC and Street Fighter X Tekken and the DLC with a documentary, 2 anime movies, the full Street Fighter animated series and 11 discs of music

1222
01:37:48,832 --> 01:37:51,514
[SPEAKER_08]: and it has a light up Ryu statue and Ryu's belt.

1223
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:53,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That is too much Street Fighter.

1224
01:37:53,295 --> 01:37:53,655
[SPEAKER_08]: For $150.

1225
01:37:53,935 --> 01:37:55,616
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1226
01:37:55,916 --> 01:37:56,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I want it.

1227
01:37:57,357 --> 01:37:57,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you do.

1228
01:37:58,698 --> 01:38:00,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you are a consumer whore.

1229
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:00,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And how.

1230
01:38:01,879 --> 01:38:04,481
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, I don't care because I freaking love Street Fighter.

1231
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:10,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at this set and oh my dear God, it just, I'm literally moist right now.

1232
01:38:10,444 --> 01:38:10,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

1233
01:38:13,206 --> 01:38:14,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So, how about Harry Potter stuff?

1234
01:38:14,727 --> 01:38:15,167
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it?

1235
01:38:16,468 --> 01:38:19,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there's going to be a Harry Potter for Kinect and there's a trailer out.

1236
01:38:20,494 --> 01:38:23,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a really creepy face capture thing on it.

1237
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:26,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It does, but it actually looks pretty good.

1238
01:38:28,345 --> 01:38:31,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good in the trailer.

1239
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:35,521
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I'm like, the games are never really like that.

1240
01:38:36,062 --> 01:38:38,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make the damn MMO already.

1241
01:38:38,323 --> 01:38:38,824
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1242
01:38:40,065 --> 01:38:42,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw Harry Potter because fucking Ryu.

1243
01:38:42,847 --> 01:38:43,687
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's underage.

1244
01:38:44,068 --> 01:38:44,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Statue, not anymore.

1245
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Statues, statue of Ryu that lights up.

1246
01:38:49,071 --> 01:38:53,653
[SPEAKER_08]: with... It even has a certificate of authenticity.

1247
01:38:54,614 --> 01:38:55,274
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you pass that up?

1248
01:38:55,294 --> 01:38:56,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know it's authenticity.

1249
01:38:57,815 --> 01:39:05,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll go on my wall and I will stare at Ryu for hours because that was my first video game crush was Ryu when I was a little kid.

1250
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, that's kind of adorable.

1251
01:39:09,001 --> 01:39:09,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1252
01:39:09,581 --> 01:39:09,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1253
01:39:10,142 --> 01:39:10,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1254
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:10,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm spent.

1255
01:39:11,082 --> 01:39:11,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really spent.

1256
01:39:12,123 --> 01:39:12,383
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1257
01:39:12,743 --> 01:39:16,645
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to go to the Fugle question of the week.

1258
01:39:24,482 --> 01:39:32,929
[SPEAKER_06]: The Google Question of the Week is a segment of our show where we ask a question on Facebook and Google+, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

1259
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:34,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't ask one tonight.

1260
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:38,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you might have said, hey, I didn't see a new question on Facebook or Google this week.

1261
01:39:38,654 --> 01:39:43,537
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because we never got to read last week's answers because of the crash, and it was a pretty timely question.

1262
01:39:43,918 --> 01:39:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to go through some of those right now.

1263
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start on our Google Plus page.

1264
01:39:49,903 --> 01:39:50,283
Shit.

1265
01:39:50,823 --> 01:39:51,384
Google Plus.

1266
01:39:52,071 --> 01:39:54,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I just dropped that brand new iPad of mine.

1267
01:39:54,695 --> 01:39:55,376
[SPEAKER_06]: How convenient.

1268
01:39:56,979 --> 01:39:57,961
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I have a case on it.

1269
01:39:58,201 --> 01:39:59,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the weird thing.

1270
01:39:59,122 --> 01:40:00,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't access Facebook right now.

1271
01:40:01,206 --> 01:40:02,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you access Facebook, Loki?

1272
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:03,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I access Facebook?

1273
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it went.

1274
01:40:04,308 --> 01:40:04,709
[SPEAKER_06]: It just went.

1275
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

1276
01:40:05,129 --> 01:40:08,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was getting worried that I was going to miss the questions here.

1277
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:09,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

1278
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,170
[SPEAKER_06]: The question of the week.

1279
01:40:11,751 --> 01:40:14,451
[SPEAKER_06]: More and more games are incorporating multiplayer into their games.

1280
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Mass Effect 3.

1281
01:40:16,492 --> 01:40:21,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Some in the industry have been quoted as saying that multiplayer is essential in this day and age to having a successful game.

1282
01:40:22,114 --> 01:40:25,635
[SPEAKER_06]: How important do you feel that multiplayer is to the games you purchase?

1283
01:40:26,055 --> 01:40:29,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever been swayed on a game purchase because of the fact that it did or did not have multiplayer?

1284
01:40:31,249 --> 01:40:45,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment answers the question and says multiplayer is irrelevant to me due to my ISP being fucking incompetent PSN being incompetent and me cancelling Xbox Live Gold as part of my effort to buy a house so in other words the world is out to get him

1285
01:40:47,148 --> 01:40:52,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Vlogus responds and says, these are all from Google Plus again, Uncharted, Gears, Halo, etc.

1286
01:40:52,974 --> 01:40:55,918
[SPEAKER_06]: All have some form of competitive multiplayer that I've never tried.

1287
01:40:56,258 --> 01:41:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I only buy games for the single player component due to the rampant negativity on the online services.

1288
01:41:01,964 --> 01:41:04,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I do love co-op multiplayer with my family or friends.

1289
01:41:05,088 --> 01:41:08,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell Jamie I apologize for my bad grammar and punctuation.

1290
01:41:08,331 --> 01:41:09,391
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay, I'm not reading it.

1291
01:41:09,411 --> 01:41:11,392
[SPEAKER_06]: You apologized to the wrong person.

1292
01:41:11,912 --> 01:41:12,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm mad.

1293
01:41:12,713 --> 01:41:13,213
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1294
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,333
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually didn't do a bad job.

1295
01:41:15,114 --> 01:41:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I have pretty bad grammar myself, so I'm usually pretty forgiving.

1296
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:18,715
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1297
01:41:19,255 --> 01:41:25,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Jim, he was supposed to be here last week to answer this in person, but he decided to go on Google Plus and answer instead.

1298
01:41:26,419 --> 01:41:42,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaco Jones I don't care much for multiplayer modes in games because I'm all about the story and it doesn't make much sense story wise when there are seven Nathan Drakes running around shooting other players at the same time plus I rent or buy used so I don't even get to play multiplayer thanks to online passes

1299
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:52,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Facebook community now that Facebook is working for me at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and read some of the answers that you guys sent us over there.

1300
01:41:53,125 --> 01:42:01,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start off with a reply from DDR Dollar Bill who says, Never, as in, has you ever been swayed?

1301
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

1302
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:05,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiplayer never made or break a purchase for me.

1303
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:07,073
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice, but it wasn't life or death either.

1304
01:42:07,393 --> 01:42:11,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wouldn't change a game grade by one point if it was included nor excluded.

1305
01:42:12,456 --> 01:42:19,200
[SPEAKER_06]: JVmon says I almost never play multiplayer online and if I do it's only with friends who usually don't buy the same games as me.

1306
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Even then cross game chat fixes that problem and we can hang out while playing.

1307
01:42:23,903 --> 01:42:24,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So would it sway me?

1308
01:42:25,143 --> 01:42:25,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.

1309
01:42:27,054 --> 01:42:30,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a lot of people that are like, no, no, no, never, never, never.

1310
01:42:32,217 --> 01:42:33,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to an answer from RedTheHaze.

1311
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:44,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I've no problems with added multiplayer as long as it's good, builds on the single player game, and adds to the experience, but has no negative consequences to the single player.

1312
01:42:44,744 --> 01:42:54,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like when I bought Mass Effect 3 when it was on sale for $30 just for multiplayer, even though I haven't played Mass Effect 2, but I plan to play 3 once I get to.

1313
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Panaxium responded and said...

1314
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:19,068
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Prime Hunters was a lot more fun, except for the cramping and trolls, but I digress.

1315
01:43:19,509 --> 01:43:24,479
[SPEAKER_06]: In the end, I would rather have an amazing single experience than half-baked multiplayer.

1316
01:43:26,506 --> 01:43:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike B responded saying, I think it's great as long as it has a co-op story mode.

1317
01:43:31,707 --> 01:43:33,808
[SPEAKER_06]: It is fun playing through the story with friends.

1318
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:41,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like that whole co-op versus versus too because I think the type of multiplayer can really change a lot too.

1319
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:44,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's really important to state too.

1320
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:45,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a game like LittleBigPlanet

1321
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:48,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Really is enhanced by the multiplayer.

1322
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:50,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one game I didn't really see get brought up here.

1323
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:55,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But a game like LittleBigPlanet really gets enhanced because it's more of a co-op.

1324
01:43:56,536 --> 01:43:58,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I'm into Mass Effect 3 right now.

1325
01:43:59,377 --> 01:44:00,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of that is because it's co-op.

1326
01:44:02,919 --> 01:44:11,166
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't necessary, especially for established single-player franchises, but sometimes it can be a welcome addition that doesn't take away from its campaign.

1327
01:44:11,487 --> 01:44:15,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal 2, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 are just a few examples.

1328
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:16,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all really good examples.

1329
01:44:18,312 --> 01:44:23,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read one more from John K. Oh, excuse me, I didn't read the name.

1330
01:44:23,417 --> 01:44:24,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Critical Myth, my bad.

1331
01:44:49,861 --> 01:44:54,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, those are all answers from our Facebook account, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1332
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:58,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Come thumbs up us over there and you can answer a question in a future week.

1333
01:44:58,663 --> 01:44:59,924
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you guys here in studio?

1334
01:45:00,304 --> 01:45:02,184
[SPEAKER_06]: How important is multiplayer to you?

1335
01:45:02,784 --> 01:45:03,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.

1336
01:45:03,985 --> 01:45:05,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really give a crap about it.

1337
01:45:05,285 --> 01:45:06,946
[SPEAKER_06]: You really go out of your way to avoid it.

1338
01:45:07,226 --> 01:45:08,146
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet you play an MMO.

1339
01:45:09,338 --> 01:45:11,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you notice, what do I do most of the time?

1340
01:45:11,779 --> 01:45:12,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I quest.

1341
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I play by myself and just chat with people.

1342
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:17,603
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the having to play with other people.

1343
01:45:18,183 --> 01:45:19,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I like raiding, okay?

1344
01:45:19,784 --> 01:45:21,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm with my guildmates.

1345
01:45:21,825 --> 01:45:23,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with people that I pretty much know.

1346
01:45:25,482 --> 01:45:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: PVP I hate I mean I don't really mind doing like the most fun that I have in dungeons is when basically I've just tagged along with you know with the ones that you've done for like what was that one that was really fun that you drug me around in your motorcycle for

1347
01:45:42,556 --> 01:45:43,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The Isle of Conquest?

1348
01:45:43,677 --> 01:45:44,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Isle of Conquest.

1349
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun because I was playing with you and Alan.

1350
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,201
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.

1351
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:52,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just have this thing about the random stranger thing.

1352
01:45:53,805 --> 01:45:57,768
[SPEAKER_08]: All appearances to the contrary, I am a bit of an introvert.

1353
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:06,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I've taught myself how to be outwardly extroverted, but really I kind of like to do my own thing and stick with the folks I know.

1354
01:46:06,755 --> 01:46:07,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1355
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:31,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost my train of thought that's alright I'll go ahead and just say I really agree with the answer that said it's best when it more enhances a single player game that's already there especially the examples of Portal 2 and Mass Effect 3 I think are two great examples of where multiplayer really just sweetened the pot for a game that would have already been worth the asking price

1356
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:34,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Portal 2 Multiplayer Portal 2 Strangers

1357
01:47:00,752 --> 01:47:01,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so mature.

1358
01:47:01,892 --> 01:47:05,513
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, before I get to Loki's answer, let me get to our chat room.

1359
01:47:05,793 --> 01:47:07,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks talking about Skyrim.

1360
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, obviously Skyrim gets brought up as a game that didn't need multiplayer to be successful.

1361
01:47:11,894 --> 01:47:16,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally says, Skyrim is awesome, but it would be twice as good if a co-op mode was added.

1362
01:47:16,195 --> 01:47:17,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people have been asking for something like that.

1363
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:21,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But ShadowNextGen says, I don't know if Skyrim would be good with co-op.

1364
01:47:21,516 --> 01:47:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is really all about your personal choices.

1365
01:47:25,137 --> 01:47:28,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily need multiplayer for Final Fantasy or something like that.

1366
01:47:48,813 --> 01:48:10,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Blender brings up a great point in our chat room what about Journey Orange Lounge Radio and he's not talking about the one from the 80s about the band he's talking about that new one on PlayStation Network and I gotta say no one's bought it for me yet well I have it and I've played through it and I gotta say Journey is like on a whole nother level with the multiplayer it's like a new type of multiplayer experience you can't even really define you don't have to talk to them do you

1367
01:48:10,698 --> 01:48:11,579
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you never do.

1368
01:48:28,427 --> 01:48:51,249
[SPEAKER_06]: which it's it's so crazy like the simplicity of the game and kind of what it's done for multiplayer games Journey again if you haven't played it on PlayStation 3 and you own a PlayStation 3 you really gotta check it out it just it's amazing it was better when people didn't tell you there was a multiplayer component and I did not even know there was going to be multiplayer in it and I was just blown away amazing

1369
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:54,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for the Fugle Question of the Week.

1370
01:48:54,591 --> 01:48:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to everybody who responded.

1371
01:48:56,012 --> 01:48:57,432
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a ton of answers on Facebook.

1372
01:48:57,452 --> 01:48:59,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry I didn't have time to read all of them.

1373
01:48:59,913 --> 01:49:02,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But answer us in a future week, and we'll try to get some in.

1374
01:49:02,755 --> 01:49:07,537
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always get your thoughts through to our mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1375
01:49:08,397 --> 01:49:09,839
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll read those in a future week.

1376
01:49:10,059 --> 01:49:11,180
[SPEAKER_08]: For now... We don't have any.

1377
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:16,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sadly we didn't get any mail this week so we don't have anything to read but maybe in a future week.

1378
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:18,528
[SPEAKER_06]: For now though, let's get to some news.

1379
01:49:18,728 --> 01:49:18,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1380
01:49:19,809 --> 01:49:20,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1381
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:22,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about...

1382
01:49:23,573 --> 01:49:24,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1383
01:49:40,057 --> 01:49:57,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for a project called Destiny and also they're talking about some of the expected bonuses and stuff based on performance and also saying that they're going to have a version of the game that's going to come out on the Xbox 360.

1384
01:50:00,942 --> 01:50:09,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in the fall of 2013, there's going to be follow-ups in multiple years, and it's supposed to be a four-game deal.

1385
01:50:09,384 --> 01:50:14,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, at the end of that, they're going to have the option to fund a new marathon game.

1386
01:50:17,006 --> 01:50:17,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

1387
01:50:18,147 --> 01:50:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's definitely a lot of...

1388
01:50:21,327 --> 01:50:29,689
[SPEAKER_05]: corporate mumbo jumbo at least in the leaked document but it'll be cool to see what this new Destiny game is supposed to be like.

1389
01:50:30,409 --> 01:50:31,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be like Halo.

1390
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:33,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking it will be.

1391
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:40,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping it would be Pimps at Sea but you know unfortunately we can dream but that's not going to happen.

1392
01:50:41,932 --> 01:50:43,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

1393
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,542
[SPEAKER_06]: have no part of this whole authenticator and ways to protect their account.

1394
01:51:07,822 --> 01:51:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So Blizzard's coming in and saying, well, people need to be more careful with their account information, but apparently it has come through in recent days that there are a small number of accounts that are being hacked with authenticators on them, but it's coming through malware on the user system.

1395
01:51:26,668 --> 01:51:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: and the blue posts that are on the forums are very adamant that, yeah, we're looking at the MSInfo files of people that are saying they're getting hacked with an authenticator and they've got all sorts of malware on the system and that's where it's coming from.

1396
01:51:37,651 --> 01:51:46,993
[SPEAKER_06]: So this whole single player always connected experience is really starting to rub people the wrong way and this is just the latest feather in that hat.

1397
01:51:47,053 --> 01:51:47,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, really?

1398
01:51:48,233 --> 01:51:54,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not want to fucking deal with this and now people are getting hacked and all this shit because they don't have an authenticator on their account?

1399
01:51:54,895 --> 01:52:00,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Diablo 3 had amazing sales in their first week, but what is the long-term damage this shit is causing?

1400
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked a little more about this on Horde House this week at www.hordehouse.com, my World of Warcraft themed spinoff show, but to kind of ask here a little bit, Loki, I think you're a good one to ask because you're not as sucked into this Warcraft phenomenon as DarkSakura and I are.

1401
01:52:16,572 --> 01:52:23,096
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts about Diablo 3 being always connected and have they screwed PC games

1402
01:52:24,277 --> 01:52:29,041
[SPEAKER_06]: that might want to explore this in the future with this consistent botched thing after another.

1403
01:52:29,281 --> 01:52:33,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I never like any always connected games there, especially if it's not required.

1404
01:52:33,584 --> 01:52:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not an MMO, then what's the point of me having to be always required a connection for this to happen?

1405
01:52:39,888 --> 01:52:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, say, if I want a game on my laptop, it doesn't mean I'm going to have Wi-Fi everywhere I go.

1406
01:52:45,752 --> 01:52:45,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1407
01:52:47,133 --> 01:52:53,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that kind of sucks if I can't play my game that I purchased because I don't have an internet connection at the time.

1408
01:52:56,099 --> 01:52:56,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

1409
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's another reason why I wouldn't get the game, I guess.

1410
01:53:01,063 --> 01:53:04,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than, you know, just don't really want to buy the game.

1411
01:53:05,646 --> 01:53:07,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn, our chatroom, asks, so it's malware?

1412
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:10,849
[SPEAKER_06]: The rumor was it was joining public games that opened you up to it.

1413
01:53:11,229 --> 01:53:14,611
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Blizzard is passionately denying those claims.

1414
01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:14,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1415
01:53:15,913 --> 01:53:20,378
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've learned, though, throughout other parts of the game industry, that doesn't necessarily always mean anything, though.

1416
01:53:20,919 --> 01:53:30,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to think that they've tested that and it's true, but... And just because you have malware, I mean, because there's a lot of malware out there, but, I mean...

1417
01:53:31,993 --> 01:53:34,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying, oh, well, we can see that you have malware on your system.

1418
01:53:35,437 --> 01:53:37,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the same malware for each thing?

1419
01:53:37,438 --> 01:53:40,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what exactly does this malware do?

1420
01:53:42,003 --> 01:53:48,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's malware that just, I go search something on Google and all of a sudden I get transferred to another page that has nothing to do with what I just searched for.

1421
01:53:49,049 --> 01:53:50,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like another search engine.

1422
01:53:50,230 --> 01:53:55,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it something that's like, I'm specifically putting this malware on your system to steal your information?

1423
01:53:56,596 --> 01:54:17,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, why can't Blizzard, just to give extra protection to the accounts, very similar to what Star Wars, the Old Republic did, you have these personal questions that only you would know the answer to, and whenever Star Wars suspects that you're making a major change or you're doing something weird where it might not really be you, it asks you to answer three of those questions at random.

1424
01:54:17,437 --> 01:54:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1425
01:54:17,977 --> 01:54:19,638
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, why couldn't they?

1426
01:54:20,299 --> 01:54:24,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, you usually play Diablo 3 in Sacramento, California.

1427
01:54:25,142 --> 01:54:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: All of a sudden, you're trying to log in from China.

1428
01:54:27,983 --> 01:54:37,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should ask you a private question that only you would know the answer to because the odds that you were playing in California and now you're suddenly playing in China are very, very low.

1429
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:54,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Or here's a thought, since we've gotten these little readouts of what processes you have running and stuff, and we've noticed that there's specific malware programs or whatever running.

1430
01:54:54,861 --> 01:54:55,942
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1431
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's because probably none of that has any information.

1432
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:34,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like saying, oh, well, you know, you've got some sort of virus on your computer, so that must be how they're hacking your system.

1433
01:55:34,867 --> 01:55:38,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And seriously, most malware that you'll find are usually like site trackers.

1434
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:40,109
[SPEAKER_08]: That type of thing.

1435
01:55:40,169 --> 01:55:41,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing that's really going to have anything.

1436
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:42,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for advertising.

1437
01:55:42,871 --> 01:55:43,411
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

1438
01:55:45,032 --> 01:55:46,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

1439
01:55:48,313 --> 01:55:50,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope Blizzard can patch this shit up.

1440
01:55:50,634 --> 01:55:52,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously think they're doing some long-term damage here.

1441
01:55:53,155 --> 01:55:54,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I did find a new patch applied last night.

1442
01:55:55,096 --> 01:55:55,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah?

1443
01:55:55,696 --> 01:55:59,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't see what it was for, but they did patch my game last night.

1444
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:00,681
[SPEAKER_06]: We ain't found shit!

1445
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:32,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess some people in chat are saying they emailed within the past hour or so.

1446
01:56:32,406 --> 01:56:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, check it again.

1447
01:56:33,428 --> 01:56:34,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to check it again?

1448
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:36,893
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do the FUs of the week first.

1449
01:56:37,373 --> 01:56:38,515
[SPEAKER_05]: This is usually the time we do that.

1450
01:56:38,615 --> 01:56:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Loki wants to jump in.

1451
01:56:39,917 --> 01:56:41,920
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was just going to jump in with some random stuff.

1452
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured I'd... Already logged in.

1453
01:56:44,143 --> 01:56:44,644
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one.

1454
01:56:46,139 --> 01:57:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing Google searches for information regarding this Xbox jacking stuff there's actually a whole bunch of information about doxing which is finding out the information on people like their name, city, state all the personal information based on some of this other stuff and that's how they steal accounts it's by knowing all your personal information tons of ebooks on it too be careful who you add on your social networks that's for sure so we have one

1455
01:57:16,232 --> 01:57:17,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yay, we do have an email after all.

1456
01:57:17,902 --> 01:57:18,345
[SPEAKER_06]: From Munma.

1457
01:57:18,989 --> 01:57:19,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1458
01:57:20,532 --> 01:57:21,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Question for the staff.

1459
01:57:21,612 --> 01:57:26,774
[SPEAKER_08]: What has to be the single most expensive gaming accessory you have purchased for your gaming console?

1460
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:34,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And to read the disclaimer, this email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, the podcast about anime, cosplay, convention, roasting, pop culture, and everything in between.

1461
01:57:34,377 --> 01:57:35,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Podcast guaranteed to derail in 10 minutes.

1462
01:57:35,898 --> 01:57:36,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Your money back.

1463
01:57:36,398 --> 01:57:38,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Check us out at www.animejamsession.com.

1464
01:57:38,959 --> 01:57:42,780
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the cheapest fucking plug I have ever seen in the history of this show.

1465
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:46,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask a really generic question and then plug the shit out of my show.

1466
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:48,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Micro Machines.

1467
01:57:48,843 --> 01:57:50,084
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright, you know what?

1468
01:57:50,585 --> 01:58:01,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we love Anime Jam Session John Machida was great We're gonna allow it I did buy my husband Steel Battalion Oh yeah?

1469
01:58:01,673 --> 01:58:02,914
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1470
01:58:21,625 --> 01:58:47,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, but keep in mind, if you look at my BitMoney collection, I've got a poppin' music controller, I have four 2DX controllers now, I have two Guitar Freaks controllers, I have a keyboard for Keyboard Mania, I have a drum controller for Drum Mania, and then we have all this crap we have for Guitar Hero, so it's really hard to say when you look at the whole thing, but I think the single most expensive has to be the Steel Battalion controller, because that was 300 bucks.

1471
01:58:50,491 --> 01:59:01,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the most expensive... I know this probably doesn't count for the original question, but I fucking bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 just so I could play all those Bomani games back in the day, so I think I get that one.

1472
01:59:01,534 --> 01:59:06,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, you know, I bought the controller, I bought the DDR mats, all to work with the Japanese setup.

1473
01:59:06,595 --> 01:59:07,536
[SPEAKER_08]: We bought a JPS2.

1474
01:59:07,796 --> 01:59:10,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, keyboard... I bought fucking keyboard mania, okay?

1475
01:59:11,177 --> 01:59:13,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that qualifies.

1476
01:59:13,317 --> 01:59:14,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you what our most expensive game was.

1477
01:59:15,078 --> 01:59:15,278
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1478
01:59:15,618 --> 01:59:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Was probably Dracula X. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1479
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:19,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1480
01:59:19,379 --> 01:59:19,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1481
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought an arcade cabinet to put DDR in.

1482
01:59:24,964 --> 01:59:27,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Never really gone around to putting DDR in it, though.

1483
01:59:27,146 --> 01:59:30,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But looking at accessories on their own, what is the most...

1484
01:59:31,829 --> 01:59:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all my Rockman stuff.

1485
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:43,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have, you know, $100 guitar here and drum set and another bass guitar that I got specially that's collecting dust under my desk at work.

1486
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:48,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what was your most expensive system?

1487
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:50,841
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the most you've ever paid for a single video game system?

1488
01:59:50,941 --> 01:59:52,161
[SPEAKER_05]: My first Xbox 360.

1489
01:59:53,142 --> 01:59:56,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you dumb bastard.

1490
01:59:57,945 --> 01:59:59,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You did pay a lot for that.

1491
02:00:01,545 --> 02:00:02,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it your PS2?

1492
02:00:02,965 --> 02:00:04,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Most I paid for a system?

1493
02:00:04,546 --> 02:00:05,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1494
02:00:06,047 --> 02:00:07,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be my PlayStation 3.

1495
02:00:08,128 --> 02:00:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a PS3 was more expensive than importing the PlayStation 2.

1496
02:00:11,889 --> 02:00:16,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I will second that because keep in mind when we bought ours, we still have our first model PS3.

1497
02:00:17,052 --> 02:00:21,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks to Discover, we got $100 knocked off of it because we got a reward on it.

1498
02:00:22,574 --> 02:00:25,296
[SPEAKER_08]: So we paid $600 for our first model PS3.

1499
02:00:26,391 --> 02:00:34,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at vognetwork.com said, I own a very expensive set of Roland V-Drums, and I just put it on TwitPick.

1500
02:00:35,877 --> 02:00:37,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it does work with... That does.

1501
02:00:38,199 --> 02:00:40,620
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not really necessarily an accessory.

1502
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so then moving forward to... Because I really like elaborating on this one.

1503
02:00:44,703 --> 02:00:46,484
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the most you've ever paid for a game?

1504
02:00:47,464 --> 02:00:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The most I've ever paid for a game?

1505
02:00:49,846 --> 02:00:51,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, Japanese importing...

1506
02:00:52,622 --> 02:00:56,986
[SPEAKER_06]: and probably Beatmania 2DX6 style.

1507
02:00:57,026 --> 02:01:00,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was probably the most expensive one I got because I got that when it was brand, brand new.

1508
02:01:01,069 --> 02:01:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I have actually paid more than $100 for a game.

1509
02:01:03,611 --> 02:01:05,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever paid more than that.

1510
02:01:05,513 --> 02:01:09,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid $120 for the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game on Super Famicom.

1511
02:01:10,317 --> 02:01:11,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I take that back.

1512
02:01:12,019 --> 02:01:13,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Add up all the months of World of Warcraft.

1513
02:01:14,421 --> 02:01:16,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm saying for the game itself.

1514
02:01:17,023 --> 02:01:19,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Alan's joining us and I think wants to say something.

1515
02:01:19,824 --> 02:01:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Alan So we're talking about most spent on a game Yes sir When I was, there was a year or two where I was importing Japanese games And I only got four or five of them But I want to say Tobel number two The sequel to the Square Fighting game I think I spent close to like 90, 95 bucks all told to get that game It also had the demo on it though for Final Fantasy 7, wasn't it?

1516
02:01:45,615 --> 02:01:48,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I think so Yeah Alan, remember when we had disposable income?

1517
02:01:50,194 --> 02:01:51,015
[SPEAKER_06]: What about you, Loki?

1518
02:01:51,115 --> 02:01:51,295

[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1521
02:01:53,338 --> 02:01:55,060
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the most you've ever paid for a game?

1522
02:01:55,661 --> 02:01:57,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Standalone didn't come with anything else.

1523
02:01:59,637 --> 02:02:25,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Motorstorm Apocalypse because it was a beta or it was a barely yeah you bought that on eBay or something didn't you yeah yeah so I would what about people who bought that Capcom mech game that was like 200 bucks because they have the whole controller oh Steel Battalion I've got no check this now I have two copies and two controllers you're sick but I mean that would love

[SPEAKER_06]: I love SSJ100, Matt.

1527
02:02:33,327 --> 02:02:36,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The most I've ever spent on a game was Yaris for zero points.

1528
02:02:36,568 --> 02:02:38,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Paid way too much for it.

1529
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:39,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1530
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:41,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, the most we ever spent on a what?

1531
02:02:41,451 --> 02:02:41,851
[SPEAKER_06]: A system?

1532
02:02:42,571 --> 02:02:44,672
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think is your most valuable system that you own?

1533
02:02:46,794 --> 02:02:49,595
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of personal value and then in terms of financial value.

1534
02:02:50,618 --> 02:02:53,779
[SPEAKER_06]: My still working Super Nintendo in terms of personal value.

1535
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,101
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of actual... I don't really have a lot of rare systems.

1536
02:02:58,141 --> 02:03:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have any old shit that still works.

1537
02:03:03,803 --> 02:03:05,924
[SPEAKER_06]: The HD DVD player on my Xbox 360.

1538
02:03:06,844 --> 02:03:13,547
[SPEAKER_05]: My arcade system for most valuable and for personal value.

1539
02:03:13,747 --> 02:03:15,108
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox of fame.

1540
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:17,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I think our most valuable one is our Neo Geo.

1541
02:03:33,345 --> 02:03:33,585
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

1542
02:03:50,276 --> 02:03:54,659
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about how much money we've spent on this sick obsession here.

1543
02:03:55,940 --> 02:04:01,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Burr in the chat room is trying to call me out saying, Sky had disposable income that could have gone to improving the show.

1544
02:04:02,025 --> 02:04:03,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking about that stinking power device.

1545
02:04:03,686 --> 02:04:05,968
[SPEAKER_07]: He did put a lot of money into the show.

1546
02:04:05,988 --> 02:04:07,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this iPad.

1547
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:12,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I just did the Facebook questions for the Fugle Question of the Week off the iPad.

1548
02:04:13,093 --> 02:04:16,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So it did go to improving the show, just so you know.

1549
02:04:17,653 --> 02:04:34,765
[SPEAKER_08]: by the way I'd like to answer a niche or is it niche or niche whatever I think it's Nietzsche Nietzsche that's not how the philosopher's name is spelled oh well whatever there should be a T and a Z in there we did not buy a 3DO because there is all of crap for 3DO we did almost buy a CDI

1550
02:04:36,385 --> 02:04:47,810
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want me to go through the list of what we own we'll need a whole other show for that alright that's it for the mailbag now we will do the FUs of the week angst, anger um

1551
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm angry at being sick.

1552
02:05:09,603 --> 02:05:11,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I feel tons better now.

1553
02:05:11,445 --> 02:05:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what's funny.

1554
02:05:12,406 --> 02:05:13,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I slept all day yesterday.

1555
02:05:14,068 --> 02:05:16,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally almost all day yesterday.

1556
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:19,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And I slept most of this morning, had weird ass freaking fever dreams.

1557
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:26,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I go out on my bicycle feeling like crap because I needed to go get NyQuil from the Kmart around the corner from my house.

1558
02:05:26,841 --> 02:05:27,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's about a mile.

1559
02:05:28,142 --> 02:05:31,804
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I rode my bike a mile there, got all my stuff, rode it back with a backpack full of stuff.

1560
02:05:32,665 --> 02:05:36,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was so hot and feverish and shaky when I got home.

1561
02:05:37,108 --> 02:05:41,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my fever broke from my bike ride because now, like, my lungs feel better.

1562
02:05:41,891 --> 02:05:47,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have, you know, the stupid sinus headache, but I feel, like, infinitely better than I have in weeks.

1563
02:05:47,895 --> 02:05:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So, F you to having to go through all of that just to feel better.

1564
02:05:51,758 --> 02:05:55,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to bread.

1565
02:05:56,881 --> 02:05:58,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having to go back on raw food again.

1566
02:06:01,103 --> 02:06:05,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, don't knock Kmart because I got a Sonic the Hedgehog shirt there.

1567
02:06:06,566 --> 02:06:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's cheap.

1568
02:06:09,247 --> 02:06:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1569
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to my cult and F you to power not being available during our show sometimes.

1570
02:06:19,952 --> 02:06:22,154
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the music stopping.

1571
02:06:23,801 --> 02:06:32,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, F you to Burr in our chatroom for saying the Fugo questions just had to be read from a retina display to protect Skye's precious eyes.

1572
02:06:32,467 --> 02:06:33,668
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, F you.

1573
02:06:33,688 --> 02:06:39,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then my other F you of the week goes to this cough that will not leave.

1574
02:06:41,233 --> 02:06:43,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've had this cough for like two weeks.

1575
02:06:43,055 --> 02:06:44,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember when I was sick on the show a couple weeks ago?

1576
02:06:44,876 --> 02:06:45,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have the cough.

1577
02:06:45,937 --> 02:06:46,397
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may.

1578
02:06:46,577 --> 02:06:47,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just hiding it well.

1579
02:06:47,318 --> 02:06:47,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, ma'am.

1580
02:06:47,678 --> 02:06:48,779
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's medical advice.

1581
02:06:50,868 --> 02:06:55,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I'm not a doctor, disclaimer, disclaimer Are you taking any Guafenicin?

1582
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:58,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse you, what is that?

1583
02:06:59,091 --> 02:07:02,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Mucinex This is the former, what's that store?

1584
02:07:02,632 --> 02:07:19,777
[SPEAKER_08]: GC, whatever that you used to work at I used to work at GMC Yeah, that's a GMC Well, you can go to the dollar store, Rob And get plain old Guafenicin And take two doses of it And it is the pharmacy dose And I guarantee you, it will clear up your cough

1585
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:22,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what else will it do to me?

1586
02:07:22,893 --> 02:07:25,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same stuff the doctor gives you a prescription.

1587
02:07:26,898 --> 02:07:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1588
02:07:29,902 --> 02:07:32,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I like my big gay life, dammit.

1589
02:07:32,565 --> 02:07:34,387
[SPEAKER_08]: All it does is a mucus thinner.

1590
02:07:34,487 --> 02:07:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps you produce it so that you don't have it causing the cough anymore.

1591
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:38,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1592
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,082
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how mine has gotten better.

1593
02:07:41,062 --> 02:07:41,383
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1594
02:07:41,403 --> 02:07:42,303
[SPEAKER_08]: That and lots of NyQuil.

1595
02:07:42,924 --> 02:07:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more stories for you guys.

1596
02:07:44,265 --> 02:07:49,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1597
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1598
02:07:50,790 --> 02:07:51,191
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1599
02:07:51,291 --> 02:07:54,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk once again about more Activision drama.

1600
02:07:54,073 --> 02:08:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of ties in with the whole lawsuit between, you know, Wes and Zempela versus Activision.

1601
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:06,983
[SPEAKER_05]: and just some of the dirty stuff that went on.

1602
02:08:07,163 --> 02:08:13,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously the first part of the lawsuit's been settled, but there's still the whole lawsuit against those people.

1603
02:08:14,667 --> 02:08:17,629
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this thing that came out called Project Icebreaker.

1604
02:08:17,949 --> 02:08:24,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it was an initiative designed by Activision to secretly scour the computers of those two individuals

1605
02:08:25,013 --> 02:08:27,155
[SPEAKER_05]: for evidence that would support a firing.

1606
02:08:27,556 --> 02:08:34,362
[SPEAKER_05]: This involved them attempting to hack into their accounts or their systems.

1607
02:08:34,642 --> 02:08:40,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the possibility of faking a fire drill to get them to leave the building so that someone could go and hack into their computers.

1608
02:08:41,669 --> 02:08:43,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Just dirty shit.

1609
02:08:43,731 --> 02:08:49,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, I can't believe that they would even... Well, no, I can believe that they could do that because it's Activision.

1610
02:08:50,437 --> 02:08:50,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1611
02:08:52,592 --> 02:09:10,409
[SPEAKER_05]: also um you know of course some of the stuff you know during that's been released is spreadsheets um talking about the top 20 um Infinity Ward employees and their salaries and of course Wes and Zempella have made quite a bit of money um apparently they've each uh

1612
02:09:12,376 --> 02:09:13,317
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1613
02:09:34,508 --> 02:09:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reading some of that crazy shit on the internet, those Activision emails and so forth, and it's a scary inside look to how some of this shit operates.

1614
02:09:42,532 --> 02:09:45,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, man, it's almost evil.

1615
02:09:46,313 --> 02:09:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It is evil.

1616
02:09:47,814 --> 02:09:49,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not almost evil, we know how evil they are.

1617
02:09:53,699 --> 02:10:04,591
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're asking a lawyer to do something illegal, they're like, I don't know if I'm comfortable doing that.

1618
02:10:05,051 --> 02:10:06,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just ridiculous.

1619
02:10:07,313 --> 02:10:10,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move from something evil to just kind of shady.

1620
02:10:10,297 --> 02:10:11,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1621
02:10:12,298 --> 02:10:22,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with THQ, and I guess they're going to be having a June 29 stockholders meeting where they're going to do what's called a reverse stock split to avoid a delisting from NASDAQ.

1622
02:10:22,407 --> 02:10:25,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's really not shady, it's just business, but I guess it's sad.

1623
02:10:26,009 --> 02:10:27,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tricky way of doing things.

1624
02:10:27,451 --> 02:10:27,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

1625
02:10:27,871 --> 02:10:28,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally is.

1626
02:10:28,612 --> 02:10:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit like the shell game.

1627
02:10:30,733 --> 02:10:32,695
[SPEAKER_08]: They are going to have some pissed off investors.

1628
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyhow, apparently what's going to happen is that they have to do the stock split to maintain $1 per share minimum that NASDAQ requires.

1629
02:10:41,874 --> 02:10:48,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there are going to be three options in the process, one of three, one of five, and one of ten, reverse stock split ratios.

1630
02:10:49,277 --> 02:10:54,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of these options, it means there are fewer outstanding shares with an increased apparent value per share.

1631
02:10:55,379 --> 02:11:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, if they do a one to three reverse stock split, each stockholder will own one stock for every three that they had prior to the split, even though the total value of the company doesn't change.

1632
02:11:07,765 --> 02:11:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So that 61 cents that they're currently trading at, they do a one of 10.

1633
02:11:12,347 --> 02:11:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's, oh, it's $6.10 a share, but hopefully you only have one share instead of 10.

1634
02:11:17,929 --> 02:11:18,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1635
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:20,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can do that.

1636
02:11:21,751 --> 02:11:25,272
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if you have two shares?

1637
02:11:25,292 --> 02:11:26,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to say.

1638
02:11:26,112 --> 02:11:28,493
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that get novelty stock.

1639
02:11:28,513 --> 02:11:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They just buy one share.

1640
02:11:29,473 --> 02:11:32,034
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, how many people just buy one share of THQ?

1641
02:11:32,554 --> 02:11:32,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

1642
02:11:32,914 --> 02:11:39,396
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got more people that do that shit with Facebook or Disney or Coca-Cola or Pepsi, big companies.

1643
02:11:39,997 --> 02:11:40,177
[SPEAKER_06]: There's...

1644
02:11:41,317 --> 02:11:46,758
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a company out there, some website, and I hate that I'm giving them free advertising, but whatever.

1645
02:11:46,798 --> 02:11:54,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like buyoneshare.com or oneshare.com, and they actually do this whole little shtick where they'll print out a certificate, and you can frame it.

1646
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:56,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a gift-giving thing.

1647
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a neat idea for a gift.

1648
02:11:59,281 --> 02:12:07,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they did a report on some website the other day, and it was like, if you had bought one share of Apple in 1982, it would be worth $1,000 now.

1649
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:18,903
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom, who actually worked for Intel for a while, part of their thing was that each employee got a certain amount of stock.

1650
02:12:19,803 --> 02:12:26,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this was way back in the 70s and 80s and stuff, and she still has it.

1651
02:12:26,986 --> 02:12:29,126
[SPEAKER_05]: She found the certificate in the attic the other day.

1652
02:12:29,146 --> 02:12:29,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1653
02:12:29,947 --> 02:12:39,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny, as we looked into it, and that split so many times since that one share of stock, I only think it was one share, it was like a few shares of stock, it was like,

1654
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:41,291
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1655
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:27,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have the Twitter topics up yet so maybe Loki I know there might be some last minute stories tonight because there was a lot of stuff we had to cut from tonight's show and it's just it's picking up as we move towards E3 I'm sure we've got some stuff here of course I'm not ready as usual

1656
02:13:29,465 --> 02:13:33,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still looking at that hacking stuff.

1657
02:13:33,087 --> 02:13:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting.

1658
02:13:34,427 --> 02:13:37,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe all the information that they have out there.

1659
02:13:38,308 --> 02:13:52,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically telling you to use those white pages or reverse searches and stuff like that to find out people's personal information that your phone company and stuff collects so you can hack someone's Xbox Live account.

1660
02:13:53,034 --> 02:13:53,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.

1661
02:13:54,394 --> 02:13:54,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1662
02:13:54,955 --> 02:13:57,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk about Silicon Knights.

1663
02:13:57,657 --> 02:13:58,317
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of funny.

1664
02:13:58,337 --> 02:14:04,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Silicon Knights had this lawsuit against Epic because they're saying, Your engine was too hard to use.

1665
02:14:04,761 --> 02:14:06,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why our games suck balls.

1666
02:14:07,763 --> 02:14:17,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently they failed to provide evidence of damages or whatever for their lawsuit.

1667
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:21,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the judge assigned them their own value of a dollar.

1668
02:14:21,532 --> 02:14:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they win their claim, they get a dollar.

1669
02:14:24,074 --> 02:14:24,835
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole dollar?

1670
02:14:24,855 --> 02:14:25,455
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole dollar.

1671
02:14:25,475 --> 02:14:26,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You could buy a candy bar with that.

1672
02:14:27,076 --> 02:14:27,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1673
02:14:27,456 --> 02:14:28,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got a call coming in.

1674
02:14:28,617 --> 02:14:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

1675
02:14:29,637 --> 02:14:30,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1676
02:14:30,538 --> 02:14:30,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1677
02:14:31,498 --> 02:14:34,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one person that actually sent an email into the mailbag, Ranma.

1678
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:38,702
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny is that the chatters were like, no, Ranma doesn't get through tonight.

1679
02:14:38,782 --> 02:14:40,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma does not get to call in because he sent an email.

1680
02:14:40,923 --> 02:14:49,788
[SPEAKER_04]: But when nobody else calls, you guys... I can't help it that I have the fastest internet in America to beat everybody else 99% of the time.

1681
02:14:49,828 --> 02:14:50,788
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just that awesome.

1682
02:14:50,808 --> 02:14:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind tonight, Ranma?

1683
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what's on my mind is a bit of a hardware review, which is in conjunction with the email that I sent earlier.

1684
02:14:59,312 --> 02:15:09,359
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was at PAX East playing at the Square Enix booth, they had these nice headphones that I was playing a theater rhythm with, and I was like, the music quality is just phenomenal, where did you get it?

1685
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:17,705
[SPEAKER_04]: They told me they had it at the Astro Gaming booth, and I checked out their equipment, and after thinking about it for all of five seconds, I decided to buy them.

1686
02:15:18,065 --> 02:15:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But not right away, I decided to save my money and get them for my birthday, and which I did.

1687
02:15:25,049 --> 02:15:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I own a pair of Astro A30 gaming headsets with a powered mix amp, which is perfect for Xbox 360, PC, television, and cell phone.

1688
02:15:38,533 --> 02:15:44,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say, audio quality is quite phenomenal compared to what I was used to listening to.

1689
02:15:47,188 --> 02:15:52,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm yelling with the chatters because apparently we had a drop, but I'm showing that we didn't.

1690
02:15:52,293 --> 02:15:59,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually if we drop, we show that our sent information drops way down, but I don't see that, so whatever.

1691
02:15:59,972 --> 02:16:01,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're just saying it because I'm on the phone.

1692
02:16:01,833 --> 02:16:04,353
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, drop the stream so I get off the phone.

1693
02:16:04,953 --> 02:16:05,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Haters gonna hate.

1694
02:16:06,134 --> 02:16:10,975
[SPEAKER_06]: The timer reset to 1 minute 30 seconds so maybe there was a hiccup, but that's weird because usually that number resets.

1695
02:16:11,115 --> 02:16:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, podcast listeners don't care about this.

1696
02:16:13,956 --> 02:16:16,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the hardware.

1697
02:16:16,296 --> 02:16:18,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So how expensive is this thing supposed to be?

1698
02:16:18,877 --> 02:16:20,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the headset itself is $129.

1699
02:16:20,638 --> 02:16:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The mix amp is $99, but you can get it as a bundle for $199.

1700
02:16:23,398 --> 02:16:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth it?

1701
02:16:31,812 --> 02:16:34,514
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an audiophile, I say yes.

1702
02:16:35,254 --> 02:16:48,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're looking to change your normal headphones for your cell phone or MP3 player, if you're looking for a bit of a change for mobile gaming, I would definitely go with the headset standalone.

1703
02:16:49,002 --> 02:16:52,284
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mixamp, like I said, gives better audio quality.

1704
02:16:54,291 --> 02:17:02,096
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the songs I actually tested to see how well the clarity of the music is was Loki's Verbalicious remix, which is one of my personal favorites.

1705
02:17:02,156 --> 02:17:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing, though.

1706
02:17:03,737 --> 02:17:06,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those surround sound headphones or are they just standard headphones?

1707
02:17:07,179 --> 02:17:08,720
[SPEAKER_04]: The headphones itself are standard.

1708
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:10,441
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the surround sound 7.1 with the mix amp.

1709
02:17:14,108 --> 02:17:15,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I have those kind of headsets.

1710
02:17:15,149 --> 02:17:16,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the headset with the surround sound built in.

1711
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:17,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun.

1712
02:17:17,531 --> 02:17:21,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got a pair at home, but I paid a lot less than $200 for them.

1713
02:17:21,714 --> 02:17:22,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.

1714
02:17:23,035 --> 02:17:25,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they weren't Turtle Beach.

1715
02:17:25,837 --> 02:17:27,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the hell I got.

1716
02:17:27,058 --> 02:17:28,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Tritons, the ones I have.

1717
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:33,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually tried on a pair of Tritons, and they were phenomenal while I was playing them with Bioshock 2.

1718
02:17:33,983 --> 02:17:34,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1719
02:17:37,492 --> 02:17:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but anything else you want to plug here on the show real quick before we let you go?

1720
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Luke Chan already plugged it for me, so I'm going to run high back under my rock for the next seven days.

1721
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:51,880
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in seven days.

1722
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:52,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

1723
02:17:52,821 --> 02:17:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye.

1724
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:55,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1725
02:17:55,502 --> 02:17:56,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ranma.

1726
02:17:56,122 --> 02:17:58,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I was a little distracted during that call, but those things happen.

1727
02:17:58,824 --> 02:18:02,366
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1728
02:18:02,486 --> 02:18:02,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it goes.

1729
02:18:02,946 --> 02:18:03,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

1730
02:18:03,386 --> 02:18:04,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Phone's ringing right off the hook.

1731
02:18:04,647 --> 02:18:05,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1732
02:18:05,548 --> 02:18:05,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1733
02:18:06,721 --> 02:18:07,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

1734
02:18:07,667 --> 02:18:08,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?

1735
02:18:10,607 --> 02:18:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to talk about the email Ranma sent you.

1736
02:18:15,949 --> 02:18:16,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1737
02:18:17,049 --> 02:18:18,310
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tangent about it.

1738
02:18:20,051 --> 02:18:25,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any accessories or a very expensive video game.

1739
02:18:25,773 --> 02:18:32,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most expensive one I have paid for is Bitmania 12, Happy Sky.

1740
02:18:33,776 --> 02:18:37,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have spent tons and tons of money on

1741
02:18:39,093 --> 02:18:40,975
[SPEAKER_02]: on Pokemon plushies, Pokeballs.

1742
02:18:43,979 --> 02:18:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is that?

1743
02:18:45,421 --> 02:18:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I was thinking that this call was going to go in the direction of because you live in Mexico and not every company releases their products officially in Mexico, sometimes you have to pay these crazy-ass import fees.

1744
02:18:56,574 --> 02:18:58,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it kind of along the same lines for Pokemon?

1745
02:19:00,602 --> 02:19:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of the time, since a friend helped me get most of the stuff I get from the United States, so I import, so I pretty much pay what you would pay for something like that.

1746
02:19:17,237 --> 02:19:22,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still a pretty expensive little hobby, if you want to call it like that.

1747
02:19:23,961 --> 02:19:24,964
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1748
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:33,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I live pretty much 10 minutes to the border.

1749
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:34,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

1750
02:19:34,681 --> 02:19:35,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I live pretty close.

1751
02:19:35,821 --> 02:19:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, shit.

1752
02:19:36,361 --> 02:19:36,841
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nothing.

1753
02:19:37,221 --> 02:19:43,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So how often do you just drive up into the States to pick up what you want?

1754
02:19:45,204 --> 02:19:50,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unfortunately, I can't right now because I don't have a passport or a visa.

1755
02:19:51,426 --> 02:19:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dope.

1756
02:19:52,027 --> 02:19:55,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cannot cross the border, but I used to, and...

1757
02:19:56,168 --> 02:19:58,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends on how much traffic is there.

1758
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:06,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It usually, it can take up to an hour to cross the border and pretty much go to the next town.

1759
02:20:07,333 --> 02:20:11,335
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a GameStop, there's a mall too, and there's a Best Buy.

1760
02:20:11,955 --> 02:20:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's pretty much, well, very renowned stores to go and buy stuff.

1761
02:20:19,618 --> 02:20:20,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that difficult.

1762
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And please tell me you live in one of those parts of Mexico I'm not seeing on the news, like you live in one of the safer parts, I hope?

1763
02:20:28,643 --> 02:20:30,544
[SPEAKER_06]: More or less.

1764
02:20:31,284 --> 02:20:32,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of yourself, buddy.

1765
02:20:32,525 --> 02:20:34,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like some of the stuff I see on the news.

1766
02:20:34,686 --> 02:20:35,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me very sad.

1767
02:20:36,606 --> 02:20:45,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It is safe around where I live, but we live pretty close to some of the other parts that you do see on TV, so...

1768
02:20:46,691 --> 02:20:52,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not that bad right now, but it's not that good either.

1769
02:20:52,812 --> 02:21:05,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sending happier thoughts your guys' way, because I always, you know, when I see that stuff on the news, believe it or not, I do think about, I know people in Mexico, and I hope this is not something they're having to deal with, you know?

1770
02:21:05,375 --> 02:21:09,716
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mexico's a big place, so I know there's a lot of parts you see on TV and parts that are just fine.

1771
02:21:10,236 --> 02:21:10,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1772
02:21:12,016 --> 02:21:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, didn't mean to steer the conversation in a totally different direction, but that'll happen sometimes on OLR.

1773
02:21:17,217 --> 02:21:19,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Any recent games you've been playing you want to talk about?

1774
02:21:21,338 --> 02:21:23,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many, pretty much.

1775
02:21:23,879 --> 02:21:27,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play The Walking Dead on Steam.

1776
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:33,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it for free on the Tall Tale Twitter account.

1777
02:21:33,741 --> 02:21:35,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, very cool.

1778
02:21:35,542 --> 02:21:35,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1779
02:21:36,564 --> 02:21:38,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty thoughtful of them to give me one.

1780
02:21:38,906 --> 02:21:40,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.

1781
02:21:40,207 --> 02:21:41,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a pretty cool game.

1782
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:50,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that much action, but story and the decisions you take, it's pretty much, well, compelling.

1783
02:21:50,117 --> 02:21:51,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks you in.

1784
02:21:52,788 --> 02:21:53,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear it's a great game.

1785
02:21:53,729 --> 02:21:55,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I've really got to check it out at some point.

1786
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:58,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I know nothing about the books or the TV show, but that doesn't matter.

1787
02:21:58,292 --> 02:21:59,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It can still be a great game.

1788
02:22:00,273 --> 02:22:05,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I still need to play the Jurassic Park game, which even though I know that game got kind of razzed, I like the movies well enough.

1789
02:22:05,897 --> 02:22:06,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to try it.

1790
02:22:06,998 --> 02:22:08,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I have Weird Al in my head.

1791
02:22:08,779 --> 02:22:11,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

1792
02:22:12,722 --> 02:22:13,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, Donna Summer.

1793
02:22:13,723 --> 02:22:16,105
[SPEAKER_08]: All the dinosaurs are running wild.

1794
02:22:16,165 --> 02:22:19,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember another song, but I don't sing that well.

1795
02:22:20,028 --> 02:22:20,248
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1796
02:22:21,489 --> 02:22:24,010
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can try and get another call.

1797
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:24,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But take care, okay?

1798
02:22:25,291 --> 02:22:25,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1799
02:22:25,692 --> 02:22:26,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean that.

1800
02:22:26,252 --> 02:22:26,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1801
02:22:26,852 --> 02:22:29,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1802
02:22:29,374 --> 02:22:30,235

[SPEAKER_07]: Donna Summer.

1805
02:22:33,317 --> 02:22:33,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1806
02:22:33,577 --> 02:22:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to say.

1807
02:22:34,298 --> 02:22:35,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at work.

1808
02:22:35,739 --> 02:22:37,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I was legitimately verklempt by that news.

1809
02:22:38,241 --> 02:22:39,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so sad.

1810
02:22:39,161 --> 02:22:42,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, I know there was... Go ahead.

1811
02:22:42,424 --> 02:22:43,865
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a death I was more saddened by.

1812
02:22:44,724 --> 02:22:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Robin Gibb?

1813
02:22:45,525 --> 02:22:45,685
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1814
02:22:46,145 --> 02:22:46,426
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1815
02:22:47,246 --> 02:22:47,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Bee Gees!

1816
02:22:48,127 --> 02:22:48,347
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1817
02:22:49,689 --> 02:22:52,891
[SPEAKER_08]: By Adam Yalch, MCA.

1818
02:22:53,072 --> 02:22:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was... Because... He was young, too.

1819
02:22:55,494 --> 02:22:57,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not just, you know, that he was famous.

1820
02:22:57,936 --> 02:23:03,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all the good stuff he was doing and just how absolutely brilliant of a person he was.

1821
02:23:03,681 --> 02:23:05,002
[SPEAKER_08]: That big Kurosawa fan.

1822
02:23:05,163 --> 02:23:05,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1823
02:23:05,743 --> 02:23:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it just me or did she stay gorgeous?

1824
02:23:07,744 --> 02:23:08,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, she did.

1825
02:23:08,124 --> 02:23:08,464
[SPEAKER_06]: She sure did.

1826
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:36,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1827
02:23:39,089 --> 02:23:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we have a call coming in right now, so let's go to it.

1828
02:23:42,213 --> 02:23:43,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1829
02:23:43,175 --> 02:23:43,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1830
02:23:44,366 --> 02:24:11,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo You sexy people, it's Jim Sally Hey, your train's behind schedule You're usually on the Bobby Blackwolf show But you're delayed three hours tonight I got delayed, I went on the wrong side of the tracks today Well, you know, we've been saying for a few weeks now That, you know, we made a left turn at Albuquerque And other folks we used to work with made a right So I was thinking maybe you just made the wrong turn at Albuquerque

1831
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:16,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, you can't do anything right when you're doing it in Albuquerque.

1832
02:24:17,773 --> 02:24:18,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

1833
02:24:19,154 --> 02:24:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

1834
02:24:20,455 --> 02:24:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up, Jim?

1835
02:24:22,036 --> 02:24:26,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, we were talking earlier about putting multiplayer in things in different games.

1836
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,881
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be in Skyrim.

1837
02:24:28,901 --> 02:24:30,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing this stupid game a lot lately.

1838
02:24:31,363 --> 02:24:39,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was like every now and again I'd roll up to somebody like me that was uber powerful and could kill everything and had way too much money.

1839
02:24:41,126 --> 02:24:43,167
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about the whole Elder Scrolls Online?

1840
02:24:43,207 --> 02:24:45,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about that either last week or the week before.

1841
02:24:45,688 --> 02:24:50,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's trying to appease some of these people who want their multiplayer Elder Scrolls.

1842
02:24:50,789 --> 02:24:51,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that enough for you?

1843
02:24:52,390 --> 02:24:55,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be great if it was just little missions like go out and hunt a criminal.

1844
02:24:56,131 --> 02:25:00,352
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do a lot of bad stuff in the town, maybe that town can just pay another player to come chase me.

1845
02:25:01,678 --> 02:25:27,675
[SPEAKER_00]: and good luck because you ain't gonna kill Jim Sally in this game I'm stupid powerful do you find when you're playing these games like I'm an accountant so I'm very good with numbers and maximizing productivity I find I just overpower everything in the game it's it's pretty insane right now I I wonder if um there'll be some type of how do you play Skyrim on the PC or do you play on console um I play it on the console because consoles are better yeah and and um

1846
02:25:28,445 --> 02:25:30,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm better, so that's why I play it on the console.

1847
02:25:58,945 --> 02:25:59,626
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1848
02:26:17,256 --> 02:26:20,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Oblivion needs to do it, sorry, Bethesda needs to do it right.

1849
02:26:47,143 --> 02:26:54,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of think Skyrim is going to stay single player and they're going to really try to push you to pay that monthly fee if you want to take it multiplayer.

1850
02:26:55,086 --> 02:26:58,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, it's about time that they just let Obsidian do it for them.

1851
02:26:58,127 --> 02:27:03,089
[SPEAKER_00]: If they make the best sequels to games, perfectly solid and stable, they should just let Obsidian make it.

1852
02:27:03,449 --> 02:27:04,370
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it with Fallout.

1853
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:05,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them do it with Oblivion.

1854
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:10,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope they're listening to your suggestion, but sadly they probably aren't.

1855
02:27:11,953 --> 02:27:12,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that right.

1856
02:27:13,033 --> 02:27:14,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Jim, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

1857
02:27:16,005 --> 02:27:20,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I play way too much of that Walking Dead game that the last caller just called about.

1858
02:27:21,550 --> 02:27:22,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, people are loving it.

1859
02:27:23,312 --> 02:27:24,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

1860
02:27:24,573 --> 02:27:25,794
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, brother?

1861
02:27:25,814 --> 02:27:26,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you this right now.

1862
02:27:27,336 --> 02:27:30,238
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part about the zombie apocalypse?

1863
02:27:31,319 --> 02:27:33,181
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be pretending I'm not excited.

1864
02:27:33,922 --> 02:27:35,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

1865
02:27:35,383 --> 02:27:36,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim Sally's getting ready.

1866
02:27:36,864 --> 02:27:37,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready.

1867
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:44,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I will pass the word along to my friend at Telltale because they're very proud of that game and they should be.

1868
02:27:45,005 --> 02:27:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, before we were talking about Minecraft's, you know, record-breaking figures, Walking Dead was doing very well for itself on Xbox Live Arcade.

1869
02:27:53,151 --> 02:28:08,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's some really good news, you know, because there's a lot of people that think adventure games are like a niche thing, you know, and yeah, Telltale's filling that niche very well, but Walking Dead's really kind of broken it mainstream for them and I'm happy for them and for adventure game fans everywhere, really.

1870
02:28:09,261 --> 02:28:09,861
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that right.

1871
02:28:10,001 --> 02:28:13,403
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, brother, I got to take off.

1872
02:28:13,783 --> 02:28:22,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say, everybody, that if you go to bed and you don't think about zombies coming, then maybe you're not scared enough or too scared.

1873
02:28:24,387 --> 02:28:26,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to ponder in bed tonight.

1874
02:28:26,188 --> 02:28:26,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Jim hung up.

1875
02:28:26,828 --> 02:28:27,228
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1876
02:28:29,369 --> 02:28:30,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it when he calls us.

1877
02:28:32,324 --> 02:28:37,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it when he calls Bobby too, but it's okay if he misses that train and calls us once in a while too.

1878
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a little alternating.

1879
02:28:39,111 --> 02:28:40,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1880
02:28:40,793 --> 02:28:42,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys who tried to call.

1881
02:28:42,775 --> 02:28:45,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry if you didn't get through, but please send us an email.

1882
02:28:45,438 --> 02:28:50,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com In the meantime, any other last minute stories?

1883
02:28:51,004 --> 02:28:52,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get to these Twitter topics.

1884
02:28:52,225 --> 02:28:52,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a few of them.

1885
02:28:53,942 --> 02:28:55,062
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain is broken, Rob.

1886
02:28:55,662 --> 02:28:56,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It requires Pinkberry.

1887
02:28:57,503 --> 02:28:58,683
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be able to manage that.

1888
02:28:58,763 --> 02:29:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me quickly do some Twitter topics here from Actdeft.

1889
02:29:01,964 --> 02:29:06,505
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of indie games on sale until June 1st for the PC, Steam, and iOS, Android.

1890
02:29:06,785 --> 02:29:08,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Support indie devs.

1891
02:29:08,546 --> 02:29:10,647
[SPEAKER_06]: BecauseWeMay.com That's right.

1892
02:29:10,667 --> 02:29:12,047
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even bring that up during the show.

1893
02:29:12,147 --> 02:29:12,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Shame on us.

1894
02:29:12,747 --> 02:29:14,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great thing to support.

1895
02:29:14,288 --> 02:29:15,328
[SPEAKER_06]: At least look into it, guys.

1896
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:21,770
[SPEAKER_06]: BecauseWeMay.com Actdeft also wants to share that you can get the Awesome Knots theme song for free.

1897
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:23,190
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't played Awesome Knots yet...

1898
02:29:23,671 --> 02:29:25,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It has an awesome theme song and you should definitely check it out.

1899
02:29:27,482 --> 02:29:30,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do a few more tweets here, but let me ask Loki first.

1900
02:29:30,089 --> 02:29:30,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Any last minute stories?

1901
02:29:31,523 --> 02:29:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to talk about Shootmania, which was part of this Mania Planet series.

1902
02:29:37,425 --> 02:29:39,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You may remember them from Trackmania.

1903
02:29:40,045 --> 02:29:45,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Shootmania is their FPS editor, and it also is a game.

1904
02:29:47,047 --> 02:29:52,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Shootmania Storm is the first thing they have right now that's in beta, and they actually have the registration open for that.

1905
02:29:53,108 --> 02:29:53,709
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check it out.

1906
02:29:54,329 --> 02:29:54,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

1907
02:29:55,629 --> 02:30:02,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty cool, and you can basically create your own FPS game with this, and they've got all the tools to make, I think it's an online FPS maker.

1908
02:30:04,294 --> 02:30:12,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it should be noted that they're supposed to have Quest Mania at some point, so that means a really cool RPG maker, so I'm kind of interested in that.

1909
02:30:12,539 --> 02:30:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign up for the beta, so we'll see when that happens.

1910
02:30:14,681 --> 02:30:15,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I was checking that out, by the way.

1911
02:30:16,322 --> 02:30:18,263
[SPEAKER_08]: The Binding of Isaac is one of the games, and they're two bucks.

1912
02:30:18,523 --> 02:30:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah, I was actually going to pick that up this weekend.

1913
02:30:20,824 --> 02:30:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reminding me.

1914
02:30:23,866 --> 02:30:24,826
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more tweets here.

1915
02:30:25,266 --> 02:30:28,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Ionotropic tweets us on Twitter.com slash OLR.

1916
02:30:28,728 --> 02:30:30,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragnarok Odyssey for Vita.

1917
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:31,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to be awesome or not?

1918
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's hard to say when the game's not in front of me, but did you even know that that was coming to the Vita?

1919
02:30:36,492 --> 02:30:36,752
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1920
02:30:37,972 --> 02:30:39,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know anything about it.

1921
02:30:40,013 --> 02:30:41,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I will check it out.

1922
02:30:44,235 --> 02:30:44,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1923
02:30:44,875 --> 02:30:46,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a Vita, so I don't really care.

1924
02:30:47,476 --> 02:30:48,477
[SPEAKER_06]: You can borrow mine.

1925
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:53,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that you've got your iPad.

1926
02:30:54,521 --> 02:30:55,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hate me.

1927
02:30:55,502 --> 02:30:57,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to a couple tweets from Tiger Claw.

1928
02:30:57,523 --> 02:30:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Death spank the bacon-ing.

1929
02:30:59,324 --> 02:31:03,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie game The Movie will be Steam's first full-length film release.

1930
02:31:03,786 --> 02:31:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea Steam was looking into doing this, but apparently Steam is going to start giving out movies.

1931
02:31:08,328 --> 02:31:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, the 1080p video will be DRM'd as much as any other Steam product or game for those of you that were worried about that.

1932
02:31:15,474 --> 02:31:18,296
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will have to have the Steam client in order to watch it.

1933
02:31:18,636 --> 02:31:20,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can pre-order the movie on Steam for $8.99.

1934
02:31:21,819 --> 02:31:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That includes a 10% discount until June 12th when the movie's coming out.

1935
02:31:26,062 --> 02:31:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a new area for Steam.

1936
02:31:27,844 --> 02:31:29,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're going to take on iTunes.

1937
02:31:29,926 --> 02:31:35,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, by the way, you know what else is on that sale on Steam since you mentioned it?

1938
02:31:35,112 --> 02:31:35,452
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1939
02:31:35,512 --> 02:31:36,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Psychonauts.

1940
02:31:36,593 --> 02:31:37,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Five bucks.

1941
02:31:37,054 --> 02:31:37,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

1942
02:31:38,055 --> 02:31:38,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Five bucks.

1943
02:31:39,276 --> 02:31:41,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess who's buying it and not buying Minecraft?

1944
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

1945
02:31:43,621 --> 02:31:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty hard.

1946
02:31:44,382 --> 02:31:45,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Psychonauts is a good choice.

1947
02:31:45,903 --> 02:31:50,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the most hardcore of Minecraft fan would be hard to argue with you there.

1948
02:31:53,199 --> 02:32:01,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to load up this other story from Tigerclaw, but our internet's being a little wonky, but it's titled A Video Game Designed to Help Doctors to Recognize Drug Abuse.

1949
02:32:01,765 --> 02:32:03,927
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell would that game be?

1950
02:32:07,074 --> 02:32:26,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's using the same technology used to train FBI agents in interrogation tactics, a combination of self-disclosure and nonverbal cues.

1951
02:32:26,365 --> 02:32:32,789
[SPEAKER_06]: The game uses an actor's voice to stimulate a hypothetical conversation with a patient seeking, for example, pain relievers.

1952
02:32:33,209 --> 02:32:43,176
[SPEAKER_06]: The program generates responses based on the doctor's questions and the doctor must identify indicators of possible addiction or abuse based on the simulated patient appearing on screen before them.

1953
02:32:43,457 --> 02:32:50,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something where you're the doctor, you're trying to recognize a patient that's asking for a drug who might be addicted to them.

1954
02:32:50,762 --> 02:32:51,963
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like L.A.

1955
02:32:52,023 --> 02:32:52,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Noire.

1956
02:32:53,584 --> 02:32:57,990
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking for those hidden cues to let you know if there's a problem or not.

1957
02:32:58,030 --> 02:33:05,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird in a way, but neat, I guess, that video games are being used out there in the real world.

1958
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for Twitter.

1959
02:33:07,142 --> 02:33:08,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other last-minute stories tonight, Loki?

1960
02:33:09,044 --> 02:33:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's it.

1961
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:12,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, then that brings us to the end of the show.

1962
02:33:13,664 --> 02:33:19,451
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ending a little bit early tonight, but that's because we unfortunately didn't have that interview happen, but hey, you know what?

1963
02:33:19,491 --> 02:33:20,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Things happen.

1964
02:33:20,432 --> 02:33:23,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope you guys out there enjoy the rest of your Memorial Day weekend.

1965
02:33:25,257 --> 02:33:27,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap it up for tonight.

1966
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:28,901
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

1967
02:33:28,941 --> 02:33:29,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Your final thought.

1968
02:33:29,642 --> 02:33:31,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Freaking steam and stuff on sale.

1969
02:33:32,611 --> 02:33:33,331
[SPEAKER_06]: taking all your money.

1970
02:33:34,092 --> 02:33:37,514
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is be sure to check out Girls Gone Wow.

1971
02:33:37,574 --> 02:33:38,114
[SPEAKER_06]: We love them.

1972
02:33:38,154 --> 02:33:40,435
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a great show and I was their guest this week.

1973
02:33:40,776 --> 02:33:43,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to make sure that I plug that appearance at some point.

1974
02:33:43,177 --> 02:33:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: GirlsGoneWow.net Loki.

1975
02:33:45,979 --> 02:33:46,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for more Minecraft.

1976
02:33:47,319 --> 02:33:48,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for more Minecraft.

1977
02:33:49,425 --> 02:33:57,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening live, however you are tuning in, and for supporting independent radio and independent broadcasting.

1978
02:33:57,429 --> 02:34:02,132
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we say, if you like what you hear, tell a friend or two or five about the show.

1979
02:34:02,212 --> 02:34:07,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Blender was telling me he brought in some friends of his from PlayStation Home to listen to the network tonight.

1980
02:34:08,035 --> 02:34:12,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly the types of stuff we're looking for, so thank you to Blender, and thank you to everybody who is helping to spread the word.

1981
02:34:13,097 --> 02:34:17,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And no thank you to PlayStation Home for not upping the caps limit of their club.

1982
02:34:17,299 --> 02:34:17,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1983
02:34:17,739 --> 02:34:25,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we want to have everybody in our clubhouse, but we can only have 25 people, and it was maxed out a year ago, so I'm sad.

1984
02:34:25,545 --> 02:34:26,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe.

1985
02:34:26,545 --> 02:34:27,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe things will change someday.

1986
02:34:27,886 --> 02:34:28,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1987
02:34:30,467 --> 02:34:30,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1988
02:34:31,408 --> 02:34:31,848
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1989
02:34:31,889 --> 02:34:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here.

1990
02:34:32,549 --> 02:34:33,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful week.

1991
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:35,832
[SPEAKER_06]: We will not be here live next week.

1992
02:34:35,933 --> 02:34:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Very important.

1993
02:34:37,034 --> 02:34:37,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby will.

1994
02:34:38,115 --> 02:34:38,775
[SPEAKER_06]: We will not.

1995
02:34:39,516 --> 02:34:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: We will see you live in two weeks.

1996
02:34:41,758 --> 02:34:44,561
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be on the podcast feed next week, however, with a pre-tape show.

1997
02:34:44,681 --> 02:34:45,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore, yeah.

1998
02:34:45,702 --> 02:34:45,943
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1999
02:34:46,263 --> 02:34:47,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great week, everybody.

2000
02:34:48,405 --> 02:34:49,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Be safe.

2001
02:34:49,706 --> 02:34:50,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a dick.

2002
02:34:51,188 --> 02:34:52,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And good night.

2003
02:34:52,887 --> 02:34:55,849
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2004
02:34:56,489 --> 02:35:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2005
