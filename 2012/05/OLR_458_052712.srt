00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,780
Tonight, May 27th, 2012, a new Star Wars game is set to be unveiled.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,340
After weeks of speculation, 38 Studios shuts its doors, and a major game publisher is sued

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,680
for fraud.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,280
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,040
video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, with my co-host here in studio.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Welcome back tonight, the one and only Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Hi.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,800
Boy, you missed a fun show last week.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
No, I didn't because I was eating at Bucket of Meat.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,480
I guess that is a little better, but we'll talk more about that in a minute.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,680
Yeah, I was very sad though.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
I sent you my support from afar as I was eating barbecue chicken.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Now, for those that don't know what Bucket of Meat is, dot, dot, dot.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,720
It is the Big Thunder barbecue restaurant at Disneyland.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Of course.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,680
Where it's like 30 bucks a head and you get all you can eat meat, like beef ribs, sausages,

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,240
chicken, cornbread, coleslaw, beans, and they all come in these big shiny, well not kind

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,320
of shiny, but big iron buckets, which a couple of people ran off with one.

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
Are you a fan of finding big sausages at Disneyland?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Oh yes.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Oh yes, Rob.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,900
All right, also say hello, joining us tonight, to Tech Master Loki.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,720
That sounds like a Southern Brazilian barbecue.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,160
It kind of does a little bit, but Brazilian barbecue is amazing.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
Oh, I don't know though.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Cornbread could make it better.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
You know what?

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, they did, they did have cornbread, but they also, the people there on the stage performing

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,000
did You Got a Friend in Me, all kind of blue grassy.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, how fun.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It was great.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Um, we're going to go around and talk about how our weeks were in video games, but first

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,900
I want to start off tonight talking about what happened last week because the podcasties

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,800
are sitting here going, wait a minute, Dark Soccer was on the last show.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
There just, there wasn't a show on the feed last week.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,320
I also have to say one thing for GOVDA.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
The place did have vegetarian options.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,800
They had a skewer with peppers and vegetables and tofu.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
Well, isn't that special?

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
It was delicious.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
All right.

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Anyhow, off food on show.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm just saying it's cool that they have vegetarian options, but I mean it's bucket of meat.

47
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,640
If it was bucket of salad, I wouldn't be touching the place.

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,840
Same if I was a vegetarian and I went to a place that's called bucket of meat, probably

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
wouldn't be my thing.

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
All right.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Look, last week's show.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
So live, we were here last week live and no, this is not a case of me being lazy and not

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
updating the podcast feed.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here's what happened.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,960
We were live, we were doing a show and while we were in the middle of the classic game

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,740
of the week segment, which as you know, is always at the end of the first half, the power

57
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,980
went out completely.

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,000
The power shut off in the apartment.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
It wasn't just my place.

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It was the whole unit.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
It was the whole stretch.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,920
We still don't know to this tonight what caused the issue.

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,440
But unfortunately what happened is that it caused the live listeners got to hear at least

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,480
half a show, but because we were unable to retrieve the MP3 from backup, which, you know,

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
if you want to get technical, it's not really an MP3.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,500
It's a raw Adobe audition file, but it was all wrong.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,200
Like it's just, it was, it was too much to be able to fix and props to Travis from other

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
station life.

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
He tried to fix it.

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,920
He tried to go in and move the little packets that were out of order, but he said after

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,280
about 10 minutes worth of show, he gave up and I don't, I don't blame him.

72
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,060
I don't have the patience for that either.

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,080
So that's like trying to like knit something.

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,560
So unfortunately last week's show is gone.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,240
So we want to catch you up a little bit on what you missed last week.

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,920
So last week we were joined here in studio by Flaco Jones, who you might know if you

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
listen to Hoard House, he's the number one fan of Hoard House, my Warcraft show, but

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,760
I don't think he'd been on OLR.

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
He certainly had not never gone on as a host before.

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,500
I don't think he'd even been on as a guest in a very long time.

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,880
He talked a lot about his days working at Konami and some of the stuff he got to beta

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,320
test who has a league tester on the winks games, which I'm really sad.

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,560
That's that was, that was the part of the show you have that raw file.

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I do.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
And it's like, that's the part of the show I might have to stream together and put on

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Twitter.

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,340
So you guys can hear, you should just send it to me and maybe I'll, yeah, we'll see.

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,040
But that's a, Oh man, that's the part of the show you really have to hear if anything else.

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,880
But there's a couple important revelations that came up last week too, that for the OLR

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
continuity, cause believe it or not, this show has a storyline over the past 10 years.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
It's very important.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,040
You understand one of the discussions we had last week, so we're going to rehab it a little

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,340
bit here tonight.

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,400
So Loki, how was your gaming week last week that no doubt spills into this week?

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,300
I play a lot of Minecraft.

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
A lot of Minecraft.

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,560
As did I.

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,080
A lot of Minecraft.

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,160
As in every night I signed onto Xbox, Loki, OLR is playing Minecraft.

100
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,080
And I'm very sad when I see you sign on and you're not playing Minecraft.

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,920
Because I'm playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer usually.

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,640
But here's the deal, as you guys know, a few months ago on the show, we talked about, you

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,520
know what, we tried Minecraft.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
We don't get it.

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
I don't, you know, it's cool.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,440
For those of you that are into Minecraft, it's cool.

107
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,460
But for us, we don't understand.

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,740
All hell broke loose when the 360 version came out.

109
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,000
Because for me, it was about, Oh, there's a tutorial mode that is explaining the point.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,760
This game now has a point.

111
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,200
And I just, once I kind of was able to get the basic parts down, and plus it's important

112
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,280
to note that the 360 version really simplifies crafting and da da da da da, once I understood

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,880
all that, I was like, okay, I'm into this.

114
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
And Loki, I'm imagining it's a similar thing for you.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah, pretty much.

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,680
It's just, you know, I went through part of the tutorial, not even the whole tutorial,

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,680
just like the very basic stuff and then once I figured out, okay, this is how I craft stuff,

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,480
this is how you do this, this is what this is for, okay, I'm just gonna start my own

119
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
world.

120
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Yeah.

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
But you know what?

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
What?

123
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Tacos.

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Yeah.

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Dark Sakura is yet to try Minecraft on the 360 and she has not been turned yet, but we're

126
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
working on her.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
You know what, if I have to pay for it, probably not.

128
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Well, there's a free one on PC, technically, but anyway, we won't go there.

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
We won't go there.

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I played the PC one.

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
There's the trial.

132
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
But anyway, anyway.

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
Um, so what you need to know, Loki and I are both now really, I mean, Loki more so than

134
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
me, both really into Minecraft.

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Bobby Blackwell's a part of this too.

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,160
He's, I mean, I visited his world, he visited mine, we're both in Loki's world.

137
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Which is...

138
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
By the way, you really do need to visit the southern part of the map.

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,520
See, we're playing on the same seed, so, you know, but you need to visit, the southern

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,720
part of the map is friggin' awesome.

141
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,420
Now here's another important comparison I brought up last week that the podcast-y folks

142
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,920
didn't get to hear, because we realize there's been a lot of slammin' on the 360 by the PC

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,600
fans because it's not as advanced.

144
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
It's based on an earlier version of the game.

145
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,080
And the other big, big, big one I hear is the finite size of the map.

146
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,920
Is only, what, 1024 by 1024, which for me is big enough, I got enough to work with,

147
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,880
but I understand where the PC fans, especially if you're playing a bunch of people on one

148
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,700
of those servers, really feel a little constricted by the map size, although they say they might

149
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
change it on Xbox.

150
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,640
But the comparison I made is I said, well, you've got Civilization IV, Civilization

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,160
V on the PC, it's kind of a complicated game.

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,440
It's a hard game to jump into and just learn and kind of figure out all the facets of it.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,560
But on the consoles a few years ago, they made a console version of it called Civilization

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Revolution, which really kind of, for lack of a better term, dumbed it down.

155
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
And they didn't make it a bad game.

156
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,240
It actually is a really fun game.

157
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,640
It's a good way to get a Civ fix really quick when you don't have hours and hours and hours

158
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,660
to play Civ V, because Civ V can go for hours and hours and hours.

159
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,200
But Civ Rev is a really good way to kind of get a quick fix.

160
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,660
So I enjoyed both games, and I think that's where I'm at with Minecraft now.

161
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,040
Because of me getting into the 360 version, Alan has been obsessed with the PC version

162
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
lately.

163
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,920
I mean, well, I see, just as like kind of getting ideas, one of the first things I did

164
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,520
after I built a few things was, okay, what are cool things I could build on the 360 version?

165
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,160
So a bunch of internet searches on YouTube, well, just YouTube searches and stuff.

166
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
And it just kind of bookmarked a bunch of things that I want to make.

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
And so I did that.

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,880
But there's a lot of cool mods, like industry craft and stuff like that, that you could

169
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,460
build machines that'll do mining for you, and like ridiculous stuff like power drills

170
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,000
and like batteries and piping and all sorts of crazy stuff.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,420
But I mean, it's really cool, and I hope they implement.

172
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,080
Within the next week, I want to go back and give another game a try that I originally

173
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,480
kind of, I didn't really diss it on the show, but I just kind of gave it a review of I Don't

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
Get It, LOL.

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,000
And that's the game Terraria.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,760
Because supposedly that's the 2D Minecraft.

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,840
So now that I get Minecraft, I'm going to try Terraria again and I'll let you guys know

178
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,920
next week how that goes, because that's something else I want to explore.

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,440
By the way, since we did Bring It Up, Civ 5 is on sale on Steam today for $7.49.

180
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Thank you.

181
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
And I was going to actually call that out from our chat room, which I have yet to mention.

182
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Sorry, guys.

183
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Vognetwork.com.

184
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
I just want to get you caught up on last week.

185
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
Vognetwork.com, it's right there on the page, is the chat room.

186
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
And we have Act Deft giving the FYI on that as well.

187
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,320
And Civ 5 for $7.49, that's a steal.

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
That's an absolute steal.

189
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
They're pushing that expansion pack coming out in a month, I bet, but I love Civ 5.

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
It's totally worth it.

191
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, my friend's been playing it on Xbox.

192
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,120
Becky's husband.

193
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
There is no Civ 5 on Xbox.

194
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,160
You must be thinking Civilization Revolution, which is the game I mentioned a minute ago.

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
But I've been watching that and it actually was pretty cool, except you know, that's totally

196
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
not my thing.

197
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,320
Just like Minecraft 360, it's a good way to get your feet wet with the series.

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
All right.

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,820
Other things you might have missed last week.

200
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,900
We had an exclusive story, but we're going to repeat that at the top of tonight's show,

201
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,040
so we'll come back to that in a minute.

202
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
You guys missed a lot last week.

203
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,800
And there was also the Classic Game of the Week, just for housekeeping purposes.

204
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,420
We decided because Jim was not able to finish his Classic Game of the Week, we're not going

205
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,520
to have that officially be the Classic Game of the Week.

206
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,280
We are going to invite him back on the show, whenever he wants to come back as a fourth

207
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,880
host even, and let him finish what he started.

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
Jamie said she would kindly give over the Classic Game of the Week segment, whatever

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
week he comes back, so he can finish what he started that night.

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,160
So just, and if you didn't, if you don't know what the Classic Game is, well I have to leave

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
some suspense.

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,120
So you'll just have to figure it out in a later week.

213
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
I think that was about it.

214
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,520
I think that was all the stuff that came up last week that was important and worth mentioning.

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,800
So let's get into, how was your gaming, oh, VOG Network, I want to say really quickly

216
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,320
about VOG Network.

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Friday night, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern, the next phase of VOG will be revealed.

218
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Yes, I'm teasing a teaser, but I think if you guys are really interested in what we're

219
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,280
up to and what the full vision is here, and I know there's a lot of people out there that

220
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,560
still have questions like, why did you leave where you were at before just to do yet another

221
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,840
radio network?

222
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,520
There's more to it than a radio network and some of that is going to be unveiled on Friday,

223
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,740
so I'm really excited about that.

224
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,240
So again, Friday, 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern right here at vognetwork.com.

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,920
We're supposed to have an interview at 6.30 tonight and I teased that on the Twitter a

226
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
little bit.

227
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,300
Her name is Susan, she's with the website hackedonxbox.com and we're going to talk a

228
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,160
little bit about what, she's basically the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week

229
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,200
and I say that with love, I love Nancy Drew, but she really got down to the bottom of what

230
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,720
is really going on on Xbox 360 with what they're not calling Xbox hackings, but Xbox jackings

231
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,680
and we'll talk a little bit about the difference and why that is.

232
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,320
Hopefully we get her on the show here in 10 minutes, unfortunately just, we don't see

233
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,480
her, it's kind of like that interview we had two weeks ago where the dude disappeared for

234
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
a little bit.

235
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,500
I haven't heard from her on Twitter or Skype today, these things happen, especially because

236
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,920
her piece got picked up by a lot of the big gaming blogs.

237
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,040
She might just be very popular and in demand right now, so we're going to see if we can't

238
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
get her on.

239
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,640
If we can't, we'll just roll it over to a later week when she can come on, but we'll

240
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,320
check in with you guys in 10 minutes.

241
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,640
Alright, for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

242
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,780
DarkSakura, you've been out for a week, how was your gaming weeks?

243
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,320
I've actually played stuff.

244
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Played lots of things, although I still haven't played Mass Effect, I'm very sorry.

245
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,240
I played a lot of Portal 2 while I was out.

246
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
I've been playing Words with Friends because I figured since I already paid for it, Zynga

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,360
already got my damn money.

248
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,240
And honestly, while I'm at work, it's kind of something I can keep up with Dan, so I've

249
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,760
been keeping up with that.

250
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,680
I did try to play Draw Something, but I'm using the free version just because I want

251
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,360
to see what all the fuss is about.

252
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,800
It's cute, I like it.

253
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,360
I am playing, I started playing a lot more fractal.

254
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:17,160
In fact, if you look on my Facebook fan page for Jamie Summers, I posted a screencap of

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
what fractal looks like.

256
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,160
And I'm going to be actually showcasing a different game on Steam that I'm playing so

257
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,320
that everyone can see what it is.

258
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm going to be starting Fallout New Vegas again, just starting over from scratch.

259
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,260
I've been playing Droplets, I got Droplets on iPhone, which is kind of weird and not

260
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,560
as fun as playing it on Steam.

261
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,400
And I've played some WoW, but I've really been playing Diablo 3.

262
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,320
I played a crap ton of it last night.

263
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
And I was like, you know what, this is like playing Ragnarok online without people.

264
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,560
This is great.

265
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,560
So I've really been getting into Diablo.

266
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Because it was free, because I signed over the blood pact.

267
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,120
It was free with a big footnote.

268
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah.

269
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,440
Well, as you saw, when I told my friend on Facebook that it was free, he said, great

270
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Hal, Dan said she signed her life away.

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
For a year.

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
For a year.

273
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,880
Which, you know, was what, a third over?

274
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,680
So it's not bad.

275
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,760
But yeah, I think everyone's playing Diablo, because I'll log on to WoW and say, hey, where's

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
all my peeps at?

277
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,160
And they're all on Diablo, and whatever.

278
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,600
And then I've been playing some more Puzzle Bobble again, best move.

279
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Because I really love that game, and it's really great to play when...

280
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I don't know what it is, but when I'm sick.

281
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,280
And I'm over my cold, guys, I just sound like I'm on the tail of it.

282
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,560
But I slept for two days.

283
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,140
It was glorious.

284
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,320
I was really sick two weeks ago, you might remember, and I'm still coughing.

285
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I'm still having coughing.

286
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
People at my work.

287
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,280
And see, I had that sinus attack.

288
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,900
And then I had it bad at Disneyland.

289
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,800
And then I came back to a full blown cold.

290
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I ran a fever.

291
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You know what I just remembered?

292
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,920
I have coffee brewing in the kitchen.

293
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Bye.

294
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Yes, you do.

295
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,880
Anyway, so when I'm sick, it's like I don't really have this mental focus.

296
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,640
However, I think when my brain shuts down, I become really fantastic at puzzle games.

297
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,360
And that was like clearing out levels on Fractal that I had never been able to pass before.

298
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,000
And for anyone, it's not an easy game.

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,880
It really is not very easy, because you've got so much to keep in mind with the direction

300
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
of how your little things move.

301
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,200
But I still tell everyone, get Fractal, it is worth the money.

302
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,640
It is such a fun game.

303
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Again, it's called Fractal, make blooms, not war.

304
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,080
And I hope that they pay me for my sponsorship, because I am doing that for free.

305
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:51,400
And then I'm also supposed to be sitting down, because our friend loaned us the Street Fighter

306
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,880
cross Tekken.

307
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,320
And I'm kind of afraid to try it, because I do not want to play against the Mega Man.

308
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,800
But I'm thinking about it, so meh.

309
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,640
Did you play anything other than Minecraft?

310
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,720
I play Minecraft, lots of Minecraft.

311
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
Let's see, what did I do this week in Minecraft?

312
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
I think I finished my rail system.

313
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,080
Now we mentioned it on Bobby's show, but I don't think we mentioned it here.

314
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,420
Your Minecraft level is intricate.

315
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,120
You built a tunnel underneath the ocean, I don't even know how the hell you did that,

316
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
or underneath a lake.

317
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,640
You built a tunnel under the lake, and you have a glass ceiling on said tunnel, so that

318
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,660
you can look up and see the water.

319
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,440
And you built this entire tram system.

320
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,600
He built the deep run tram.

321
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
He did.

322
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,800
So when we are talking that Loki started playing Minecraft, we're not fucking around.

323
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,960
He is really into Minecraft.

324
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,600
And what's great is when I go into Loki's world, I can hear Nellie laughing in the background

325
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,860
whenever something stupid happens.

326
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,760
So she's got to be into this a little bit too, right?

327
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,260
She's not into it at all.

328
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,600
She keeps asking me, aren't you sick of this game yet?

329
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,420
What's the point of this game?

330
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
And I'm just like, there is no point.

331
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,920
It's just like Legos.

332
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
But yeah.

333
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
It's Legos.

334
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
For men!

335
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
And girls.

336
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
I have been playing Minecraft more than Call of Duty this week.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,980
I did play Call of Duty though.

338
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,140
We finally got to check out the new, well they're maps technically for the new game

339
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,800
type face off, however you can use them for anything.

340
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,200
So we've been playing on them for just our deathmatch maps since we only have like two

341
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,040
to four people usually playing at a time.

342
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,440
Well three to four people.

343
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,500
But you know, it's perfect for what we use it for.

344
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,800
So we've been actually enjoying those quite a bit.

345
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:47,140
However one of the new maps, Ground, it's quite apparent that the spawn points in there

346
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,160
aren't that random.

347
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,900
And like there was one time I literally, I killed somebody and they spawned again right

348
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
in front of me.

349
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,500
So I knifed them to death and then they spawned again right in the next room.

350
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,720
It's like wow, that's pretty close.

351
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,160
See other things, well let's go back to Minecraft.

352
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,840
So the first thing I did in Minecraft this week is I explored the whole map, or as much

353
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,800
of the map as I could because I was looking for a spot to dig with dynamite.

354
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
And that's what I did.

355
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,240
Because I duped a bunch of dynamite and that kind of stuff.

356
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,120
We also made a portal to the Nether and went there and I got my glowstone and my, I don't

357
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
remember what it's called.

358
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,940
It's the dirt that's all in the ender that you can set on fire and that will burn forever.

359
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,400
So that's kind of cool.

360
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,960
And there's some other like sand, soul sand or something that makes people walk slow.

361
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,140
I don't really know what the point would that be for.

362
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,440
So I have that.

363
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,180
And then, oh so I started digging with dynamite and I did that and unfortunately I did make

364
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,800
it all the way down to the bedrock but I got killed by lava many, many, many times.

365
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,200
So I decided to go ahead and build a roof over the top of the giant hole that I made.

366
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,280
So I did that and now it's a glass top roof so you can walk over it and see this giant

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,840
hole all the way down to the bedrock.

368
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
And I'm slowly hollowing it out for I don't know what purpose.

369
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm just doing it right now.

370
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
You should fill it with candy.

371
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
They don't have candy.

372
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,040
I can't fill it with candy yet.

373
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
That's why Minecraft isn't a 10.

374
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
It's only about a nine.

375
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,360
You should fill it with whatever those things that try to kill you are.

376
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,720
There's no, there's no, um, there's no coffee and there's no candy, but there are, well

377
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
see you're Jewish.

378
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,040
I was going to say there are pork chops, which is pretty exciting, but, oh yes, there is

379
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
cake.

380
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,160
Fill it, fill it with cake, fill it with cake and sheep.

381
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,320
Like throw sheep down the hole.

382
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,400
You apparently can, however, I don't know if you've noticed, if you pick up an egg,

383
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,560
have you tried throwing an egg?

384
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,840
It'll create a chicken.

385
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Does it really?

386
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
No, I didn't try that.

387
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,760
You throw an egg, it creates a chicken.

388
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,840
So I've seen an actual video where someone took eggs, well see they probably didn't dupe

389
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,960
them like I would, but okay, let's say I duplicate all of them.

390
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,080
So I have stacks of 64 eggs and you put that in one of the dispensers, you maybe put those

391
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,520
in like say 10 dispensers or whatever, and you turn them all on and then all of a sudden

392
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,920
you have hundreds of chickens, which then I can automate a system to kill all of those

393
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
chickens.

394
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,040
Wait, are you talking about an automated death machine for chickens?

395
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,460
Yes, I've actually thought of that.

396
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Nothing is safe.

397
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,360
I've thought of that for the pigs, but, and I actually built a trap to catch the pigs,

398
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,280
but it doesn't seem to work too well because they, when you sleep or whatever, the animals

399
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,400
respawn and they don't get, they don't stay in the pen that I made, which is kind of lame.

400
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,920
But yeah, then Bobby helped me dig out.

401
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,400
See basically I dug down in that initial cave system that I found until I got to the furthest

402
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,520
point away, and then I dug straight up into, he's all, you know you're digging into the

403
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
ocean dude.

404
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,440
I'm like, eh, we'll worry about that when we get to it, and so we did.

405
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,240
And ended up, it was kind of cool, I started by digging a hole up through the top.

406
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,000
Swam to the top, and then basically built a barrier around where my staircase was, and

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,100
you know, if you fill it in with anything, dirt or whatever, and then you dig it back

408
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,720
out again, the water's gone.

409
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
So that's how I did it.

410
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,840
I just dug to this, I basically created a stack, boxed it all in and filled it in and

411
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
dug it back out again.

412
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,760
And that's how I got a thing through the ocean.

413
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Tacos.

414
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,600
And then I tried putting a glass top ceiling in one of the caves, you know, under the ocean.

415
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,240
And I kept drowning myself, though, when I did that, so I said, eh, fuck that, I'm not

416
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
doing that.

417
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Now, at least.

418
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
So that's what I did.

419
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,600
I also played Pocket Edition, Pocket Edition's pretty fun.

420
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
More Minecraft.

421
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
My gaming week.

422
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,480
I didn't play a lot of new stuff, mostly because I've been content playing Diablo 3.

423
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,660
Mass Effect 3's got a big multiplayer thing going on this weekend, and I don't know what

424
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,080
made me think I would even remotely possibly hit that goal of promoting three people during

425
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,960
the weekend, but, you know, I thought I'd try.

426
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,840
And yeah, I don't think I've really played a lot else other than that in Minecraft.

427
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,000
A little bit of Minecraft, too, not as much as Matt.

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,080
And the stuff I build isn't nearly as intricate, but I'm just lucky if I can kind of get down

429
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,360
to finding lava without getting killed.

430
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,400
I think I'm going to try playing a little more often in peaceful mode.

431
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
All right.

432
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,800
So here's the part where I'm going to get judged by some people, and I'm going to get

433
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,400
congratulated by others.

434
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
I bought an iPad.

435
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, I bought one of the new iPads, and, you know, I wanted one.

436
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm really not going to give you any better reason than that.

437
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I wanted one.

438
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm in a slightly different position at work now where I might be doing some more travel-oriented

439
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,840
things again, and I thought the iPad would come in very handy for that because my laptop

440
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,880
is kind of getting a little bit old, and there is some stuff you can do with an iPad, and

441
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,960
some of that does include remote taping and broadcasting a podcast.

442
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,400
I've thought of that, too.

443
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,840
But in the meantime, before I get to all that busy, busy work stuff, I'm doing fun stuff

444
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,920
on the iPad, like playing games.

445
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,440
And one of the games that I got addicted to is Temple Run, and it's one of those games

446
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
that's really stupidly simple in design.

447
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,400
It's like one of the, the game itself could have been on the Atari 2600 for all I know.

448
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,640
It's like you swipe up to jump, you swipe down to slide, left and right to go left and

449
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
right, and the whole kitchen of the game is you're running fast to escape these monkeys

450
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,040
that if they catch you, they're going to eat you because I guess you took their treasure

451
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,200
or whatever.

452
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,080
And it's so, so, so simple and so stupid, yet it is so addicting, I can't stop playing

453
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,160
it.

454
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,260
So yeah, Temple Run's what I've been playing a lot on my iPad.

455
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,920
That's like the iPad go-to game right now.

456
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,680
And the screen's really pretty, you guys.

457
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
We were watching Archer.

458
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm like, it's pretty for a cartoon.

459
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Don't shake your head at me.

460
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
That's you judging me.

461
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I can hear you.

462
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I am.

463
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,600
So that was pretty much my week.

464
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,880
All right.

465
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,000
So a little bit of housekeeping, and then we're going to get into some news and so forth.

466
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Housekeeping.

467
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,760
I want to mention, this got a little bit derailed in my eyes and in the eyes here in studio

468
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,880
because this whole VOG network thing happened in the past month and we were not able to

469
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,000
give our full attention to The Hunt going on on orangelandtrady.com.

470
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,120
Dark Tetsuya really put a ton of effort to make this like pseudo-game going on based

471
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,900
on, you know, Ready Player One, that book series, and he ran this whole virtual contest

472
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,160
where people had to like play and joust and find the hidden Easter egg screen in adventure

473
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,120
and just, you know, cute fun stuff.

474
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,340
You know, there was no point, no seriousness, just let's have fun on the internet.

475
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,660
And that's really what it was.

476
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
And it has a winner.

477
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,600
So I want to congratulate Orange Right won The Hunt this week.

478
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,000
So yay Orange Right, you win something.

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,100
We're going to send Orange Right something from OLR Studios.

480
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,440
I will find out if I get his address later.

481
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,520
I know he, do you mean that?

482
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Cause I'll go.

483
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,880
All right, we're going to send Orange Right a lock of Dark Soccer's hair and something

484
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,400
else actually useful from OLR Studios.

485
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
I think I know what we can send him.

486
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Some cat litter.

487
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
All right.

488
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
We're not sending him cat litter.

489
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
It's useful.

490
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,160
You can use cat litter for a whole bunch of stuff, Rob.

491
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
All right.

492
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,320
You know, if you spill oil, if oil drips from your car, you can put cat litter on it.

493
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,040
I think we have posters over there.

494
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Just stop.

495
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
All right.

496
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I'll send him a post.

497
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
Well, posters are kind of a bitch to mail.

498
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,040
I was thinking we have, we have a bunch of these little guys here, so I'll send him one

499
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
of these.

500
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
All right.

501
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
All right.

502
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Um, I also, I know he's a Bamani fan and in the other room I have literally stacks and

503
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,420
stacks of promo CDs we were going to give away at live events.

504
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
We never did.

505
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,720
So I'm just going to put a bunch of those in a box and be all like, LOL, have fun.

506
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,560
And I think he'll get a kick out of that.

507
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,960
All right.

508
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
Um, let's see.

509
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Second place.

510
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
You get nothing.

511
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Sorry.

512
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,200
That's a tough life lesson learned.

513
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
All right.

514
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Uh, let's see.

515
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,680
The other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention was that we will not be here live next week.

516
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,000
Sorry to say I am going to be at bucket of meat or Disneyland.

517
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
Um, so I have to make the most out of my past because the prices just went up and I, there's

518
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,440
no way I'm renewing at the end of the year.

519
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,960
So, uh, I am going this next week.

520
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
Um, so there will be no live show.

521
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,640
We are going to try to pre tape a show earlier in the week.

522
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,680
We just have to find something that, uh, blends with all of our schedules.

523
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,480
So I'm sorry, uh, live listeners, you won't have anything here, but think of, think of

524
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,780
it as fair because last week you got a show that the podcasters never heard.

525
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,640
So next week you're going to have to get the podcast show just like a lot of other people

526
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
do.

527
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,240
So that's next week's show.

528
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,000
I think that's it I have for housekeeping.

529
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
All right.

530
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,800
The other thing I have for housekeeping, um, we were supposed to be having an interview

531
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,720
right now with Susan from hacked on xbox.com.

532
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,000
Uh, unfortunately she's not online.

533
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,040
This is almost exactly what happened with mega ran a couple of weeks ago.

534
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,320
What is it about our show?

535
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Are we, are we scary?

536
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I don't know.

537
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
No, I don't.

538
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
You know what?

539
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,440
I was looking at her personal Twitter and it said something about, I got two hours of

540
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
sleep last night.

541
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
That was yesterday.

542
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Oh, was it?

543
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Oh, I thought it was today.

544
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,180
Well, you know, it is a busy weekend here in the States.

545
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,240
I don't know what's up.

546
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,760
You know, I don't take it personally.

547
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,520
You know, we did talk about it on Friday and I'm always the kind of person that's like,

548
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,180
if I don't write it down five times, I'm going to forget.

549
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,220
So for whatever reason, she's unfortunately not online.

550
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,100
If she shows up later, as we did with mega ran, we'll bring her on the show later.

551
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,660
I was going to use this interview to talk about something that's been going on in the

552
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,920
news this week.

553
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Loki, hopefully you can talk about it instead since Susan's not here, but apparently there

554
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,040
was some stuff going on with the whole, we think we know how some accounts are getting

555
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
stolen.

556
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Yeah.

557
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,440
So basically, um, Susan had actually put together, um, an article on her website talking about

558
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,760
how she kind of figured out, um, how some of this is going down.

559
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,720
Now I'm not sure how she came about the website.

560
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm assuming just web searches because, you know, doing the same similar type of web search

561
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,580
was able to pull up, uh, the same information.

562
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,440
So basically what it was is she found out that it's not necessarily account hacking

563
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
that's going on.

564
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,340
It's basically jacking or, uh, the so-called hackers are social engineering, Microsoft

565
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,320
and other companies to get information, to recover your account on their system.

566
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,440
And it doesn't matter what sort of safe, um, you know, any sort of passwords, uh, questions,

567
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
whatever.

568
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,400
It doesn't matter cause they find a way to get that information from Microsoft or the

569
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,400
third party companies representing Microsoft customer service or whatever it is.

570
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:40,240
So they basically, there is this, um, it was on, uh, I'm trying to remember which website

571
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
it was now.

572
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,560
Um, picked it up and then it was originally on hacked on xbox.com and then Kotaku picked

573
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
it up.

574
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Right.

575
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
And that's where it really kind of blew up.

576
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah.

577
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,000
Um, but basically the, the one of the websites, I can't remember what the original website,

578
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,720
um, that had this step by step information, uh, cause they actually had this like a tutorial

579
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,440
on how to do it cause this guy's like, Oh, I'm quitting hacking.

580
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,700
Well, yeah, it didn't now, now I had joked at the beginning of the show, Susan was kind

581
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,120
of the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week because she kind of got down to the bottom

582
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,500
of what exactly was going on.

583
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,720
But part of the way she did that was that I guess turned remorseful Jackers, game tag

584
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Jackers.

585
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,200
I shouldn't just say remorseful Jackers.

586
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,640
I could be talking about other stuff.

587
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,400
Game tag Jackers actually contacted her and I don't know, I told her how it was.

588
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
I don't even think they contact her.

589
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,760
I think it was just a post that happened that she happened to run across on this website.

590
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,820
And um, cause I actually, I remember reading it, I couldn't view it because it was basically

591
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,160
one of those underground forums, whatever that you have to be, you have to be invited

592
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
to.

593
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,480
But however, one of those people that normally are entities that gets invited to any website

594
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,720
would be a Google, you know, bot that happened to cash the page and that pops up in the preview

595
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,800
and you can read information from there.

596
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Um, so basically, you know, the, you know, they talk about what, you know, the strategy

597
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
to do it.

598
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,720
First you go to xbox.com, you click support and basically at the bottom of the page there's

599
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,480
a contact us stuff.

600
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,800
Um, on that page you click the email us link and then xbox live and then you basically

601
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:29,380
at that point they, um, impersonate an employee of Microsoft.

602
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,840
So they put, you know, an email address at Microsoft.com, they put the agent's name,

603
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,360
somebody that they, I guess, talk to, they could, you know, call up customer service

604
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,400
and hi, blah, blah, blah, my name is blah, blah, blah.

605
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,000
They write it down, you know, and they go through this web form.

606
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,200
Um, you put the customer and basically they, you fill out like a little note to them, you

607
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,920
know, customer and you put the name, you know, verified the 16 digit, um, credit card number.

608
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,020
He has made an inquiry and about how he has forgotten his accounts information.

609
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,960
Since I am tier, I am a tier one agent, I am unable to view the customer's gamertag.

610
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,080
He has requested to have an answer change to, and then, you know, you put some realistic

611
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,080
answer I guess for the question, uh, the xbox slave gamertag is, and you put the gamertag

612
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,000
down, um, you know, and then the person's name is supposedly contacting them that you're

613
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
spoofing.

614
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,760
So basically they're working it by because Microsoft is so big and there's so many departments

615
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,400
that don't talk to each other, essentially they're impersonating department to department.

616
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,860
They're impersonating the many branches of Microsoft in order to get your gamertag and

617
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,640
there ain't shit you can do about it except don't put a credit card on xbox.

618
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah, there's really nothing you could do about it because they're literally going and

619
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,320
finding the answers to your, you know, the questions that you put down.

620
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,960
Even if you put down, you know, which city were you born in and you put down Abraham

621
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,080
Lincoln or something like that, they can still get the answer to it and they're basically

622
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,000
changing it to whatever they want.

623
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,140
Um, now unfortunately, you know, one of the things I want to ask Susan tonight from hacked

624
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,160
on xbox.com and I got to hand it to the chatters at a vog network.com.

625
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,520
SGA 100 Matt says, even the best show hosts get canceled on Carson Letterman have been

626
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,820
canceled on too.

627
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
And what up?

628
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,680
G says, when the interview comes on, it should be good even late.

629
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
And I agree.

630
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,640
And hopefully maybe she forgot it was Memorial day weekend.

631
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
I don't know.

632
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
But anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hopefully get her on next week.

633
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Yeah.

634
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
There's always another time.

635
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Yeah.

636
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Yeah.

637
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
We'll figure something out.

638
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,240
But anyway, one thing I want to ask her about was that apparently Microsoft responded via

639
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,120
Kotaku to her, to her report.

640
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Did you see that?

641
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Yes.

642
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,720
They basically said, um, well, you can't do this anymore.

643
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Well, okay.

644
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,480
I don't really see.

645
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,680
They're basically, you know, um, yeah, I thought it was irritating because they really tried

646
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,480
to poopoo her story and it, it kind of pissed me off because it's kind of like, well, you

647
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,120
never Microsoft, you never acknowledged that this was happening.

648
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,960
And now you're trying to poopoo it like, well, you can't do it anymore.

649
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,160
And I understand that Microsoft certainly to save their image, doesn't want to admit

650
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,480
that they had a problem, but at the same time being that they are, I mean, they are on the

651
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
stock market.

652
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Yes.

653
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
They're a publicly traded company, right?

654
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Yeah.

655
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,320
Isn't there some sort of responsibility that they should be reporting this shit's happening?

656
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Yeah.

657
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,320
And they basically said, okay, here's what their Microsoft or Kotaku asked for comment

658
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
from them.

659
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,800
And they're all, their response was, there are several or there are several different

660
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,600
methods malicious users employed to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

661
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,260
Social engineering is one of them.

662
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,440
We are aware of vulnerabilities that social engineering pose and continue to address these

663
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,760
through tools and training to help our members, um, uh, keep our members safe and secure.

664
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,880
Well, right there, that sounds like tools and train their members.

665
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
It sounds like us.

666
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,680
They're teaching us how to not be social engineered, which cool, but that doesn't really seem to,

667
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,720
you know, apply to us because we're not the ones being contacted by these people.

668
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,800
It's your customer service reps.

669
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,560
Here's another thing I really wanted to get into as much as I respect what Susan's done

670
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,360
this week and what she's been able to find out and put out what needed to be out there

671
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,640
on the internet.

672
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,200
She put out what people needed to hear this week and I so respect her for that.

673
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,080
I don't think it is the sole reason this stuff is happening.

674
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,760
Now I'm having a hard time remembering when I was hacked.

675
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,740
I think it was about six months ago at this point.

676
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:34,280
I seem to recall my password was never changed, which would tell me that this didn't happen

677
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,100
to me because they're resetting your password in this, right?

678
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,680
I don't think that they're resetting your password actually.

679
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Really?

680
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Yeah.

681
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,040
Cause I took away from it that they're trying to get into your security questions that they

682
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,560
can reset your password.

683
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Not necessarily.

684
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,080
So here, here's what it is.

685
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Okay.

686
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,160
So, so it starts off, they send the inquiry about the security question via email and

687
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,320
then, um, obviously they're not going to your response because you know, they're not at

688
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,280
that email that you call up Xbox, um, 30 minutes later.

689
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,840
And uh, after the ants, after the answer, you say that you got disconnected from a tier

690
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,200
two agent and asked to be transferred back.

691
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,000
So they transfer you to a tier two agent.

692
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,200
You give them the number, the one that you wrote, um, the one that you, I guess your

693
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,440
customer, so they act like they have, what was it?

694
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,680
Um, once they pull it up, say, um, they'll say it'll take a little while to change it.

695
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,920
Uh, call back, say you forgot your email, but you know what the security question or

696
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,420
the secret question answer is and they will ask for your gamer tag and um, answer them

697
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,720
and they will give you the email.

698
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:48,520
So now, um, so I guess, uh, let's see here.

699
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,360
So basically now you have their email and I guess their security question, I'm not really

700
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,960
sure how, I guess I don't know if that allows you to change it immediately.

701
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,880
I thought they would send you a, maybe I just want to deny, deny, deny.

702
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Just like I want to deny that I couldn't have been phished either.

703
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,640
You know, I just, maybe I'm just being a little hard headed, but I kind of think like, why

704
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,680
would someone want my account?

705
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,160
I mean, granted, maybe I, although I don't think I have much of a public face, I have

706
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,960
a public face thanks to this podcast nonetheless.

707
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,200
So maybe some a-hole out there wanted it.

708
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,720
I don't know why they used it to play FIFA 13 though.

709
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,280
I don't, I don't think it's necessarily that they're, they're saying there's a few reasons

710
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,880
why they have our accounts get hacked.

711
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,440
One is the original gamer tag, which means, um, you know, you have a gamer tag that's

712
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,280
like, you know, awesome or, you know, which I don't, I don't think I have a name people

713
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
want.

714
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Yeah.

715
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
So it's not necessarily that.

716
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Or, um, sometimes accounts get hacked because you're, you know, you're a member of live

717
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,280
for X number of years.

718
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,480
That could be that I would agree.

719
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,200
I don't know why zone one account for that, but, but I, okay, but the other, sorry, but

720
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,200
the other thing I have friends who were hacked that hadn't touched their Xbox in years and

721
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
it's just, it's not clicking for me.

722
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,800
They can just, they can just probably find random people.

723
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,080
Maybe there's try it on one or another.

724
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,420
Perhaps it's a given the amount of time has gone since it's been used.

725
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,360
It makes it an easy target because it's someone less likely to check.

726
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,680
I feel like this story has blown a hole in it, but it hasn't still yet shown us everything

727
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
that's going on.

728
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,200
Let me quickly go to the chat room because there's some good comments here from the chat

729
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
room.

730
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,840
Uh, DJ Morpheus from under station live Saturday nights here on VOG says, has anyone considered

731
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,400
the possibility if there is inside help within the Xbox call centers for the Jackers?

732
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,120
That's a scary thought, isn't it?

733
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,560
But it's not unheard of.

734
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,960
It is not unheard of.

735
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,600
Well, here's an example.

736
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,520
When I worked for, um, the, uh, mortgage service or I used to work for one of our clients had

737
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,400
a bunch of information stolen by one of their employees stealing a laptop.

738
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Wow.

739
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:03,480
And it had something like, um, I want to say, uh, 3000, uh, bank account information, new

740
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
bank accounts.

741
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,520
So just saying it happens within companies.

742
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
It does.

743
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
It does.

744
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,520
You know, I work in the insurance industry and there's laws set in place to prosecute

745
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,640
people who use the information that they find in malicious ways because, you know, imagine

746
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,680
if you could access a celebrity's medical records, the things that might happen there,

747
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,720
you know, but there's, there's laws in place to protect everybody.

748
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,160
Like with my job now, I have, I run into the same thing, you know, with inspections.

749
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Yeah.

750
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,400
Let me, uh, let me read this comment from ACDEF in our chat room as well, cause I like

751
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,840
this too at vognetwork.com ACDEF says, let me put it this way.

752
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,280
PlayStation network handled their hacking issue horribly, but they handled it nonetheless.

753
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
Steam handled their forums being hacked really well and keep, kept the users informed of

754
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,480
and users of what was happening.

755
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,600
Microsoft handling the Xbox live jackings is non-existent, which is worse of what Sony

756
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
did.

757
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,140
And, uh, DJ Morpheus added to that, remember this is Microsoft.

758
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,120
They never admit issues until necessary.

759
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,160
Look at Vista and how it was a disaster and ACDEF said, yeah, pretty much what I'm saying.

760
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,560
Microsoft denying the whole issue is worse than what Sony did.

761
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,480
And we're talking that Sony didn't handle the problem that well to begin with.

762
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,780
And I've said this for months now, as much as we give Sony shit and yes, they do deserve

763
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,980
quite a bit of shit over what happened and you know, kind of how they made themselves

764
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,560
a target and everything.

765
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,360
Although we give them shit, at least they said what was going on and they did take their

766
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,320
network down when it was a problem.

767
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:36,840
And you know, most of all, they never had money actually stolen.

768
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,080
Yet here we are on Xbox this much later and we're still hearing stories about how it's

769
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
done.

770
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,960
And you go to that website hacked on xbox.com.

771
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,460
It is still happening.

772
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,240
If you have not changed your password on Xbox live in the past six months, you are a fool

773
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
to not do it.

774
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,140
Now, if you do not change your password on Xbox live, you have sat through all of these

775
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,820
stories and it's still not changed your Xbox live password.

776
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:12,840
You are a fool and I wish you the best of luck.

777
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,560
Now that I paraded everybody, hopefully that wasn't anybody actually listening and let

778
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,080
you know, I should go change my password right now.

779
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,520
I forgive you if it's the first time you've ever heard me ranting, maybe you didn't think

780
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,440
to change it before, but if you've been sitting here for the past six months and you still

781
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,960
haven't changed it, you're, you're, you're just asking for it.

782
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,080
I've done mine twice since then cause I routinely change my passwords every three months.

783
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,640
Well, here's the weird thing too, and this actually just came up in the past week and

784
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
a half.

785
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,800
I got an email or I tried to log into xbox.com or something and it made me change my password.

786
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,120
But it wasn't a reset or something.

787
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,240
It was some type of somebody's been trying to log into your account too many times.

788
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,820
You better change your password.

789
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,320
And so that made me, you know, the first thing I went to my bank account to make sure no

790
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,520
more money had been stolen or any of that crap is going on.

791
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,280
But they, you know, I looked in the game history of they've been in there, been able to play

792
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
anything.

793
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,320
Thankfully, no, um, no one actually got in there, but it made me go, they're still fucking

794
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,720
trying.

795
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
All right.

796
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Anyhow.

797
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,160
Anyways, there was hackforms.net is where this stuff originated from.

798
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,160
They have the whole priv7 how to jack any xbox account.

799
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,880
That's where all that information was from on her website.

800
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
All right.

801
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,200
Well, I'm hoping, um, you know, we can get her on here to tell us more about the story

802
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,960
about how she found it and you know, kind of her opinions really having heard so many

803
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,300
of these stories on what Microsoft should do.

804
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,080
But we'll have to get that in a later week.

805
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
All right.

806
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,400
For now, let's get into the rest of the week's news.

807
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,000
We're going to start off with a repeat from last week because this, this still hasn't

808
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
really broken, right?

809
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
No, it hasn't broken yet.

810
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
All right.

811
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,880
So sorry, live listeners, you're going to be hearing this for the second time, but for

812
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,480
the podcasters, let's, let's take it away.

813
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,320
So this is a kind of neat, um, we figured out, uh, who the lead character is going to

814
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,240
be for dead rising three, or at least who will be voicing said lead character for dead

815
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
rising three.

816
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,160
Um, that individual is actor, uh, George Diaz.

817
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,120
George Diaz, in case you're not familiar with that name is, uh, done quite a few things.

818
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Um, one of being, uh, the brothers Garcia, which was a TV series, um, back in early two

819
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
thousands.

820
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,400
Uh, also recently was in, um, was it Love Concord, um, which is kind of like a video

821
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,360
game-ish movie, but, um, this is directly actually from him, um, kind of long story

822
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,320
short how we kind of came about that.

823
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,200
I had a coworker who was actually talking to him about Love Concord, um, you know, cause

824
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,120
he's kind of big in the indie stuff and actually, um, saw, you know, the friends of my coworker,

825
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,280
um, had, you know, friend of his Facebook or whatever.

826
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,960
Say, Hey, um, so by the way, man, uh, tell your friend, um, who liked this post that

827
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm the new face of dead rising three lol.

828
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,500
I saw he works for, um, for video games, the trailer should be coming out soon in the next

829
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,560
month or two.

830
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
It's crazy.

831
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,480
They sent me to this place called Mova in San Francisco, insane technology.

832
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,960
They did Benjamin Button.

833
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Looks so real.

834
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I'll post it on here when they give it to me.

835
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Um, just real quick.

836
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,280
Are you sure the name's not Jorge?

837
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
Who starts with the T?

838
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Yeah, it's Jorge.

840
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
But okay.

841
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Just making sure.

842
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Jorge Diaz.

843
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Jorge Diaz.

844
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,840
Um, and he'll get a kick out of it.

845
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,400
So, um, kind of neat.

846
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,960
It's actually, I mean, if you go go look up Jorge Diaz on Facebook, you can actually see

847
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
said post.

848
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,360
Um, but yeah, uh, I guess we'll see that in, um, uh, well, when they talk a little bit

849
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,040
about during E3 and also kind of goes back to the rumor about the plot for dead rising

850
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,760
three where it's supposed to be this, uh, auto mechanic and there was supposed to be,

851
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,340
um, you know, an LA and sort of this, you know, illegal immigrant spin thing on there

852
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,360
where they have these aliens, um, that they're trying to smuggle across borders.

853
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,080
But the aliens are actually a little controversy to, uh, let's, let's use something, uh, politically

854
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,180
buzz worthy to try and sell more copies.

855
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,180
That's taste.

856
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Yeah.

857
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,040
And the aliens would be these, uh, or illegals they call them, um, would be a group of infected

858
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
people that aren't ready.

859
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,040
They're literally illegal aliens because they're silly.

860
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
All right.

861
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Anyway, whatever.

862
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,280
Um, but it also confirms dead rising three basically because every Capcom has not confirmed

863
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
dead rising three.

864
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Everything out there is speculation.

865
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Yes.

866
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,480
So they will be announcing dead rising three at E3 for sure.

867
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,600
That'll probably be one of like Xbox or playstations things.

868
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Sure.

869
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Sure.

870
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
So there you go.

871
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,480
No Frank West or the other guy.

872
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,000
No, of course not.

873
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay.

874
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yet.

875
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Until DL.

876
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No man.

877
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Like Frank West.

878
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,120
Yeah, dead rising two off the record bond.

879
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,720
So well, because I think a lot of people will kind of saw it as a, I think a lot of people

880
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,600
saw it for what it was.

881
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,040
It was a cheap attempt to try and get dead rising two more popularity when it just should

882
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,040
have been there to begin with.

883
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
You know what I mean?

884
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,200
I think people are starting to call Capcom out on a lot of this shit and it's kind of

885
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,800
fun to watch like watching a soap opera a little bit and it's just, Hey, just like,

886
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:23,120
you know, all the on disc DLC for street fighter cross Tekken and dragon dog, dragon's dog.

887
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,840
Let's talk Minecraft.

888
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
I bet Loki will be excited about this.

889
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,960
I bet you never thought this would be something happening on OLR Minecraft segment.

890
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
All right.

891
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,800
We used to talk about Minecraft updates all the time.

892
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,680
I will have, you know, okay, here, here we go.

893
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
No, this is some serious Minecraft news.

894
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,700
Um, Xbox live arcade.

895
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,280
What game is being played the most online?

896
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,160
Well it's still modern warfare three, but Minecraft has now edged out call of duty black

897
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,400
ops for the number two spot.

898
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,940
This is a game that's been out a month, not even, not even.

899
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,500
That's pretty and online completely.

900
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,000
Can't buy it in stores.

901
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,480
That's pretty impressive.

902
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,840
There is supposedly an adventure update thing coming to Minecraft, Xbox live arcade eventually.

903
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,680
Now I guess the next update for Minecraft is going to be 1.7.3, which will add pistons

904
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,280
into the game, which is awesome.

905
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,440
That's the next thing that Xbox is slated to get, but at some point 1.8, which was the

906
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,140
adventure update on the PC that will be coming to Xbox live arcade, uh, the quote from four

907
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,140
J studios.

908
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,440
They're the ones who ported the game for Xbox live arcade.

909
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,420
There are no big architecture changes with the move to 1.7.3 so it's been quite straightforward.

910
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,760
The move to 1.8.2 is much more challenging.

911
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,480
We are working with Daniel Kaplan at Mojang to define what is going in the Xbox version,

912
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,360
but the aim is to include as many of the PC features that make sense on the Xbox as possible.

913
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,360
The game isn't Minecraft on the Xbox.

914
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,080
It's Minecraft Xbox 360 edition.

915
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,720
So it isn't really a direct port of the PC game.

916
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,000
That's kind of them as I'm trying to weave these tangled words of, we didn't promise

917
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,880
you everything, but I got to say it's still, you know, especially for somebody who's new

918
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,040
to the whole damn thing like me, it's still pretty impressive and I'll be looking forward

919
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,480
to these updates.

920
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,120
So there you go.

921
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,200
This update, by the way, the endermen, those are the ones that you can't make direct eye

922
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
contact with.

923
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Right?

924
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,720
Oh, Alan was showing me one of those guys and I thought creepers were scary.

925
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
Good Lord.

926
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,720
Uh, new kinds of building materials, a new mode called creative mode and some changes

927
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,160
to combat mechanics.

928
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,460
And that'll be the patch where you're going to have to eat food to survive.

929
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:43,960
Although I imagine there'll still be a casual mode that won't have that element in it.

930
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:52,320
So Minecraft sales figures, 6 million sold on the PC, 9 million across all platforms

931
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,640
when you factor in Xbox, Android, and iOS, maybe 9.2 million.

932
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,240
That's according to Daniel Kaplan with, uh, Mojang has a lot.

933
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,720
That's a lot, especially considering I don't think the iOS and I can't imagine those sold

934
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
a lot.

935
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,320
I mean, I don't think in the millions, maybe a million a pop.

936
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,440
I mean, the Xbox ones probably sold at least a million and a half at this point.

937
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,040
So I, well, they said they were profitable within 10 hours.

938
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,500
That's that is, this is, this is the type of thing that they're going to look back on

939
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:29,640
in 10 years and be all like, Hey, remember in the 2010s when people played Minecraft,

940
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,880
just like we kind of look back and go, Hey, remember the pet rock, you know, I think it'll

941
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,080
be that whole thing where it's still, um, I just have a feeling that like Lego is just

942
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,560
kicking themselves going, damn it.

943
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,160
We could have done something like this.

944
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,200
Like we could have so done something like this.

945
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,080
You're going to see this on VH1 in 10 years.

946
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:56,360
Michael Ian Black commenting on VH1's I love the 10s anymore.

947
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,120
I love the 10s.

948
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,120
Remember Minecraft?

949
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:08,960
Remember when we used to have this show, do countdowns of decades and stuff and just stopped.

950
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,200
All right, so there you go.

951
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,640
That's, that's what's going on in Minecraft world.

952
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,400
So dark soccer, if you want to talk about a different game, now would be a good chance.

953
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,680
Well, I said, if people want me to play the damn game, they need to buy it for me on PC.

954
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
That's cute.

955
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,280
You live in a world, you think you live in a world where that will happen.

956
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,240
That means I don't have to play it.

957
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,760
No, no, don't even try to get out of it like that.

958
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,520
You can download the classic version completely free on their website, but I don't want the

959
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
classic version.

960
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Yeah.

961
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Yeah.

962
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
And I've tried it.

963
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,520
The terms have changed.

964
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,080
I've tried it because I want to see what all this, you know, neat crap is, but it's not

965
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,600
worth it to me unless I'm playing for free because you know, I'm cheap that way.

966
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,800
So how about some Star Wars?

967
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,640
There's going to be a new Star Wars franchise unveiled next week.

968
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Ooh.

969
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
And it's a bold vision.

970
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Ooh.

971
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,540
And we don't know what the crap it is, but it's going to be on GTTV.

972
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,120
So good.

973
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,760
That's on Thursday.

974
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:14,160
What it was said though is that it actually had a pretty high caliber team on it and it's

975
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,160
going to be very bold, very bold, but we don't know what it is.

976
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,760
So I mean, hopefully it's going to be better than the MMO because the MMO is losing people

977
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,880
and it really wasn't all that great that I saw.

978
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,080
I'm not impressed by it except I do kind of like the alignment change thing, but that's

979
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
about it.

980
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
That's really about it.

981
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Yay.

982
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,680
It's going to be a new Battlefront series and that sounds awesome.

983
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,680
You think?

984
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
I think so.

985
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,680
That would be worth it.

986
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
They're just going to call it something different.

987
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,680
How about, you know, how about a return to like the, um, uh, super Nintendo style side

988
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,680
scroller games?

989
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,680
That would be rad.

990
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,400
Yeah, that'd be cool.

991
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,640
But, and of course a lot of times when I think about Lucas art, I think about the point and

992
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,560
click adventure games from back in the day, like loom and Indiana Jones and shit.

993
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,120
So how about a fucking like, you know, Hey, tell tales kind of, you know, made that industry

994
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,160
like cool again with the whole walking deads doing very well.

995
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Right.

996
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,280
Since they're already on a star Wars game like that, since they're already, you know,

997
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,760
stealing from Blizzard, why don't they just keep doing it and do like a Diablo style,

998
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,960
you know, play like that since they're already, I'm sorry, borrowing from Blizzard.

999
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,840
I am with dark Tetsuya in our chat room at vognetwork.com as long as it's not Han Solo's

1000
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,560
dance party for the connect.

1001
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,240
You know what Han Solo's dance party would be?

1002
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,500
Him shooting people.

1003
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
The end.

1004
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,800
Uh, God, I just, I hope they don't make a sequel to that game cause it was terrible.

1005
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,000
It probably sold okay, but man, it was a terrible game.

1006
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,640
Speaking of terrible, there's been some terrible things going on at 38 studios and big, huge

1007
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
games.

1008
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
They've laid off their entire staff.

1009
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:00,440
Apparently, uh, kingdoms of Amalur wasn't doing very well and, um, they owed a lot of

1010
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,840
money to Rhode Island, you know, they had a, basically they were supposed to be paying

1011
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:13,960
back $50 million and, uh, of the $75 million loan that they got from Rhode Island.

1012
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,720
And you know, their franchise wasn't worth very much.

1013
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,440
Um, kingdoms of Amalur reckoning didn't sell like they had hoped it would.

1014
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,920
They needed to sell 3 million units to break even and they only sold about 700,000.

1015
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,060
So, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1016
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:34,420
Wasn't there a tweet that something like they had sold 1.2 million or something or was that

1017
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,800
like shipped versus sold and that whole clever math that we see in the gaming industry?

1018
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,680
Honestly, I don't know when that update was, but it sold well under 3 million units, that's

1019
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
for sure.

1020
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,600
Um, I mean, that stuff takes time, but not enough time to repay their debts.

1021
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,120
And it's just, there was a whole bunch of, uh, just terrible stuff going on there.

1022
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:04,480
I was reading things, uh, oh yeah, 1.22 million units in the first 90 days is what they said.

1023
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:11,200
Um, but also like I heard stuff where some of the employees that were relocated to work

1024
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,440
for this company, oh, by the way, you know, that house that we bought for you, um, yeah,

1025
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,520
we never paid for it.

1026
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,160
So you've got, we took a second mortgage out on your home to see, you know, yeah, I heard

1027
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
about that mortgage now.

1028
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,240
Yeah, that sucks.

1029
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,480
And that kind of stuff can really fuck your credit.

1030
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,260
I mean, that's, that's the really sad thing about this, you know, but hooray to the gaming

1031
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,600
industry for at least trying to, you know, cause usually you think of the gaming industry

1032
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,480
and it's, you know, you think of the people on Xbox live, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck,

1033
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,840
fag, fag, fag, you know.

1034
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:52,360
And also, I mean, considering that there was almost 380 employees at 38 studios, um, so

1035
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,080
they, you know, people on Twitter have been kind of rallying, um, to, you know, with 38,

1036
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,440
the hashtag, uh, 38 jobs, also Facebook group, um, 38 jobs.

1037
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,760
And they've got, you know, people including like Alex Rubens, um, you know, game journalist

1038
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,760
and he's been, you know, collecting like a stuff into a Google doc with all these different

1039
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,720
studios with openings and stuff.

1040
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,440
And there's also job fairs going on in their area and they're kind of letting these people

1041
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,440
know.

1042
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,840
Uh, he might be a listener of the show because him and I have followed each other on Twitter

1043
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
for a while.

1044
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,000
And so I actually kind of saw his tweets about that when he was putting it together, his

1045
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
whole Google docs thing.

1046
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,160
And I thought that was a really cool idea.

1047
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
So props to him.

1048
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,840
I'm glad you're getting your, especially cause I know he's an aspiring game journalist.

1049
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,140
This is a good thing.

1050
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,140
You know, good begets good.

1051
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,200
You know what I mean?

1052
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,680
So good for him.

1053
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
Yeah.

1054
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,120
Um, so yeah, it's, it's a terrible situation, uh, thankfully though they're a talented group

1055
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,200
of people and so they should hopefully be able to find work pretty quick.

1056
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,880
And God, I mean, that's just, I don't know.

1057
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Now that's not good.

1058
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,600
SSJ 100, Matt has taken the cheap shot in our chat room at vog network.com that a lot

1059
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,920
of people have been taking Kurt Schilling always been a douche.

1060
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,640
So I had a clever retort.

1061
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Okay.

1062
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
What is your retort young lady?

1063
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,680
The douches keep girl bits clean, so how's that bad?

1064
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,440
Well look, whatever he is, um, uh, he's apparently not the best businessman in the world.

1065
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,000
Uh, we can certainly say that.

1066
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,280
So I mean, what about the repercussions that are being felt for, you know, the fact that

1067
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:32,120
his name basically got a state to believe in his company enough to give them this huge

1068
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,320
loan that now they're going to have to eat.

1069
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,520
I mean, what's the longterm repercussion of this?

1070
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,880
You think, well, taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.

1071
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,600
And I think they estimated it was like a over a hundred million dollars that the taxpayers

1072
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
would be accountable for.

1073
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:52,400
I want to say it was like 112 in chains or something like that, but, um, yeah, it sucks.

1074
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,880
Rhode Island's not a big state.

1075
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,280
That's that's a lot of money.

1076
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,760
A dungeon buster in our chat room says Amalur wasn't that bad of a game, but the timing

1077
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,760
for its release couldn't get out from Skyrim shadow, which I mean, I don't know what a

1078
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,040
lot of people are going to do Skyrim by the time they come out.

1079
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,200
I wouldn't blame Skyrim because it was a few months after Skyrim.

1080
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,300
I would blame Mass Effect 3 because it came out literally like three weeks before Mass

1081
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,300
Effect 3.

1082
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,880
Well, not even that, but maybe it's just me and the fact that I don't watch a lot of TV

1083
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,560
or when I do, I watch it without commercials.

1084
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,840
I hadn't really heard a lot about this game, which, you know, considering I do this show,

1085
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,840
you'd think be honest.

1086
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
It's the first I've ever heard of it.

1087
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Right.

1088
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Maybe that's a problem.

1089
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,860
Well, it is a problem considering it's EA, the one publishing it and they usually pimp

1090
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,040
the shit out of their games.

1091
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,120
Um, I mean, I heard about it and stuff and they, I saw, you know, they had a demo and

1092
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,960
I didn't really see any TV advertisement for it.

1093
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,840
But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so I mean, it's possible that they had stuff

1094
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,120
for it.

1095
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,760
Um, but it's not like, you know, Madden or something that you'd spend a lot of money

1096
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
on it.

1097
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,440
Uh, Phantasm, our chairman says reckoning had a bad release window with Skyrim and Mass

1098
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
Effect 3.

1099
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,280
Is it possible that the game just released at a bad time?

1100
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,120
I, once again, I'm not going to blame Skyrim.

1101
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,560
Skyrim was two months before it, but what about could contribute, but I think there

1102
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
might be other factors.

1103
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,760
What about just the fact that maybe the month it released usually isn't a big month for

1104
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,200
games, especially maybe they should have held it off till summer because those first few

1105
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,920
weeks really do make or break your game.

1106
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,920
You know what I'm going to blame?

1107
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,900
I'm going to blame the fucking online pass because it was a game that had an online,

1108
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,360
they literally called it an online pass for a game that had no online component.

1109
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,600
Oh, that's right.

1110
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
That was this.

1111
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,400
They had no online component, but the online pass, they literally called an online pass

1112
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,720
was just, you know, bonus DLC.

1113
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,760
Yeah, that didn't help.

1114
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:49,000
So I mean, just call it bonus DLC, you know, then if you don't buy it at launch, you don't

1115
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,680
get the bonus DLC and all you can do is go, well, damn, I should have bought the game

1116
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,680
at launch.

1117
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,440
I mean, I don't see how that's a bad thing at all.

1118
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,640
And instead of calling it an online pass, oh, you got to pay this extra money to get

1119
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,960
online and download this extra DLC.

1120
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,320
I don't really know what the spin was on that, but all right, well, continuing with things

1121
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,320
that might, um, drive the gaming industry further into a hole, um, you've got to hear

1122
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,640
about this patent that was discovered this week.

1123
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,440
Sony Computer Entertainment America or SCA filed for this patent in 2011.

1124
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,040
It usually takes a little time for these patents to be found.

1125
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,720
So yes, it's an older patent, but it's just being found now.

1126
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,200
Um, the patent was for an advertising system where a game will be suspended during play

1127
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,420
for an advertisement to come up.

1128
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,960
Then the game will continue.

1129
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,000
Think of it, excuse me, think of it like how TV commercials interrupt your show, Hulu,

1130
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,780
or Hulu ads would be proceeded by a warning and a slow down of gameplay with another warning

1131
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,820
displayed when gameplay is about to resume.

1132
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,280
So it's kind of like ad incoming.

1133
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,280
Everything's low.

1134
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,280
Bye Pepsi.

1135
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,280
Oh, okay.

1136
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,280
Let's get back into the game.

1137
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,960
Yeah, seriously, that, that reminds me of Mr. Sensei with 2000 movie sign.

1138
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,800
Um, now just because they filed the patent doesn't mean it will be implemented.

1139
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,760
It's just, you know, again, patents are to kind of protect ideas or what have you, which

1140
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,920
is weird because I thought I, I thought IOS games did this shit already.

1141
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,360
Doesn't word with friends kind of do something like this where you play and then you get

1142
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360
mad.

1143
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,120
If you have the free version, yeah, if you, I have the paid version of words with friends

1144
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,600
that never does that crap to me.

1145
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,280
I don't know, would this be terrible if it was to support like free full console games?

1146
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,920
Like for example, ad supported stuff like for, you know, say I want to get a little

1147
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,920
big planet too and it, I can add supported version that stops gameplay once in a while

1148
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,320
to pimp me Pepsi or something.

1149
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,120
I would probably, I'd probably just want to buy the regular game, which is what they want

1150
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,040
you to do in the first place, but they can make more ad revenue.

1151
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,200
If this shit pops up in a fucking retail game, I'm not fucking buying that.

1152
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,840
This was in wipeout as well, wasn't it sorta, sorta.

1153
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,880
I mean, it didn't really pause gameplay, but it doesn't like the loading screens.

1154
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:06,080
Well, that's one thing if they have it as a, as something that's not gonna be obtrusive,

1155
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,720
you know, if it's not gonna interrupt your gameplay, I don't so much have a problem with

1156
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,880
it.

1157
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,540
I'm cool with the billboards and racing games, but I think that if they're doing this as

1158
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,720
a way to bring in more revenue, they need to decrease the price of the game.

1159
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,720
Absolutely.

1160
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,520
Now, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room and says, don't effing get me started

1161
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,720
on patents.

1162
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,480
Had my phone delayed in customs a week or so ago because of a BS Apple patent.

1163
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,840
Well, you know, a lot of folks are saying the patent industry in this country is really

1164
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,680
screwed up right now.

1165
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,640
And it's a lot of just offensive and defensive maneuvers.

1166
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,240
Remember when Twitter came out and said, we have all of these patents, they actually put

1167
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,580
out a press release that said, we have acquired all these patents and we only plan to use

1168
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,680
them defensively.

1169
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,040
Like, it's a fucking game of chess.

1170
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,240
That's what the patent industry in this country has become.

1171
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,920
So, yeah, maybe Sony is not even going to do anything with this.

1172
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,160
It's just, we just want to, you know, defend ourselves against when somebody tries to call

1173
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,200
us on it or something weird to throw my political two cents into it.

1174
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,600
This is what happens when you allow certain businesses to go deregulated DJ Morpheus is

1175
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,200
in our chat room and gives us an example of what could come to a PlayStation game near

1176
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
you.

1177
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,600
We'll return you to your blood carnage marathon game after this message from some feminine

1178
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,720
yeast infection product.

1179
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,240
Could be that would be freaking hilarious actually that I could support just for the

1180
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,840
comic value alone, because I'd want to see a reaction videos to that on the interwebs

1181
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,120
be hilarious.

1182
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:41,800
Now maybe this is related news, but Sony online entertainment or SOE has announced a free

1183
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,520
to play game called bullet run.

1184
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:51,400
It's a revamped game from Acony games or this head head head one or head in was the game

1185
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
with a new title.

1186
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
H-E-D-O-N-E.

1187
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,400
Head one.

1188
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,400
Yeah.

1189
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
Had one.

1190
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Could be heading.

1191
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
I don't know.

1192
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,920
But this is the bullet run is now kind of the new version of this.

1193
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,400
And you can see this at bullet run the game.com.

1194
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,200
It's a free to play shooter.

1195
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,760
It has a reality show premise to it.

1196
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,480
So, you know, reality show killing sprees are all the rage right now, thanks to hunger

1197
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,480
games.

1198
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,800
So I guess this is kind of like the hunger games, but with like commandos and stuff like

1199
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
that.

1200
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,140
So, uh, there you go.

1201
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:25,040
The developers known for such games as APB and battle forge, meaning they haven't had

1202
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,100
a lot of luck so far, but maybe this will be it.

1203
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:32,920
And maybe this will make Sony money because, Oh, I'm about to score a headshot on my opponent

1204
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:39,480
and have you tried summers Eve?

1205
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
Speaking of douches.

1206
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,720
It'd be funnier.

1207
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,920
It's just relative to the conversation.

1208
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
Yes.

1209
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:54,600
It'd be funnier if it was in max pain three bullet time advertisement, bullet time over

1210
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,440
advertisement gone.

1211
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,760
Interesting.

1212
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,640
Tiger call on our chat room says, and you know, those ads that appear in billboards

1213
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,680
and games and such, they actually find ways to block those ads from loading in games.

1214
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,720
You know, that ad that pops up on the Xbox live dashboard, there's a little tweak you

1215
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,760
can make the blocks it.

1216
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,760
So it doesn't load.

1217
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,280
I seem to remember reading something about that once where it's like on your router,

1218
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,600
you block a certain domain or something.

1219
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,180
It's never have to see that shit.

1220
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:24,000
You basically, you redirect, um, certain IPs to your local domain so that it doesn't pop.

1221
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,720
Doesn't load those things up.

1222
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,520
Um, but yeah, I mean you could do that.

1223
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,760
It would be, it depends, but you would all, you would be, you'd be interrupted with a

1224
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,860
blank screen instead.

1225
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,640
You know what my favorite way of getting rid of ads is?

1226
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,120
I'm not giving a fuck.

1227
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,520
Ignore it.

1228
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
How about that?

1229
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,280
Don't give a fuck.

1230
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,280
Or just don't.

1231
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,360
I mean, this is the day, age of the internet.

1232
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,280
You're going to know when there's going to be some source software out there that has

1233
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
ads in it.

1234
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,280
It's getting me out of fucking blocks.

1235
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,560
Hey, can you imagine this next, uh, God of War game has fucking ads for like, you know,

1236
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,960
subway in the middle, middle of the damn game.

1237
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,800
Are you out of fucks to give?

1238
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,600
Try new Folgers instant coffee.

1239
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,400
It will perk you right back up.

1240
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
You'll have plenty of fucks.

1241
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
This is my thing.

1242
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,760
If it's free or a very inexpensive service, I don't really care about if there's ads.

1243
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,440
You know, if it keeps the costs low or free, fine.

1244
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,440
That's great.

1245
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,040
You know, if, and then offer, you know, a paid option if you don't want to see the ads.

1246
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,920
That's, you know, that I think is fair.

1247
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,600
But when you've already paid the money for the game, that's, I think, and then you have

1248
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,880
your game interrupted, that's a little too far.

1249
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,880
I'm with you.

1250
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:44,800
If that and the micro transaction stuff, the Facebook style game in your $60 game, that

1251
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,160
shit pisses me the fuck off.

1252
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,040
They're going to keep doing it because they can charge $60 for a game and someone's going

1253
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,400
to pay for it and then they'll just watch the game.

1254
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,960
If they charge 20 bucks for the game.

1255
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,320
That's why there's going to be another video game industry crash.

1256
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
Wait.

1257
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,040
If they pay, now if they charge $20 for a game and then had, I refuse to use the word,

1258
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:04,320
had individual transactions within the game, that I could understand a little bit more

1259
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,080
because then you're paying for the cost of development.

1260
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,960
You're paying for the cost of advertising and you're paying for the shipping.

1261
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,920
So you're a supporter of Ridge Racer for the Vita, which was basically a $30 game that

1262
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,080
came with nothing.

1263
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,360
It was basically a six, six, no, I'm sorry, six cars, three tracks.

1264
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,240
That game can ask my D. You know what?

1265
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,880
I paid two bucks for Bust Move and I paid for all the maps, all the puzzles.

1266
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,680
I ended up spending six bucks on that game.

1267
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,200
You have a two versus 30 is a huge difference, but I'm saying as an example, all right, going

1268
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,080
to our, a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on shadow next gen in our

1269
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,920
chat room at vog network.com says too much effort for something that really doesn't mean

1270
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,920
anything.

1271
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,600
And I believe that's in regards to blocking the ads.

1272
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,800
A Sep when says, I don't have a problem with ads when they fit like ads in a sports game

1273
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,160
that look like the ads you see at a real game.

1274
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,120
Yeah, believe it or not, I don't, I don't give a shit about those at all.

1275
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,120
It kind of adds to the experience really.

1276
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,560
It makes it more realistic.

1277
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,760
I mean, it really does.

1278
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:08,280
Um, YouTube ads, however, Infinel says stupid ads like on X-Box dashboard make me want to

1279
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,520
avoid that product or service.

1280
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,520
Here's what you do.

1281
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,520
I don't know if I go that far with it.

1282
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
Here's what you do.

1283
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,360
Add people, and this is pure ad genius right here.

1284
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:22,840
You make a fighting game, Allah smash brothers or you know, Sony mascot battle rail where

1285
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,960
they're calling it.

1286
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:29,260
Um, and you just make it with the mascots from those advertisements and there you go.

1287
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,680
It's one big ad that actually fits within the game.

1288
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,600
There were a whole games around mascots.

1289
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:40,840
Remember like the yonoid and cool spot and exactly and I'm saying make kids, but you

1290
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,760
know what people and how about like Burger King did with their little sneak king and

1291
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,760
all of that.

1292
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,040
I saw a copy of sneak king at the flea market yesterday and I almost bought it.

1293
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,160
Where the fuck is my goddamn connect games Burger King.

1294
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
I've been waiting.

1295
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,040
It's so may connect.

1296
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,320
That's good advertising.

1297
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,280
I think that is clever.

1298
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,920
Those Burger King games were one of the best things I've seen actually.

1299
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,520
I mean, although the games were stupid, I mean just the fact that they even made them

1300
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
is quite astounding.

1301
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,920
All right, quickly, I want to read this comment from chat and then we need to move on for

1302
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,920
time.

1303
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,500
Blender in our chat room says I bought a subway sandwich for the uncharted three freebies.

1304
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,280
I got to say that was a really good promotion too.

1305
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,280
It really was.

1306
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,280
Yeah.

1307
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,040
I bought a subway sandwich for those uncharted three freebies as well and they didn't give

1308
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,040
up to me.

1309
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,520
Yeah, but that's, that's your individual subways fault.

1310
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,880
I've been like multiple subways for the stew.

1311
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,760
I've been getting like the large, you know, they're all, yeah, by a large drink and you

1312
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,600
get code for some battleship thing.

1313
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:39,700
I have yet to get a fucking code and like five different subways, a battleship thing.

1314
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,700
It's like for money.

1315
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,960
I don't know, but it's, it's tying it with the movie, but not one of them.

1316
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
I get it.

1317
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,040
I get it because, because they're sub sandwiches.

1318
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,040
Congratulations.

1319
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,040
You figured it out.

1320
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,680
That movie is gonna be such a sink.

1321
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,200
I saw the best article on, oh no, they didn't, which is one of my favorite websites on the

1322
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,320
entire internet.

1323
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:10,120
It was an article that was just, here is the complete bits of dialogue that Rihanna had

1324
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:16,000
in the movie battleship.

1325
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Oh my God.

1326
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,680
It was just, it was great.

1327
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,800
Anyway, let's move on.

1328
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
Video game news.

1329
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,000
How about something that's actually cool?

1330
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Less battleship.

1331
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yes.

1332
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,480
Let's move on to the Jima news.

1333
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,560
There's been some artwork revealed for a particular game that I know a lot of people are super

1334
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,560
excited about.

1335
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,560
You know what that is?

1336
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,560
No.

1337
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,720
A new zone of the Enders.

1338
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,400
It's the Enders project is in an experimental phase and he's trying to develop the game

1339
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,720
using the Fox engine.

1340
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,040
So hopefully we can see this out before too long.

1341
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:56,280
Right now though, it's supposed to be a fully fledged sequel to Zone of the Enders, the

1342
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,840
second runner.

1343
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,440
And so hopefully we can see that out before too long.

1344
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,960
And there's also been plenty of artwork tweeted by people who were at the press event.

1345
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,240
I'd like to see a new zone of the Enders game.

1346
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,240
That would be fun.

1347
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,240
Yep.

1348
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,520
And this event actually was specific for the Zone of the Enders HD collection.

1349
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,040
What's up with all these HD collections?

1350
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,040
People are buying them.

1351
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,320
That's what's up with them.

1352
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,720
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some games that are going to be coming

1353
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,160
out a whole lot sooner, as in this week as we travel the world with release dates.

1354
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,280
Loki, US.

1355
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,200
There's not a whole lot coming out this week.

1356
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,360
I mean, some re-releases I guess, or I don't know.

1357
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:40,200
We've got Batman Arkham City Game of the Year edition, which is coming out this week, on

1358
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:48,200
PS3 and Xbox 360, with that wonderful Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC and crap thrown in.

1359
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Hey!

1360
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
I like how they talk about...

1361
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,160
I know people genuinely excited about that, and I gotta say, it sounds pretty robust.

1362
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,800
I'm into it.

1363
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Robust.

1364
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Like Catwoman.

1365
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,800
It's robust.

1366
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Bust.

1367
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Whatever.

1368
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Whatever.

1369
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:09,640
Let's see, other fun things this week, Dear Drive, Legends on the 3DS.

1370
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,040
Get your deer hunting on in 3D.

1371
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,640
Atelier Maruru, The Apprentice of Arland on PlayStation 3 this week.

1372
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,440
Resistance, Burning Skies on the Vita.

1373
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Might have to check that out.

1374
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,640
That looks pretty neat.

1375
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,760
There's not a whole lot this week.

1376
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,280
A lot of it getting cancelled.

1377
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,480
Max Payne 3.

1378
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,480
That's right.

1379
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
The first is this Friday.

1380
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,960
Max Payne 3, Special Edition and the Regular Edition on PC coming out as well.

1381
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
And that's it.

1382
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,800
Alright, let's travel to Japan.

1383
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,800
Check out the games that are coming out over there in Japan on the Nintendo 3DS.

1384
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,040
I don't think there's a Disney game this week, but for some reason a bunch of character cases

1385
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,040
are coming out.

1386
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,320
So if you've ever wanted to stitch character case, import one from Japan, because there's

1387
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,400
a bunch of those coming out there from Hori.

1388
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,440
Must tie in to Dream Drop Distance somehow, it must.

1389
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:08,640
But what is coming out on the 3DS, this is kind of a big deal.

1390
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,200
Dragon Quest Monsters, Terry No Wonderland 3D.

1391
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,520
So it's not in the main series of Dragon Quest games, but still it carries the name.

1392
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,760
It is from Square Enix, so it will be a little bit of a deal there.

1393
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,660
Guild 01 from level 5 comes out as well.

1394
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:26,000
That's all again on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

1395
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,880
Taking a look at the other handheld real quick, the Vita, nothing this week.

1396
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,740
The next big game is Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny on June the 7th.

1397
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:40,200
Taking a look at the consoles real quick on the Playstation 3, Atelier Meru Alchemist

1398
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,400
of Arland 3 gets a price drop into the best collection.

1399
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,920
That's also Atelier Rorona gets that same price drop.

1400
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:54,360
Coming out from Sega this week, Jisen Pachi Slot Hishihoho Hokuto no Ken F Sekimatsu Kaishu

1401
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,960
Seisu Densetsu, it's basically another Pachino game, Pachinko, Pachinko game.

1402
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,960
Not like Al Pachinko.

1403
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,960
I heard legend in there somewhere.

1404
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,040
Yeah, it's a Sega Pachinko game.

1405
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,720
That's what you get.

1406
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:11,200
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13, but that is in English, but it's getting a Japanese release.

1407
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,240
And hey, Portal 2 gets a price reduction, so if you want to hear what GLaDOS sounds

1408
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,280
like in Japanese, there you go.

1409
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,920
Lastly in the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Portal 2 gets that same price reduction, and

1410
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,440
that's really it.

1411
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,760
How about the UK, Darkstalker?

1412
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,160
Three things.

1413
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:34,040
Mad Riders for Xbox 360 and Resistance Burning Skies for Vita on the 30th, and then we have

1414
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,000
on June 1st, Max Payne 3 for PC.

1415
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That's about it.

1416
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,760
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the

1417
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
week.

1418
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,760
But first, Loki.

1419
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Ah, yes.

1420
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,420
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of funny, uh, Kinect.

1421
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:57,160
They have new technology now, new technology, where they can detect you sitting down.

1422
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:03,880
That's right, Kinect Software Development Kit Update 1.5 now features the ability to

1423
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,480
Kinect with you sitting on the couch.

1424
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,480
And uh...

1425
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,480
Now, it can't tell if I'm wearing pants or not, right?

1426
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,400
Because you know I have this legit fear about the Kinect, that if I, you know, it's my house,

1427
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,200
I'll do what I want, and if I'm sitting in front of the Xbox 360 not wearing pants and

1428
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,280
playing Minecraft, I don't want that image broadcast to the internet, and I have this

1429
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,280
fear in the back of my mind.

1430
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:31,440
I put a little box in front of the Kinect when I don't want to be seen by the internet.

1431
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,600
Um, yeah, they don't have that ability in here.

1432
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,440
It's not one of the listed features, but uh, other fun stuff, they've got a development

1433
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:46,440
kit for face tracking, um, also some human interface guidelines and other improvements.

1434
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:54,200
Um, also, they're saying that, um, you know, they have full seated skeletal tracking mode,

1435
01:13:54,200 --> 01:14:01,000
which is, you know, to track people sitting down, and uh, they said also that um, I think

1436
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,720
this is more, obviously this is only on, you know, PC, but I think a little bit, since

1437
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:11,560
most people on PC are probably sitting down to interface with stuff, I would hate to have

1438
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:17,160
to stand up to, I don't know, read an email or something like that with Kinect.

1439
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:23,360
Well it'll be nice too that now you can play Kinect without actually having to move.

1440
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,840
It's kind of the nice, you know, antithesis.

1441
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:32,000
I'm pretty sure, I mean, the Kinect does detect you sitting down, um, like for some things,

1442
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,880
like you can browse menus and stuff like that on the Xbox Kinect, just, uh, I think sitting

1443
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,880
down.

1444
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:44,520
I can stand up to browse video menus and stuff like that, um, then again, I'm not, you know,

1445
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:50,080
stupid enough to hook up Kinect to do that when I can go, huh, controller is faster,

1446
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,960
you know, seriously, why would I need, I never understood why I need to browse those menus

1447
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:03,720
with my arm when I can just put the controller in my hand and just do that, I mean, I, it's

1448
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,240
faster, it really is faster.

1449
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:12,520
Voice searches, that's kinda cool, but, you know, moving my hand around to select things,

1450
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,600
that is slower.

1451
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,600
Well we will see what this brings into games later on, although couldn't you play Joyride

1452
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
sitting down?

1453
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,120
Was it supposed to be able to see your hands driving the car?

1454
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,840
Um, I didn't play that long.

1455
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,160
Maybe it's because it was only looking at your hands, it wasn't looking at the rest

1456
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,800
of your body, I don't know.

1457
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,880
Well there's somewhat of an in-joke amongst the, uh, community of Konami fans that have

1458
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,200
been following them for some time and it's called Konami Will Sue, but maybe this week

1459
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,120
the joke should be changed to Konami Will Be Sued, because Konami was sued this week

1460
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,920
and, uh, you'd be pretty impressed what it's for, it's pretty crazy.

1461
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:52,560
City National Bank is the one that's filed the suit against Konami and Autumn Games,

1462
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,480
and it's over fraud, and the reason why is because the bank hasn't received any return

1463
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,080
on a 15 million dollar line of credit that it approved to both Konami and Autumn Games,

1464
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:10,080
and the court documents claim that the financial state of Autumn and Konami were faults at

1465
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,520
the time that they were made and that defendants never had any intention of repaying the loan

1466
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,120
as promised.

1467
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,840
That's all a quote from the court documents and so is this, rather than paying game-related

1468
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:26,980
proceeds directly to CNB or City National Bank as agreed, defendant have kept all game-related

1469
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:32,520
proceeds for themselves and have refused to remit any such proceeds to City National Bank.

1470
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,720
Here's what I think, here's what I think the problem is.

1471
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,960
I think that they think that those games, or, you know, Def Jam Rapstar was going to

1472
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,060
be successful, and they're like, where's our percentage of, you know, of the profits?

1473
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,960
Why are we only getting, like, ten dollars?

1474
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,880
Well, that is your percentage, actually.

1475
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,560
You can't divide by zero, stupid!

1476
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,560
Sorry, uh, that's how much, that's how many copies we sold.

1477
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,640
You get a big fat check for twenty dollars.

1478
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,540
By the way, that's not the first time there's been a lawsuit over this game, because what

1479
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:09,160
happened in March, EMI Music Group actually also filed a suit over the game's licensed

1480
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:15,720
tracks were not supposed to be there, apparently, so this game has caused a lot more headache,

1481
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,720
probably, for these companies than it was worth, although I do still stand by it, even

1482
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:24,800
though not everybody's into rap music, it really wasn't a bad music game.

1483
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,800
It was really kind of too bad that all this shit has fallen out because of it, because

1484
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,800
it really wasn't a bad music game, if, you know, especially if you actually like rap,

1485
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
so.

1486
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,660
Alright, let's travel back to a time when we didn't have to read about all these lawsuits

1487
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,760
going on, because there was no internet, or I guess in the particular case of this game,

1488
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,520
there was a little internet, but there were no lawsuits.

1489
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,680
There were no laws.

1490
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:52,160
There were no, yes, right, there were no laws in this game, actually, I think this is a

1491
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,160
perfect thing.

1492
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,160
It was lawless land.

1493
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:59,360
Let's travel back in time and visit the classic game of the week.

1494
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:05,280
Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks,

1495
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:11,280
hey, you ungrateful little brat, so you're newfangled crap, go back and play something

1496
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,720
old school, like this.

1497
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,360
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1498
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,840
There was a game that used to eat up all of my time in early 2000, and I would sit and

1499
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,720
point and click and click and click and click and click, and my husband was so pissed off

1500
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,680
because I was deaf all night playing this damn game.

1501
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,680
Diablo 2?

1502
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,680
No.

1503
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,720
Keep in mind, I didn't play the first two Diablo games.

1504
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:39,800
This is Ragnarok Online, which was my crack, and I have, from time to time, been known

1505
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,760
to go back on a free server.

1506
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,400
I am also one of the people who basically has a permanent account on IRO, the International

1507
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,440
Ragnarok Online, because I played in the beta.

1508
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,640
I played in the Korean beta, I played in the Japanese beta, and I played in the US beta.

1509
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,360
Yeah, I've played a lot of Ragnarok.

1510
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,760
And my last, I think-

1511
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,920
Fuck, even I remember this music.

1512
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,160
I remember when I gave you the hair bow, Rob, when you were playing with me.

1513
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,160
I was very pretty with that little hair bow.

1514
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,160
You were lovely.

1515
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,160
And you had the red hair.

1516
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,160
The red boy hair.

1517
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,640
Back when my hair actually looked like that.

1518
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,640
Yeah.

1519
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,760
But I played the ton of this, and I think the last server I played on was EssenceRO.

1520
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,480
Good server if anyone's looking for a private server.

1521
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,480
Great people.

1522
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,320
Anyway, it's made by Gravity.

1523
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:31,680
It is based off of the manhwa, which is called Ragnarok, and there was a Ragnarok 3 animation

1524
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,680
based off of it.

1525
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,320
It was actually a pretty, pretty good little anime.

1526
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,320
It really captured the game very well.

1527
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:45,940
You've got different types of gameplay that are in that you have PvE, you have guild versus

1528
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,400
guild, and PvP.

1529
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:53,040
So you can initiate PvP anywhere.

1530
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,480
Guild versus guild, I really, really, really liked that function.

1531
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,880
Because it was a big capture the flag kind of thing.

1532
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,280
And I think that's something that-

1533
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:11,240
And now while I'm not a PvP fan, that is kind of the only reason why I like Battlegrounds

1534
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,240
at all in WoW.

1535
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,960
It's because it kind of reminds me of this, even though I didn't do it that often.

1536
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,040
Because honestly, I was a PvE person.

1537
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,760
I'm always a PvE person.

1538
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:30,860
It's sprite based, it is with different 3D environments, and you basically travel all

1539
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:36,280
over this little world in the game getting different creatures.

1540
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:42,040
And as long as I played this damn game, Rob, I have not been everywhere in it.

1541
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,040
It is big.

1542
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:49,120
I mean, yeah, I've been to every needed thing on the main map, but there's all the little

1543
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,640
caves and the dungeons and the special areas, and I haven't been everywhere in the game.

1544
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:00,480
Although I have been to certain areas of the game many times, like the freaking toy factory.

1545
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,480
Or pronterra.

1546
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,480
Pronterra.

1547
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,120
Warp to pront, please.

1548
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,640
Warp to pront, please.

1549
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:11,240
I'm glad that they took out that warping thing, because that was such a pain.

1550
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:16,520
Usually priests could teleport, and they could open warp portals, and they did something

1551
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,560
because that's not there anymore.

1552
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:28,160
But yeah, you also, it really was based heavily off of Norse mythology, and you have different

1553
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,800
classes.

1554
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:35,620
They also offered transcendent classes that keep going forward.

1555
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,560
So yeah, with the different versions, you have your jobs.

1556
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,800
Swordsman starts off as a novice, and then you actually can become a super novice, where

1557
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,960
you get different aspects of other classes.

1558
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:52,140
Then you have a swordman who can become a knight or a crusader, and then rebirth classes

1559
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:56,280
where you start over and rebuild them with more goodies.

1560
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:02,260
So basically, your first job class is swordsman, mage, archer, merchant, thief, acolyte.

1561
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:06,800
And then you can expand to guns, you also have expanded classes such as gunslinger,

1562
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,600
or taequan, which, playing a taequan was actually really fun.

1563
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,600
The chat room was getting upset with the music, because it's the only music you ever heard

1564
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,160
in the game, so I switched it, because there was more than one song in Ragnarok Online.

1565
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,960
Oh I love that music, that's Juno, isn't it?

1566
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,960
I love that area.

1567
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:24,960
Anyway.

1568
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,640
I thought you might approve.

1569
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,480
After the 2-1, you can actually become a knight, wizard, hunter, blacksmith, assassin, or priest.

1570
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,840
I played a blacksmith for a while named Tony Stark, just saying.

1571
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,040
Because you can get mecha later on, too.

1572
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,320
Moving forward, you also have the 2-2 classes, which is crusader, sage, bard dancer, alchemist,

1573
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,200
rogue, and monk.

1574
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,200
And then the further go, once they rebirth, you have the 2-1 job, which is lord knight,

1575
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,360
high wizard, sniper, master smith, who gets a mecha, that's awesome, assassin, cross,

1576
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,600
and high priest.

1577
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,440
Or the 2-2 job classes, which are paladin, scholar, minstrel, gypsy, biochemist, stalker,

1578
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,440
and champion.

1579
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,760
I actually have to say that minstrels are pretty fun.

1580
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:09,720
For female ones, you had a dancer, who basically looks like a harem chick.

1581
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,320
There's a soundtrack come out.

1582
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,840
There's all kinds of stuff for this.

1583
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:20,640
There are pay-to-play servers, and then there's tons of freemium stuff that goes on with it,

1584
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,640
too.

1585
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,220
Like the caffer shop, you can buy different stuff.

1586
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:30,880
With free-to-play servers, basically, you can play for free, but to support the servers,

1587
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,280
they usually have special freebie goods, or special goods that you can pay for.

1588
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,880
Like for one server I played on, there used to be these little dolls you could get that

1589
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,880
sit on top of your head.

1590
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:40,880
They were selling doll hats.

1591
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,560
They had a sprite artist who would make doll hats.

1592
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,100
And you paid like 20 bucks, and you got a doll hat.

1593
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,080
And it was good because it kept the server paid for, because it does cost money to keep

1594
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,080
these going off.

1595
01:23:52,080 --> 01:24:00,560
There's also Ragnarok Mobile, that you can use to focus on your characters.

1596
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,720
And then there was the Ragnarok RPG that I've been playing.

1597
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:10,040
And there's a version on Game Boy that I, um, you got me the Japanese version of it,

1598
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,040
didn't you?

1599
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,040
Yeah.

1600
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,040
I played the crap out of that.

1601
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:19,140
Because I could read Prontera, and I knew where I was on the damn map.

1602
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:22,800
And I think an English version of that since came out, too.

1603
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,080
But it is really fun.

1604
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:30,000
I would say that if you're looking for just like a little freebie RPG to get into, Ragnarok

1605
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,320
Online is really fun.

1606
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,960
And like my favorite class still to this day is Assassin, because it's like pow pow pow

1607
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,960
pow.

1608
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,960
It's just all speed.

1609
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:38,960
It was awesome.

1610
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:39,960
So yeah, my game is Ragnarok Online.

1611
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:46,080
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Ragnarok Online for the PC.

1612
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,000
And various spinoffs on other devices that Darsak are named.

1613
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yes.

1614
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,320
A game I haven't played in about 10 years.

1615
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,880
I have, I've been playing the one on the iPhone lately, and it's pretty fun.

1616
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:55,880
That's cool.

1617
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,880
Yeah.

1618
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,880
I might have to check that out.

1619
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,480
You play a total- On my shiny new iPad.

1620
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,880
You play a total asshole, though.

1621
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,880
He's so fun.

1622
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,880
Good times.

1623
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,760
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1624
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,240
We're going to take a break here live as we are taping our episode number 458B here live

1625
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,880
on May the 27th of 2012.

1626
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,400
We're going to take a quick break here.

1627
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,400
But don't go anywhere, guys.

1628
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,120
We've got plenty more show to come.

1629
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,760
We've got some rapid fire news.

1630
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:25,480
We have the mailbag FUs of the week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio

1631
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,640
on Skype are all coming up in a little while.

1632
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,640
So stay tuned.

1633
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,640
Don't go anywhere.

1634
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:38,040
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1635
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,520
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1636
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,600
We are live on this Memorial Day weekend, May the 27th of 2012, with episode number

1637
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,340
458B of our podcast.

1638
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,160
Why is it episode 458B?

1639
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,600
Well, go back and listen to the first part of the show if you want to know why it is

1640
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,600
458B.

1641
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,800
Anyhow, we're going to get back in with some rapid fire news here.

1642
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:07,360
Again, I just want to really plug the VOG conference on Friday at 7 Pacific 10 Eastern

1643
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,120
live at vognetwork.com.

1644
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,040
And I'm getting some people that are just sending me their ideas for VOG stuff, and

1645
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,040
I love it.

1646
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,360
And I know Bobby wants to hear it.

1647
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,760
Dark Soccer would like to hear it.

1648
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,920
Shit, anybody you can talk to that's one of the hosts on VOG somewhere, Loki, Travis,

1649
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,200
whoever, we love hearing the ideas.

1650
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,600
And I'm talking to somebody about one idea right now, I'm like, well, that is a good

1651
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,940
idea actually, yes, we should do that.

1652
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:34,000
And so I love it because it's, you know, just like Orange Lounge Radio, where every gamer

1653
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,840
has a voice was never really just about us, VOG network isn't really just about us either.

1654
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,880
So it's about me, everybody know me and my fabulousness.

1655
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,880
Stop hating, Rob.

1656
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Stop being a parody.

1657
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,880
All right.

1658
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Stop hating.

1659
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,880
Let's move on.

1660
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,880
It's about the gaming news.

1661
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,980
Now we're going to travel around and check out some quick stories in a segment we call

1662
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,400
Rapid Fire News.

1663
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,400
Loki.

1664
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,600
All right.

1665
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,000
Let's talk a little bit about some upcoming games.

1666
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,160
XCOM Enemy Unknown actually has been announced to be coming out on October 9th.

1667
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:10,800
Now I thought, you know, when I first saw this that this means, ah, damn, I guess, you

1668
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:17,640
know, I guess we're not going to have any Grand Theft Auto 5 game announcement for October.

1669
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,640
I'm not so sure if that's going to be the case anymore because actually there was an

1670
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:29,520
announcement for, was it Take-Two put out their estimates for their fiscal years and

1671
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:40,280
for 2013, which would cover up through now through, was it March of, March 31st, 2013,

1672
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,660
and then we'll play some awesome music.

1673
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:50,800
They have about $700 million or, you know, unaccounted revenue in there and even if like

1674
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,000
some of these games do really well, I don't think they're going to hit that spot.

1675
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So people are thinking, maybe that's Grand Theft Auto 5 in there somewhere, which honestly

1676
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,600
if it were to come out in October, it would, it probably wouldn't compete very well.

1677
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,400
You know, they wouldn't, wouldn't cannibalize stuff.

1678
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,280
So God, I hope it's October.

1679
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:21,880
Anyways, so yes, XCOM Enemy Unknown, October 9th and I guess 13th internationally as well.

1680
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,000
So pretty cool.

1681
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,360
And then of course, there's rumors, spoiler, I don't know, that EA's next Need for Speed

1682
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,720
game is actually going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted.

1683
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,200
Perhaps a reboot of that franchise.

1684
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,720
Wait, they already had a Most Wanted.

1685
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,720
Yes, they did.

1686
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,560
They also had a Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but that didn't stop them from having that

1687
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,320
last year.

1688
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:51,800
So perhaps Most Wanted could be, you know, put out again.

1689
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,460
You know, a new title with the same, I hope it's not the same thing.

1690
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:55,920
It's like Apple's methodology.

1691
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,600
It's the new Most Wanted.

1692
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,600
Yeah.

1693
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,600
So.

1694
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,600
More Wanted-er.

1695
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,840
Maybe Most Wanted 2, I don't know.

1696
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,280
Apparently there's, you know, a schedule going around showing, you know, that the game's

1697
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:16,880
going to be shown on like EA's booth and also apparently it was, there was a Twitch TV feed

1698
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,960
or something like that for E3 that also has that listed on there as well amongst some

1699
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,640
other TVA titles from Ubisoft.

1700
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,120
So yeah, we'll probably see something from, you know, EA for Need for Speed Most Wanted

1701
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,200
whether it be, I hope it's not the same damn title because that's going to be confusing

1702
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,680
because it didn't come out that long ago.

1703
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,300
That was only like five years ago.

1704
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,440
That's not, that's not that long in game time.

1705
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:45,160
And last but not least, Carmageddon Reincarnation has hit their goal with ten days left to go

1706
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:53,200
and of course, you know, I guess that means we're going to be getting a remade Carmageddon

1707
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,200
game.

1708
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,840
Also they're saying that they're going to be adding some DLC to it now and probably

1709
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,540
going to be setting some different stretch goals for that as well and, you know, funding

1710
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:06,600
will be done in a few more days.

1711
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,640
All right, let's move on with some other news.

1712
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,760
You ever been to a website where you have to punch in CAPTCHA?

1713
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,120
You know, like if you want to like download something or if you want to register for an

1714
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,280
account, you have to put in CAPTCHA.

1715
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,560
And sometimes the words are very like nonsense.

1716
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,320
I love this mock up where somebody put kill me in the CAPTCHA.

1717
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,320
Well I love this.

1718
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,200
Apparently there is- I had destroy enemies once.

1719
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,200
Did you really?

1720
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,200
Yes I did.

1721
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,200
That's awesome.

1722
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:36,000
I guess there is a new Detroit based startup company and they're called Are You a Human?

1723
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,880
And what they aim to do, they want to replace the CAPTCHA box that people use with mini

1724
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,340
games.

1725
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,340
Why not?

1726
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,340
It accomplishes the same thing.

1727
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,880
You wouldn't be able to beat the game if you weren't actually a human.

1728
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:52,600
The tool they're developing is called PlayThrough and it's going to allow a website owner to

1729
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,000
fight bots and spammers by using simple mini games.

1730
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,960
For example, there could be a level where you put tools in a toolbox or you put toppings

1731
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,880
on a pizza.

1732
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,200
Some websites that are already using this, Quicken Loans and Fathead.

1733
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,960
I don't know what Fathead does, but-

1734
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,080
Fathead makes giant posters on the wall of sports figures.

1735
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,080
Oh.

1736
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,160
That's why I had no idea who they were.

1737
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,160
I don't own any of those.

1738
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,680
But I do have a sweet Tron poster.

1739
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,720
I don't own any of those either, but the reason I know they do that is because they also have

1740
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,920
that option for your Xbox Live avatar and I'm like why the fuck would I want a six foot

1741
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,520
tall picture of my avatar on the wall.

1742
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,920
I really have a big problem with your Tron poster.

1743
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:29,920
What?

1744
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,120
Because it looks like all those little teleporting effects are just really bad use of the blur

1745
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,120
tool.

1746
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,120
Well, I'm sorry.

1747
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:41,880
Speaking of Tron, I did happen to see that that episode of Tron Uprising was on Disney

1748
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,760
last night and I was like, ooh, that's right, we're only a couple of weeks away from actual

1749
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,760
new episodes.

1750
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,280
Well, you know what I found out is that funny enough, a week from tonight, they are going

1751
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,600
to be doing some type of kickoff event at Downtown Disney.

1752
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,300
Guess where I'm going to be, yo?

1753
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,160
So I plan to bring you a vlog-

1754
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,760
Better bring me Tron stuff.

1755
01:31:58,760 --> 01:31:59,760
I'm going to-

1756
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,680
We're going to have a neon blue carpet.

1757
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:08,560
I am so going, and there will be a full report on vlog for sure, so I'm not expecting much

1758
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,560
though.

1759
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,200
For all I know, they're just going to have a giant screen out in the middle of Downtown

1760
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,200
Disney that's playing it.

1761
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,200
So we'll see.

1762
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,200
Elijah wouldn't be there.

1763
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,200
You're going to get kidnapped by a recognizer.

1764
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,200
I'd be alright with that.

1765
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,200
Paul Rubins was there.

1766
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,620
Oh my gosh, it'd be awesome.

1767
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,620
So we'll see.

1768
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,620
We'll see.

1769
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,620
I'm not going to hold my breath.

1770
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,620
He needs to record a bumper.

1771
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,480
You know who was at Disneyland, by the way, last weekend when we were there?

1772
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,800
Lady Gaga.

1773
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,800
Shut the front door.

1774
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,600
She was posted on Facebook.

1775
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Isn't she like touring?

1776
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,560
Like she was supposed to go to Indonesia and there's the whole hub-a-loo going on there?

1777
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,400
There was a post on her Facebook thing that was at Disneyland.

1778
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,280
Well maybe she was at like Hong Kong Disney.

1779
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,600
I don't know, but-

1780
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,920
I don't think Hong Kong Disney exists anymore.

1781
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,920
We looked for her.

1782
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,920
Yeah, they have.

1783
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,600
It used to be an airport years ago.

1784
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,000
Anyhow, don't ask me how I know that.

1785
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That's Shanghai Disney.

1786
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Alright, moving on.

1787
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,760
Uh, rumors about a new Castlevania game on the 3DS.

1788
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,280
Apparently the name has leaked out, Castlevania Mirror of Faith.

1789
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,800
Supposedly this is a game that's going to be shown at E3.

1790
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,800
Makes sense to me.

1791
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,480
It's about time there's a new Castlevania game out on a handheld.

1792
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,480
I have no reason to disbelieve this.

1793
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,480
Yeah.

1794
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:13,920
Especially because, it's funny because this particular site is a site Nintendo Netherlands

1795
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,000
or whatever.

1796
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,140
You might remember, OLR blew the story on that about six years ago.

1797
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,560
One of the DS games we had the exclusive on.

1798
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,340
So I have no reason to doubt them.

1799
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,340
They're sloppy.

1800
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,040
Let's get out.

1801
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,240
It would be interesting if this information that got out is also true.

1802
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,980
It has to do with Wii U details.

1803
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:39,880
These are very specific details from Ubisoft Milan apparently leaked these details.

1804
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,400
It's Wii U related information.

1805
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,920
It was found on an Italian message board.

1806
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,240
Some very specific details.

1807
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,640
Now granted this could all be fanboy wank, but I don't know.

1808
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,480
They're claiming it's directly from Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft would know some of this

1809
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,860
shit because they are doing some of the launch games.

1810
01:33:54,860 --> 01:34:01,000
Which include for Ubisoft Rayman Legends, The Avengers, Assassin's Creed 3 and Just

1811
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,120
Dance 4.

1812
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,280
A game called Killer Freaks from Outer Space, supposed to arrive a few weeks after launch.

1813
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:10,360
Those are some pretty specific, I mean granted about three of those are a duh, but Killer

1814
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,360
Freaks from Outer Space.

1815
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,360
You can't guess that.

1816
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360
That was announced at E3 last year.

1817
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,360
Oh was it?

1818
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,360
I don't remember that one.

1819
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,520
Yeah they even had video of it.

1820
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,920
Alright, so maybe it's just somebody using logic, but we'll see.

1821
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,880
It looks like a cross between the Rabbids and Critters.

1822
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,720
Like the Rabbids were like evil alien things.

1823
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,560
Wii U does DirectX 11.

1824
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,720
It's already running Unreal Engine 4.

1825
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,280
Two gigs of RAM.

1826
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,200
560 megs of that dedicated to the OS.

1827
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:38,680
November 23rd, the launch date, but remember that's coming out of Milan so could be a little

1828
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,840
bit around there for other regions.

1829
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:47,400
Launch price hasn't yet been decided, but they're saying 350 to 450 which tells me 399.

1830
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,040
Multiple versions of the console out there with developers.

1831
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,920
Graphics being powered by a Radeon HD 6770 chipset.

1832
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,120
Assassin's Creed 3 is 60 frames a second at 1080p.

1833
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,240
It is only running 720p on the other consoles right now.

1834
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,320
November 23rd would be a Friday, I don't know if they'd launch it.

1835
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,240
But that's, again, that's Milan.

1836
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,820
That's not America.

1837
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,080
So there's some time is some shift with the days.

1838
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,080
And you know the other thing.

1839
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,080
Add those Italians.

1840
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:17,080
Well here's the problem I have with Ubisoft, this information coming from Ubisoft Milan,

1841
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:23,360
because Ubisoft Milan would be a, it's basically a portion of the company that does development

1842
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,360
for certain games.

1843
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:28,240
So which game are they working on that they would be privy to this information?

1844
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:34,840
Because, you know, Ubisoft Milan, let's see, let's, I'm sorry, I can't hear Ubisoft Milan

1845
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:42,480
without hearing in the back of my head RuPaul saying, London, Paris, Milan.

1846
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,320
I fully expect nobody listening to this show will get that joke.

1847
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,000
But maybe one, maybe one person.

1848
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,280
Alright.

1849
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,560
The Wii U comes with pre-installed software, which really wouldn't be a stretch for Nintendo.

1850
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,280
You know, they have some basic shit on all their platforms, like the Mii Plaza, for example

1851
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,320
on 3DS.

1852
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:05,160
Most interesting about this, Valve working on a digital distribution platform and portal

1853
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,160
ports.

1854
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,840
That could be very interesting if Valve is involved with the Wii.

1855
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:15,400
That's going to bring a heck of a lot of, you know, like, core gamer quote unquote oomph

1856
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,400
to the Wii U.

1857
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,400
That would be amazing.

1858
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,840
One other thing I'll say here, the new button supposedly has some link to the Wii Vitality

1859
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,840
sensor.

1860
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,720
So maybe a new form of it or something like that.

1861
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,840
Well I figured it would be a biometric button.

1862
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:33,960
Alright so, that's it for the Wii U rumors, so let's move on with some more rapid fire

1863
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:34,960
news.

1864
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:42,520
Okay, Rob, well, how about some stuff having to do with touch screen graffiti controls

1865
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,400
for Jet Set Radio.

1866
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,360
This is for the Vita release.

1867
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:50,760
Basically, well, and there's still not a date on it yet, but they're saying that they're

1868
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:58,400
bringing in touch screen controls and camera integration so that I guess you can, for customizing

1869
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,860
your tags in the game.

1870
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,780
So that should be pretty cool.

1871
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:09,480
And then this is the thing that I lusted over yesterday, and, oh my god I want this so bad,

1872
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:22,200
it like seriously makes me moist, the Street Fighter 25th anniversary collector set that

1873
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:34,040
comes in a big black box has a Ryu figure, 15 discs that includes on it, Super Street

1874
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:38,480
Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, Super Street

1875
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,320
Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, and the DLC, and Street Fighter Cross Tekken, and the DLC with

1876
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:48,040
a documentary, two anime movies, the full Street Fighter animated series, and 11 discs

1877
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
of music.

1878
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,880
And it has a light up Ryu statue and Ryu's belt.

1879
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,360
That is too much Street Fighter.

1880
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,120
For 150 bucks.

1881
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,120
You know what?

1882
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,120
I want it.

1883
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,440
Of course you do, because you are a consumer whore.

1884
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,440
And how.

1885
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,720
But really, I don't care because I freaking love Street Fighter.

1886
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:10,600
I'm looking at this set and oh my dear god, it just, I'm literally moist right now, I

1887
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,240
can't help it.

1888
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,760
So how about Harry Potter stuff?

1889
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,760
How about it?

1890
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,760
Um, apparently there's going to be a Harry Potter for Kinect and there's a trailer out.

1891
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,160
It's got a really creepy face capture thing on it.

1892
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,600
It does, but it actually looks pretty good.

1893
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:34,880
As long, I, it looks good in the trailer, but then I'm like, the games are never really

1894
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,220
like that.

1895
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,360
Just make the damn MMO already.

1896
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,160
You know what?

1897
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:47,280
Screw Harry Potter because fucking Ryu, no he's underage, statue, not anymore, statues,

1898
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:54,720
statue of Ryu that lights up with, it even has a certificate of authen-fucking-ticity.

1899
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,720
How can you pass that off?

1900
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,840
So you know it's authen-fucking-tistic.

1901
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,400
It'll go on my wall and I will stare at Ryu for hours because that, you know, that was

1902
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:06,080
my first video game crush was Ryu when I was a little kid.

1903
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,000
Aww, that's kind of adorable.

1904
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yep.

1905
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Okay.

1906
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I'm done.

1907
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm spent.

1908
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I'm really spent.

1909
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Alright.

1910
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:24,440
Let's move on to the foogle question of the week.

1911
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:28,720
The foogle question of the week is a segment of our show where we ask a question on Facebook

1912
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:33,880
and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

1913
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,880
We didn't ask one tonight.

1914
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,300
Some of you might have said, hey, I didn't see a new question on Facebook or Google this

1915
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,300
week.

1916
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,920
That's because, you know, we never got to read last week's answers because of the crash

1917
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,880
and it was a pretty timely question.

1918
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,080
So I want to go through some of those right now.

1919
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,680
So we're going to start on our Google Plus page.

1920
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,080
Shit.

1921
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,680
I just dropped that brand new iPad of mine.

1922
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,040
How convenient.

1923
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,040
That's why I have a case on it.

1924
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,040
Well, here's the weird thing.

1925
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,760
I can't access Facebook right now.

1926
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,360
Can you access Facebook, Logan?

1927
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,640
Can I access Facebook?

1928
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,640
Oh, there it went.

1929
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:05,640
It just went.

1930
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,640
Okay, good.

1931
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,520
Because I was getting worried that I was going to miss the questions here.

1932
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,520
Alright, anyhow.

1933
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,520
The question of the week, more and more games are incorporating multiplayer into their games.

1934
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,560
For example, Mass Effect 3.

1935
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,920
Some in the industry have been quoted as saying that multiplayer is essential in this day

1936
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,120
and age to having a successful game.

1937
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:26,080
How important do you feel that multiplayer is to the games you purchase?

1938
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,040
Have you ever been swayed on a game purchase because of the fact that it did or did not

1939
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,240
have multiplayer?

1940
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:35,080
Reddertainment answers the question and says, multiplayer is irrelevant to me due to my

1941
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:41,040
ISP being fucking incompetent, PSN being incompetent, and me canceling Xbox Live Gold as part of

1942
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,040
my effort to buy a house.

1943
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:47,080
So in other words, the world is out to get him.

1944
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:52,280
Vilagas responds and says, these are all from Google Plus again, Uncharted, Gears, Halo,

1945
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,280
etc.

1946
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,000
All have some form of competitive multiplayer that I've never tried.

1947
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,920
I only buy games for the single player component due to the rampant negativity on the online

1948
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:01,920
services.

1949
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,000
I do love co-op multiplayer with my family or friends.

1950
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,840
Tell Jamie I apologize for my bad grammar and punctuation.

1951
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,960
Well, you apologize to the wrong person.

1952
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,960
And I'm mad.

1953
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,960
No, I'm just kidding.

1954
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:14,960
You actually didn't do a bad job.

1955
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,040
I'm, I'm, I have pretty bad grammar myself, so I'm usually pretty forgiving.

1956
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,040
All right.

1957
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,760
And lastly, Jim from who he was supposed to be here last week to answer this in person,

1958
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,440
but he decided to go on Google Plus and answer instead.

1959
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,920
Flaco Jones, I don't care much for multiplayer modes in games because I'm all about the story

1960
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,260
and it doesn't make much sense story wise when there are seven Nathan Drakes running

1961
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,600
around shooting other players at the same time.

1962
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:44,360
Plus, I rent or buy used, so I don't get even get to play multiplayer thanks to online passes.

1963
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,120
Let's go to the Facebook community now that Facebook is working for me at facebook.com

1964
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:53,180
slash orange lounge radio and read some of the answers that you guys sent us over there.

1965
01:41:53,180 --> 01:42:00,260
And we're going to start off with a reply from DDR dollar bill who says never as in

1966
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:05,120
has you ever been swayed, never multiplayer, never made or break a purchase for me.

1967
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,400
It was nice, but it wasn't life or death either.

1968
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:12,840
And it wouldn't change a game grade by one point if it was included nor excluded JV Mon

1969
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,520
says I almost never play multiplayer online.

1970
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:19,720
And if I do, it's only with friends who usually don't buy the same games as me.

1971
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:23,900
Even then cross game chat fixes that problem and we can hang out while playing.

1972
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,220
So would it sway me?

1973
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:27,040
Not at all.

1974
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:32,240
So we have a lot of people that are like no, no, no, never, never, never.

1975
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,240
Let's go to an answer from Red the Haze.

1976
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,100
I've no problems with added multiplayer as long as it's good, builds on the single player

1977
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:44,880
game and adds to the experience but has no negative consequences to the single player.

1978
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,360
Just like when I bought Mass Effect 3 when it was on sale for 30 bucks just for multiplayer

1979
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:54,420
even though I haven't played Mass Effect 2, but I plan to play 3 once I get to.

1980
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:57,640
So that's somebody who kind of went and bought a game that's more known as a single player

1981
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:00,940
experience for the multiplayer component.

1982
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,400
Kind of interesting.

1983
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:07,160
Panaxium responded and said I do enjoy multiplayer as an option but only when the production

1984
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,420
quality is high.

1985
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:10,600
An example is Metroid Prime 2.

1986
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,360
It included multiplayer but it was half-assed and got boring very quickly.

1987
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:19,480
However Prime Hunters was a lot more fun except for the cramping controls but I digress.

1988
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:26,520
In the end I would rather have an amazing single experience than half-baked multiplayer.

1989
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,680
Mike B. responded saying I think it's great as long as it has a co-op story mode.

1990
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,000
It is fun playing through the story with friends.

1991
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,240
I kind of like that whole co-op versus versus too because I think the type of multiplayer

1992
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,360
can really change a lot too.

1993
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,960
I think that's really important to state too.

1994
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:48,580
I think a game like LittleBigPlanet really is enhanced by the multiplayer and that's

1995
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:52,000
one game I didn't really see get brought up here but a game like LittleBigPlanet really

1996
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,560
gets enhanced because it's more of a co-op.

1997
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:01,080
And of course I'm into Mass Effect 3 right now and a lot of that is because it's co-op.

1998
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:06,320
Acidic Vampire brings up Mass Effect and says it isn't necessary especially for established

1999
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,900
single player franchises but sometimes it can be a welcome addition that doesn't take

2000
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,440
away from its campaign.

2001
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,680
Portal 2, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 are just a few examples.

2002
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,340
Those are all really good examples.

2003
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:27,800
Let me read one more from John K. I've never bought a game because multiplayer was included.

2004
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,760
In fact, sometimes attempts to shove multiplayer into a great single player franchise can take

2005
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,620
a lot away from the experience.

2006
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:37,320
For example, the most recent Ratchet and Clank game.

2007
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:41,680
All for One was designed to be four player co-op and the changes to the camera and controls

2008
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,720
to allow for all that but made the game unplayable.

2009
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,880
Even playing as a single player, it was more frustrating than fun.

2010
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,200
So again those are all answers from our Facebook account, facebook.com slash orange lounge

2011
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,200
radio.

2012
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,700
Come thumbs up us over there and you can answer a question in a future week.

2013
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,320
How about you guys here in studio?

2014
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,880
How important is multiplayer to you?

2015
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,880
Not at all.

2016
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,280
I don't really give a crap about it.

2017
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,280
You really go out of your way to avoid it.

2018
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,400
But yet you play an MMO.

2019
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,640
Yeah but you notice what do I do most of the time?

2020
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:15,560
I quest, I play by myself and just chat with people.

2021
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,260
It's the having to play with other people.

2022
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:21,720
Like I like raiding okay because I'm with my guild mates.

2023
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,640
I'm with people that I pretty much know.

2024
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,200
PvP I hate.

2025
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:32,100
I mean I don't really mind doing like the most fun that I have in dungeons is when basically

2026
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:36,480
I've just tagged along with you know with the ones that you've done for like what was

2027
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:42,560
that one that was really fun that you drug me around in your motorcycle for?

2028
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,560
The Isle of Conquest?

2029
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,280
Yeah, Isle of Conquest.

2030
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,560
That was fun because I was playing with you and Alan.

2031
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,560
Yeah.

2032
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,560
That was fun.

2033
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,600
But I I just have this thing about the random stranger thing.

2034
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:57,520
I'm all you know appearances to the contrary I am a bit of an introvert.

2035
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:04,980
You know I I've taught myself how to be outwardly extroverted but really I kind of like to do

2036
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,440
my own thing and stick with the folks I know.

2037
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:13,140
You know so I lost my train of thought.

2038
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:14,140
That's all right.

2039
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:18,240
I'll go ahead and just say I really agree with the answer that said it's best when it

2040
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,760
more enhances a single-player game that's already there especially the the examples

2041
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:27,880
of Portal 2 and Mass Effect 3 I think are two great examples of where multiplayer really

2042
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:32,760
just sweetened the pot for a game that would have already been worth the asking price.

2043
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:36,720
See I would play Portal 2 multiplayer as long as I played with someone I know.

2044
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,720
Right which I think you I don't think you can play Portal 2 with strangers can you?

2045
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:49,720
But it's like now when I used to do PSO fantasy star online you know you could run into people

2046
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,460
just wait looking for groups in random but for the most part I played with my friends

2047
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:57,680
we would lock the room and put stupid passwords on them like butt cheese.

2048
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,840
That was one of our passwords.

2049
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,840
You're so mature.

2050
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,880
All right before I get to Loki's answer let me get to our chat room.

2051
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,240
Some folks talking about Skyrim because you know obviously Skyrim gets brought up as a

2052
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,800
game that didn't need multiplayer to be successful.

2053
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,120
Jim Sally says Skyrim is awesome but it would be twice as good if a co-op mode was added

2054
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,920
and a lot of people have been asking for something like that.

2055
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:22,360
But Shadow Next Gen says I don't know if Skyrim would be good with co-op that game is really

2056
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,360
all about your personal choices.

2057
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,840
Very true.

2058
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,640
Loki lastly with you what how important is multiplayer to you?

2059
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:33,760
It all depends on the game I mean some games I don't really care other games kind of want

2060
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:40,320
it in there like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty or Minecraft I don't know it just

2061
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:48,840
it depends like I don't necessarily need multiplayer for Final Fantasy or something like that.

2062
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,080
Blender brings up a great point in our chat room what about Journey Orange Lounge Radio

2063
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:55,960
and he's not talking about the one from the 80s about the band he's talking about that

2064
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:00,440
new one on PlayStation Network and I gotta say no one's bought it for me yet well I have

2065
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:04,440
it and I've played through it and I gotta say Journey is like on a whole nother level

2066
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:08,840
with the multiplayer it's like a new type of multiplayer experience you can't even really

2067
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:13,520
define don't have to talk to them do you know you never do perfect you that's the beautiful

2068
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,620
thing about Journey they're there and they're with you they can only talk to you through

2069
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:22,360
song through one button that kind of hums a little tune and it's your choice you can

2070
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:26,740
follow this person you can try to work with it and try to develop your own communication

2071
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:32,640
style it which it's it's so crazy like the simplicity of the game and kind of what it's

2072
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,640
done for multiplayer games Journey again if you haven't played it on PlayStation 3 and

2073
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:42,440
you own a PlayStation 3 you really gotta check it out it just it's amazing it was better

2074
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:47,260
when people didn't tell you there was a multiplayer component and I did not even know there was

2075
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:53,280
gonna be multiplayer in it and I was just blown away amazing anyhow that's gonna do

2076
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,520
it for the frugal question of the week thank you to everybody who responded we had a ton

2077
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:00,520
of answers on Facebook I'm so sorry I didn't have time to read all of them but answer us

2078
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:03,840
in a future week and we'll try to get some in you can always get your thoughts through

2079
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:10,080
to our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll read those in a future week for

2080
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:14,420
now we don't have any yeah sadly we didn't get any mail this week so we don't have anything

2081
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:20,480
to read but maybe in a future week for now though let's get to some news Loki all right

2082
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:27,040
so let's talk a little bit about I don't know Activision you may remember that Bungie has

2083
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:33,600
entered into an agreement with them to create this next big franchise and they are they're

2084
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,620
actually right now according to the leaked documents that you know kind of show this

2085
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:46,560
agreement it's for a project called destiny and also you know they're talking about like

2086
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:52,080
some of the expected you know bonuses and stuff based on you know performance and also

2087
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:56,320
saying that you know they're gonna have you know a version of the game is gonna come out

2088
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:04,760
on the Xbox 360 you know also in the fall 2013 and that there's gonna be follow-ups

2089
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:09,720
in multiple years and it's supposed to be a four-part you know four game deal and also

2090
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:17,320
at the end of that they're gonna have the option to fund a new marathon game so that's

2091
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:25,280
kind of neat I mean that's definitely a lot of corporate mumbo-jumbo at least in the leaked

2092
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:30,240
document but it'd be cool to see what this new destiny game supposed to be like a code

2093
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:35,360
name it'll probably be like Halo I'm thinking it will be I was hoping it would be Pimps

2094
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:42,480
at sea but you know unfortunately we can dream but that's not gonna happen but yeah it'll

2095
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:49,200
be pretty cool all right let's go to a story about Diablo 3 because unfortunately Diablo

2096
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:58,160
3 allegedly hacking going on in Diablo 3 right now and a lot of people coming into Diablo

2097
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:05,120
3 remembering Diablo 1 and 2 as a single-player game have no part of this whole authenticator

2098
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:10,520
and ways to protect their account so you know Blizzard's coming in and saying well people

2099
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:16,080
need to be more careful with their account information but apparently and I apparently

2100
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:21,480
it has come through in recent days that there are a small number of accounts that are being

2101
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:26,720
hacked with authenticators on them but it's coming through malware on the user system

2102
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:30,560
and the blue posts that are on the forums are very adamant that yeah we're looking at

2103
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,660
the msinfo files of people that are saying they're getting hacked with an authenticator

2104
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:39,740
and they've got all sorts of malware on the system and that's where it's coming from so

2105
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:43,940
this whole single-player always connected experience is really starting to rub people

2106
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:48,600
the wrong way and this is just the latest feather in that hat like really I did not

2107
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:52,320
want to fucking deal with this and now people are getting hacked and all this shit because

2108
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,880
they don't have an authenticator on their account I mean Blizzard or Diablo 3 had amazing

2109
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,800
sales in their first week but what is the long-term damage this shit is causing we talked

2110
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:06,160
a little more about this on Hoard House this week at www.hoardhouse.com my World of Warcraft

2111
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:11,240
themed spin-off show but to kind of ask here a little bit Loki I think you're a good one

2112
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:16,640
to ask because you're not as sucked into this Warcraft phenomenon as Dark Soccer and I are

2113
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:22,400
what are your thoughts about Diablo 3 being always connected and have they screwed PC

2114
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:28,320
games that might want to explore this in the future with this consistent botched thing

2115
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,480
after another well I never like any always connected games there you know especially

2116
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:36,440
if it's not required if it's not an MMO then what's the point of me having to be always

2117
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:41,000
required you know a connection for this to happen I mean because you know say if I want

2118
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:47,040
to game my laptop doesn't mean I'm gonna have Wi-Fi anywhere you know everywhere I go and

2119
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:51,440
you know that kind of sucks if I can't play my game that I purchased because I don't have

2120
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:58,720
an internet connection at the time I mean I don't know it yeah it's another reason why

2121
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:04,480
I wouldn't get the game I guess other than you know just don't really want to buy the

2122
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:09,720
game burn our chat room asks so it's malware the rumor was it was joining public games

2123
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:16,160
that opens you up to it you know Blizzard is passionately denying those claims as we've

2124
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,340
learned though throughout other parts of the game industry that doesn't necessarily always

2125
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:25,880
mean anything though I would like to think that that they've tested that and it's true

2126
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:29,260
but and just because you have more where I mean because there's a lot of malware out

2127
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:35,560
there but I mean just saying up well we can see that yeah malware on your system is it

2128
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:40,080
the same malware for each thing I mean is it I mean what kind of what exactly is this

2129
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:45,040
malware do is it's like because there's malware that just I go search something on Google

2130
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,560
and also I get transferred to another page that has nothing to do with what I just search

2131
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,480
for it's like another search engine or is it something that's like I'm specifically

2132
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:58,760
putting this malware on your system to steal your information also why can't Blizzard just

2133
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,700
to give extra protection to the accounts very similar to what Star Wars the Old Republic

2134
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:08,440
did you have these personal questions that only you would know the answer to and whenever

2135
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:13,280
Star Wars suspects that you're making a major change or you're doing something weird where

2136
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,000
it might not really be you it asks you to answer three of those questions at random

2137
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:25,160
you know why couldn't they gee you usually play Diablo 3 in Sacramento California all

2138
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:30,000
of a sudden you're trying to log in from China maybe I should ask you a private question

2139
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
that only you would know the answer to because the odds that you were playing in California

2140
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,460
and now you're suddenly playing in China are very very low or here's a thought since we've

2141
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:48,600
you know we've gotten these MS you know these little readouts of what processes you have

2142
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:54,160
running and stuff and we've noticed that there's specific malware you know programs or whatever

2143
01:54:54,160 --> 01:55:01,020
running hey you know you have some sort of device that runs before the program launches

2144
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:05,760
to detect for people using cheat devices and stuff maybe I don't know add these programs

2145
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:11,880
in there so that you know hey you try to launch Diablo and you get this you know pop-up saying

2146
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,360
hey there's more and your system is gonna steal your Diablo identity if you play Diablo

2147
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,440
maybe you should I don't know clear that off or something why don't they have that since

2148
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,960
they could do that very easily oh it's because probably none of that has any information

2149
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:31,560
it's like saying oh well you know you you've got some sort of virus on your computer so

2150
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,920
there must be how that must be how they're hacking your system and seriously most malware

2151
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,760
that you'll find are usually like site trackers that type of thing nothing that's really going

2152
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:49,040
to have anything it's for advertising that's all it is so all right let's hope Blizzard

2153
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:53,080
can patch this shit up I I seriously think they're doing some long-term damage here I

2154
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:57,240
did find a new patch applied last night oh yeah yeah I didn't see what it was for but

2155
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:01,880
they did patch my game last night I think they've been doing as a variety of fixes they

2156
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:05,040
keep pushing back that real money auction house that's the other thing that tells you

2157
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:10,280
there's a problem that was supposed to be Diablo's bread and butter and hasn't happened

2158
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:15,880
so anyhow we were going to move on to the mailbag at this point but I believe when you

2159
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:21,680
check before the show started it was empty right to quote a line from a masterpiece of

2160
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:29,960
a movie which is called Spaceballs we ain't found shit if you I guess some people in chat

2161
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:33,880
are saying they emailed within the past hour or so well check it again you want to check

2162
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:38,480
it again we'll do that we'll do the FUs of the week first so usually the time we do that

2163
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:41,840
oh I was looking was to jump in well I was just gonna jump in with some random stuff

2164
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:48,340
so I figured I'd already logged in we have one I was doing Google searches for information

2165
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:52,500
regarding you know this Xbox jacking stuff it's actually a whole bunch of information

2166
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:59,240
about doxing which is finding up finding out the information on people like their name

2167
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:04,520
city state all the personal information based on some of their stuff and that's how they

2168
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:11,760
steal accounts it's by knowing all your personal information tons of ebooks on it too be careful

2169
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:16,920
who you add on your social networks that's for sure so we have one all right yay we do

2170
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:22,960
have an email after all of course question for the staff what has to be the single most

2171
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:28,440
expensive gaming accessory you have purchased for your gaming console and to read the disclaimer

2172
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:32,640
this email was brought to you by anime jam session the podcast about anime cosplay convention

2173
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:35,800
roasting pop culture and everything in between podcast guaranteed to derail in ten minutes

2174
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:40,740
your money back check us out at www.animajamsession.com that was the cheapest fucking plug I have

2175
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:45,040
ever seen in the history of this show I'm gonna ask a really generic question and then

2176
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:51,040
plug I read it out of my mic mic machines that's all right you know what because we

2177
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:57,360
love anime jam session john machina was great we're gonna allow it yes all right I did buy

2178
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:05,520
my husband steel battalion oh yeah yeah I paid 300 bucks and bought him steel battalion

2179
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:11,980
of course he in return has bought me thousands of dollars of beymani equipment you know we

2180
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:18,800
bought my uh both my dance pads for uh together for 160 for my dreamcast ddr which I think

2181
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:25,400
the game was also about 70 bucks so um but keep in mind if you look at my beymani collection

2182
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:31,280
I've got a pop music controller I have four 2dx controllers now I have two guitar freaks

2183
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:36,940
controllers a key I have a keyboard for keyboard mania I have a drum controller for um drum

2184
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:41,840
mania and then we have all this crap we have for guitar hero so it's really hard to say

2185
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,680
when you look at the whole thing but I think the single most expensive has to be the steel

2186
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:52,240
battalion controller because that was 300 bucks um I would say the most expensive I

2187
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:57,040
know this probably doesn't count for the original question but I fucking bought a Japanese PlayStation

2188
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:01,060
2 just so I could play all those beymani games back in the day so I think I think I get that

2189
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:05,880
one especially you know I bought the controller I bought the ddr mats all to work with the

2190
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:12,120
Japanese we bought a jps2 yeah keyboard I bought I bought fucking keyboard mania okay

2191
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,480
I think I think that qualifies I can tell you what our most expensive game was what

2192
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:22,720
was probably dracula x oh yeah yeah that's right Loki um I bought an arcade cabinet to

2193
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:28,640
put in ddr in never really got around to putting ddr in it though but looking at accessories

2194
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:35,480
on their own what is the most small my rock man stuff because I have you know a hundred

2195
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:42,040
dollar guitar here and drum set and another bass guitar they got specially that's collecting

2196
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:49,040
dust under my desk at work now what was your most expensive system what is the most you've

2197
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:58,040
ever paid for a single video game system my first xbox 360 oh you you dumb bastard you

2198
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:09,080
did pay a lot for that most I paid for a system might be my playstation 3 I think a ps3 was

2199
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:13,520
more expensive than importing the playstation 2 I will second that because keep in mind

2200
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:19,240
when we bought ours we still have our first model ps3 and thanks to discover we got a

2201
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,080
hundred bucks knocked off of it because we got a reward on it so we paid 600 bucks for

2202
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:28,980
our first model ps3 now the one and only bobby blackwolf in our chat room at vog network

2203
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:34,880
dot com said I own a very expensive set of Roland V drums and I just put it on twit pic

2204
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:40,880
so that is that does work with that does but that's not really necessarily an accessory

2205
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,960
okay so then moving forward to it let's because I really like elaborating on this one what's

2206
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:50,720
the most you've ever paid for a game the most I've ever paid for a game um again Japanese

2207
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:58,360
importing probably beat media 2d x6 style I want to say was probably the most expensive

2208
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:02,280
one I got because I got that when it was brand brand new I eventually paid more than a hundred

2209
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:06,360
dollars for a game no I don't think I paid a hundred and twenty dollars for the Sailor

2210
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:12,720
Moon's super s fighting game on Super Famicom actually I take that back add up all the months

2211
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:18,360
of World of Warcraft but I'm saying for the game itself hey Alan's joining us and I think

2212
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:25,240
wants to say something hi Alan so we're talking about more most spent on a game yes sir when

2213
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:30,280
I was there was a year or two where I was importing Japanese games and I only got four

2214
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:34,760
or five of them but I want to say Tobel number two the sequel to the square fighting game

2215
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:41,260
I think I spent close to like 90 95 bucks all told to get that game it also had the

2216
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:48,340
demo on it though for um Final Fantasy 7 wasn't it yeah uh Alan remember when we had disposable

2217
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:53,840
income I know right what about you let me ask my iPad says hi what's the most you've

2218
02:01:53,840 --> 02:02:02,040
ever paid for a game standalone didn't come with anything else Motorstorm apocalypse because

2219
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:07,520
it was a beta or it was a bear yeah you bought that on eBay or something didn't you yeah

2220
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:13,760
yeah so I would know what about people who bought that Capcom met game that was like

2221
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:19,100
200 bucks because they had the whole controller oh still battalion I've got I've no check

2222
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:26,440
this now I have two copies and two controllers you're sick but I mean that would love okay

2223
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:33,680
so no no no no what is the rarest system that you own I love SSG 100 Matt the most I've

2224
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:39,800
ever spent on a game was Yaris for zero points paid way too much for it I agree I'm sorry

2225
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:44,200
the most we ever spent on a what a system what do you think is your most valuable system

2226
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:50,960
that you own in terms of personal value and then in terms of financial value my still

2227
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:57,240
working Super Nintendo in terms of personal value in terms of actual I don't really have

2228
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:05,080
a lot of rare systems I don't really have any old shit that still works the HD DVD player

2229
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:16,000
on my Xbox 360 arcade system for most valuable and for personal value the Xbox of Fame the

2230
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Xbox oh good answer the one that's been autographed by one of the Avengers now yes look at that

2231
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:28,360
so for me and yeah I know I've got the collection and this is unfair but actually I think that

2232
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:35,160
our most I think our most valuable one is our Neo Geo although we do have a turbo duo

2233
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:40,640
but my personal favorite is the turbo duo because no country lockout you can play your

2234
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:46,800
Japanese games no problem unless you get a game that requires the arcade card and then

2235
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:53,620
you have to have a duo RX alright let's talk about how much money we've spent on this sick

2236
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:59,800
obsession here burn the chat room is trying to call me out saying sky had disposable income

2237
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:04,600
that could have gone to improving the show talking about that stinkin power device did

2238
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:10,380
but it's a lot of money into the show hey this iPad I just did the Facebook questions

2271
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,160
of nyquil a couple more stories for you guys then you guys on the skype line at one eight

2272
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:51,560
seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio loki all right so let's

2273
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:56,280
talk once again about more Activision drama this kind of ties in with the whole lawsuit

2274
02:07:56,280 --> 02:08:06,040
between you know the Wesson Zampella versus Activision and just some of the dirty stuff

2275
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:11,000
that went on obviously the first part of the lawsuits been settled but there's still the

2276
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:17,820
whole lawsuit against those people there was this thing that came out called project icebreaker

2277
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:23,260
apparently it was an initiative designed by Activision to secretly scour the computers

2278
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:29,680
of those two individuals for evidence that would support a firing this involved them

2279
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:36,720
attempting to hack into their accounts or their systems also the possibility of faking

2280
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:40,400
a fire drill to get them to leave the building so that someone could go and hack into their

2281
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:48,120
computers just dirty shit I mean seriously I can't believe that they would even I can

2282
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:55,040
believe that they could do that because it's Activision also you know of course some of

2283
02:08:55,040 --> 02:09:00,840
the stuff you know during that's been released is spreadsheets talking about the top 20 and

2284
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:06,140
Finney Ward employees and their salaries and of course Wesson Zampella have made quite

2285
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:14,120
a bit of money apparently they've each you know they were expecting bonuses over six

2286
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:21,200
hundred thousand dollars and supposed to be getting additional losses from you know the

2287
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:27,600
sale of new games for one point four to two point five million dollars that's quite a

2288
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:35,520
bit of money thirteen million dollars in bonuses total for 2010 I was reading some of that

2289
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:39,380
crazy shit on the internet those Activision emails and so forth and it's just it's a scary

2290
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:46,960
inside look to how some of this shit operates it's it's man it's almost evil it is evil

2291
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:56,120
it's not almost evil we know how evil they are when you're asking some for like a lawyer's

2292
02:09:56,120 --> 02:10:02,760
asking somebody to do something illegal and they're you know they're like I don't know

2293
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:07,920
if I'm comfortable with doing that you know it's just ridiculous well let's move from

2294
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:15,200
something evil to just kind of shady it has to do with THQ and I guess they're gonna be

2295
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:19,160
having a June 29 stockholders meeting where they're gonna do what's called a reverse stock

2296
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:24,360
split to avoid a delisting from Nasdaq I guess that's really not shady it's just business

2297
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:29,200
but it's I guess it's sad a tricky way of doing it is it's totally is a little bit like

2298
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:35,120
the shell game they are gonna have some pissed off investors so anyhow apparently what's

2299
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:40,080
gonna happen is that they have to do the stock split to maintain one dollar per share minimum

2300
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:44,840
that Nasdaq requires apparently they're gonna be three options in the process one of three

2301
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:51,080
one of five and one of ten reverse stock split ratios any of these options it means there

2302
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:56,080
are fewer outstanding shares with an increased apparent value per share so for example if

2303
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:01,640
they do a one to three reverse stock split each stockholder will own one stock for every

2304
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:06,800
three that they had prior to the split even though the total value of the company doesn't

2305
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:12,240
change so that sixty one cents that they're currently trading at they do a one of ten

2306
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:16,760
now it's oh it's six dollars ten cents a share but hopefully one share and say I only have

2307
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:22,880
one share instead of ten exactly but they can do that they have happens if you have

2308
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:27,280
like two stock or two share that's how I was gonna say there's a lot of not people to get

2309
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,080
novelty stock you know they just buy one share but then again how many people just buy one

2310
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:36,000
share of thq probably not you got more people to do that shit with like Facebook or Disney

2311
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,940
or you know coca-cola or Pepsi you know what big companies there's there's there's actually

2312
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:46,440
a company out there some website and I hate that I'm giving them free advertising but

2313
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:50,560
whatever it's like buy one share calm or one share calm and they actually do this whole

2314
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:55,400
little stick where they they'll print out a certificate you can frame it you know it's

2315
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:00,080
like a gift-giving thing it's kind of a kind of a neat idea for a gift like imagine it

2316
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:04,640
I think they did a report on some website the other day and it was like if you had bought

2317
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:11,760
a one share of Apple in like 1982 it would be worth a thousand dollars now my mom who

2318
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:17,080
actually worked for Intel for a while you know part of their thing was that each employee

2319
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:23,280
got you know a certain amount of stock well this is way back you know in the seventies

2320
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:28,800
and eighties and stuff and she still has to she found their certificate in the attic the

2321
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,920
other day wow and it's funny as we looked into it and that's split so many times since

2322
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,880
you know that one like one share of stock were around I only think is one shares like

2323
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:43,760
a few shares of stock is like a hundred and fifty shares of stock now it's just like ridiculous

2324
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:51,160
oh wow that's still really cool though yeah like you can sell that you know alright well

2325
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:54,800
now we're going to get to the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to give us

2326
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:59,680
a call right now one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge

2327
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,360
radio give us a call we'll talk about anything we've talked about prior tonight or maybe

2328
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,100
you have something else that you want to bring up again that's one eight seven seven game

2329
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:11,500
olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio I do not have the twitter topics up

2330
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:16,200
yet so maybe loki I know there might be some last minute stories tonight because there

2331
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:20,000
was a lot of stuff we had to cut from tonight's show and it's just it's picking up as we move

2332
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:30,840
towards e3 um I'm sure we've got some stuff here of course I'm not ready as usual um still

2333
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:36,680
looking at those the hacking stuff it's very interesting just I can't believe all the information

2334
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:40,800
that they have out there you know basically telling you use like those like white pages

2335
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:47,080
or reverse searches and stuff like that to find um how people's personal information

2336
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:52,480
um that you know your phone company and stuff collects so you can hack someone's xbox live

2337
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:57,720
account it's ridiculous um let's see here we can talk about uh silicon knights this

2338
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:01,680
is kind of funny silicon knights you know they were um had this lawsuit against epic

2339
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:06,320
because they're saying your engine was too hard to use that's why our game sucked balls

2340
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:16,280
um and apparently they they failed to um provide evidence you know of damages or whatever uh

2341
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:21,360
for their lawsuit and so the um the judge assigned them their own value of a dollar

2342
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:25,600
so if they win their claim they get a dollar a whole dollar a whole dollar you can buy

2343
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,640
a candy bar with that maybe all right we got a call coming in let's go to the phones hi

2344
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:33,440
you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the one person actually sent an email into

2345
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:38,080
the mailbag ron you know what's funny is that the chatters were like no rama doesn't get

2346
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:41,940
through tonight rama does not get to calling because he sent an email but when nobody else

2347
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:48,480
calls you guys i can't help it i have the fastest internet in america to beat everybody

2348
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:53,720
else 99 at a time you're just that awesome what's on your mind tonight rama um my what's

2349
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:57,660
on my mind is a bit of a hardware review which is in conjunction with the email that i sent

2350
02:14:57,660 --> 02:15:02,880
earlier when i was at pax east playing uh at the squirt enix booth they had these nice

2351
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:07,800
headphones and i was playing a theater rhythm with it i was like the music quality is just

2352
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:11,660
phenomenal where did you get it they told me they had it at the astro gaming booth i

2353
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:17,080
checked out their equipment and after thinking about it for all of five seconds i decided

2354
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:21,900
to buy them but not right away i decided to save my money get them for my birthday and

2355
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:30,980
which i did so now i own a pair of astro a30 gaming headsets with a powered mix amp which

2356
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:41,140
is perfect for xbox 360 pc television and cell phone and i have to say audio quality

2357
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:48,220
is quite phenomenal compared to what i was used to listening to sorry we just we i'm

2358
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:51,880
yelling with the chatters because apparently we had a drop but i'm showing that we've we

2359
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:58,340
didn't usually if we drop we show that our scent information drops way down but i don't

2360
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:02,700
see that so whatever no they're just saying it because i'm on the phone they're just like

2361
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:07,540
drop the stream so i get off the phone no haters gonna hate the timer reset to one minute

2362
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:11,020
30 seconds so maybe there was a hiccup but that's weird because usually that number resets

2363
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:17,220
anyway podcast listeners don't care about this so exactly the hardware so how how expensive

2364
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:24,940
is this thing supposed to be okay the headset itself is 129 dollars the mix amp is 99 but

2365
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:34,180
you can get it as a bundle for 199 dollars is it worth it if you're an audiophile i say

2366
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:42,380
yes but if you're looking to change your normal headphones for your cell phone or mp3 player

2367
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:46,820
if you're looking for something a bit of a change like for mobile gaming i would definitely

2368
02:16:46,820 --> 02:16:54,100
go with the headset stand alone the mix amp like i said gives better audio quality i mean

2369
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:59,540
one of the songs i actually tested to see how well the clarity of the music is was low-keys

2370
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:04,220
uh verbalicious remix which is one of my personal now here's the thing though are those um headphones

2371
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:07,980
surround sound headphones or are they just standard headphones the headphones itself

2372
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:15,060
are standard you get the surround sound 7.1 with the mix amp i have those kind of headsets

2373
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:18,380
i like the headset with the surround sound built-in it's kind of fun yeah i've got a

2374
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:24,580
pair at home but i i paid a lot less than 200 for them yeah me too uh because they're

2375
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:28,180
i don't they weren't turtle beach i don't remember how i got their tritons the ones

2376

2388
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:46,540
on pokemon plushies pokeballs and why is that is it and you know i was thinking that this

2389
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:51,520
call was going to go in the direction of because you live in mexico and not every company releases

2390
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:55,580
their products officially in mexico sometimes you have to pay these crazy ass import fees

2391
02:18:55,580 --> 02:19:02,780
and is is it kind of along the same lines for pokemon well most of the time uh since

2392
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:08,700
a friend helped me uh get get most of the stuff i uh i get from the united states so

2393
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:17,780
i very important so i i pretty much pay what you would pay uh for something like that but

2394
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:23,900
it's still a pretty expensive uh little hobby if you want if you want to call it like that

2395
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:28,020
how often do you because you don't live that far from the u.s border right you're about

2397
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:39,700

2398
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:48,700
into uh the states to pick up what you want well uh unfortunately i can't right now because

2399
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:55,100
i don't have a passport or a visa oh so i cannot cross the border but i used to and

2400
02:19:55,100 --> 02:20:03,400
uh well depends on how much traffic is there it usually it can take up to an hour to cross

2401
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:09,280
the border and pretty much go to the to the to the next town there's a game stop uh there's

2402
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:16,620
a mall too and there's a best buy and there's pretty much uh uh well very uh renowned stores

2403
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:22,120
uh to go and buy stuff and so it's not that difficult and please tell me you live in one

2404
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:25,840
of those parts of mexico i'm not seeing on the news like you live in one of the safer

2411
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:06,620

2413
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:16,060

2427
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:42,820
by that news i was so sad i mean granted i know honestly i'd go ahead there was a death

2428
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:53,620
i was more saddened by robin gibb no no bg's no um by uh adam yelch uh mca yeah that that

2429
02:22:53,620 --> 02:22:58,340
was because he was young too well it's not just you know that he was famous it was all

2430
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:04,620
the good stuff he was doing and just how absolutely brilliant of a person he was that big chorizo

2431
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:11,340
fan so donna summer you know and i know there's been a lot of stuff said about her and some

2432
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:15,220
of her relationship with the gay community in the past but you know a lot of that was

2433
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:19,060
in the past and sometimes the media likes to take things and run with it so you know

2434
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:25,000
what i think donna summer was a pretty okay lady and and she had a lot of wonderful wonderful

2435
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:32,900
songs and and it's just me or did she stay gorgeous yes she did she sure did so you know

2436
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:40,040

2437
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:45,500
right now so let's go to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this chugga chugga chugga

2438
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:53,100
choo choo you sexy people it's jib sally hey your trains your trains behind schedule you're

2439
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:57,780
usually on the bobby blackpool show but you're delayed three hours tonight i got delayed

2440
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:02,320
i went on the wrong side of the tracks well you know we we've been saying for a few weeks

2441
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:07,660
now that you know we made a left turn at alberkirky and other folks we used to work with made

2442
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:11,420
a right so i was thinking maybe you just maybe you just made the wrong turn at alberkirky

2443
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:15,980
listen you can't you can't make any can't do anything right when you're doing it in

2444
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:23,020
alberkirky that's very true that's very true so what's up jim listen we were talking we

2445
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:28,380
talked earlier about putting multiplayer and things in different games it needs to be in

2446
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:32,460
skyrim i'm playing this stupid game a lot and lately and i i wish there was like every

2447
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:37,260
night again i'd roll up to somebody like me that was uber powerful and could kill everything

2448
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:43,100
and it had way too much money well what do you think about the whole elder scrolls online

2449
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:46,300
we were talking about that either last week or the week before you know i guess that's

2450
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:50,780
trying to appease some of these people who want their multiplayer uh elder scrolls is

2451
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:54,940
that enough for you i think it would be great if it was just little missions like go out

2452
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:58,600
and hunt a criminal like if i do a lot of bad stuff in the town maybe that town can

2453
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:03,100
just pay another player to come chase me and good luck because you ain't gonna kill jim

2454
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:07,860
sally in this game i'm stupid powerful do you find when you're playing these games like

2455
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:12,840
i'm an accountant so i'm very good with numbers and maximizing productivity i find i just

2456
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:18,300
overpower everything in the game it's it's pretty insane right now i i wonder if um

2457
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:22,820
there'll be some type of how do you play skyrim on the pc or do you play on console um i played

2458
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:30,020
on the console because consoles are better and and um i'm better so that's why i played

2459
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:33,620
on the console i gotta say though that might end up being the problem and what keeps you

2460
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:37,660
from multiplayer because i seem to remember on pc now granted i play on the console too

2461
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:40,940
and i play on the playstation 3 which most people say is the worst way to play it but

2462
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:47,580
i don't care um the thing is is that on the pc that game gets modded and even oblivion

2463
02:25:47,580 --> 02:25:52,940
ended up having a multiplayer mod in it at some point so i don't i i would firmly believe

2464
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:59,020
there's going to be some type of unofficial multiplayer mod for skyrim eventually yeah

2465
02:25:59,020 --> 02:26:03,540
but i'm never gonna see it on the console that's true that's when they when they did

2466
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:07,580
it on the on the pc it was janky like someone would pause the game and then my game would

2467
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:10,700
just not work i'd have to sit there and wait for two minutes while the guy plays with his

2468
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:14,700
menus and then i would get the pause and he'd have to wait for two minutes while i play

2469
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:20,220
with my menus they need like oblivion needs to do it oblivion sorry bethesda needs to

2470
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:25,860
do it right well you know it's anything's possible we don't know much about these expansions

2471
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:29,260
that are supposed to be coming to skyrim i imagine an e3 will finally hear about this

2472
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:34,380
first expansion that's coming to skyrim um but since they haven't been releasing them

2473
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:38,780
with the frequency that they did for oblivion you know these packs are going to be huge

2474
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:42,320
so i would say nothing's off the table maybe we're going to get multiplayer in an expansion

2475
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:47,040
pack but i kind of don't think they're going to cannibalize from elder scrolls online i

2476
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:51,060
kind of think it's skyrim is going to stay single player and they're going to really

2477
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:55,540
try to push you to pay that monthly fee if you want to take it multiplayer so it's about

2478
02:26:55,540 --> 02:27:00,620
time that they just let obsidian do it for them they make the best sequels to games perfectly

2479
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:04,500
solid and stable they should just let obsidian make it they've done it with follow let them

2480
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:09,680
do it with oblivion well i i hope they're listening to your suggestion but sadly they

2481
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:14,060
probably aren't all right you got that right all right well jim anything else you want

2482
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:19,420
to share with us tonight also yeah i play way too much of that walking dead game that

2483
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:25,180
the last caller just called about hey people are loving it oh my god the one you you know

2484
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:29,180
what brother i'm going to tell you this right now the only the hardest part about the zombie

2485
02:27:29,180 --> 02:27:37,060
apocalypse we'll be pretending i'm not excited oh my god kim sally's getting ready i'm getting

2486
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:43,220
ready well i i i will pass the word along to my friend at telltale because they're very

2487
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:47,180
proud of that game and they should be and you know before we were talking about minecrafts

2488
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:52,300
you know record-breaking figures uh walking dead was doing very well for itself on xbox

2489
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:57,220
live arcade so uh i i think that's some really good news you know because there's a lot of

2490
02:27:57,220 --> 02:28:01,020
people that think adventure games are like a niche thing you know and yeah telltale's

2491
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:05,380
filling that niche very well but walking dead's really kind of broken a mainstream forum and

2492
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:10,260
i'm happy for him and for adventure game fans everywhere really you got that right but anyway

2493
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:13,720
brother i gotta take off but i was probably with people i want to call in all right so

2494
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:18,660
i just want to say everybody that if you go to bed and you don't think about zombies coming

2495
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:26,040
then maybe you're not scared enough or too scared something to ponder in bed tonight

2496
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:33,500
oh jim hung up there you go i like it when he calls us i like it when he calls bobby

2497
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:37,940
too but you know it's okay if he misses that train and calls us once in a while too do

2510
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:38,740
um shoot mania which was part of this mania planet series you may remember them from track

2511
02:29:38,740 --> 02:29:48,060
mania um shoot mania is their um fps editor and it also is a game um shoot mania storm

2512
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:52,000
is the first thing they have right now that's in beta and they actually have the registration

2513
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,900
open for that uh you can check it out but um it looks pretty cool and you can basically

2514
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:01,780
create your own fps game with this and they've got all the tools to make i think it's an

2515
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:06,720

2526
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:04,620
indie game the movie will be steam's first full-length film release i had no idea steam

2527
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:08,420
was looking into doing this but apparently steam is going to start giving out movies

2528
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,700
that's right the 1080p video will be drm'd as much as any other steam product or game

2529
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:17,380
for those of you that were worried about that um so you will have to have the steam client

2530
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:22,500
in order to watch it but you can pre-order the movie on steam for $8.99 that includes

2531
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:28,040
a 10 discount until june 12th when the movie's coming out so this is a new area for steam

2532
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:33,380
now they're gonna take on itunes hey by the way huh you know what else is um on that uh

2533
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:39,480
sale on steam since you mentioned it what's that psychonauts five bucks five bucks guess

2534
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:44,980
who's buying it and not buying minecraft you know what though it's pretty hard psychonauts

2535
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:50,560
is a good choice even even the most hardcore of minecraft fan would be hard to argue with

2536
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:56,100
you there um i'm trying to load up this other story from tiger claw but our internet's being

2537
02:31:56,100 --> 02:32:01,260
a little wonky but it's titled a video game designed to help doctors to recognize drug

2538
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:07,060
abuse what the hell would that game be but it's not loading because the website is being

2539
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:12,160
wonky let me try one more time here there it goes um let's see it's probably heroine

2540
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:18,180
hero or heroine hero where you have to chase the chase the giant sword it's using the same

2541
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:24,820
technology used to train fbi agents in interrogation tactics a combination of self-disclosure and

2542
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:30,100
non-verbal cues the game uses an actor's voice to stimulate a hypothetical conversation with

2543
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:35,340
a patient seeking for example pain relievers the program generates responses based on the

2544
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:40,300
doctor's questions and the doctor must identify indicators of possible addiction or abuse

2545
02:32:40,300 --> 02:32:44,560
based on the simulated patient appearing on screen before them so this is something where

2546
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:49,660
you're the doctor you're trying to recognize a patient that's asking for a drug who might

2547
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:56,160
be addicted to them this sounds like la noir you're looking for those hidden cues to let

2548
02:32:56,160 --> 02:33:01,380
you know if there's a problem or not that's kind of weird in a way but but neat i guess

2549
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:06,360
that you know video games are being used out there in the real world that's going to do
