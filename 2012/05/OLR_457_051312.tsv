27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 457 of our show for this May the 13th of 2012.
46000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.
53000	58000	Say hello first off to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
58000	60000	Hi world.
60000	61000	How are you doing?
61000	62000	I'm alright.
62000	64000	You sound a little better than last week, but not much.
64000	67000	No, it's still the allergies. I'm feeling a lot better.
67000	74000	We're sickly lounge radio tonight because actually, I don't know if you can really hear it, but I'm getting over what was a really bad, like, throaty cold.
74000	76000	Don't get me sick before I go to Disneyland.
76000	86000	Well, I'm hoping I'm way past that point because I was sick like Thursday, and if Alan didn't get sick, I don't think you guys are getting sick.
86000	88000	I have a sore throat.
88000	89000	Do you really?
89000	90000	I'll make you pay me in coffee.
90000	93000	Well, then maybe you did get sick from me a week ago somehow.
93000	98000	Well, then I don't know if I was sick or if it was allergies. I felt just fine.
98000	101000	Something's going around, I don't know, but yeah, I had a really bad sore throat.
101000	111000	It was bad because I was trying to, well, usually on Warcraft on Thursdays and Fridays, I lead the raid, which basically means, you know, well, I mean, like, I just, I make it sound bigger than it is.
111000	118000	I basically am sitting there calling, you know, hold DPS, alright, attack the tentacle in the upper left, you know, or whatever it is.
118000	120000	But this week, I couldn't do it.
120000	124000	I was like, Shane, you're going to need to do it because it happened this week because I sounded like this.
124000	128000	I sounded like a little boy because my throat hurts so much.
128000	136000	But thankfully, my voice is okay tonight and I can do a show for all you people out there listening to us on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.
136000	142000	I need to introduce, of course, the third host on our show, always here every week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
142000	143000	Hello.
143000	144000	How are you, Loki?
144000	145000	I'm fine.
145000	147000	Apparently, you're getting sick too. That's no good.
147000	148000	Yeah.
148000	149000	These things happen.
149000	150000	Yeah. Alright.
150000	164000	Also, of course, we do tape live on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our good pal Bobby Black Wolf over at the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
164000	169000	I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the gamer mommies out there that listen.
169000	173000	I don't know of too many for sure. I know of one, at least, that usually listens live.
173000	175000	Maybe one other.
175000	184000	But, you know, even if you're not necessarily a gaming mom, you might be a mom figure in somebody else's life or maybe a mommy to your pets.
184000	188000	So, happy Mother's Day to all who that saying would apply to.
188000	195000	However, for all of you whose girl bits work, ugh.
195000	198000	Are you having an unhappy Mother's Day right now?
198000	213000	I've been having a funk because, and, you know, I've been, Dan and I have been trying for like the last six years and I've been trying not to get excited every time I've had a little thing happen, but I've gotten excited and I've gotten super depressed.
213000	214000	I'm sure.
214000	217000	So, I just wanted everyone to shut up.
217000	219000	Well, I understand where you get like really-
219000	233000	It also creeps me the fuck out when people use pictures of their children as their Facebook icons. I understand being proud of your child, but living through your child and using your child as your avatar is creepy as fuck.
233000	238000	Well, you might change an awful lot once you go through that experience.
238000	242000	I really don't think so. I've never used a picture of Shermie as my icon.
242000	244000	You should. Shermie's adorable.
244000	248000	She is adorable, but anytime I've ever used a picture of Shermie, I've been in it.
248000	256000	I have an icon of Shermie on my LiveJournal where I have icons of me and a lot of other people from fandoms.
256000	259000	And it's the picture of Shermie sitting in Mel B's lap.
259000	262000	This says another lap dominated by Shermie.
262000	267000	Well, we'll see. I'll keep this recording and someday it'll happen for you.
267000	272000	You know, remember, true story, my mom and dad didn't get knocked up till my mom was 37.
272000	273000	She finally had me.
273000	274000	In a row?
274000	276000	Yes, in a row. She finally had me at 37.
276000	281000	However, Julian has turned five and I have to tell you the funny Mother's Day story from yesterday.
281000	283000	Sure, go ahead. Then we can talk about games.
283000	290000	Okay. I was at Becky's house and Julian runs in from the garage all excited and he hops up in Becky's lap.
290000	296000	He says, Mommy, Mommy, we got you flowers, but it's a surprise.
296000	299000	And we started laughing so hard.
299000	301000	Well, it's the kind of flowers.
301000	303000	You can't see it yet because it's a surprise.
303000	308000	And she's like, just know when it's a surprise, you're not supposed to tell me about it.
308000	312000	Oh, the look on his face was funny.
312000	315000	He's like, oh, you didn't know what kind of flowers.
315000	316000	That was the surprise.
316000	319000	It was just funny because he's like, I can't show you.
319000	321000	This is a surprise.
321000	324000	And just the way he said it, it was so cute.
324000	326000	But yeah, that's my Julian story of the week.
326000	330000	All right. Going to our chat room at vognetwork.com is where the chat room is.
330000	334000	Or if you're on the Game Surge Network, join us in channel VOG, V-O-G, voice of geeks.
334000	339000	Raginator says, Shermie and Mel B's lap, the one chick from the Spice Girls?
339000	340000	No.
340000	341000	No.
341000	344000	He's our own Mel B of...
344000	346000	DDR infamy from back in the day.
346000	348000	He used to do freestyle tournaments and all this stuff.
348000	349000	And now he's a kick ass DJ.
349000	350000	That's right, he's DJ now.
350000	353000	Didn't he spin at Fauna Mae last year? Isn't he doing it this year?
353000	354000	I think he's doing it this year too.
354000	355000	Yeah.
355000	359000	We really need to do, you know, for our 10 year anniversary things
359000	361000	since we really have no ideas.
361000	364000	I would really like to do some type of where are they now
364000	368000	where we really catch up with a lot of the old people from back in the DDR day just to say hey.
368000	374000	I know at least three of the girls are mothers.
374000	378000	Although I have to say one of them, you remember Renee?
378000	379000	Oh yeah.
379000	384000	She told me to have a happy Mother's Day because I take care of other people.
384000	385000	That's very nice.
385000	386000	That's good.
386000	387000	So that made me feel better.
387000	392000	I talked to my mommy and my mommy was like, I was like, so what are you doing for Mother's Day?
392000	393000	Laundry?
393000	396000	Well, if you think about it, not only are you a mother to Shermie,
396000	402000	but you're sort of a godmother to Maruko and Sanrio, our cats, because they have two daddies.
402000	405000	So you're like the womanly influence in their life.
405000	408000	I do get the cuddles from your little prissy dude.
408000	412000	He is kind of a prissy cat with his tail in the air all the time.
412000	414000	It's like, look at my butt.
414000	418000	Going to more comments from our chat room, Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, for Mother's Day,
418000	421000	you should show your mom a violent video game just to see how she reacts.
421000	423000	We already did that like six months ago.
423000	425000	I showed her the new Mortal Kombat game.
425000	426000	It was hilarious.
426000	427000	What episode number was that?
427000	428000	You taped her reaction.
428000	429000	I did.
429000	433000	It's actually on video, but she said she would disown me if I put the video up.
433000	436000	So I could only play the audio of it for you guys.
436000	438000	Rob, what is this?
438000	443000	Actually, the next thing I want to show her, I want to show her the love scene from Mass Effect 3.
443000	448000	Either the dude on dude or the female on female to get a reaction.
448000	450000	I want to get my mom.
450000	453000	Keep in mind, my mom used to play Super Mario Brothers with me back in the day.
453000	454000	There you go.
454000	458000	When I go back to Alabama, I need to get a video of mom today playing Super Mario Brothers.
458000	459000	There you go.
459000	462000	She could probably still do 1-1 blindfolded.
462000	463000	No, no, no.
463000	465000	That was 8-1 that you had to do blindfolded.
465000	466000	Oh, I'm sorry.
466000	469000	Because it had the same timing every time you freaking did it.
469000	473000	DJ Morpheus from Under Sedation Live, which is on the VOG Network,
473000	476000	Saturday nights at a new time, 7 Pacific, says,
476000	481000	With Rob's voice cracking periodically, it's like being in a time machine and hearing him go through puberty.
481000	484000	You shut up. I'm sick.
484000	488000	I'm sick and I'm showing up for this show anyway because I love you guys.
488000	489000	Shut your whore mouth.
489000	491000	That's right. Shut your whore mouth.
491000	493000	Hey, video games.
493000	497000	We'll get to our gaming weeks in just a moment, but I thought a couple kickoff topics tonight.
497000	499000	Oh, my God. That's so cute.
499000	501000	What? Something else to distract us now?
501000	506000	No. It was Tiger Koplos did a picture of him with his old TV.
506000	508000	I had a TV like that.
508000	509000	I want to see.
509000	512000	It has UHF channels and rabid ears.
512000	517000	Oh, God. I used to have a TV like that in my bedroom because that was like the ultimate hand-me-down TV.
517000	522000	Since it is a radio show, this is the kind of TV that has the two knobs.
522000	523000	Shit.
523000	524000	Knobs. It had knobs.
524000	527000	I know. I know. But I'm just realizing as I'm saying this out loud.
527000	531000	You know, any teenager listening to this show has absolutely no idea what we're talking about.
531000	533000	And it had a contrast twisty dial.
533000	535000	Maybe you've seen these at a thrift store.
535000	540000	I saw a Blu-ray player at a thrift store, Rob.
540000	544000	I can only imagine that this description should be started with back in my day.
544000	551000	I know. Well, a TV like that, the funny thing is a TV like that wouldn't even work anymore after the whole digital conversion.
551000	553000	However, I'm looking for one.
553000	555000	For a reason.
555000	556000	Why?
556000	557000	Play my Odyssey 2.
557000	559000	Go to a thrift store. I'm sure you'd find them.
559000	561000	I haven't seen them at a thrift store.
561000	564000	Really? You need to go to like, you know where you need to go?
564000	565000	Just need an RF adapter.
565000	568000	You need to go to Deseret, the Mormon frickin'...
568000	570000	I do not like giving the Mormons my money.
570000	573000	I know, but I'll tell you what. They've got everything.
573000	575000	I used to buy old comics there, though.
575000	580000	I almost bought, for Rocky Horror, in my defense it was for Rocky Horror and I don't want to hear it.
580000	584000	I almost bought a wedding dress at Deseret.
584000	587000	I've been with Jessica a number of times getting stuff for clubbing.
587000	588000	Yeah? Good times.
588000	592000	Because you can get lots of fun. I've actually bought cosplay stuff there to modify.
592000	593000	There you go.
593000	594000	I bought...
594000	595000	The Mormons aren't all bad.
595000	598000	I bought some... actually, you know what the last thing I bought there was?
598000	599000	What?
599000	605000	Was my copy of Rubber Soul. The Beatles Rubber Soul. On vinyl. Five bucks.
605000	611000	This other place I went to had a really shitty copy and one of 54. And I was like, nah, I'll buy it for the Mormons.
611000	616000	Alright, I was going to spend some time talking about some pre-E3 lulz and stuff, but you know what?
616000	619000	I just... I don't think we're going to be able to keep the topic on gaming.
619000	620000	Sure we can. I can do that.
620000	621000	What?
621000	623000	I can keep the topic on gaming.
623000	624000	Alright.
624000	626000	So let's talk about pre-E3 stuff.
626000	629000	Let's talk about pre-E3 stuff. What did you want to bring up?
629000	634000	I don't know. There's a lot of big announcements I'm expecting at E3, so...
634000	638000	Alright, is it time to make our E3 predictions now that we're talking?
638000	643000	You know, we know that the press dates have been set and some of them you'll be able to watch live,
643000	646000	and some of them will only be online or what have you.
646000	649000	Okay, what are we going to see from Nintendo this year? This is the easy one.
649000	652000	What are we going to see from Nintendo this year at their conference?
652000	655000	The Game Boy Micro 2.
655000	658000	I still have my Micro, so STFU.
658000	662000	They're just going to plain say, fuck it, we ain't releasing the Wii U, you bastards.
662000	665000	I'm sure we'll see the Wii U.
665000	668000	I just can't get excited about it, though.
668000	671000	I mean, I don't know.
671000	677000	I don't think there's anything that they can put out for it at launch that's going to make me excited about the Wii U.
677000	680000	Save Excite Truck 2.
680000	685000	In which case, that will be a tough, tough day.
685000	690000	But they're not going to announce a date. They're not going to announce a price.
690000	692000	It's like...
692000	694000	It's like the Wii all over again or something.
694000	697000	That's right, they did come out and say, no date, no price at E3, right?
697000	700000	It's like, thanks! No information.
700000	705000	Oh, by the way, we're not going to show you any games either, because, you know...
705000	708000	Alright, so Nintendo, easy.
708000	714000	It's going to be all about the Wii U with a little bit thrown at the 3DS.
714000	717000	What if it gets delayed?
717000	719000	You really think that's possible at this point?
719000	721000	PS3 got delayed.
721000	723000	I don't think so.
723000	725000	They can't afford to delay it.
725000	730000	Nintendo already is going down the downward turn with their investors and everything.
730000	734000	If they don't put out the Wii U, you're going to see Mario on the iPhone.
734000	738000	They're going to have to give in to the investors, and that's what the investors want.
738000	742000	They want Nintendo to develop for the iPhone.
742000	744000	So if the Wii U gets delayed...
744000	750000	That's the day that Miyamoto will bind his knees and commit seppuku on the roof of the Nintendo building.
750000	753000	Honestly? Yes.
753000	755000	And then they would sell his head on eBay.
755000	757000	The Wii U's coming, whether it's ready or not.
757000	760000	I hear Foxconn has a nice roof that he can jump off of.
760000	762000	Stop it. Inappropriate.
762000	766000	I think Miyamoto has a little more self-respect than that. I think it would be ritual suicide.
766000	769000	You know, the last one in Japan happened in 1978.
769000	772000	You all are being so morbid and gross and tacky.
772000	775000	I have to read from chatroom, Rob, since you're ignoring it.
775000	778000	I'm not ignoring them. What do you want to read from chat?
778000	781000	I just lost it because you were busy jabbering.
781000	784000	Oh yeah, um...
784000	787000	Great, now I forgot it. Oh well.
787000	792000	I can't find them anymore. This is why I usually read chat.
792000	795000	We have this awesome comment from our chatroom, and...
795000	797000	Oh, it scrolled away. Where'd it go?
797000	799000	I'm trying to find it.
799000	802000	Someone said, back in my day, we... Oh no, it was one-night stands.
802000	804000	Back in my day, we had to blow in our cartridges.
804000	808000	But my retort was, back in my day, my computers used cassette tapes.
808000	810000	Because you're old. All right, um...
810000	817000	You're old, too! Who was it we were talking about needed hearing aid today, Mr. Rob?
817000	822000	All right, look. 3DS. Anything exciting going to happen on the 3DS at E3?
822000	827000	All they're going to show is, they're going to show New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the 3DS,
827000	833000	which is like, yay, New Super Mario Brothers!
833000	838000	I mean, it's a good game, and they're just making more levels for it,
838000	841000	which I've said in the past they should do for the first one,
841000	845000	you know, and open it up so everyone else can make levels, but then they won't do that.
845000	850000	Um, I mean, what are they going to really have for...
850000	852000	It's not going to be Smash Brothers.
852000	856000	They may announce Smash Brothers, because it could be years away before it actually comes out,
856000	858000	but that's not beyond intended to do that.
858000	860000	I mean, hell, when did they announce Pikmin?
860000	862000	Well, like a couple of years ago.
862000	864000	So, I'm not surprised there.
864000	869000	Um, probably Animal Crossing will be the holiday game, which is kind of...
869000	871000	You know...
871000	873000	Yay!
873000	874000	I want to play it.
874000	877000	He may do Luigi's Mansion 2, but eh.
877000	881000	It's kind of been long enough for me since I really got into an Animal Crossing game
881000	884000	that I could be convinced, because I really just passed on the Wii one,
884000	887000	I really could be convinced to play Animal Crossing 3DS.
887000	889000	I would be pretty easily convinced.
889000	891000	Like, it's really a peer pressure thing for me.
891000	893000	If all my friends do it, I will do it too.
893000	895000	You know what?
895000	897000	I found my copy of Doubutsu no Mori.
897000	898000	Really?
898000	900000	And I was like, I should play this.
900000	903000	And then I was trying to remember why I stopped playing it to begin with.
903000	908000	Because I don't read Kana as well as I thought I did.
908000	911000	This game's hard when you don't natively speak the language.
911000	914000	I mean, there's not a lot that I can be excited about.
914000	918000	Especially if we're talking about this system's going to be
918000	924000	basically like an Xbox 360 with the tablet controller and the Wii controls.
924000	926000	I don't know.
926000	928000	It doesn't seem very exciting to me.
928000	930000	They're going to have...
930000	932000	Probably the same stuff that you saw in the tech demos
932000	934000	are probably going to become full-fledged games,
934000	937000	because that's what they did with the Wii.
937000	939000	Oh, these are only tech demos?
939000	940000	Wii Sports.
940000	942000	You know, Wii Sports Resort.
942000	944000	It was just all the same shit.
944000	948000	So you'll probably see some sort of compilation that's going to be packed in,
948000	951000	like a packing game or something that's going to be like Wii Sports.
951000	954000	I don't know, Wii U Sports or whatever they're going to call it.
954000	956000	And that'll be that.
956000	960000	But I'm kind of interested to see how it's going to work with, like,
960000	964000	you know, especially first-person shooters and stuff,
964000	966000	that tablet control is cool.
966000	970000	But what if, like, say, I want to have more than just one person
970000	972000	playing a first-person shooter, you know,
972000	974000	were we going to be on the classic controllers now?
974000	976000	I mean, that might not even be that great,
976000	978000	because their controllers are kind of lacking
978000	980000	compared to some of the other systems.
980000	982000	It's going to be hard to port that stuff over,
982000	984000	but I don't know.
984000	986000	I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they show.
986000	988000	All right, let's move on so we don't spend all show
988000	991000	on these predictions weeks before the show happens.
991000	993000	How about Microsoft?
993000	995000	I said on Bobby's show a minute ago
995000	998000	that I think Microsoft is hedging all their bets on Halo 4.
998000	1000000	The Halo 4 is going to be the centerpiece
1000000	1002000	of that presentation at the very end,
1002000	1004000	and that's really all the Xbox has going for it right now.
1004000	1006000	No one's going to care.
1006000	1008000	I don't think I'd be that cynical about it.
1008000	1011000	Well, first party, they're going to have the new Forza game.
1011000	1015000	They're going to have Halo 4, the new Fable game.
1015000	1018000	They're going to be talking about exclusive DLC
1018000	1020000	for existing properties like Skyrim.
1020000	1024000	They're going to have exclusive DLC for it.
1024000	1026000	They're going to talk black ops 2 because I'm assuming
1026000	1028000	they're going to continue on with them having the DLC
1028000	1031000	slightly earlier before everybody else.
1031000	1033000	There's the rumors that they're going to be doing
1033000	1037000	some sort of extended peripherals for some exercise games
1037000	1040000	to kind of tie those all together, that kind of stuff.
1040000	1043000	Maybe the web browser thing.
1043000	1047000	You may be talking about some more revisions to the...
1047000	1050000	Please don't make any more revisions to the goddamn dashboard, okay?
1050000	1052000	It's already Windows 8 enough.
1052000	1056000	I mean, so... I don't know.
1056000	1059000	I'm wondering if they won't slip in some things about Windows 8
1059000	1062000	and kind of maybe how it might interact with the Xbox.
1062000	1065000	Maybe some type of enhanced media center or something?
1065000	1067000	I mean, big question mark there, but...
1067000	1069000	I don't think that's really necessary anymore
1069000	1071000	because a lot of the people they have now,
1071000	1074000	it's tied in with all these different streaming services.
1074000	1076000	You don't really need to stream from your PC anymore
1076000	1078000	to stream Netflix and stuff
1078000	1080000	because you can do it through their apps.
1080000	1083000	So they may talk about more partnerships with that kind of stuff.
1083000	1088000	Another perfect one is the Kinect-enabled children's programming stuff
1088000	1091000	that they were going to be doing for National Geographic and Sesame Street.
1091000	1094000	That might be something to push Kinect because that was kind of neat.
1094000	1098000	So you think it'll be a lot of these really weird outside-the-box things like that
1098000	1100000	that you're talking about that we're going to see from Microsoft?
1100000	1101000	I'm thinking, yeah.
1101000	1105000	Here's how the device does this, and here's how the device makes waffles.
1105000	1110000	Maybe they're going to talk about new properties.
1110000	1114000	It would be nice if they made a new franchise or something like that.
1114000	1116000	Hell, Nintendo, make a new franchise.
1116000	1118000	That would be kind of cool.
1120000	1122000	I would love it if they would kick off a new franchise.
1122000	1123000	We'll see.
1123000	1125000	Maybe they'll bring Milo back from the dead, LOL.
1125000	1126000	Okay, Sony.
1126000	1128000	Sony's a huge what?
1128000	1129000	What do you want to say, Dark Soccer?
1129000	1130000	Nothing.
1130000	1132000	It's a thought that when it came back into my head,
1132000	1134000	I thought that's actually going to be kind of stupid.
1134000	1136000	What? Now I really want to hear it.
1136000	1141000	Taking old, kind of obscure NES games and making them into full-on new properties.
1141000	1142000	That won't happen.
1142000	1144000	Like Milan's Secret Castle.
1144000	1145000	Not on the Xbox.
1145000	1147000	Well, no, I'm talking...
1147000	1149000	You said Nintendo needs a new...
1149000	1152000	Sure, Nintendo. Any of them could use the new one. Why not?
1152000	1154000	New IPs rock.
1154000	1158000	Well, maybe that's, you know, with all this retro gaming thing that's been going on,
1158000	1161000	maybe what they need to do is look at the old stuff
1161000	1164000	and bring it screaming into the modern...
1164000	1167000	Yeah, but some of it hasn't worked out too well. Look at Bionic Commando.
1167000	1168000	Oh, yeah, but that was shit.
1168000	1171000	Well, that worked out well for the Xbox Live Arcade games.
1171000	1176000	That's true. The best Bionic Commando were the remade games. Yeah, yeah.
1176000	1180000	Which is ironic because they're by the same people, but...
1180000	1185000	The other thing, the IPTV stuff, the web TV thing that they're maybe going to be doing,
1185000	1189000	their own TV network type thing, that might be interesting.
1189000	1192000	I would bet you anything that's where Major's Minute goes.
1192000	1194000	Some sort of new show.
1194000	1195000	Interesting.
1195000	1198000	To get rid of the old show, to make way for the new show.
1198000	1201000	Alright, let's quickly talk Sony real quick, because Sony's kind of a wild card.
1201000	1205000	I mean, obviously, they're going to be pushing Vita, but we're not going to really see...
1205000	1209000	You know, there's not going to be any peripherals that we can think of that would come out from Sony.
1209000	1211000	Like, there's nothing that they're pushing there.
1211000	1214000	So, it's really games, games, games, games, games, left and right.
1214000	1221000	Vita, they're going to be having a lot of stuff to talk about. The Vita, maybe enhancements to that.
1221000	1226000	Maybe some more move-enabled games.
1226000	1230000	Once again, I don't think the move is a bad peripheral.
1230000	1237000	Honestly, out of all of the motion-captured things that they have right now, I think that one works the best.
1237000	1241000	Yet, I don't want to play anything that's using it.
1241000	1245000	Well, actually, the sports champions thing, I thought it was really impressive.
1245000	1248000	I'm like, this actually works pretty well.
1248000	1253000	Versus Kinect, where it's like, this is not detecting me. This is frustrating.
1253000	1257000	So, I can see them doing some more games that are going to probably support that.
1257000	1262000	Once again, they're going to continue doing hardcore games that support the move as well.
1262000	1267000	I think they're going to talk a little bit more about, once again, franchises that are going to be supporting the move.
1267000	1271000	And stuff like Bioshock, Infinite.
1271000	1277000	They have a few new games that they're supposed to be announcing, like the God of War prequel.
1277000	1279000	Well, the God of War prequel.
1279000	1281000	It's not making God of War prequels.
1281000	1284000	I can't even keep track of the storyline anymore.
1284000	1287000	Sony Smash Brothers, or whatever they're calling it. Battle Royale.
1287000	1289000	That might be pretty cool.
1289000	1292000	They're going to probably show...
1292000	1296000	What about that one game, Last Guardian?
1296000	1300000	Where that guy suddenly disappeared, but they say the game's not cancelled.
1300000	1305000	The Last of Us, also. That's their big holiday game.
1305000	1308000	So they're really going to just have game, game, game, game, game, game.
1308000	1309000	I think they're just going to have lots of games.
1309000	1311000	That's good. That's what they need. Especially Vita.
1311000	1316000	I'm really excited to see the Vita's second half, based on some of the early stuff they were announcing before.
1316000	1318000	Yeah.
1318000	1319000	Alright.
1319000	1324000	Going to our chat room, ShadowNextGen says there needs to be a Vita price drop announcement at E3.
1324000	1326000	I don't... I mean, I think that will...
1326000	1331000	And then WhatUpG follows that with, there is talk of a PS3 price drop for E3, ShadowNextGen.
1331000	1333000	Again, that's vognetwork.com for chat.
1333000	1337000	I could see them doing that, because they want to push more systems.
1337000	1341000	They're just bundling right now. They're kind of doing that whole thing.
1341000	1344000	The Vita price drop... I mean...
1344000	1349000	I guess they could do that, but they're already... I think they're already losing money on the system.
1349000	1351000	So it's going to be hard for them to do that.
1351000	1354000	Because, I mean, the system is more powerful than the 3DS.
1354000	1357000	And so, therefore, it is more expensive.
1357000	1361000	It's just right now, I don't think there's a lot of games that people need to have on the Vita.
1361000	1364000	There's nothing like, oh my god, I need to get a Vita for this game.
1364000	1367000	Whereas, you know, like Mario Kart, oh, I gotta buy a 3DS for that.
1367000	1370000	Or Super Mario 3D Land, because it's just an amazing Mario game.
1370000	1372000	Or, you know, a Zelda game, or something like that.
1372000	1375000	Although, they need a new Zelda game on the 3DS.
1375000	1378000	None of this Nintendo 64 rehash bullshit.
1378000	1384000	Let's see... I'm actually speaking of rehash bullshit for the 3DS.
1384000	1388000	I'm surprised they haven't remade the Mario 64.
1388000	1392000	That could be a title that they could just poop out real quick and put out for holiday.
1392000	1394000	And it would sell a ton of copies.
1397000	1400000	I don't know. I think there's going to be a lot of things for the Vita.
1400000	1402000	I think Call of Duty is definitely going to help.
1402000	1408000	I think if they end up doing a Max Payne Grand Theft Auto or something of that caliber on there,
1408000	1409000	they could easily do that.
1409000	1415000	You know, I'm actually very interested in Lego City Stories, which was the game.
1415000	1419000	They didn't announce the publisher, but it's fucking Rockstar.
1419000	1421000	It is so goddamn Rockstar Games.
1421000	1423000	The interface is exactly the same.
1423000	1425000	So it's Lego Grand Theft Auto.
1425000	1428000	I mean, that would be pretty awesome for the Wii U.
1428000	1429000	That could be a big thing.
1429000	1432000	And if that comes out in other systems, that could be a pretty cool announcement.
1434000	1437000	And just more Grand Theft Auto 5.
1437000	1438000	I don't care who shows it.
1438000	1441000	Microsoft, Sony, both of them.
1441000	1444000	Hey, let's just show different things.
1444000	1445000	Every booth has it.
1445000	1447000	EA, just put it up there.
1447000	1449000	Hey, it's such an awesome game. We're going to show this too.
1449000	1451000	I think that would be pretty cool.
1454000	1456000	I hope it's just something that's not cancelled.
1456000	1460000	Because once again, all those really cool things that I wanted for the 3DS,
1460000	1464000	DJ Hero, Saints Row, that kind of stuff,
1464000	1467000	all got fucking cancelled before the 3DS came out.
1467000	1469000	So all these things that they announced for the Wii U,
1469000	1472000	like this Lego City Stories thing,
1472000	1474000	could easily be cancelled by the time we get to it.
1476000	1479000	Alright, well, I'm sure some of you out there have your theories as well.
1479000	1482000	Email us quickly before the leaks start coming,
1482000	1484000	because that's going to be the exciting thing over the next few weeks,
1484000	1486000	is leaks, leaks, and more leaks. We even have a few tonight.
1486000	1490000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to lock in your predictions right now.
1490000	1493000	And I would like to add once again, because I don't think I say this enough,
1493000	1498000	I fucking hate Michael Patcher for getting paid lots of money to make stupid guesses.
1498000	1505000	I mean, hey, hey, I hear that a certain big title from Take Two got, you know, delayed.
1505000	1508000	Therefore, Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming out that day.
1508000	1513000	Yes, you could draw that, you know, you can make that argument, I guess,
1513000	1515000	because it's a pretty obvious one to make.
1515000	1523000	You know, or like, hey, I hear that, you know, a studio's making a new Halo game for the X-
1523000	1525000	I think it's going to be for the Xbox.
1525000	1531000	I mean, come on, that would be kind of the stuff that he makes calls on, I don't know.
1531000	1533000	But he gets paid a lot more money than I do.
1533000	1535000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks,
1535000	1538000	because I have a pretty big thing I've got to get into in my gaming week this week,
1538000	1541000	so let's start off with Ladies First Dark Sakura.
1541000	1545000	How was your gaming week? What type of video games have you been playing this week when you haven't been coughing?
1545000	1552000	Um, I got a panda to ten as a brewmaster and talked to the king of Stormwind
1552000	1555000	and realized he's an asshole and quit playing the beta.
1555000	1559000	By the way, she's a Warcraft addict, everybody.
1559000	1563000	A dealer. And I played some Portal 2.
1563000	1567000	Oh, have you played with that new level creator thingy that came out?
1567000	1568000	Not yet, not yet.
1568000	1570000	Oh, you gotta. I need to.
1570000	1579000	I need to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.
1579000	1581000	Yeah, I think you might want to cash in on that.
1581000	1583000	It's down to like twenty bucks now.
1583000	1585000	Oh, if it doesn't work, oh my god.
1585000	1587000	I'll have to wait for another Steam sale.
1587000	1589000	Still, I'm going to point and laugh at you for a second.
1589000	1593000	I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.
1593000	1599000	I'm going to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.
1599000	1601000	I'm going to point and laugh at you for having missed that bone.
1601000	1607000	I want to thank ActDeft for the gift of the Portal 2 behind the scenes thing.
1607000	1608000	Oh, that's nice.
1608000	1611000	Listeners buy us gifts? I want gifts.
1611000	1612000	Listeners buy me gifts.
1612000	1616000	No, actually, I have gotten nice things from listeners before. I can't pitch.
1616000	1619000	Speaking of gifts, I already bought you guys' Christmas gifts.
1619000	1620000	Already?
1620000	1621000	Really?
1621000	1622000	I already took care of it.
1622000	1624000	Nice. That's being proactive.
1624000	1627000	Now I'm going to remember that when Christmas comes around.
1627000	1629000	You bought that in May.
1629000	1631000	No, I can't wait. It'll be great.
1631000	1633000	It's not ready yet, though.
1633000	1634000	Alright.
1634000	1635000	Uh-oh.
1635000	1638000	RageNator in chat says,
1638000	1641000	Just an A. No A+. For shame.
1641000	1643000	He's being very much an Asian father right now.
1643000	1645000	Do I look Asian to you?
1645000	1649000	Alright, I'm assuming she's done, so Loki, you're giving me a week.
1649000	1651000	I just played Call of Duty Mario Warfare 3.
1651000	1656000	I wanted to get to play other things, but I was actually working on some Grand Theft Auto modding tool thing.
1656000	1658000	And I finally finished that, so...
1658000	1663000	Whew! I'm done with that. I can actually go and work on actual Grand Theft Auto 4 modding.
1663000	1669000	You know, I've got to get my stuff that I've been working on for like a year now done before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.
1669000	1674000	And then I am going back to Skyrim.
1674000	1677000	It's beckoning me, so I'm going to play that.
1677000	1679000	Now, actually, I'm supposed to be getting a copy.
1679000	1684000	I don't know if I'm going to keep it, of the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition for the 360.
1684000	1687000	I haven't decided if I'm going to play that or not.
1687000	1692000	I do want Max Payne 3, because I want to rule the online for that.
1692000	1696000	But, we'll see.
1696000	1698000	I have to wait a money.
1698000	1701000	Alright. That's it then.
1701000	1704000	Alright, my gaming week has been all over the map.
1704000	1706000	Let's talk about the big one.
1706000	1710000	I beat my third game for 2012 this week.
1710000	1712000	That means I beat...
1712000	1714000	Okay, so if we go back...
1714000	1716000	Now, remember, I have Gamer's ADD.
1716000	1718000	I never beat video games.
1718000	1721000	And if you haven't heard me talk about my Gamer ADD on the show before,
1721000	1726000	I have a horrible habit of buying $60 video games, playing the first three stages,
1726000	1728000	and then going, ooh, shiny!
1728000	1730000	Playing a new game that comes out the very next week.
1730000	1733000	I know I'm not the only podcast host that has this problem.
1733000	1735000	I've heard other guys with this.
1735000	1737000	I don't know what you're talking about.
1737000	1739000	Exactly. I know I'm not the only gamer with this problem.
1739000	1741000	So it happens to all of us.
1741000	1743000	It's been 25 hours in the day.
1743000	1745000	You know, sorry, just to interrupt real quick,
1745000	1748000	but you posted on Twitter you needed a new game to play.
1748000	1750000	Yeah. I was going to get to that.
1750000	1752000	Well, then let me get to it.
1752000	1754000	First, I have to talk about my big feat.
1754000	1756000	So I beat my third game.
1756000	1759000	So to recap, this year, I beat Mass Effect.
1759000	1761000	Then after that, I beat Mass Effect 2.
1761000	1763000	Guess what I beat the other night?
1763000	1765000	Space Harrier.
1765000	1767000	Mass Effect 3, everybody!
1767000	1769000	Woo!
1769000	1772000	In summary, you know how many hours I've sunk into the franchise overall?
1772000	1777000	Over 100 hours I have played these games since February.
1777000	1779000	Yeah, so I beat Mass Effect 3.
1779000	1782000	I've already kind of reviewed the game, I guess, on prior shows.
1782000	1784000	I love it.
1784000	1786000	But I'm sure here's the question.
1786000	1788000	I already know.
1788000	1790000	I already know Tiger Claw is going to ask this in the chat room,
1790000	1792000	or somebody's asking it in chat.
1792000	1794000	I don't even have to turn my head to look.
1794000	1797000	So, Rob, how about that ending?
1797000	1799000	So I can finally talk about the ending.
1799000	1801000	I won't spoil, though.
1801000	1804000	Out of respect to those that have not beat Mass Effect 3 yet,
1804000	1807000	or are just now getting into Mass Effect, I'm not going to spoil.
1807000	1809000	So which color did you get?
1809000	1814000	I went with green, which apparently was not the right thing to do.
1814000	1816000	But my thought was,
1816000	1819000	oh, well, I'm not going to go with the obviously Paragon
1819000	1821000	or the obviously Renegade thing.
1821000	1824000	This surely must be the bonus choice that I get
1824000	1827000	for having collected so many war assets,
1827000	1829000	which was only about half true.
1829000	1832000	Yes, it is a bonus choice you get for collecting a certain amount of war assets,
1832000	1834000	but it's not as great as you'd think.
1834000	1835000	You said ass.
1835000	1836000	Yeah, exactly.
1836000	1840000	Anyhow, so without ruining the ending, let me just say this.
1840000	1844000	I pretty much stand by everything I already said about this debacle
1844000	1846000	earlier in the program.
1846000	1850000	Yeah, it's kind of a disappointing end to a series
1850000	1852000	that a lot of people are very rabid over.
1852000	1855000	It's a little weird that no matter what you do,
1855000	1858000	the end result kind of ends up being really the same.
1858000	1864000	And for all this war asset, multiplayer, EA server,
1864000	1868000	it interfaces with the iPad app and the iPhone game
1868000	1871000	and the website and all this stuff.
1871000	1873000	You build up the war.
1873000	1878000	It maybe impacts three QuickTime movies you get at the end of the game,
1878000	1882000	which is kind of disappointing considering BioWare puts so much more
1882000	1884000	into the game otherwise.
1884000	1888000	But maybe they didn't want to branch it out in all these directions
1888000	1890000	because it makes future games in the series a bitch to make.
1890000	1892000	I don't know. I don't know their reasoning,
1892000	1894000	but I'm looking forward to the DLC just like everybody else.
1894000	1896000	But this is supposed to be the last one.
1896000	1899000	Surely you don't suggest that they made a terrible ending
1899000	1901000	so that they could sell another game.
1901000	1903000	Oh, please. Please.
1903000	1906000	It won't be the last Mass Effect game.
1906000	1909000	I mean, it might be the last in this trilogy,
1909000	1913000	but if they could make a Halo 4, they could make a Mass Effect 4.
1913000	1915000	That's for sure.
1915000	1919000	Otherwise, yes, the ending is unfortunate,
1919000	1922000	but it doesn't ruin the hundred hours of the gaming experience
1922000	1925000	I had to get there, which was a great gameplay experience.
1925000	1927000	I'm still playing the multiplayer.
1927000	1930000	As recently as earlier today, I was playing multiplayer.
1930000	1933000	I was playing multiplayer with Shane and Paul,
1933000	1935000	one of our listeners and one of his friends last night.
1935000	1937000	We were all trying the gold multiplayer and getting our ass kicked,
1937000	1939000	but it was so much fun.
1939000	1941000	So, you know, we're having fun with that.
1941000	1946000	And what else did I want to say about the whole ending debacle?
1946000	1948000	There was one other thing I wanted to say about it.
1948000	1952000	Oh, the whole talk about the defective game
1952000	1958000	and turning it back to Amazon and filing the complaint with the FCC.
1958000	1960000	That shit was ridiculous.
1960000	1963000	Oh, really? I didn't need to play the game to know that.
1963000	1965000	Exactly. My thoughts have not changed on that.
1965000	1967000	I just want to make that clear.
1967000	1971000	Do I think BioWare could have done better?
1971000	1973000	Fuck yeah, I think they could have done better.
1973000	1975000	Absolutely.
1975000	1979000	But I'm not really the type to raise this huge ruckus and stink over it.
1979000	1984000	They were a little busy working on some Star Wars MMO or something.
1984000	1987000	Shane is screaming at me to talk about the theory.
1987000	1990000	I don't want to spoil it, Shane.
1990000	1992000	I don't want to spoil it for listeners that haven't beat it yet.
1992000	1994000	All I will say is this.
1994000	2000000	He was begging me to watch this one and a half hour long documentary on YouTube
2000000	2002000	that is explaining the ending.
2002000	2006000	And I'm like, Shane, I don't need to watch this hour and a half documentary
2006000	2007000	that explains the ending.
2007000	2008000	Exactly.
2008000	2010000	Because I kind of already figured it out.
2010000	2011000	Like, I was halfway there.
2011000	2014000	And then he says, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2014000	2016000	And I'm like, oh, okay, I can see that.
2016000	2017000	Yeah, you're probably right.
2017000	2020000	You see, they're going to better explain the ending soon.
2020000	2025000	They're going to have the pop-up bubbles, like pop-up video for the ending
2025000	2028000	once the new BioWare DLC comes out for Mass Effect 3.
2028000	2030000	And he's like, no, you have to watch it anyway
2030000	2032000	because there's so many little things that go into it.
2032000	2035000	I'm like, Shane, I don't need to be sold on the theory.
2035000	2037000	I accept your theory.
2037000	2038000	It makes a lot of sense.
2038000	2039000	All right, I'm on board.
2039000	2040000	You're right.
2040000	2042000	That's the ending and that's how they're going to fix it in the DLC.
2042000	2044000	No, watch the documentary.
2044000	2046000	I'm like, God damn it, no.
2046000	2055000	Anyhow, act deaf in the chat room screaming.
2055000	2056000	Exactly.
2056000	2057000	Fucking exactly.
2057000	2058000	It's open to interpretation.
2058000	2059000	That it is.
2059000	2061000	It is a little bit.
2061000	2065000	Anyhow, how about other games that aren't Mass Effect?
2065000	2069000	Which I know is sacrilege, right?
2069000	2072000	Okay, you wanted me to get out the haterade, though,
2072000	2074000	because I played a really fucking terrible game this week.
2074000	2077000	Like, it is Yaris bad, you guys.
2077000	2078000	You ready?
2078000	2082000	It was a free game for me on PlayStation Plus,
2082000	2085000	which should start to tell you how terrible it was.
2085000	2088000	And I don't even remember the name of it.
2088000	2094000	I think it was called Frogger Returns.
2094000	2095000	Good Lord, Rob.
2095000	2096000	Oh, no.
2096000	2099000	No, you see, you don't even have to explain that.
2099000	2100000	I mean, it's just...
2100000	2104000	Yeah.
2104000	2106000	It was free and...
2106000	2108000	Okay, so it's like...
2108000	2111000	Remember how, like, the original Frogger was a good game?
2111000	2112000	And then remember how...
2112000	2114000	I don't remember the original Frogger anymore,
2114000	2117000	because it's been tainted by all this shit that they keep popping out.
2117000	2119000	I have good memories of Frogger,
2119000	2121000	because I was really good at it while on roller skates.
2121000	2124000	Then remember how Frogger came out again in, like,
2124000	2126000	94 or 95 on the PlayStation?
2126000	2127000	And it wasn't bad.
2127000	2130000	That first Frogger game was kind of a neat reimagining
2130000	2132000	of Frogger on the PlayStation, right?
2132000	2135000	And how every Frogger since then has basically tried to be
2135000	2137000	that PlayStation game all over again,
2137000	2139000	because I guess that was actually one of, like,
2139000	2141000	the best-selling PlayStation games ever,
2141000	2142000	was that Frogger that came out.
2142000	2144000	But it was awful.
2144000	2150000	So Frogger Returns is, like, kind of a mixture of the two.
2150000	2154000	Like, it's trying to be the arcade game in that top overhead style,
2154000	2160000	but they've redone the maps to add a sewer level, a subway thing,
2160000	2164000	and it's just, like, it's so derpy,
2164000	2166000	and I don't really have a better way to explain it.
2166000	2168000	Like, there's power-ups, you guys.
2168000	2170000	Oh my god, oh my god, okay, power-ups, power-ups.
2170000	2175000	You can make everything stop for a few seconds,
2175000	2177000	which surprisingly doesn't make anything easier,
2177000	2179000	because sometimes you have to have things moving
2179000	2181000	in order to get from platform to platform.
2181000	2183000	So that power-up does nothing.
2183000	2185000	And then, oh my god, you guys, oh my god, you guys,
2185000	2188000	super revolutionary Frogger power-up,
2188000	2192000	change your fucking mind, blow your fucking mind away.
2192000	2193000	Ready?
2193000	2195000	Reverse.
2195000	2197000	Everything fucking moves backwards.
2197000	2200000	Oh my god!
2200000	2204000	Don't tell me that they have a mirror stage option as well.
2204000	2206000	I don't know, I didn't beat the game,
2206000	2208000	but maybe that's something that comes up.
2208000	2210000	But everything moves backwards,
2210000	2212000	and you know what it changes?
2212000	2215000	Nothing, because Frogger is just as hard
2215000	2218000	when everything's moving backwards as it is forwards.
2218000	2219000	Hey, Rob.
2219000	2220000	What?
2220000	2221000	There was a good Frogger thing that came out.
2221000	2222000	What's that?
2222000	2225000	Frogger 3 Deep on the Commodore 64 was badass.
2225000	2231000	It was a project using GPS mapping and street sensors
2231000	2234000	to where they had an interactive Frogger
2234000	2237000	that used New York City traffic as the cars,
2237000	2239000	and you played the frog.
2239000	2241000	That's already more interesting than the game I played.
2241000	2243000	I don't know, that looked pretty derpy.
2243000	2244000	I thought it was pretty neat.
2244000	2245000	I will say this.
2245000	2247000	For you trophy whores,
2247000	2250000	there are four trophies in Frogger Returns.
2250000	2253000	You get a silver trophy for beating the first stage,
2253000	2255000	and then for stages two through four,
2255000	2257000	you get a gold trophy.
2257000	2259000	So if you want an easy gold trophy or two,
2259000	2261000	go play Frogger Returns.
2261000	2263000	Three on PlayStation Plus.
2263000	2266000	Otherwise, oh, I needed to get out there.
2266000	2268000	This is so important.
2268000	2272000	The collision detection is awful.
2272000	2276000	And in Frogger, collision detection is kind of important.
2276000	2279000	You think?
2279000	2282000	I was nowhere near that car.
2282000	2285000	It's like playing a sprite-based game in three dimensions.
2285000	2286000	It's terrible.
2286000	2287000	All right.
2287000	2288000	Moving on.
2288000	2290000	One other game I played on PlayStation 3,
2290000	2292000	although this game's on Xbox Live Arcade as well.
2292000	2295000	I didn't pay for it because it's also free on PlayStation Plus.
2295000	2297000	No, we got it found at Fifth Avenue Frogger.
2297000	2299000	And this game was actually worth my time,
2299000	2301000	unlike the other one.
2301000	2304000	Awesomenauts is on PlayStation right now.
2304000	2306000	Awesomenauts is kind of cool
2306000	2309000	because Awesomenauts is like a tower defense game
2309000	2311000	mixed with Gunstar Heroes or Contra.
2311000	2314000	It's like a shooter mixed with a tower defense game.
2314000	2316000	Here's the interesting thing about it, though.
2316000	2318000	Once you play the tutorial level,
2318000	2320000	it's really all multiplayer.
2320000	2322000	I mean, yeah, you can play single player with bots,
2322000	2324000	and you can kind of do it that way,
2324000	2326000	but it's all online.
2326000	2330000	And so, I mean, imagine if you were playing a type of Contra
2330000	2332000	where you were just shooting the other people.
2332000	2335000	That's kind of what they've made is a side-scroller shooter
2335000	2337000	that's multiplayer head-to-head.
2337000	2341000	And, yeah, it's kind of a neat experience. I liked it.
2341000	2343000	Can you shoot people until they explode?
2343000	2345000	Yeah, you shoot people until they explode.
2345000	2347000	They go back to their base, and they have to respawn,
2347000	2349000	and then you fall down this little rocket,
2349000	2351000	and that's kind of what fills the time
2351000	2355000	so that way there is a penalty for you having died.
2355000	2357000	And in a nutshell, you're trying to bust through
2357000	2359000	these little, like, I think they're called turrets.
2359000	2361000	You bust through these little turrets
2361000	2362000	on your way to get to the base.
2362000	2364000	I mean, it's like any other tower defense game,
2364000	2365000	but they mixed it with a shooter,
2365000	2367000	which makes it kind of unique and fun.
2367000	2368000	So, yeah, I liked Awesomenauts.
2368000	2370000	That's worth a look.
2370000	2373000	If you're on PlayStation Plus, especially, it's free.
2373000	2375000	So, like, seriously, go get it.
2375000	2378000	So it wasn't Awesomenaut.
2378000	2382000	Well, and it has this amazing 80s retro theme song to it
2382000	2383000	and, like, anime intro.
2383000	2385000	And I got to say, it's a sharp-looking game.
2385000	2386000	It looks like a cartoon.
2386000	2388000	It's great. Art style's fun.
2388000	2391000	So, yeah, it's worth checking out.
2391000	2395000	So I was just thinking now, you know,
2395000	2398000	how you're looking for another game to play, you know,
2398000	2400000	and possibly one that's, you know,
2400000	2401000	we could play with other people.
2401000	2402000	Yes, I put that out on Twitter.
2402000	2405000	Now that I've beat Mass Effect 3, what do I play?
2405000	2406000	And, of course, Shane replied and said,
2406000	2407000	More Mass Effect.
2407000	2409000	I'm like, I want to give it a month
2409000	2411000	before I start my Renegade playthrough.
2411000	2413000	Well, I was just thinking it'd be interesting
2413000	2417000	if we both tried Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.
2417000	2420000	All right, look, I don't want the Minecraft hate mail.
2420000	2425000	I played Minecraft on PC and I just didn't get it.
2425000	2428000	But to be fair, to be fair, everybody,
2428000	2430000	put the pens down, don't write the hate mail.
2430000	2432000	The first time I played Mass Effect,
2432000	2435000	about three years ago, the first Mass Effect game,
2435000	2437000	I didn't get it either and I didn't like it.
2437000	2441000	So, okay, I'm with you, Loki.
2441000	2443000	Let's give Minecraft one more chance.
2443000	2446000	I will buy it tomorrow.
2446000	2447000	All right.
2447000	2449000	I am looking for Minecraft for Linux.
2449000	2451000	Well, I'm sure it exists.
2451000	2454000	Why the sudden urge to get into Minecraft, Loki?
2454000	2455000	I don't have a real urge to it,
2455000	2456000	but I think it'd be interesting.
2456000	2458000	It'd be funny if we both played a game,
2458000	2460000	like we set a time during the week or something
2460000	2462000	to play multiplayer and that just,
2462000	2465000	whether we hate it or like it, it'll be interesting.
2465000	2467000	That's right. Interesting it will.
2467000	2468000	There is Minecraft for Linux.
2468000	2469000	Of course there is.
2469000	2470000	There's everything for Linux.
2470000	2471000	I don't know.
2471000	2473000	Or Steam for Linux.
2473000	2474000	Or we could play a game that we already have,
2474000	2476000	like Saints Row the Third.
2476000	2477000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says,
2477000	2480000	Sky, Minecraft on 360 is a better introduction.
2480000	2481000	That's what I hear.
2481000	2484000	It's set up a little better to like get you into the series.
2484000	2486000	I'll check it out. I will. Why not?
2486000	2487000	Sure.
2487000	2488000	All right.
2488000	2491000	Otherwise, I do have all these other games I could be playing,
2491000	2492000	like Fez I need to play more of,
2492000	2495000	because I actually really enjoyed the little time I spent with that.
2495000	2497000	Oh, whatever.
2497000	2498000	Let's move on.
2498000	2500000	Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
2500000	2501000	How's that sound?
2501000	2503000	Oh, first let me plug our Twitters.
2503000	2505000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook.
2505000	2508000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2508000	2509000	Add us.
2509000	2511000	Be our friend.
2511000	2512000	And we'll be your friend in return.
2512000	2513000	And you can interact with the show
2513000	2516000	and answer our foogle questions every week.
2516000	2517000	Otherwise, housekeeping,
2517000	2518000	there will still be a show next week.
2518000	2519000	But no Dark Sakura.
2519000	2521000	Dark Sakura's going to the happiest place on Earth.
2521000	2523000	And not taking me.
2523000	2525000	You know, you were invited.
2525000	2526000	I was.
2526000	2527000	I was totally invited,
2527000	2529000	but I can't make it because I have a conflict.
2529000	2530000	That's right.
2530000	2531000	You're conflicted.
2531000	2532000	Yeah, I'm always am.
2532000	2534000	So, Loki and I will be here holding down the fort,
2534000	2536000	maybe a guest host.
2536000	2538000	Alan works on Sunday nights now, so he won't be here.
2538000	2539000	And for the record, Frisbee,
2539000	2542000	wine does not work on my netbook,
2542000	2544000	which I'm running Lennox Mint on.
2544000	2545000	So, end of story.
2545000	2546000	And also, I want to say,
2546000	2548000	Nicholson, since I know you're listening,
2548000	2549000	thank you for the pink berry.
2549000	2550000	Right, Jamie?
2550000	2551000	Yes, thank you.
2551000	2553000	It was considerate of you to think of us.
2553000	2554000	It was considerate.
2554000	2555000	He brought it for me.
2555000	2556000	You just sound so sincere.
2556000	2557000	But I'm here.
2557000	2558000	No, you are.
2558000	2559000	It was considerate.
2559000	2560000	All right.
2560000	2562000	Let's move on and get into the news.
2562000	2563000	Loki.
2563000	2564000	All right.
2564000	2565000	So, EA, you know,
2565000	2567000	they're planning on doing some layoffs.
2567000	2568000	And they have,
2568000	2569000	they have,
2569000	2571000	the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs
2571000	2572000	on Sunday nights.
2572000	2573000	And, you know,
2573000	2575000	they're planning on doing some layoffs.
2575000	2576000	And they have,
2576000	2577000	they have,
2577000	2579000	the plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs
2579000	2580000	by September 30th.
2580000	2582000	Basically, what they're doing is the restructuring
2582000	2583000	of their employees.
2583000	2584000	Um, and they're-
2584000	2586000	Running people off?
2586000	2589000	Yes, they're restructuring them out of the company.
2589000	2590000	Okay, see right here,
2590000	2592000	this, this is our group of employees here.
2592000	2593000	We have,
2593000	2595000	this circle represents the people that are in the company.
2595000	2597000	The people that are outside of the circle.
2597000	2599000	You're fired.
2599000	2602000	So, um, that's kind of how it's going to work.
2602000	2604000	Um, they're basically, um,
2604000	2607000	I guess dropping from a one in eight engineers
2607000	2608000	to one in two engineers.
2608000	2610000	To one in two.
2610000	2613000	Um, so, cool.
2613000	2616000	And, um, I guess, uh,
2616000	2618000	they, uh, will-
2618000	2622000	By the way, this is all the fault of people that rent games
2622000	2623000	and buy them used.
2623000	2625000	This is all your fault,
2625000	2627000	and the blood is on your hands.
2627000	2630000	Clearly it's because you're not paying enough for those online passes.
2630000	2632000	That is clearly why these people are being let go
2632000	2634000	and not because they like making money.
2634000	2636000	Um, so yes,
2636000	2638000	apparently they're going to, um,
2638000	2640000	have a variety of expenses, um,
2640000	2643000	incurring up to 40 million in total costs, I guess,
2643000	2645000	the severance packages for these people.
2645000	2647000	And, um, no,
2647000	2650000	23 million of that is severance packages.
2650000	2652000	The other 17, I guess, is going away parties.
2652000	2654000	Uh, that'd be my guess.
2654000	2656000	Uh, yeah.
2656000	2659000	And then, of course, um, they're going to, um,
2659000	2663000	drop the number of employees by five to ten percent,
2663000	2667000	which is approximately 500 to 1,000 people.
2667000	2670000	How in the hell does that go from one in eight people being an engineer
2670000	2673000	to one in two people being an engineer when you're firing five percent?
2673000	2677000	Like, I'm not even a math major, and that doesn't compute to me.
2677000	2680000	Does that mean all these people are suddenly going to be changed into engineers?
2680000	2682000	They're just going to-
2682000	2684000	Loki! Bam! You're an engineer!
2684000	2686000	They're just going to make them respec, okay?
2686000	2689000	As an engineer, so that's what's going to happen, you know.
2689000	2692000	You were a white mage before, you're now a fucking engineer.
2692000	2694000	You're going to need to pay 120 Microsoft points.
2694000	2697000	Listen, you better learn how to fucking pilot that airship,
2697000	2699000	because if not, you're out of there as well.
2699000	2701000	We're going to drop it down to one in one engineers.
2701000	2703000	Um, so yes.
2703000	2707000	Only you could make a shitty thing like job loss hilarious, thank you, Loki.
2707000	2713000	Hey, not only do I speculate about, you know, game industry stuff,
2713000	2715000	I can also do comedy.
2715000	2717000	Fuck you, Michael Patcher.
2717000	2720000	You can't do comedy for shit. I saw your video.
2720000	2725000	My data says that there's more people that whine than complain.
2725000	2728000	Well my data says that you're a fucking tard.
2728000	2730000	Allegedly.
2730000	2732000	Allegedly.
2734000	2736000	So yes. So there's that.
2736000	2738000	And then of course, you know, beyond that,
2738000	2740000	they've made some money with Origin.
2740000	2746000	You know, I guess they have 11 million members on Origin.
2746000	2751000	Now, to be fair, if you play an EA game that has multiplayer,
2751000	2753000	you have to sign up on Origin.
2753000	2757000	Yeah, I'm on Origin because of Mass Effect, not willingly.
2757000	2762000	You may be skewing those numbers a little bit, so fine.
2762000	2765000	The person who hacked my Xbox signed me up for Origin.
2765000	2768000	You know, I found out, I got signed up for Origin.
2768000	2771000	And my Xbox hasn't been hacked, but I'm signed up for it.
2771000	2773000	Somehow, I don't remember doing it.
2773000	2775000	Dragon Age. You had to do it for Dragon Age.
2775000	2777000	Yep, see, aha! I'm smart.
2777000	2783000	So, and then of course, they've made $150 million in revenue
2783000	2789000	during the fiscal year from March 31st, 2011 to April 1st of this year.
2789000	2796000	And, you know, they're saying that EA's Nucleus cross-platform community network,
2796000	2801000	which, I gotta be honest, I've never heard of, has 220 million members.
2801000	2805000	I don't even know what the fuck that is or why they have so many members for it.
2805000	2812000	And they said, of course, they've allowed 11 million members to provide feedback
2812000	2816000	on Origin and their digital distribution service.
2816000	2821000	But, see, once again, it's just because you can't tout those numbers.
2821000	2825000	That's like, for example, the PlayStation, like Sony is saying,
2825000	2827000	oh look, the PlayStation Network has all these members.
2827000	2830000	Yes, because it's free to make an account.
2830000	2834000	I have four accounts. Am I four people? No, I am one person.
2834000	2838000	But I have four accounts because I like having accounts in every single region.
2838000	2841000	And also Nelly has an account. But technically it's on the PlayStation,
2841000	2845000	so therefore it's my account. But that doesn't count.
2845000	2850000	So, whatever, fine. Tout your numbers, but all it really comes down to is revenue.
2850000	2855000	$150 million isn't bad. I don't know what Steam makes during that same time period.
2855000	2857000	I'm assuming a lot more than $150 million.
2857000	2860000	$150 million can save lots of jobs. Never mind.
2860000	2865000	Oh, by the way, it wasn't Dragon Age. It was Sims 3.
2865000	2867000	Whatever.
2867000	2870000	Cray Sims 3 makes you sign up for Origin?
2870000	2874000	No, but I signed up for an EA registration account.
2874000	2875000	Oh.
2875000	2878000	So it linked my data from when I signed up for Dragon Age.
2878000	2879000	It actually linked my data from Sims 3.
2879000	2880000	Gotcha.
2880000	2883000	Well, it's also weird because I had a Call of Duty Elite account,
2883000	2886000	and yet I never remembered signing up for one.
2886000	2890000	But I did. I just don't remember why.
2890000	2894000	Alright, well speaking of Call of Duty Elite, if you're all done with the EA news over there,
2894000	2895000	I am.
2895000	2898000	Let's move over to Activision Blizzard and talk about what they reported.
2898000	2901000	After all, these are the two big software publishers in the world right now.
2901000	2906000	Activision Blizzard, or Active Blizzard, whatever I just called them,
2906000	2911000	the net revenue right now, $1.17 billion for the period ending on March 31, 2012.
2911000	2915000	That is a 23% drop over 2011.
2915000	2921000	Activision, let's see, Activision had 23% of net revenues, that's down 19%.
2921000	2926000	Blizzard accounted for 21% of net revenues, down 42%.
2926000	2931000	Probably because, I would imagine, because Blizzard had StarCraft II sales still pretty strong this time last year.
2931000	2934000	And also, wow, subscriptions were up.
2934000	2935000	Yeah.
2935000	2941000	Now, of course, Blizzard kind of has this semi-big game coming out.
2941000	2943000	Let me think, when is that game going to be out?
2943000	2946000	Tomorrow night, Diablo III, which should look pretty good for them.
2946000	2947000	Pandas!
2947000	2951000	Panda People, Land of the Panda People is coming out later this year as well.
2951000	2954000	And then, of course, they have a StarCraft II expansion on the horizon.
2954000	2958000	Do you suppose that maybe getting people to prepay for their full year of, you know,
2958000	2961000	now assuming that was prepaid for the blood pact, right?
2961000	2962000	No, it was not.
2962000	2963000	Okay.
2963000	2965000	It was merely, it was the equivalent of a cell phone contract.
2965000	2967000	You signed it up and agreed not to.
2967000	2969000	I thought maybe they were trying to boost their numbers.
2969000	2970000	You don't have to pay anything extra.
2970000	2975000	It's just, we'll give you a pretty pony and this game and a beta.
2975000	2976000	I will say I did this.
2976000	2980000	When I signed up for the blood pact, I switched my account to six months at a time,
2980000	2984000	because when you do six months at a time, you get like $2 off a month.
2984000	2986000	You pay like $77 for six months.
2986000	2990000	And so I just did that because I had a nice chunk of money six months ago,
2990000	2994000	and then I knew around now I would have to pony up the money again, which I did.
2994000	2996000	And it's okay.
2996000	2999000	So, let's see.
2999000	3002000	Activision's big stuff coming up.
3002000	3007000	Prototype 2, Amazing Spider-Man, Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
3007000	3010000	Yeah, they've got, well, they've got, well, Prototype 2 just came out.
3010000	3012000	Obviously, their big one, Call of Duty.
3012000	3018000	Later on, Skylanders Giants, which I hate to say is probably going to be a big title for them.
3018000	3023000	And they have a whole bunch of smaller things in between them, like Ice Age 2.
3023000	3028000	They have a terrible battleship game that's coming out also on Tuesday.
3028000	3029000	They also have a-
3029000	3034000	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Battleship was a game. Now it's a movie.
3034000	3037000	The game, based off the movie, based off the game.
3037000	3041000	Yes, they have a game that's coming out.
3041000	3047000	A first-person shooter that will probably be passed over by a lot of people coming out as well.
3047000	3053000	And then a couple weeks later, Men in Black, Alien Crisis, another terrible game based on a movie.
3053000	3057000	Well, not exactly based on a movie. It's based on a lot of secondary characters from the movies.
3057000	3060000	That's also coming out as well. So they're going to have that.
3060000	3063000	And Spider-Man will do well for them.
3063000	3066000	Alright, well, Call of Duty Elite, since Loki had brought that up a minute ago.
3066000	3070000	Apparently, 10 million users are signed up for Call of Duty Elite.
3070000	3072000	2 million are paid subscribers.
3072000	3076000	That's better than nothing, which is what they had a few years ago when the service didn't exist.
3076000	3080000	Apparently, that is up 3 million and a half million.
3080000	3086000	So it was 7 million and 1.5 million since February when they last reported on the numbers.
3086000	3091000	So, yeah, it's gone up. I guess people are liking their Call of Duty Elite.
3091000	3100000	They have a lot of content packs coming out, so it's becoming very apparent that paying the $60 a year is a good deal if you want all those maps and stuff.
3100000	3106000	See, I'm not super into Call of Duty, so that's really not for me, but I could see where that is lucrative.
3106000	3110000	Like, if they had something like that for Mass Effect, I'd be tempted. I hate to say that.
3110000	3119000	Yeah, see, like, right now we play offline at work, so, you know, that would require everybody having those maps in order for it to be beneficial for me to buy those maps.
3119000	3123000	So I just don't buy those maps right now.
3123000	3128000	Alright. Well, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.
3128000	3133000	Yes, other stuff that is, uh, well, more Blizzard-y things.
3133000	3138000	Blizzard and Valve settled their little trademark disagreement for the DOTA.
3138000	3140000	DOTA, whatever it is.
3140000	3148000	Um, so basically, Valve gets to use it, and Blizzard retains non-commercial use of the title for the community.
3148000	3155000	Um, as in keeping it as an acronym available for Warcraft III and StarCraft II.
3155000	3163000	Um, in fact, Blizzard is renaming the Blizzard DOTA project. It's called Blizzard All-Stars.
3163000	3169000	And this is the quote that came out from Rob Pardo, who's the Blizzard exec.
3169000	3175000	Um, both Blizzard and Valve recognized that at the end of the day, players just want to be able to play the games they're looking forward to,
3175000	3179000	so we're happy to come to an agreement that helps both of us stay focused on that.
3179000	3181000	And then Gabe Newell said,
3181000	3186000	We're pleased that we could come to an agreement with Blizzard without drawing things out in a way that would benefit no one.
3186000	3192000	We both want to focus on the things our fans care about creating and shipping great games for our communities.
3192000	3194000	Um, neither title has a release date, by the way.
3194000	3196000	But, soon.
3196000	3198000	But they've come to an agreement. They've shaken hands.
3198000	3201000	They said, you know what, this is silly.
3201000	3203000	Which is good. I mean, the community wins.
3203000	3208000	And it's not like the community is not going to know one of these games from the other.
3208000	3212000	I mean, DOTA-style games are really a rage right now.
3212000	3214000	You know, League of Legends is really huge.
3214000	3216000	It's a game we don't talk about enough on this show.
3216000	3218000	There's a pretty huge community behind it.
3218000	3224000	Um, you know, those style of games are very popular, so I think everybody's really waiting to see what Blizzard and Valve puts out there.
3224000	3226000	As well as, uh, there's another one.
3226000	3229000	One of the other Dota makers went to go make a third one.
3229000	3231000	I can't remember the name. I'm sure someone in chat will jump in.
3231000	3234000	But there's kind of a third one involved in all this, too, so.
3234000	3237000	And then, of course, there's League of Legends, too.
3237000	3239000	So, you know, they're all kind of very similar.
3239000	3242000	But, we'll all be unique in their own ways.
3242000	3244000	It'll be neat to see.
3244000	3250000	And, you know, honestly, I wish we could see this type of agreement.
3250000	3252000	This type of goodwill, I would say.
3252000	3256000	From more companies that are having little tiffs with each other.
3256000	3260000	I would rather them consider their whole...
3260000	3264000	The whole reason they have money in their pockets is because of these communities.
3264000	3266000	Because of the gamers.
3266000	3271000	And they try to, you know, delay things and screw each other over.
3271000	3273000	In the end, they're screwing us over, too.
3273000	3275000	And back to screwing themselves.
3275000	3278000	Because they're not getting their money as soon as they would probably like it.
3278000	3279000	WhatupG in the chatroom says,
3279000	3281000	Can Valve now get to making Half-Life 3?
3281000	3284000	I agree. I definitely agree with that notion.
3284000	3288000	I would like to see them back to making Half-Life 3 at this point.
3288000	3290000	More Half-Life.
3290000	3292000	Alright, moving on.
3292000	3296000	So, there's some other rumors or reports, I guess,
3296000	3299000	regarding some stuff that maybe Microsoft's gonna be showing off at E3.
3299000	3305000	And this involves Kinect Play Fit in a device called JUUL.
3305000	3311000	Basically, what JUUL is supposed to be is some sort of device that's gonna include
3311000	3315000	a heart rate monitor and other wireless monitoring stuff.
3315000	3318000	Like, for example, I would imagine a pedometer or something like that.
3318000	3324000	And what it's gonna do is track your, I guess, exercise across all different Kinect games.
3324000	3330000	And, um, so, almost like, I would say, like those, uh, oh, I don't know what you call them,
3330000	3334000	but the, uh, the Nike things that they have for, like, the iPhone or, you know, whatever,
3334000	3338000	where you can jog and they'll, you know, keep track of how far you've jogged.
3338000	3340000	You mean the pedometer?
3340000	3343000	Well, no, I understand it's a pedometer, but it's a little bit more than that.
3343000	3348000	It's like a heart rate monitor and stuff, and it actually hooks up to these different software devices.
3348000	3350000	Um, so that's what they're gonna be talking about.
3350000	3352000	And I think that's kind of a neat idea,
3352000	3355000	because then that way you're not limited to, oh, I have to play a fitness game
3355000	3360000	in order to track how much, you know, how many calories I'm burning or something like that.
3360000	3364000	Almost reminds me a little bit of, like, what they did with kind of, like, the Wii Fit Plus stuff,
3364000	3370000	where you can, you know, show your progress across a bunch of different things,
3370000	3373000	and you have your own dedicated channel for that.
3373000	3376000	Um, I can see them doing something similar, maybe built into the dashboard,
3376000	3380000	where you buy this device, maybe it comes with, like, an exercise program or something like that,
3380000	3386000	and you wear it for, you know, these different Kinect games, like Dance Central or something like that,
3386000	3392000	and not only are you having fun, but you're, you know, tracking weight loss and that kind of stuff.
3394000	3398000	Hurray! More weight loss and exercise games for the Kinect.
3398000	3403000	Honestly, you know, I think, I mean, they need more of, not only do they need the weight loss stuff,
3403000	3409000	but they need, like, dieting stuff as well, like, what should you eat, you know?
3409000	3412000	Like a full program, not just, yeah.
3412000	3416000	Not just because, you know, weight loss stuff is a good idea, but if you're only doing that,
3416000	3420000	you're not gonna lose anything, so you need, like, you know, they need to also say,
3420000	3424000	okay, here's what you should eat too, and hey, recipes, recipes are nice.
3424000	3428000	Tied in with, like, a Windows phone thing or something, I don't know.
3428000	3431000	Maybe a tie-in with Fedocracy?
3431000	3434000	Sure, why not. Who knows, anything's possible.
3434000	3440000	Anything is possible, including an internet browser finally on the 360, what, about six years late?
3440000	3443000	At this point, it's, like, almost not even worth it.
3443000	3447000	How long has the Wii and the, excuse me, the PlayStation 3 had a browser?
3447000	3453000	Well, sounds like the Xbox 360 could be getting one of their own if rumors are to be believed.
3453000	3458000	Internet Explorer 9, which is weird because I thought they were up to, like, 10, but whatever,
3458000	3465000	Internet Explorer 9, having Kinect functionality, is rumored to be coming to the Xbox in a future update.
3465000	3469000	You'll be able to search with voice input, just like, you know, the Bing search bar and all that stuff,
3469000	3474000	and you can browse the web using Kinect-based controls,
3474000	3478000	which I have no idea how that would be practical or whatever, except maybe, like,
3478000	3482000	I wanna go back a page. Whoosh!
3482000	3486000	I wanna go back to home. Whoosh!
3486000	3489000	Am I just scrolling through pages because you don't have a mouse?
3489000	3493000	Well, you could use a controller for that, but why would you, why would we make things make sense?
3493000	3496000	Why do that when you can go whoosh?
3496000	3498000	The whoosh should be required.
3498000	3502000	I don't want to whoosh. I do that in private.
3502000	3507000	So, a big meh to that, I, I, whatever.
3507000	3510000	I'll download it and try it once and go, huh.
3510000	3515000	I am saying, though, let me be first to, I'm sure I'm not the first,
3515000	3519000	but I'm gonna be the first in the show to venture into that area.
3519000	3526000	Um, I can see that there's gonna be some dirty uses for the Kinect-enabled browsing.
3526000	3529000	Obviously since it's hands-free, you know.
3529000	3532000	Find porn! Go!
3532000	3536000	Whoosh! Whoosh!
3536000	3541000	Enhance. Enhance. Enhance. Whoosh!
3541000	3543000	Next video!
3543000	3549000	The Kinect starts scrolling up and down very rapidly. Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.
3549000	3555000	We have detected masturbation.
3555000	3559000	We are charting your calorie loss as part of the, uh...
3559000	3567000	We heard you just say, Kinect video chat. Dark Sakura now calling.
3567000	3570000	That would only work if I had a camera.
3570000	3573000	Do you have a Kinect? Then you have a camera.
3573000	3576000	My Kinect, Rob, is still in its box.
3576000	3580000	Here's a question for everybody. I want honest answers.
3580000	3586000	Who likes to put, like, a game box or something in front of their Kinect just in case they're spying on you?
3586000	3590000	Cause sometimes I like to play Mass Effect 3 with no pants on.
3590000	3594000	You know what, it's my house, I'll do what I want. And I'll sit in that chair with no pants on.
3594000	3602000	Well, I totally do that with my Kinect that's wrapped around, you know, that's not attached to anything that's collecting dust because that's how often I use the Kinect.
3602000	3610000	But I'm afraid one of these days it'll be like, start party with friends, and all of a sudden it's like, ba-doop, you've started video Kinect. Ah!
3610000	3618000	This is gonna be one day when I'm in my pajamas passed out on the couch while Dan's playing something.
3618000	3628000	Cause you've seen how my living room is arranged where we have the couch right in front of the TV and then we have a chaise lounge off to the side and Dan sits in the chaise lounge to play games.
3628000	3630000	Or what if, like, it'll just be me sleeping.
3630000	3642000	Or what if there's like an awkward moment where you're throwing a party actually in your house and you do not have enough cups to go around and you have a couple girls that are looking for a drink cup and you're like, there's two girls and I only have one cup.
3642000	3654000	Oh, embarrassing. That's embarrassing. Damn it. Did not want to see that. Who wants dip?
3654000	3658000	Or what if you have a new pet?
3658000	3660000	Did anyone bring lemons to the party?
3660000	3662000	Ah, shit!
3662000	3667000	Or what if you just got a new pet and you say, look, I have a new goat, see?
3667000	3675000	You know, that's actually funny enough that you should say that actually is a legitimate concern for my sister whose goats are actually having babies.
3675000	3679000	So she would have something that she would, you want to see my new goats, you know?
3679000	3681000	New goat, see?
3681000	3686000	Which I still do want a pet goat to eat the grass in my backyard.
3686000	3691000	Tiger Claw in our chat says, Skye, what about the Kinect microphone? That thing would be on and they would hear you. You gotta turn that off.
3691000	3708000	You know what? I actually did turn that off in the dashboard. I'm always afraid it's going to like pop back on or something because, you know, like sometimes I'm playing strangers on Mass Effect 3 and I don't want like, you know, Alan to walk in the room, be all like, honey, the kitty just barfed or something like that.
3708000	3711000	And then everybody hears it on the video game.
3711000	3720000	Well, we used to have Shermie shit in the hall while we recorded the show, so it's not a big thing.
3720000	3724000	And just to let everyone know, Shermie is fine. She's old and smelly.
3724000	3728000	All right, let's move on, please. Another story.
3728000	3730000	I got texted.
3730000	3732000	You're supposed to be doing a show, young lady.
3732000	3734000	So? Was it my turn?
3734000	3737000	Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, yes. It's your turn. And then release dates coming up.
3737000	3743000	That was Becky telling me she was home. She should be listening to the show right now. Becky, listen to us.
3743000	3745000	So have you ever wanted a mecha, Rob?
3745000	3747000	A mecha?
3747000	3750000	Yeah, you're a mecha, like a Gundam or an Evangelion.
3750000	3751000	Can I kill people with it?
3751000	3752000	That's what they're for.
3752000	3754000	Will I get away with it?
3754000	3760000	I have to tell you, because only in Japan, actually not only in Japan, because when I would go to Anime Expo,
3760000	3764000	there are always these guys trying to get donations for building their giant mecha.
3764000	3766000	And we're like, no.
3766000	3767000	Kickstarter?
3767000	3773000	This was before Kickstarter's. This was like my first AX in 1998 or something.
3773000	3780000	But they're doing it in Japan. They're building a 12-foot-tall pilotable mecha.
3780000	3787000	And they're using Kinect for running it.
3787000	3794000	Basically, it's as far as they actually have a weapon, Rob. It's a water gun.
3794000	3800000	Not a big sniper rifle or chain gun. It's a water gun.
3800000	3802000	And they're calling it Vaudeville.
3802000	3805000	If I shoot that water gun right in your eye, it might hurt.
3805000	3808000	Yeah. They're calling it Vaudeville.
3808000	3814000	And it looks like it's four-legged, and there's some shots of it in production.
3814000	3817000	I mean, it looks really freaking not like a Gundam.
3817000	3821000	Can my cat drive it?
3821000	3823000	Kitty mech.
3823000	3824000	Meow, meow, meow.
3824000	3826000	Did you ever play BattleTech?
3826000	3827000	No.
3827000	3828000	Well, it looks like old BattleTech stuff.
3828000	3829000	All right.
3829000	3839000	But it's neat. But, you know, I want a mecha so that I can use it to go to work.
3839000	3844000	It brings up that age-old question. Why?
3844000	3847000	And the age-old response, Rob. Why not?
3847000	3849000	Why not? Because.
3849000	3850000	Reasons.
3850000	3851000	I'm bored.
3851000	3853000	Because of reasons.
3853000	3856000	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
3856000	3859000	coming to a gaming store near you in your country,
3859000	3862000	which may or may not include gaming mechs.
3862000	3865000	There's lots of stuff coming out this week,
3865000	3872000	including a small PC title I'm sure no one's heard of, Diablo III.
3872000	3876000	That's coming out this week, both regular and collector's edition.
3876000	3879000	As I mentioned before, Battleship, the newest game from Activision,
3879000	3882000	that will be a blockbuster smash, I'm sure.
3882000	3885000	I mean, the source material is excellent.
3885000	3892000	So that's coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and Nintendo DS.
3892000	3899000	Also this week, Akai Katana on Xbox 360, if you're a fan of cave shooters.
3899000	3907000	Also this week, Game of Thrones on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3907000	3911000	Max Payne 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
3911000	3917000	as well as the special editions for that.
3917000	3923000	And last but not least, one week from today, Mario Tennis Open on the 3DS,
3923000	3927000	as well as the Midnight Purple 3DS system.
3927000	3929000	I'm sorry. I thought you said Herple.
3929000	3931000	Herple to purple.
3931000	3933000	I really want that purple 3DS, actually.
3933000	3937000	In case you're interested, apparently next week is when GameStop
3937000	3941000	is going to start selling the Avenger controller.
3941000	3943000	You know, if you want to throw money out the window, by the way.
3943000	3945000	What's the Avenger controller?
3945000	3948000	The spider controller that I showed that sucked, remember?
3948000	3949000	Oh.
3949000	3952000	That thing that was...
3952000	3955000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.
3955000	3958000	First off on the Nintendo 3DS on May 17th.
3958000	3960000	This is a mouthful. Are you ready for it?
3960000	3970000	Pachi Para 3D Omi Monogatari 2 Pachi Pro Funruko Hana Kibo 2 Urugiri no Gauken Sekkatsu.
3970000	3972000	What?
3972000	3975000	It's basically a gambling...
3975000	3977000	Beach Babes Pachinko.
3977000	3979000	Beach Babes Pachinko. You got it. That's exactly what it is.
3979000	3980000	Sweet.
3980000	3983000	And it's on the 3DS, so you know what that means.
3983000	3985000	3DS 3DS!
3985000	3986000	Woohoo!
3986000	3989000	Because that's the game we've all really wanted on the 3DS.
3989000	3991000	They've already had one of those. They're gonna make another one, too.
3991000	3993000	Well, this one was a sequel.
3993000	3994000	Oh. Well, there you go.
3994000	3997000	That's the announcement I'd like to see from Nintendo at E3 this year.
3997000	3999000	Boobs 3D!
3999000	4000000	Coming soon.
4000000	4006000	Otherwise, honestly, on any other console, I think the release dates are all the way out to the 24th.
4006000	4009000	Oh, wait, no. There are a couple things on the Sony PSP.
4009000	4012000	Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.
4012000	4014000	Regular Edition.
4014000	4016000	Uh...
4016000	4018000	What the hell is this game?
4018000	4021000	That is literally the name.
4021000	4024000	Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.
4024000	4026000	Oh my god.
4026000	4033000	This guy is carrying around this little pink bunny and he's sucking on a gigantic Pez candy or something.
4033000	4034000	I think it's like a Yowie game.
4034000	4036000	I think this is a Yowie game.
4036000	4037000	I want it.
4037000	4039000	Of course you would.
4039000	4041000	I like watching dudes make out.
4041000	4043000	I like watching ladies make out.
4043000	4045000	I like watching people make out. What am I talking about?
4045000	4049000	I'm gonna just post that in the chatroom and see who's gonna be pre-ordering that.
4049000	4051000	At least there's a variety.
4051000	4056000	See, on Nintendo handhelds this week, you can have Beach Bay Bikinis.
4056000	4061000	On the Sony PSP this week, Brothers Conflict Passion Pink.
4061000	4063000	Bunnies and sucking.
4063000	4069000	Danzai no Maria La Campanella comes out this week as well.
4069000	4074000	I don't know what this game is either, but it's a little more gothy and dark.
4074000	4077000	Dramatic Pose!
4077000	4079000	Yes, Dramatic Pose is the game.
4079000	4081000	This is worth mentioning.
4081000	4083000	Persona 2 Eternal Punishment.
4083000	4085000	I think there might be a few people interested in that one.
4085000	4088000	Finally, a really big title this week.
4088000	4090000	Persona 2 on the PSP.
4090000	4092000	Eternal Punishment.
4092000	4094000	That's it for Japanese releases.
4094000	4096000	Well, how about stuff for the UK?
4096000	4100000	On the 15th we have Pixel Junk 4 AM.
4100000	4105000	On the 16th is Ratchet and Clank HD Collection for PS3.
4105000	4107000	And on the 18th, a few things.
4107000	4110000	We have Dragon's Lair for the Xbox 360.
4110000	4113000	Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City for PC.
4113000	4115000	And Bruce Willis the Game.
4115000	4117000	I'm sorry, Max Payne 3.
4117000	4119000	I don't think the man looks good.
4119000	4121000	He looks like a different character.
4121000	4123000	Bald. Sorry.
4123000	4125000	He looks like he's trying to do that Bruce Willis thing.
4125000	4127000	I'm done.
4127000	4130000	Alright, just a few more stories before the classic game of the week.
4130000	4132000	But first, Loki.
4132000	4135000	So Assassin's Creed is being sued by a novelist.
4135000	4140000	John Bisswanger is suing them.
4140000	4147000	Because he says that Assassin's Creed stole themes and other things from his book Link.
4147000	4153000	Apparently they stole the themes of assassination and spiritual and biblical tones.
4153000	4155000	And also the battle between good and evil.
4155000	4158000	That sounds awfully generic if you ask me.
4158000	4162000	He's seeking five and a quarter million dollars in damages.
4162000	4168000	And basically saying that it could delay the release of Assassin's Creed 3.
4168000	4177000	And of course, you know, the response for it is that we understand that many gamers are upset by the litigation.
4177000	4181000	And the potential for a delay in the release of the next Assassin's Creed video game.
4181000	4190000	And as a result of that anger that had been posting negative comments on Amazon and other forums about our client and his novel Link.
4190000	4194000	However, copyright laws exist to protect the authors and creators.
4194000	4196000	And for people to exploit them.
4196000	4202000	From others who copy or create works that are under the law substantially similar.
4202000	4204000	I'm sorry. I just...
4204000	4206000	I'm not buying.
4206000	4214000	I think there's also something that was very similar to the animus that was in Assassin's Creed.
4214000	4216000	I think that's mainly the main tie in there.
4216000	4220000	But it's kind of stretching if you ask me.
4220000	4223000	I'm sure there's a lot of books that are pretty similar.
4223000	4226000	I know. I was going to say, I'm sure there's a lot of books in the world.
4226000	4227000	There's a lot of books in the world.
4227000	4232000	I'm sure if you go back even further you might be able to find traces of it somewhere else, right?
4232000	4233000	Yeah.
4233000	4234000	Surely?
4234000	4235000	I don't know.
4235000	4236000	Alright.
4236000	4237000	Moving on.
4237000	4238000	Let's talk about Zynga.
4238000	4239000	But no, no, no.
4239000	4242000	This is a story that might make you lull a little bit here.
4242000	4244000	Zynga apparently has also filed their own lawsuit.
4244000	4247000	It's against French publisher Cojobo.
4247000	4249000	Which sounds very French to me.
4249000	4252000	They have a game on Facebook called Pyramidville.
4252000	4256000	Zynga ain't having that because what's wrong with the name Pyramidville?
4256000	4260000	Oh, Zynga owns Ville apparently.
4260000	4261000	Except they don't.
4261000	4262000	They just think they do.
4262000	4270000	Zynga says that Facebook users are likely to believe erroneously that Pyramidville is a member of Zynga's Ville family of games.
4270000	4272000	That's according to the complaint.
4272000	4280000	Given Cojobo's refusal to change their game name, legal action was necessary to defend our famous marks and prevent player confusion.
4280000	4286000	Well, I am kind of confused that they have a game that's called, what is it, Dream Tower or something like that.
4286000	4289000	And it looks very similar to, you know.
4289000	4297000	But apparently, yeah, apparently they own Ville, but the same logic will not apply to Nimblebit who owns Tiny Tower.
4297000	4299000	Although I think their game is called Dream Heights, to be fair.
4299000	4300000	Dream Heights.
4300000	4301000	Still. Still.
4301000	4302000	Oh, my mistake.
4302000	4303000	Oh, okay.
4303000	4304000	Still.
4304000	4306000	Yeah, they're gonna copyright Heights now.
4306000	4309000	They just need to get back some of that money they blew on OMG Pop.
4309000	4312000	I'm sorry, but unfortunately they don't own the name Ville.
4312000	4317000	I mean, no one's gonna ever side with them in the fact that they own that as a copyright Ville.
4317000	4319000	It's not gonna happen.
4319000	4321000	And also, Ville happens to be French.
4321000	4323000	You know, French for town, so.
4323000	4327000	Well, they're gonna sue them because, you know, it's called Pyramid Town.
4327000	4328000	Pyramid Ville.
4328000	4330000	And you know what, honestly-
4330000	4332000	Mental note, guys, for the new VoG site.
4332000	4335000	Bobby, Bobby, if you're listening, we need to cancel VoG Ville.
4335000	4336000	That can't happen. No VoG Ville.
4336000	4337000	Sorry about that.
4337000	4339000	We'll just have to scratch that out.
4339000	4340000	It's gone.
4340000	4349000	Frisbee in our chatroom at VoGnetwork.com asks, so does that mean Zynga owns the song Margaritaville?
4349000	4351000	Oh, that's a good question you should ask them that.
4351000	4355000	Well, they do have a Facebook game that is Margaritaville as well.
4355000	4358000	Fifth Dream said they wanted to make a Smallville game and Zynga sued.
4358000	4360000	Let's see.
4360000	4363000	One Night Stand said I played Potville on Facebook.
4363000	4365000	Do they own that?
4365000	4370000	You know, I honestly, I hope that they lose because it's just like Monster.
4370000	4372000	Remember Monster Cables or Monster-
4372000	4373000	I don't know which one it was.
4373000	4374000	Monster Cables and Monster Energy.
4374000	4375000	They both kind of suck.
4375000	4377000	But they sue everybody that uses the name Monster.
4377000	4380000	And so, oh, people are gonna get confused.
4380000	4381000	Facebook games-
4381000	4386000	I'm gonna be the generic guy here and say, you know, they all kind of look alike anyways.
4386000	4394000	I mean, I understand that maybe this company may or may not have named their, you know, Pyramid Ville or whatever to get people confused to play their game.
4394000	4397000	Um, I don't know.
4397000	4402000	From what I hear though, they're suing them for more than they actually made on that game.
4402000	4405000	Like three times as much as they've made on that game.
4405000	4409000	And all they're doing is they're just, you know, positioning themselves-
4409000	4410000	It was Monster Cable by the way.
4410000	4412000	Yeah, well Monster Energy does it too.
4412000	4414000	Like they sued Monster Mini Golf.
4414000	4417000	It's like, okay, whatever.
4417000	4419000	Um, I don't know.
4419000	4421000	I just think it's stupid to do that.
4421000	4423000	And fuck, it's Karma, bitch.
4423000	4424000	You know?
4424000	4428000	I mean, you rip all these other people off and now you're getting yourselves ripped off.
4428000	4431000	Too bad.
4431000	4437000	Alright, let's go to a time when there was no Ville games and nobody owned that name.
4437000	4440000	It was a simpler time for video games.
4440000	4446000	Dark Soccer's gonna open up the gaming vault and find a video game she deems worthy of being the classic game of the week.
4446000	4447000	Yeah, yeah.
4447000	4449000	Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?
4449000	4451000	Streets of Rage.
4451000	4454000	I can't believe this was never the classic game of the week before.
4454000	4456000	I'm always amazed at what you pull up.
4456000	4458000	Like, I'm like, no, she had to have done this.
4458000	4459000	She had to. No.
4459000	4460000	Wiki says it's not true.
4460000	4463000	Another suggestion from my lovely husband.
4463000	4464000	Well, it's a good suggestion.
4464000	4466000	Here's a little bit of the music from Streets of Rage.
4466000	4470000	The Japanese name is Bare Knuckle Ikari No Tekken.
4470000	4474000	So, two other games have based their names off of this.
4474000	4479000	But I fucking love this music.
4479000	4482000	I wanna fucking dance.
4482000	4483000	Right now?
4483000	4484000	No.
4484000	4487000	So, which I actually have a Genesis cartridge of Bare Knuckle.
4487000	4492000	But when you play it on the American Nomad, it comes through a Streets of Rage.
4492000	4493000	Did you hear that?
4493000	4494000	That's weird.
4494000	4496000	It must read the region on the device or something.
4496000	4499000	It must.
4499000	4502000	Anyway, this was the first game, of course, in the Streets of Rage series.
4502000	4504000	There were two and three after that.
4504000	4510000	It's had multiple versions. We've had Game Gear, Mega CD, Master System.
4510000	4513000	It came out for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe.
4513000	4515000	And there's an IOS version.
4515000	4524000	There's a comic strip series that appeared in Sonic the Comic that were based off of Streets of Rage 2.
4524000	4528000	And another thing about this game is that you know who did the soundtrack, Rob?
4528000	4530000	Yuzo Koshiro Squee!
4530000	4531000	Yeah!
4531000	4532000	That's why it's fun.
4532000	4536000	By the way, if you were listening to last week's show, you know it's a big inspiration for Mega Ran as well.
4536000	4538000	Indeed.
4538000	4544000	So basically, it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up, punch-em-in-the-face.
4544000	4550000	It came out around the same time as Double Dragon and Final Fight, but it was its own thing.
4550000	4555000	And you have one special attack per life per level.
4555000	4558000	And your power-ups are shaped like police cars.
4558000	4562000	And you cannot use your special attack in level 8 at all.
4562000	4565000	It doesn't name any of the enemies.
4565000	4570000	Only in the Japanese version of the manual do the enemies have names.
4570000	4574000	Because apparently they care more than we do.
4574000	4580000	You can also play one-player or two-player co-op.
4580000	4583000	And you have multiple endings.
4583000	4586000	Of course, your enemy is Mr. X.
4586000	4593000	So you can actually end the game as a bad guy if you play in two-player mode.
4593000	4600000	So the way that it works is that you get the good ending just for finishing the game.
4600000	4603000	The bad ending, like I said, is only in two-player mode.
4603000	4605000	The boss will ask you to join him.
4605000	4608000	And one says yes and the other says no.
4608000	4613000	And so the player who said yes must prove their loyalty by killing the other player.
4613000	4621000	And if the yes player wins and then turns down the boss's offer, then he has to fight the boss alone.
4621000	4627000	And if he succeeds on the bad ending, he will be sitting in the boss's chair that says,
4627000	4630000	You became the boss, you are great.
4630000	4633000	I need a caption of me in a chair that says that.
4633000	4636000	You became the boss, you are great.
4636000	4642000	And then when the credits roll the character laughs and the word bad end appears.
4642000	4649000	If both of them say yes, the boss will test the player's loyalty by sending them back to an earlier stage.
4649000	4652000	And then they have to replay the game from that level.
4652000	4656000	So it had a little bit of interactivity to it.
4656000	4664000	So the characters in the game is Adam Hunter, who is an ex-cop and accomplished boxer.
4664000	4667000	He's slower but tougher.
4667000	4674000	And then Axel, who is an ex-cop and skilled martial artist.
4674000	4683000	And he's the middle one, who is, you know, basically all around middle speed, middle other attributes,
4683000	4686000	but he has a weak jumping ability.
4686000	4690000	And then there's Blaze Fielding, an ex-cop and judo expert.
4690000	4693000	A little weaker but she is more agile and can jump the highest.
4693000	4696000	And her kicks have the longest range.
4696000	4699000	She has throws and body slams. She's always who I use by the way.
4699000	4705000	You have the backup enforcer who is not a playable character, but he only comes out during a special attack.
4705000	4707000	He's the one good cop.
4707000	4716000	So as far as different versions, there was 8-bit versions for the Sega Game Gear and the Master System.
4716000	4721000	The Game Gear version was crap for the record and it didn't have Adam in it.
4721000	4729000	The Master System version was not actually a port from the Game Gear. It was pretty decent.
4729000	4734000	It has a boss on round 6 that is not in any other version and has no two-player support.
4734000	4739000	The Sega actually brought it out in the arcade for the Mega Touch and Mega Play arcade boards.
4739000	4747000	And in the Mega Tech version, you play for time, not for credits.
4747000	4756000	There's different collections that came out. There's Mega Games 2 that had Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi that came with the Mega Drive.
4756000	4766000	And again, that was the name in Japan and the UK for the Genesis.
4766000	4772000	There was Sega Classics Arcade which was the Mega CD version that had Super Monaco GP and Columns on it.
4772000	4777000	And also there was a cartridge version of this too.
4777000	4779000	And the voice effects in the game were redone.
4779000	4786000	Then there was the Sega Genesis 6 pack that had Streets of Rage on it, the Hedgehog, Columns, Revenge of Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Super Hang-On.
4786000	4793000	And the Mega 6 that had Streets of Rage, World Cup Italia 90, Columns, Super Monaco GP, Revenge of Shinobi, and Song of the Hedgehog.
4793000	4798000	There was a version of the Sega Gems collection for the GameCube and PS2.
4798000	4805000	They actually took it out of the North American version so that they wouldn't give it a T rating.
4805000	4807000	You can get it on Game Chat by the way.
4807000	4815000	And then they're all in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 on the Wii Virtual Console.
4815000	4822000	And there was the Streets of Rage by Blaze Europe that was handheld.
4822000	4835000	And there's the iOS version. Now this is the thing that has come up on the show before was the fact that there was the Streets of Rage remix.
4835000	4841000	That I believe, and I have it, I haven't played through it, but it was like all three of the games combined.
4841000	4844000	Just in, I guess, continuous levels.
4844000	4853000	Of course they were asked to take it down so it was stopped, but hey, clearly there are still fans in the series.
4853000	4860000	And you can get the soundtracks, which of course we said was done by Yuzo Koshiro.
4860000	4867000	And the second one and the third one had work done on it by Multihiro Kawashino.
4867000	4869000	So there you go.
4869000	4872000	Bare Knuckle, Yukari no Tekken.
4872000	4874000	Your classic game of the week.
4874000	4878000	Bare Knuckle, or as many of you know it, Streets of Rage.
4878000	4879000	The first one.
4879000	4880000	Yes.
4880000	4887000	Available on the Genesis or Mega Drive and tons and tons of systems after that in various revivals.
4887000	4888000	Indeed.
4888000	4890000	Alright, we're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere guys.
4890000	4894000	We've got more of Orange Lawn's radio coming up in a little bit, including the FUGL question of the week.
4894000	4897000	And guess what we're bringing back tonight, we haven't played this in a little while.
4897000	4902000	Listless tonight! Woo hoo! And I'll tell you guys the topic in just a little while.
4902000	4906000	So stay tuned for part B and more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4912000	4915000	Welcome back everybody to the show wherever gamer has a voice.
4915000	4920000	Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday, May the 13th of 2012.
4920000	4922000	Mother's Day once again.
4922000	4924000	To those of you that joined us a little late live tonight.
4924000	4928000	A happy Mother's Day to all the gaming mommies who are listening or the geeky mommies.
4928000	4931000	Or mother figures in people's lives or pets lives.
4931000	4937000	And everybody that somebody or something could call a mother happy day to all of you out there.
4937000	4941000	We are of course live as we are every Sunday night on VOG Network.
4941000	4943000	www.vognetwork.com
4943000	4948000	Still kind of a skeleton site there, but lots of exciting stuff to come in the next couple weeks.
4948000	4954000	Been starting to see some behind the scenes things of what's being planned and it's going to be a good time.
4954000	4958000	So looking forward to phase 2 which will be around the beginning of June.
4958000	4960000	You're not the one having to play in Photoshop Rob.
4960000	4962000	You know what?
4962000	4968000	I am heading up the future of the radio, I mean although VOG is going to be more than a radio station.
4968000	4972000	Which I think sometimes people forget because that's all it is kind of right now is the radio station and chat room.
4972000	4974000	I am going to be heading up the radio station part of it.
4974000	4978000	So I am trying to put some of the final touches on the 24-7 music feed.
4978000	4980000	I am giving you a hard time.
4980000	4983000	I know, but I am just saying that is going live soon and the other shows.
4983000	4986000	I spent minutes going through music.
4986000	4990000	If you want to recommend a show for the network get in touch with me.
4990000	4996000	You can find me idling throughout the week in the VOG chat room or rob at www.orangelandradio.com
4996000	4998000	is a great place to email me at.
4998000	5000000	I will have my VOG network address set up soon.
5000000	5002000	But that's a good place.
5002000	5006000	We are actually not really looking for a lot of more gamer shows.
5006000	5008000	Because we have a few now.
5008000	5012000	Can we set up a VOG network email account that doesn't get as much spam as we do now?
5012000	5014000	Actually yes.
5014000	5016000	I have to talk to you offline about how that's going to work.
5016000	5018000	But yes, yes you can.
5018000	5024000	So yeah, if you have a show that's of good audio quality is very important.
5024000	5028000	I especially am looking for live shows.
5028000	5030000	It's a huge, huge draw.
5030000	5032000	It can be anything about geek.
5032000	5034000	Anything geek.
5034000	5035000	Music geek.
5035000	5036000	Comic geek.
5036000	5037000	TV geek.
5037000	5038000	Movie geek.
5038000	5040000	Book geek.
5040000	5042000	Oh my god a book club show would be awesome.
5042000	5046000	Anything that you think qualifies as geek get in touch with me.
5046000	5052000	I'm looking for most of all audio quality and consistency is hugely important too.
5052000	5057000	If you can't be bothered to do the show regularly then we can't make it work.
5057000	5062000	But if you're willing to commit, we'll do what we can to help you grow an audience.
5062000	5065000	So there you go. Rob at Orensalterator.com.
5065000	5067000	Alright.
5067000	5069000	Anyhow, let's move on.
5069000	5070000	Get into some gaming news.
5070000	5072000	We need a board game podcast.
5072000	5078000	A board, especially, oh my god there's some crazy board games out there with like eleveny billion pieces.
5078000	5085000	And I know people that I get invited to these board game parties that some friends of mine have probably about every other month or so.
5085000	5088000	And I didn't get to go to the last one because I had a conflict.
5088000	5093000	But I went to the first one that I was invited to a couple weeks or a couple months ago and I had a blast.
5093000	5096000	And they have like shelves and shelves in their house just full of board games.
5096000	5098000	And played some new stuff I never heard of in my life.
5098000	5100000	Yeah a board game podcast would rock.
5100000	5103000	Wait a second Bobby, no bronies or wrestling?
5103000	5107000	I don't know if wrestling is geeky.
5107000	5110000	Bronies, let's hear your ideas.
5110000	5114000	I wouldn't necessarily say no to that but it's got to be real good.
5114000	5116000	Real good.
5116000	5120000	Alright, let's move on to cover some video game news.
5120000	5122000	Lowkey, rapid fire news.
5122000	5125000	So Bioshock Infinite's been delayed to 2013.
5125000	5133000	They basically made the excuse that it's to put some more polish on the game and apparently that they're working on multiplayer.
5133000	5136000	Because you know every game needs multiplayer.
5136000	5142000	It will not be coming out in October as originally planned.
5142000	5147000	It is now scheduled for February 26th, 2013.
5147000	5150000	So that's when you can look forward to that.
5150000	5155000	Certain analysts would let you think that Grand Theft Auto will be coming out that day.
5155000	5157000	Or October instead.
5157000	5160000	Which, don't get me wrong, I would love that.
5160000	5162000	I would love that, love that, love that.
5162000	5165000	I'd also love it if it comes out in 2013.
5165000	5170000	But yes, the sooner the better. That's my theory.
5170000	5174000	I'm just saying though, Bioshock, the delay sucks.
5174000	5178000	But at the same time, if they need the time to make the game better, then take it.
5178000	5184000	We have to remember, as much as this news might disappoint, don't rush a game that needs to be good.
5184000	5185000	Like this.
5185000	5187000	Bioshock Infinite needs to be good.
5187000	5189000	So take your time.
5189000	5195000	Modern Warfare 3 is getting some new content.
5195000	5205000	They're getting a brand new mode, which is called Face Off. It's meant for one-on-one or two-versus-two kind of deathmatch, team deathmatch type stuff.
5205000	5209000	They're actually putting out four maps, two of which are going to be free.
5209000	5211000	And those new maps are Ground and Erosion.
5211000	5215000	The Ground is a map with a run-of-ground ship.
5215000	5218000	And Erosion, I don't remember the hell that one was.
5218000	5219000	But it looked cool.
5219000	5221000	So that's going to be coming out.
5221000	5229000	Also, of course, two more maps that you can buy, which will be also part of the content collection.
5229000	5235000	So if you happen to be a paid subscriber of Call of Duty Elite, you'll be getting those for free.
5235000	5239000	And, well, you're paid for with your subscription.
5239000	5241000	But no additional cost, I guess.
5241000	5247000	And those will be coming out on May 15th for Elite subscribers.
5247000	5251000	And I guess everybody else on Xbox on May 21st.
5251000	5259000	And then Content Collection 2 is also going to include new multiplayer maps, Sanctuary, Foundation, and Oasis.
5259000	5263000	And two new Spec-Op missions, including Ironclad and Killswitch.
5263000	5265000	Ironclad being one where you get to drive a tank.
5265000	5271000	And Killswitch is a sniper and infiltration mission.
5271000	5275000	So, yeah. Looks kind of neat.
5275000	5281000	And then, last but not least, we have LEGO Batman 2 coming out pretty soon.
5281000	5284000	And LEGO Harry Potter is obviously done with.
5284000	5287000	So, what the hell is going to be the next LEGO game?
5287000	5294000	Well, the next series is supposed to be coming out, which happened to be leaked out on the LEGO toys themselves.
5294000	5299000	LEGO Lord of the Rings will be the next series from Traveler's Tales.
5299000	5304000	And will, of course, be published by Warner Brothers, since they have the Lord of the Rings license.
5304000	5308000	So, look for that sometime this summer.
5308000	5312000	And that's kind of neat, I guess.
5312000	5316000	I don't know how that would play, but I know it's going to be popular, especially with the new movie coming out.
5316000	5319000	Well, yeah. And those LEGO games are kind of always big sleeper hits.
5319000	5323000	Like, they might not seem huge to the core gamer.
5323000	5327000	They don't seem like such a big deal, but they're hugely family-friendly games.
5327000	5330000	And lots of the family owners get those games.
5330000	5332000	So, those LEGO games are always a pretty big deal.
5332000	5335000	Except for Rock Band, maybe didn't do as well.
5335000	5338000	It was a neat idea, you know? To be honest, it was a neat idea.
5338000	5347000	And it was a game that I got a copy of, just to download those songs for Rock Band.
5347000	5351000	Yeah, me too, because I found it for like $9.99. I was like, alright, I'll just get those songs.
5351000	5356000	And the songs were pretty fucking awesome. So, I don't know, it wasn't so bad.
5356000	5359000	DJ Morpheus in our chat room says, watch out for LEGO Twilight.
5359000	5362000	Well, here's the problem.
5362000	5365000	It's interesting. The premise is you just sit around and wait.
5365000	5369000	Yeah, I was going to say, here's the problem. There's no content to base a game around of.
5369000	5372000	I mean, unless ripping off your shirt.
5372000	5376000	Honestly, what would be funny for Twilight or something like that is like a microgame thing.
5376000	5382000	You know, like WarioWare. Rip off shirt. Brute. Stare at the wall for months.
5382000	5385000	You know, you're like spinning the clock to make the time go faster.
5385000	5386000	Sparkle.
5386000	5391000	Sparkle. You know, that would be pretty funny. I could see that.
5391000	5393000	Doo doo doo doo.
5393000	5400000	Block Bella from getting eaten by vampires because she poked herself with a knife and is now spewing blood.
5400000	5403000	Alright, you're getting a little too carried away there.
5403000	5409000	My wife is starting to read Fifty Shades of Grey and she says it's the worst thing ever. The worst thing.
5409000	5415000	Alright, moving on. Wolfenstein 3D. Remember that game?
5415000	5416000	Hell yeah.
5416000	5423000	Well, if you do remember that game, congrats. You're old because Wolfenstein 3D celebrated its 20th anniversary this week.
5423000	5424000	It's only been 20 years.
5424000	5430000	Yeah, I remember downloading that demo from a local BBS back in the day.
5430000	5437000	I remember buying that shareware demo. Well, it wasn't a demo. It was the full first campaign, so it was pretty awesome.
5437000	5438000	Yeah.
5438000	5441000	On a floppy disk at a flea market.
5441000	5448000	Shareware demos used to be the shit. Yeah, it was all of episode one and then if you wanted episodes two through six, that's what you bought.
5448000	5454000	It'd be like getting the full game and then you'd have to buy the DLC later on.
5454000	5455000	Yeah, yeah.
5455000	5456000	Not bad.
5456000	5460000	It's awesome. So, anyhow, Wolfenstein 3D. How did they celebrate their 20th anniversary?
5460000	5464000	Well, Wolfenstein 3D is now playable in web browsers completely free.
5464000	5470000	Wolfenstein.bethsoft.com because Bethesda has the IP now.
5470000	5477000	You can also pick it up on the iPhone devices for free. I believe that was only on the actual anniversary, though, which was on the 9th.
5477000	5481000	I don't think it's free anymore. I will say this. I picked it up and I played it.
5481000	5491000	And, you know, it's a 20-year-old game, but they up-rezzed some things and they added a map to it, which was pretty cool.
5491000	5497000	They did at least make some tweaks to the IOS version. The only thing is it controls, like, shit, like all iPhone games do.
5497000	5498000	I mean, what a shocker.
5498000	5503000	I'm not positive, but that may have been the first game I modded.
5503000	5511000	I remember an old-ass map editor that you could download, that you could make your own maps, and you could, like, spell fuck out of the walls.
5511000	5517000	We used to make crazy maps. We used to make gore mods where we would take, like, a shareware paint editor and just,
5517000	5520000	add more blood, add more blood, add more blood. That was it.
5520000	5528000	Or just have the giant room and put, like, 50 enemies in the giant, just, it's all it is, just one giant room.
5528000	5532000	We used to make mazes out of the moving blocks. Like, just put a ton of moving blocks everywhere.
5532000	5535000	It was awesome.
5535000	5536000	Nice.
5536000	5542000	Kingdom Hearts. A lot of people are excited about the Kingdom Hearts 3D version, or Dream Drop Distance.
5542000	5546000	Get excited about this. There's going to be a demo coming out.
5546000	5547000	That's pretty cool.
5547000	5552000	The 3D, for the 3DS. That's pretty awesome that Nintendo's embracing those demos a little more.
5552000	5559000	It is going to be the Traverse Town demo that's already out in Japan. It's going to be here in North America as well.
5559000	5563000	No clue when, but hopefully soon.
5563000	5567000	They also, they announced some AR cards for that as well, pre-order bonus thing.
5567000	5571000	That's right, huh? Is that the Nintendo AR cards where you can get the little pictures of?
5571000	5573000	Yeah, it's something that ties in with the game.
5573000	5576000	What they haven't announced yet is there's going to be a collector's edition.
5576000	5577000	Is there?
5577000	5578000	There's going to be a collector's edition.
5578000	5579000	What's the collector's edition going to have, Dino?
5579000	5580000	I have no fucking clue.
5580000	5581000	Alright.
5581000	5582000	There's going to be one.
5582000	5583000	Of course there's going to be a collector's edition.
5583000	5584000	They're going to announce it this week.
5584000	5585000	Stickers.
5585000	5587000	Stickers or something, I'm sure.
5587000	5589000	I know it's more than stickers.
5589000	5594000	Stickers' theater rhythm got stylus and stickers, but no.
5594000	5597000	Okay, so I wasn't too far off base suggesting stickers.
5597000	5598000	Yeah.
5598000	5600000	Maybe a soundtrack. How about a soundtrack?
5600000	5603000	It could be, yeah. I don't know.
5603000	5605000	What's the theme song for Dream Drop Distance?
5605000	5606000	I have no clue.
5606000	5607000	I don't know.
5607000	5608000	Alright.
5608000	5611000	They've always just been kind of using the same one from like, was it one?
5611000	5614000	They're kind of like doing the score version of one.
5614000	5624000	Alright, and moving on into what could soon be the trial of the century with one of gaming's most important people, Beyonce Knowles.
5624000	5625000	Ugh.
5625000	5629000	After all, she was the spokeswoman for the DS, not the 3DS, but the DS.
5629000	5634000	Remember when her and Carrie Underwood were doing those ultra-cute, hey girls play games too, hee hee, commercials.
5634000	5635000	How'd that work out?
5635000	5640000	Well, the DS sold 11 billion units, so I'd say pretty well.
5640000	5642000	Well, Beyonce told me to buy it, so I have to buy it.
5642000	5643000	That's right.
5643000	5646000	I wasn't, I'm not going to play anything Beyonce's not playing.
5646000	5653000	All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, give me money.
5653000	5658000	Anyhow, Gate 5, you might remember this company is suing Beyonce.
5658000	5660000	Why are they suing Beyonce?
5660000	5665000	Because, remember, Beyonce was supposed to have like, there was supposed to be like this uber Beyonce music game that was going to come out.
5665000	5670000	And Beyonce said, nope, not going to work.
5670000	5677000	Gate 5 apparently said to Beyonce, you continue to negotiate right up until the time you pull the plug.
5677000	5683000	And the judge said, that's not going to work with me, according to what Beyonce's lawyer said.
5683000	5686000	So Star Power Beyonce was the game.
5686000	5690000	Its cancellation resulted in the firings of 70 employees.
5690000	5699000	And Gate 5 is suing for 100 million in damages, 6.7 in investment capital, and 100 million in hypothetical profits.
5699000	5700000	Hypothetical.
5700000	5702000	Hypothetical. Hypothetical.
5702000	5710000	So they're suggesting that they were going to sell, that's actually not that much, that's almost like 200,000 copies.
5710000	5711000	I mean, that's not too bad.
5711000	5720000	Essentially what this decision has done is said, Gate 5 has enough information to proceed to an actual court.
5720000	5721000	And it is going to go to court.
5721000	5726000	Unless, of course, there's a settlement, which usually when things get this far along will inevitably happen.
5726000	5729000	And I'm sure all parties are being strongly encouraged to settle.
5729000	5731000	But as of right now...
5731000	5739000	Can you imagine what would have happened to that nameless puzzle game that Paris Hilton was, you know, putting out?
5739000	5741000	If Paris Hilton had backed out.
5741000	5743000	Like, it may have sold more copies.
5743000	5747000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sagra.
5747000	5749000	Okay, other stuff.
5749000	5763000	Well, for people who are like me, Hatsune Miku fans, there is a crystal white Vita coming out that's coming with the Hatsune Miku limited edition.
5763000	5769000	It's a crystal white Vita with an exclusive rear touch design that has Miku on it.
5769000	5775000	And it will be shipped on August 30th with the next Project Diva game.
5775000	5778000	So, that's pretty neat.
5778000	5785000	And then, there's new download content for Dance Central.
5785000	5787000	Sorry, Dance Central 2.
5787000	5793000	That will be the Spice Girls spice up your life.
5793000	5795000	Fuck yeah!
5795000	5798000	And then, Hello Good Morning by Diddy Dirty Money.
5798000	5803000	And Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest and Florida's Low.
5803000	5805000	Who cares?
5805000	5813000	And then, moving on, Marvel's Avengers Battle for Earth will be on Kinect and Wii U, Ubisoft.
5813000	5821000	So, it's well interesting. It's actually being done by Ubisoft Quebec.
5821000	5825000	And you use the motion controls to fight off the scroll.
5825000	5827000	Yay.
5827000	5829000	That's it.
5829000	5833000	You know, the whole game idea sounded cool until they mentioned Kinect.
5833000	5835000	And it's just like, eh, it's not going to be very good.
5835000	5842000	I think they're probably going to base it off their Kinect Heroes game or something that they had. Remember that?
5842000	5847000	Where it's like, you're superheroes and you get to fight each other and it's fun with Kinect.
5847000	5849000	And then, it didn't sell.
5849000	5851000	It doesn't say.
5853000	5855000	Hey, Jamie.
5864000	5866000	You're having a good time.
5866000	5868000	I didn't know she'd feel fine.
5868000	5870000	You know they're going to make you do that too.
5870000	5872000	Exactly.
5874000	5876000	Hey, let's go to Foogle.
5882000	5885000	We combine Facebook and Google Plus and we get Foogle.
5885000	5888000	And that's where we ask you a question every week of our listeners.
5888000	5890000	And we read your answers live on air.
5892000	5897000	Alright, so we're going to get to a story here about this $99 Xbox here shortly.
5897000	5907000	So our question is, how would you feel if the Xbox Next 720 lube, whatever we're calling it, cost $499,
5907000	5914000	but had a subsidized $299 option for a several year Xbox Gold commitment?
5914000	5917000	This is something we hypothesized last week when the story first got brought up.
5917000	5923000	Assuming the specs are all top of the line, is the subsidized console something you would consider buying?
5923000	5925000	Why or why not?
5925000	5930000	So would you buy a subsidized next gen console, assuming it's all the top of the line features you want,
5930000	5936000	say they knock $200 off the price, you know, for a two or three year commitment for Xbox Gold.
5936000	5938000	Would you do it?
5938000	5940000	It would not be that different from what they do for the iPhones, right?
5940000	5942000	No, I would not.
5942000	5944000	No you would not, you say?
5944000	5946000	No, I said no I would not and no I would not.
5946000	5948000	No you would not. Why wouldn't you?
5948000	5953000	I wouldn't because I've learned well enough from buying in at launches of all these different consoles and stuff
5953000	5959000	A lot of launch titles aren't that great, and you're gonna deal with all the launch bugs and all that fun stuff,
5959000	5967000	so if I'm interested in buying a console like that, I'm just gonna save up the money that's required to buy outright to begin with.
5967000	5974000	Because who knows, if it takes you a long time to save up money, like say for example, you know, $499,
5974000	5979000	are you really gonna tell me that within two years time that console isn't gonna drop in price?
5979000	5982000	It's gonna fucking drop in price, and you're still paying fucking money for it.
5982000	5988000	Alright, well let's get to some answers from Google Plus first, we have AJ on Google Plus says,
5988000	5990000	I wouldn't mind, sounds like a good deal.
5990000	5993000	It's like buying a cell phone for the discounted price in a two year agreement.
5993000	5997000	Would you really want to buy an Xbox and not want to use it online?
5997000	5999000	Going to some of the Facebook answers,
5999000	6004000	Tiara W, we love Tiara from Geek Life, geek-life.com says,
6004000	6007000	It would need to be more than just the basic model to make it worth the money.
6007000	6013000	The $99 360 sounded like a good deal, even with the extra $5 a month for the gold subscription,
6013000	6016000	until I heard it was for the 4GB console.
6016000	6022000	I can't even put most of my saved games on that little space, let alone save any games to my hard drive.
6022000	6029000	Doug T says, I won't be considering buying the next Xbox console system until it is out for at least a year.
6029000	6033000	I lost faith with Microsoft due to the Xbox 360 having so many red rings,
6033000	6038000	and Microsoft's slow response time to correct the issue and help people out who experienced it.
6038000	6043000	Very interesting perspective from Doug, somewhat similar to what you said, a little bit.
6043000	6047000	Well, it's just, you know, if I'm going to be that strapped for cash,
6047000	6051000	which I always find a way to buy those consoles at launch because I get excited about it,
6051000	6056000	but let's just say, you know, I'm strapped for cash and I just can't buy it at launch,
6056000	6060000	I don't think it's going to be that horrible.
6060000	6063000	I mean, I've got a console that I'm playing tons of games on.
6063000	6066000	It's just, you know, not even necessary.
6066000	6070000	I mean, they're not going to repeat themselves with the whole red ring of death thing.
6070000	6072000	I mean, they're not that dumb.
6072000	6074000	And technology's gotten a lot better now.
6074000	6080000	I mean, the chips are on, you know, we've got like 20nm chips now that run way cooler,
6080000	6082000	way more power efficient and stuff like that.
6082000	6086000	So overheating isn't as big of a problem anymore,
6086000	6089000	and I think that they know that they don't want to do that again
6089000	6096000	because they're just going to lose all sorts of trust in their consumers if they fuck it up again.
6096000	6102000	So, I mean, I don't think that's really an issue, but if it's going to be that expensive, though,
6102000	6104000	I just have to see what my options are.
6104000	6108000	And if there's really something at launch that I have to, have to, have to have,
6108000	6114000	which I don't really know if there's going to be anything at launch that I really, really need.
6114000	6118000	I'll just have to wait and see what they have and also what it's going to cost
6118000	6121000	and if it's something that I can wait, I can wait and purchase it later on,
6121000	6126000	when it goes on sale or when, you know, within a couple years time,
6126000	6128000	you're not going to tell me that you're going to be able to find a used cop,
6128000	6130000	a used system or something like that.
6130000	6133000	There's ways to get it cheaper and having to, you know,
6133000	6136000	since you're going to be stuck in a contract for multiple years,
6136000	6139000	why would you do that when there's an opportunity to either save up money
6139000	6142000	or you just wait for the drop in price.
6142000	6144000	Alright, well, let's check out some different answers.
6144000	6148000	Peter Uno in our chat room says to, not chat, but Facebook says,
6148000	6149000	to be perfectly honest, fuck yes.
6149000	6151000	If you get a lot of use out of Xbox Live,
6151000	6153000	then it's definitely worth taking the discount on the console.
6153000	6155000	You do end up paying less overall.
6155000	6158000	It only works if you get a lot of use out of your console and subscription though.
6158000	6162000	And yeah, the console in question had better be semi-decent too.
6162000	6164000	But you're not saving money though.
6164000	6166000	You're spending $40 more than you would have paid separately.
6166000	6169000	Well, you know, it would, you know, we, it's,
6169000	6172000	we're making up a hypothetical situation so we don't really know.
6172000	6176000	And to be honest, Dart Charger replied and said,
6176000	6178000	having the option, this is a very sensible answer by the way,
6178000	6181000	having the option for a subsidized version doesn't bother me,
6181000	6184000	though I would almost always opt for the one-time fee.
6184000	6187000	The actual value will all depend on the games and features of the unit
6187000	6190000	along with hopefully better reliability on launch.
6190000	6192000	That's a very sensible answer.
6192000	6193000	I pretty much agree with that.
6193000	6195000	One more answer from Chiggers we'll read here.
6195000	6198000	I say it depends on how much the monthly gold subscription is.
6198000	6201000	If that amount times however many months the commitment is,
6201000	6204000	rather than what it would be if I bought the damn thing straight up,
6204000	6205000	then I say, fuck you.
6205000	6209000	If I don't save any money by doing it that way, then why bother?
6209000	6210000	There you go.
6210000	6211000	If I didn't read your answer, sorry about that.
6211000	6212000	We had a lot of answers.
6212000	6214000	But send those via email if you feel strongly.
6214000	6217000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6217000	6219000	And I mean, and if they, if the problem is,
6219000	6221000	they got to know what the other company is doing
6221000	6224000	because if they come out and say, okay, our system is $499.
6224000	6227000	You can get it for $299 and blah, blah, blah.
6227000	6232000	And Sony's like, well, our system just costs $299, so.
6232000	6234000	I have to admit going into that question,
6234000	6236000	I kind of assumed I would be in the camp of, yes,
6236000	6238000	I would just go ahead and do it because I'm going to get the system anyway
6238000	6240000	and I have Xbox anyway.
6240000	6246000	But I kind of think Doug's answer was right on the money because, you know,
6246000	6248000	I did rush out and buy an Xbox 360.
6248000	6252000	I was tracking what Best Buy in the area actually had it.
6252000	6254000	I remember when they were so hard to get when they first came out.
6254000	6255000	Oh, yeah.
6255000	6257000	And then I finally was able to get one,
6257000	6259000	but it was the one without the hard drive,
6259000	6262000	so I had to buy the hard drive separately and ended up paying like $40 more.
6262000	6264000	And then the fucking thing died on me after a week.
6264000	6265000	I was so mad.
6265000	6269000	Mine didn't die after a week, but yeah, I remember doing that.
6269000	6271000	So irritating.
6271000	6273000	Got mine on Craigslist.
6273000	6274000	Yeah.
6274000	6277000	Anyway, let's get back into some more gaming news.
6277000	6279000	Thank you to everybody who answered the Google question,
6279000	6280000	whether I read it or not.
6280000	6281000	All right.
6281000	6286000	Well, let's talk a little bit about, you know, this $99 Xbox.
6286000	6289000	Of course, it was rumored last week and it ended up being true.
6289000	6293000	So Microsoft stores are offering it for $99.
6293000	6295000	Of course, there's a two-year contract
6295000	6300000	and you're going to pay $14.99 a month for those two years,
6300000	6302000	so it ends up being about $460,
6302000	6307000	which is roughly $40 more than you would have paid separately.
6307000	6309000	But if that's what you want to do, then you could do that.
6309000	6314000	However, it is only through the Microsoft stores.
6314000	6317000	You know, remember, Microsoft has actual physical retail stores,
6317000	6319000	21 of them in the United States,
6319000	6322000	and those are the only ones that are offering said deal.
6322000	6327000	And now, the thing is, this is supposed to be part of a pilot program,
6327000	6332000	so the whole conspiracy theory that, you know,
6332000	6336000	this may be happening for the next system is not that unwarranted.
6336000	6339000	They're also saying that, right now, I guess,
6339000	6343000	oh, 16 of the Microsoft stores are offering this.
6343000	6348000	I thought it was 21. Maybe some of those are out of country.
6348000	6351000	I bet you're right. I bet some of them are out of country.
6351000	6354000	It must be. I just looked that up real quick.
6354000	6356000	I seriously think the closest one to us is in, like, Phoenix,
6356000	6358000	or maybe there's one in L.A.
6358000	6359000	There is one in L.A.
6359000	6361000	Yeah, but none in Northern California.
6361000	6363000	Bay Area, there's one.
6363000	6364000	Is there really one in the Bay Area?
6364000	6366000	Yeah.
6366000	6368000	Cupertino, I think, has one.
6368000	6369000	How ironic.
6369000	6371000	In their mall.
6371000	6373000	I've been to that mall.
6373000	6376000	Yeah, I think there's one down there, but that's a close one.
6376000	6380000	It was probably about 12 years ago, but I've been to that mall.
6380000	6385000	So, I mean, this, yeah, it could very well happen with the next console.
6385000	6386000	I think that's what they're testing out.
6386000	6388000	They're seeing a response from this.
6388000	6391000	If that's the case, then they may move forward with, you know,
6391000	6395000	GameStop doing something like this, or, you know, the retailer.
6395000	6397000	I don't know.
6397000	6399000	Why not Best Buy or something?
6399000	6400000	They could.
6400000	6401000	Because they sell the mobile phones.
6401000	6404000	I think, if anything, Best Buy would be a good choice,
6404000	6407000	because, yeah, they do the whole mobile phone stuff.
6407000	6410000	Even, like, Walmart or something like that, they do mobile phones
6410000	6413000	and that kind of, you know, service.
6413000	6416000	Hell, I mean, I don't know.
6416000	6420000	You could get some sort of partner deal with, like, AT&T or something.
6420000	6422000	Who knows?
6422000	6423000	All right.
6423000	6428000	Well, a lot of stuff going on in the handheld world in regards to price drops.
6428000	6430000	The price of the DS has dropped.
6430000	6432000	Nope, I'm not talking about the 3DS.
6432000	6433000	I'm talking about the DSi.
6433000	6437000	For some weird reason, for the longest time, the DSi and the DSi XL
6437000	6439000	had still retained their old prices.
6439000	6442000	It cost just as much for a DSi XL as it did for a 3DS.
6442000	6445000	I know because Alan wanted one for his birth, or, no, for Christmas,
6445000	6446000	and I bought him one.
6446000	6450000	I was like, you want a DSi XL and not a 3DS?
6450000	6453000	But, I mean, the screens on those things really are gorgeous,
6453000	6456000	so I wish they would make a 3DS XL.
6456000	6458000	I shouldn't say that.
6458000	6460000	Your wish has been granted.
6460000	6461000	Shit.
6461000	6463000	Here at E3, we will announce more shit like,
6463000	6467000	hey, you know, we really should have put second analog stick on there.
6467000	6469000	Oops.
6469000	6473000	But, hey, you can buy this new system in fancy colors that you want.
6473000	6479000	Get it for only $99 when you agree to buy 1,000 Nintendo points a month.
6479000	6480000	All right.
6480000	6485000	DSi is dropping to $100, and the DSi XL is dropping to $130.
6485000	6489000	Those prices are effective May 20th, so I wouldn't go buy one now.
6489000	6493000	But, you know, that's not a bad deal for a DSi, 100 bucks.
6493000	6495000	They are still pretty good systems.
6495000	6497000	But, I don't know, I kind of think if you're going to invest,
6497000	6499000	you might as well kick it up to the 3DS,
6499000	6502000	but maybe you really want something to play your advanced games on.
6502000	6504000	But the DSi XL is still a pretty good deal.
6504000	6506000	That's a $50 price drop, by the way.
6506000	6508000	It was $170, now it's going to be one.
6508000	6511000	Oh, I take that back, $40, because it's going to be $129.99,
6511000	6513000	which is basically $130.
6513000	6514000	So, there you go.
6514000	6516000	Apparently, I think there will also be.
6516000	6522000	Oh, this is all happening the same day as the launch of the purple 3DS.
6522000	6525000	So, lots of Nintendo handheld stuff all happening in one day.
6525000	6531000	The Aqua Blue 3DS, on the other hand, it is being discontinued in Japan.
6531000	6533000	Now, don't feel too bad for it,
6533000	6536000	because there's already all these other colors in Japan, including black,
6536000	6539000	and I think there's another shade of blue available in Japan, too,
6539000	6543000	like the more regular blue.
6543000	6546000	But it is kind of interesting that they're getting rid of one of the colors completely, I guess,
6546000	6552000	especially one of the launch colors, but interesting.
6552000	6555000	Maybe it just wasn't selling very well.
6555000	6556000	Black Wolf in our chat room says,
6556000	6562000	Why did you buy Alan what he wanted? You should have gotten him what he should have wanted.
6562000	6565000	I really should do that next time.
6565000	6567000	Although, he was standing with me in the store, and I was like,
6567000	6569000	All right, what do you want for Christmas? Pick something.
6569000	6571000	He's like, I want a DSi XL. Really?
6571000	6573000	You answered incorrectly.
6573000	6575000	Zonk!
6575000	6580000	You chose poorly. You will now disintegrate.
6580000	6582000	Not all the news is about the 3DS, though.
6582000	6585000	There's also news about the Vita's in regards to how many they've sold.
6585000	6590000	1.8 million Vitas sold worldwide.
6590000	6591000	That's not bad.
6591000	6593000	That's not bad.
6593000	6600000	That's, what, 600,000 since late February when they last reported their sales figures, which is 1.2 million.
6600000	6602000	That's not bad.
6602000	6608000	It's not incredible, but it's not like the system's dead.
6608000	6610000	I don't know.
6610000	6616000	All right. Let's go ahead and move on to the mailbag.
6616000	6621000	Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6621000	6624000	And we'll choose some of your emails to read here live on air.
6624000	6627000	A few of them.
6627000	6630000	I will start at the beginning. We only had three.
6630000	6633000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
6633000	6637000	One day and 15 hours left. I've been waiting 10 years for this.
6637000	6641000	I thought about taking a day off to play, but I can't justify the loss of income.
6641000	6643000	I'm hoping it's a rainy weekend.
6643000	6645000	Diablo and Rain go together.
6645000	6650000	To pass the time until the release, I'm playing Dead Space 2, which I bought on Steam sale about six months ago.
6650000	6653000	I play at night with my headphones on and a candle lit.
6653000	6657000	My wife gets a kick out of hearing me yell like a girl.
6657000	6659000	It's probably the scariest game I've ever played.
6659000	6660000	Any of you play it?
6660000	6664000	I'm like Rob with game ADD, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.
6664000	6668000	Plus, I heard that the end boss is mind-blowing.
6668000	6672000	See you at the Skeleton King, mysterious turtle. Love the vlog network, kiddos.
6672000	6677000	I have not played Dead Space 2, but I've heard that it's super scary.
6677000	6681000	Somebody else starts to ask, acidic vampire in chatroom says, excellent game.
6681000	6683000	So you have one supporter there in the chatroom, at least.
6683000	6686000	I will be on board with the Diablo 3 train.
6686000	6688000	I'll be choo-chooing along too.
6688000	6691000	Yeah, it helps when the Warcraft addicts are all getting it for free.
6691000	6692000	I know, right?
6692000	6693000	Next email.
6693000	6701000	Hey, OLR. Specifically, I should be addressing both Rob and Shane.
6701000	6704000	What's up with your taste in men? Kaiden is not that fabulous.
6704000	6706000	Get off my show.
6706000	6710000	I ended up taking Ashley on to Mass Effect 2 instead of Kaiden.
6710000	6712000	I've yet to play 3.
6712000	6715000	I just feel like there are much better fish in the galaxy.
6715000	6718000	Also, Shane needs to call in more.
6718000	6721000	Hearing him always makes me giggle, and he's always got something interesting to say,
6721000	6725000	even if it's just to call in and say hello with no particular topic in mind.
6725000	6729000	A show without a call from him just isn't complete for me heart, heart, heart.
6729000	6731000	Shane has a stalker fan.
6731000	6733000	Don't inflate his ego, for God's sake.
6733000	6735000	And you're especially not going to score points.
6735000	6736000	Can I finish reading, Rob?
6736000	6741000	No, you're not going to score points when you're dogging on Kaiden.
6741000	6745000	Yes, there's all kinds of homo all up in this email. Deal with it.
6745000	6747000	I love you all, Ospher.
6747000	6752000	I love DarkTetsuya. Gay hate mail. Is this a first on OLR?
6752000	6755000	Sadly, no. I don't think it is.
6755000	6759000	This last one is a link, and I'm afraid to follow it.
6759000	6761000	Alright.
6761000	6766000	You're here because one of your friends has invited you. Page loading, please wait.
6766000	6767000	Uh, no.
6767000	6768000	I will say this.
6768000	6770000	Thank you for spamming us, listener.
6770000	6772000	AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,
6772000	6774000	Ash does have some great scenes in Mass Effect 3.
6774000	6776000	She gets fucking smashed.
6776000	6779000	Well, see, I'll probably take her, because I'm going for full-on lesbian.
6779000	6783000	Doesn't that? She's not a lesbian romance option, sadly.
6783000	6785000	Oh, she might be in 3. I don't think she is, though.
6785000	6787000	That makes my heart hurt.
6787000	6790000	Oh, there's plenty of people you can lez up with, if you want.
6790000	6792000	That's awesome.
6792000	6796000	Aliens, and I will say, I will say this.
6796000	6798000	Because that was totally me in Dragon Age 2.
6798000	6800000	There is a, I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say,
6800000	6806000	there is a very hot, hot woman, a woman of color, in Part 3,
6806000	6810000	that is, she is only a lesbian option.
6810000	6811000	Nice.
6811000	6814000	And there's a shower scene, that's all I'm going to say.
6814000	6815000	Okay.
6815000	6816000	Good times.
6816000	6819000	Okay. Need.
6819000	6821000	And AcidicVampire confirms she doesn't go lesbian.
6821000	6826000	That's alright. Save yourself for, uh, I guess I can say, save yourself for trainer.
6826000	6828000	It's hot.
6828000	6831000	Alright.
6831000	6832000	Moving on.
6832000	6834000	Uh, let's get to the FUs of the Week.
6834000	6836000	That was it for emails, huh? You got a spam email?
6836000	6837000	Uh, yeah.
6837000	6838000	Alright.
6838000	6842000	And good thing I'm on Linux, because they don't make viruses for Linux, really.
6842000	6844000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the Week.
6844000	6846000	Every week we get ranty.
6846000	6864000	Um, FU.
6864000	6868000	I have a few, actually, because I'm tired and sore and bitchy.
6868000	6874000	So, FU, as much fun as the Komen walk was, I didn't say that I did that on the show yet, did I?
6874000	6875000	No.
6875000	6880000	I did the, um, the Komen walk for breast cancer yesterday.
6880000	6889000	And, um, apparently since I've started wearing Vibram five fingers, and before I was wearing shape-ups, my stride has changed.
6889000	6893000	I found out that I used to walk on the outsides of my feet.
6893000	6902000	So when I put on my old shape-ups, because my heel pads for my Vibrams wore out, um, I'm walking.
6902000	6908000	First of all, we've had to park away from the start of the walk, so walk a mile and a half to the, no, a mile to the start.
6908000	6910000	Walk the three and a half miles for the walk.
6910000	6913000	Walk another half a mile to get to the convention center.
6913000	6919000	Walking all over the place there and walking back, I have blisters in places on my feet that I've never had blisters before.
6919000	6924000	I have one on the outside of my big toe, and of course I've got the requisite one on my right heel,
6924000	6932000	which is, um, probably another quarter bigger than a half dollar if anyone remembers what those look like and how big they are.
6932000	6938000	And then I have one on my left foot on the bottom of my, uh, next to pinky toe.
6938000	6943000	It's just bizarre, and they're annoying and they hurt.
6943000	6949000	And then, um, I woke up this morning in so much pain.
6949000	6959000	Because I pretty much walked about eight hours, eight, not eight hours, um, eight miles continuously over the course of, uh, two and a half hours.
6959000	6962000	So, which isn't bad, but, you know.
6962000	6968000	And so I was just in all kinds of pain, and thankfully my husband let me sleep in this morning.
6968000	6972000	Dan is, and he woke me up by screaming from the kitchen,
6972000	6979000	Omelette du fromage! So that woke me up. I woke up to omelette du fromage.
6979000	6989000	And, um, I've been soaring grumpy all day, and I've been sort of snapping at people because I've been too tired to articulate properly exactly what it is that I want to say.
6989000	6997000	The other one goes towards me losing my voice, um, which is now going on two weeks and all the signage drainage.
6997000	7003000	And then I'm just hoping that all of this crap is cleared up by the time I go to Disneyland, because I want to go out and have a good time.
7003000	7012000	So, uh, also, um, F.U. to, uh, Vibram speed for being way too expensive for me to get before Disneyland.
7012000	7016000	Marathon F.U. segment. Loki?
7016000	7021000	Um, I guess F.U. to my throat being sore.
7021000	7027000	It's really annoying. I hate sore throats. Scratchy.
7027000	7031000	I tried honey. It worked for like a minute.
7031000	7032000	No, that's alright. I don't want anything.
7032000	7036000	F.U. to the fact that I've been sick for like five, I'm sorry, were you done?
7036000	7037000	I'm done.
7037000	7042000	F.U. to the fact that I've been sick since like Thursday, and it sucks, and I've missed some important stuff because of it.
7042000	7050000	And what also pisses me off, I've really been sick since Wednesday, I skipped work on Thursday and stayed home.
7050000	7055000	Friday I went back to work because I had something really important, I really wanted to get done, and I was feeling a little better.
7055000	7059000	But I think because I exerted myself too much, I was really sick again yesterday.
7059000	7064000	I'm feeling a little better today, and I'm hoping by the time I wake up tomorrow I'm all better.
7064000	7070000	So I haven't taken my pills, and it's time to take my pills, and I'm doing alright, I'm making it through the show.
7070000	7075000	And I'm not as super congested, but just, ugh, go away. Be healed.
7075000	7080000	And also F.U. to the fact that our stream apparently went down about five minutes ago and caused a bunch of people to disconnect.
7080000	7085000	Because that's never good for retaining your listeners, so I hate when the server fucking burps like that.
7085000	7087000	Argh.
7087000	7090000	Alright. Anyhow.
7090000	7092000	That's really it for the F.U.s for me.
7092000	7096000	Listless is coming up very, very, very soon, but first, a couple more news stories for you guys.
7096000	7099000	Oh, actually, this next one's a doozy.
7099000	7102000	Loki has a bunch of stories about Kickstarter, right?
7102000	7104000	Let's talk about Kickstarter.
7104000	7109000	This is a new segment we're gonna call Give Us All Your Money.
7109000	7112000	And we even have an appropriate theme song for this.
7112000	7116000	Of course.
7116000	7123000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the latest Kickstarter campaigns, because I have a feeling this is not gonna go away anytime soon.
7123000	7131000	Kickstarter, the place where you can kickstart any franchise that may or may not need to be kickstarted, or you may or may not want kickstarted.
7131000	7133000	Can it kickstart my heart?
7133000	7135000	Random amount of money? Yes.
7135000	7137000	Battle Chess.
7137000	7144000	They're doing a remake for that, which I was completely unaware of, and I thought that series had died off, but oh no, they want to come back.
7144000	7147000	And they're going to Kickstarter to fund multiplayer.
7147000	7159000	And, yeah, they're looking for $100,000 for an online experience that includes skill-based matchmaking statistics and leaderboards, achievements, and in-game chat.
7159000	7165000	And they're $12,000 with 18 days to go, they're probably not gonna make it.
7165000	7168000	I like Battle Chess.
7168000	7169000	Too bad.
7169000	7172000	That was the one where the queen would like flat out chop off someone's head, right?
7172000	7173000	Yeah, that was awesome.
7173000	7177000	You might be able to get behind something like this. Two guys from Andromeda, SpaceVenture.
7177000	7184000	It's the guys that created Space Quest, they're doing a new adventure game, and it looks pretty cool.
7184000	7191000	And they've got some really popular voice actors, including the original narrator, Gary Owens.
7191000	7203000	Rob Paulson, who you may not know by name, but he voiced some of the characters from Animaniacs, as well as other things, including Pinky.
7203000	7209000	And then, of course, Ellen McLean, who you may recognize as GLaDOS.
7209000	7211000	I know her from Opera.
7211000	7214000	But she will be in there as well.
7214000	7220000	You make it sound like you don't know her as GLaDOS.
7220000	7224000	Chances of this one succeeding, probably pretty good.
7224000	7232000	They have 30 days left and they're already at almost $150,000.
7232000	7233000	Looks pretty good.
7233000	7241000	Carmageddon is trying to come back. They have a Carmageddon reincarnation, which looks terrible. I've got to be honest, man.
7241000	7248000	It's a remake of the original game. I mean, I would think if you want to kickstart something, you should do like a brand new game.
7248000	7251000	But anyways, they're doing that, and yay.
7251000	7258000	Probably it's going to get funded. They're already at $225,000 of the $400,000 that they need.
7258000	7261000	I'm killing the music. The segment's going on too long.
7261000	7264000	Sorry, I'm trying to be quick.
7264000	7277000	Another one, Redux, which is a sequel to a game called Ducks, which is a 2009 shooter that came out in the Dreamcast.
7277000	7283000	And now they're doing one, they want to do this new game for the Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Steam.
7283000	7290000	And they need $25,000, which, that's reasonable for a game.
7290000	7296000	They're definitely going to hit it. They're already at almost $24,000, and they've got 25 days to go.
7296000	7299000	And there's all sorts of neat rewards for that.
7299000	7304000	I mean, if you're a fan of shooters, it might be some of them throw your money at it, I guess.
7304000	7309000	And then, last but not least, this one's kind of interesting.
7309000	7318000	Jason Rohrer, I hope that's Rohrer, I guess, he is putting out a game called Diamond Trust of London.
7318000	7323000	It's actually a DS game. It's going to be a retail DS game. He has the game done.
7323000	7326000	He just needs the money now to make the cartridges.
7326000	7334000	Apparently Nintendo has all these, you know, limits or minimums and stuff, and they need $78,000 in order to make,
7334000	7341000	I think it's like, I don't remember how many cartridges they're making, a thousand cartridges, if not more.
7341000	7348000	They're already at $53,000 of the $78,000, just over $78,000.
7348000	7352000	They've got 12 days to go. It may not happen.
7352000	7358000	And Diamond Trust of London is kind of like a strategy game, where it has to do with diamond trading.
7358000	7363000	That was, I don't know, it sounded pretty interesting. I actually watched a little video for it.
7363000	7368000	Not my type of game, so obviously not something I'm going to buy.
7368000	7375000	He's done a few other games, too, as well. A lot of the browser games, I can't remember what he's worked on.
7375000	7378000	But you would recognize him if you saw him.
7378000	7384000	So, that's it. That's for the stuff that's on Kickstarter right now. That's notable, I guess.
7384000	7391000	There's actually a cracked article about six amazing indie video games that are made possible through Kickstarter.
7391000	7399000	And the first one is Double Fight Adventure, for number six. Number five is Auditorium Duet, which I haven't heard of.
7399000	7401000	It's a music game.
7401000	7403000	Yeah, I've heard of that.
7403000	7406000	Music game and shooter.
7406000	7411000	Sounds like Beat Hazard, which was a great game.
7411000	7419000	FTL, which doesn't look very interesting to me, but okay.
7419000	7423000	I have to go to the next page now.
7423000	7428000	Oh, come on. I just thought it was neat because it's kind of related.
7428000	7433000	We've poo-pooed on Kickstarters and I honestly still don't like them. I don't trust them.
7433000	7435000	I don't trust them.
7435000	7443000	There was one dark side of Kickstarter last week where the people had stolen the art from DeviantArt or what have you.
7443000	7452000	There's a few, actually. One of the first ones I put money towards, Video Game High School had their first episode this week.
7452000	7455000	It was actually pretty cool. I'm digging that.
7455000	7464000	It's a neat little web series that they've got going on right now about this high school that basically recruits people that play video games.
7464000	7468000	It's like video games have taken over the world type thing. It's really cool.
7468000	7475000	So anyways, that guy, he did Passage, which was kind of a browser game that was popular. It was very minimalistic.
7475000	7482000	Between was another one that he did. Sleep is Death, Inside a Starfield Sky, and then he has this new one.
7482000	7487000	But a lot of stuff that's been covered in gaming blogs and stuff like that.
7487000	7489000	Alright, well if that website ain't working...
7489000	7490000	It's not loading.
7490000	7496000	Alright, that's alright. Let's move on. Anyhow, we have a list list coming up here and it's going to relate a little bit to this story, so pay attention.
7496000	7506000	There are rumors circulating that Tadashi Sugiyama, and if you don't know that name, he directed a Mario Kart game, Pilotwings, and F-Zero.
7506000	7512000	He's apparently working on a Wii U game, which is supposed to be revealed at E3 next month.
7512000	7516000	And apparently it's one that has not been spoiled in this whole early list or whatever that leaked.
7516000	7520000	That was all speculated titles. None of those were actually official.
7520000	7528000	I see. So we'll add this to the list of speculation now, because apparently he is working on a game that's going to be revealed at E3 next month.
7528000	7540000	No hints on what it is, but if you consider that he has worked in the past on Mario Kart, which has been on the 3DS, Pilotwings, which has been on the 3DS, and F-Zero...
7540000	7543000	One of those looks really like me.
7543000	7549000	It could be a new IP, granted, or maybe he's been put on one of the other Nintendo IPs.
7549000	7557000	But, that fanboy in me is still a little excited at the possibilities, right? Am I right? Am I right?
7557000	7559000	That would be awesome. It would be awesome.
7559000	7562000	I mean, the last F-Zero game was pretty awesome.
7562000	7563000	Yes!
7563000	7564000	It was just a long time ago.
7564000	7567000	It's just that the arcade version was surprisingly leaked.
7567000	7581000	Here's the thing. Nintendo, sometimes they have really brilliant things that come out, and sometimes they have really, like, just lazy, lazily put together projects that they put out.
7581000	7589000	Like, the whole F-Zero thing with interaction with the arcade, where you can unlock the arcade tracks at home by playing at the arcade.
7589000	7593000	Or you can take your cars that you make, or your ships that you make to the arcade.
7593000	7596000	That was amazing! That was fucking awesome!
7596000	7600000	And then they just rehash Animal Crossing again.
7600000	7602000	You know, it's just like, I don't know.
7602000	7604000	Sometimes I just wonder.
7604000	7607000	I think that all comes down to, it's different development teams.
7607000	7609000	Some people have it, some people don't.
7609000	7615000	Some people just, you know, do what they can to get on by.
7617000	7624000	Sorry, I got slowed up in the chatroom here, and it, um, it's screwing me up here, because I really wanted the chatroom for this next segment.
7624000	7627000	Oh, did we lose stream again, too?
7627000	7629000	I'm not seeing anything from the chatroom.
7629000	7631000	I think we pinged out. You might want to reload chat.
7631000	7633000	Okay.
7634000	7636000	Fantastic.
7637000	7641000	The joys and fun of live radio, everybody. What can you do? Alright.
7643000	7647000	Anyhow, we're gonna move into the next segment tonight called Listless!
7650000	7652000	We have lots of theme songs tonight.
7652000	7661000	Listless is where we are going to come up with the definitive list, definitive fanboy list on a particular topic.
7661000	7666000	You guys in our chatroom are gonna help us out by voting for your favorites.
7666000	7668000	Let me remind you how Listless works.
7668000	7673000	We're gonna come up with a topic, and the topic for tonight I'll reveal in just a minute.
7673000	7680000	And then what you do on this topic is, oh, I'm sorry, you guys here in studio, and we'll have a surprise fourth guest on the phone here in a minute.
7680000	7688000	What we're gonna do on the phone and in studio is come up with our top three answers for this topic.
7688000	7690000	That's gonna leave us a list of 12.
7690000	7696000	We will then all go around the room and eliminate one from the list, leaving us a list of eight.
7696000	7701000	And then we will put it to a vote in our chatroom for their number one and number two answers.
7701000	7707000	And after that, definitive process is done. That's it. This is the list. It's a done deal.
7707000	7711000	There's no arguing. This is what the gamers demand.
7711000	7717000	Highly scientific, tested and trued over the past ten years. Am I right?
7717000	7719000	Yeah, you're right.
7719000	7722000	Here it is. Tonight's Listless topic.
7722000	7725000	Oh, actually, let me get our fourth person on the phone.
7725000	7729000	Sorry, the whole disconnection of the stream kind of screwed me up here.
7729000	7731000	It's Comcast.
7731000	7732000	Apparently.
7732000	7735000	Yeah, because we were having an issue, well, I was having an issue loading a page.
7735000	7738000	Stupids.
7738000	7741000	All right, let's try to get our person on the line here.
7741000	7743000	Hey, is this Shane?
7743000	7745000	Yeah, holy crap. You're allowed. I need to fix this.
7745000	7750000	Boo, surprise. Hey, it's Shane joining us from Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth,
7750000	7753000	which can be heard not on the VOG Network yet, but soon.
7753000	7756000	www.hoardhouse.com.
7756000	7758000	All about the World of Warcraft, right, Shane?
7758000	7760000	That's actually what I'm playing right now.
7760000	7765000	I'm playing the Mists of Pandaria beta because Male Panda's got new hairstyles,
7765000	7768000	so clearly I have to take it out for a test drive.
7768000	7772000	Wait a minute. You're not playing Mass Effect for a change?
7772000	7776000	I don't always play Mass Effect, just most of the time.
7776000	7780000	Yes, you do. Why is it that on the Warcraft show, you're always playing Mass Effect,
7780000	7783000	and now on the general gaming show, you're always playing Warcraft?
7783000	7785000	I don't understand.
7785000	7787000	Because...
7787000	7792000	I don't always play Mass Effect, but when I do, it's with Kaiden.
7792000	7798000	Yeah, what? Oh my gosh. That letter, while it did inflate my ego,
7798000	7800000	how could you bash Kaiden?
7800000	7804000	I have to say, we planned this long before we read that email tonight.
7804000	7807000	I had no idea that email was in there. That was a late-arriving email.
7807000	7811000	We already knew Shane was going to be our fourth person tonight for Listless,
7811000	7815000	and then that email comes in, and here you are on the show five minutes later.
7815000	7818000	What do you want to say to that emailer?
7818000	7822000	Thank you for inflating my ego, but you're wrong about Kaiden,
7822000	7827000	so it's like, I don't know. I just can't talk to you.
7827000	7830000	All right. You ready to play Listless with us tonight, Shane?
7830000	7833000	As long as it doesn't get in the way of playing World of Warcraft, yes.
7833000	7835000	We'll do our best. All right.
7835000	7839000	So here's the topic for tonight, because everybody's dying to know.
7839000	7846000	Here's the topic for tonight, E3 Wii U announcement
7846000	7852000	that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7852000	7856000	The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7856000	7859000	Now, chatters, if you want to give us your suggestions,
7859000	7862000	you can start typing those in our chat room at vognetwork.com.
7862000	7864000	I can't guarantee we're going to use your answers,
7864000	7868000	but if one of us ends up having an answer stolen by another host or something,
7868000	7870000	we tend to look to chat room for a little bit of help.
7870000	7871000	So what do you think?
7871000	7876000	The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7876000	7880000	Let's start with Shane. What is your number three answer?
7880000	7882000	Okay. I'm going to have to try to explain this,
7882000	7885000	because my writing it out, I didn't do a very good job.
7885000	7890000	So my number three would be Nintendo announcing a new F-Zero game
7890000	7896000	utilizing the tablet controller as some sort of like future racing control dash thing
7896000	7901000	where you'd press the buttons on the screen to go and break and stuff,
7901000	7909000	and then it would have a stand that you could tilt the controller with for tilt controls.
7909000	7912000	How about we just say new F-Zero game?
7912000	7916000	No, because you have to have the rest of that, or else it's just a crappy F-Zero game.
7916000	7917000	How about new F-Zero with tilt control?
7917000	7919000	Well, it's probably good. It's a zero.
7919000	7922000	Summarize the tilt controls one more time.
7922000	7927000	It would be this mount you put the tablet on,
7927000	7932000	because it would be awkward to have the acceleration and break on the touchscreen
7932000	7938000	while you're trying to use the crappy controller with the analog nub stick or whatever.
7938000	7940000	So it would be tilt controlled.
7940000	7942000	So it would be like you're standing on a console.
7942000	7947000	I see it on Power Rangers all the time. That's where I got the idea.
7947000	7949000	If it's good enough for Power Rangers, it's good enough for Shane.
7949000	7952000	Too bad. I shortened the answer to new F-Zero game.
7952000	7953000	Fine, whatever.
7953000	7955000	Loki, what's your number three pick?
7955000	7958000	All these are going to be kind of similar, except for the last one.
7958000	7963000	The first one is going to be a Mario Kart game with track editor.
7963000	7966000	It's like ModNation Racers with Mario Kart.
7966000	7969000	Really, everyone wants anyways.
7969000	7971000	So ModNation Mario Kart, basically.
7971000	7972000	Something like that.
7972000	7974000	ModNation is a really terrible name.
7974000	7976000	Mario Kart game with track editor.
7976000	7979000	What character is most important to have in Mario Kart?
7979000	7980000	Mario.
7980000	7983000	I mean, like, what would you want to play, mostly?
7983000	7986000	Like, as you know, there's a variety of characters that come in the games.
7986000	7988000	They haven't put Samus in there. That'd be kind of funny.
7988000	7990000	It would be funny. That's a good answer.
7990000	7991000	All right.
7991000	7993000	Dark Sakura, your number three answer.
7993000	7995000	A Mario Paint.
7995000	7997000	A new Mario Paint.
7997000	7998000	Yes.
7998000	8001000	Oh, that'd be awesome. Can I change my answer?
8001000	8004000	Only if it has the music mode in it.
8004000	8007000	With the cat meow and the dog barks.
8007000	8009000	It has to have the undo doggy, too.
8009000	8011000	So if you make a mistake, you can click on his face.
8011000	8012000	Yes. All right.
8012000	8013000	As long as undo doggy's there.
8013000	8014000	I can actually see that.
8014000	8018000	I mean, if they don't make a Mario Paint game, I mean, come on.
8018000	8019000	I agree.
8019000	8021000	They're kind of dumb if they don't make a Mario part.
8021000	8022000	Mario.
8022000	8025000	I said Mario Party, but they'll probably make one of those, too.
8025000	8026000	All right.
8026000	8029000	My number three answer.
8029000	8033000	E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and preorder it that day.
8033000	8037000	My virtual console games still work on it.
8037000	8038000	OMG.
8038000	8040000	Because that won't happen.
8040000	8046000	We all know.
8046000	8049000	But it would be nice that all that money I invested on the Wii could, like,
8049000	8052000	somehow carry over to the Wii U and I could take that little tablet, like,
8052000	8056000	into, you know, my bedroom and play before I go to bed and, you know.
8056000	8058000	Wouldn't that be nice?
8058000	8060000	Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?
8060000	8061000	Mm-hmm.
8061000	8062000	All right.
8062000	8065000	Shane, your number two answer.
8065000	8069000	Nintendo announcing multiple colors of the system for launch,
8069000	8073000	especially a blue color.
8073000	8074000	Especially blue.
8074000	8075000	Especially blue.
8075000	8076000	Yes.
8076000	8077000	Multiple colors.
8077000	8079000	Oh, because I put multiple colors including blue,
8079000	8081000	but I'll put multiple colors especially blue.
8081000	8082000	You could also put most importantly.
8082000	8085000	That would work as well.
8085000	8087000	I can't spell.
8087000	8088000	Rob spiel's will.
8088000	8089000	All right.
8089000	8091000	Multiple colors, especially blue.
8091000	8094000	Aqua blue or navy blue or what?
8094000	8099000	I will take either a midnight blue, a cobalt blue, or a metallic blue,
8099000	8101000	but not aqua blue.
8101000	8103000	I support cobalt.
8103000	8105000	Loki, your number two answer.
8105000	8113000	My number two answer, I just had something different too.
8113000	8118000	Oh, my number two answer would be that that tablet controller can actually
8118000	8121000	be used as a tablet.
8121000	8125000	Like, you know, you can take it as a portable system wherever you go,
8125000	8127000	although that wouldn't really fit in your pocket.
8127000	8130000	But it would be nice, you know, get some more value out of it.
8130000	8131000	There you go.
8131000	8134000	So the tablet controller is actually a tablet and not reliant on being
8134000	8135000	actually near a Wii U.
8135000	8136000	Yes.
8136000	8137000	All right.
8137000	8138000	Fair enough.
8138000	8141000	Dark Sakura, your number two answer.
8141000	8146000	Pokemon Snap Wii U.
8146000	8148000	How would the tablet work in Pokemon Snap Wii U?
8148000	8151000	See, I would want, like, an augmented reality version.
8151000	8154000	Is that where you pick your balls?
8154000	8155000	They could do that.
8155000	8156000	I think it has a camera on the tablet.
8156000	8157000	That is true.
8157000	8159000	Jamie, you know that there's a 3DS application coming out for
8159000	8163000	Black and White 2 that is Pokemon Snap augmented reality.
8163000	8166000	Well, I don't have a 3DS, so that doesn't sound good.
8166000	8167000	You need one for it.
8167000	8168000	It's Pokemon Snap.
8168000	8172000	Well, send me one, please.
8172000	8173000	I'm going to Disneyland.
8173000	8175000	That's more important.
8175000	8176000	All right.
8176000	8178000	My number two answer.
8178000	8180000	I bet I'm stealing Dark Sakura's number one answer right here,
8180000	8181000	but I don't even care.
8181000	8182000	I don't think you are.
8182000	8183000	I don't even care.
8183000	8184000	All right.
8184000	8185000	My answer.
8185000	8186000	The Guardian Legend Wii U.
8186000	8191000	You're not stealing my number one answer.
8191000	8192000	But I'm sorry.
8192000	8193000	It's a damn good answer.
8193000	8198000	If they say, bam, Guardian Legends coming back, I'll be, like, preordered.
8198000	8199000	Done.
8199000	8200000	Sold.
8200000	8201000	Give me two.
8201000	8202000	All right.
8202000	8206000	So far we have new F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint.
8206000	8208000	My virtual console games work.
8208000	8210000	Multiple colors, especially blue.
8210000	8212000	Tablet controller is actually a tablet.
8212000	8215000	Pokemon Snap Wii U and the Guardian Legend Wii U.
8215000	8218000	Let's get to the number one answers.
8218000	8219000	Shane.
8219000	8220000	Okay.
8220000	8221000	Okay.
8221000	8223000	This is going to be a complete surprise to everybody.
8223000	8224000	Are you ready for it?
8224000	8225000	Mass Effect.
8225000	8226000	What?
8226000	8228000	A new Mass Effect game.
8228000	8229000	See?
8229000	8234000	The tablet would have straps so you could strap it to your arm like an omni-tool, and
8234000	8238000	then it would have a control scheme similar to Metroid Prime.
8238000	8243000	So you'd have awesome, you know, omni-tool stuff, and you would have a really good control
8243000	8244000	scheme.
8244000	8246000	And I don't care if it's four or whatever.
8246000	8248000	I just would love that.
8248000	8252000	You just need Mass Effect in your life somehow being brought together with you.
8252000	8253000	Yes.
8253000	8254000	Always.
8254000	8255000	Fair enough.
8255000	8256000	Fair enough.
8256000	8257000	What a shocking answer from Shane.
8257000	8258000	All right.
8258000	8259000	Number one answer.
8259000	8265000	Try not to be shocked, but Excite Truck 2.
8265000	8266000	I would buy that system.
8266000	8268000	What a shocking answer.
8268000	8274000	But if there's one fucking minigame in that goddamn racing game, I will fucking burn that
8274000	8276000	console through the ground.
8276000	8277000	Is this an official bet?
8277000	8280000	You will buy a Wii U and set it on fire if there's an Excite Truck 2?
8280000	8283000	No, I will not waste my money.
8283000	8286000	But like in my mind, I would, you know, that console deserves a burn.
8286000	8288000	I would imagine really hard and hope you were pyrokinetic.
8288000	8289000	All right.
8289000	8292000	Dark Sakura, your number one answer.
8292000	8295000	All of my answers have been like legit and not smartassy.
8295000	8298000	So, I said DJ Max Technica.
8298000	8300000	That was going to be my number two.
8300000	8301000	Because, yeah.
8301000	8302000	All right.
8302000	8303000	Wouldn't that be fun?
8303000	8304000	Yeah, I could see that.
8304000	8305000	And totally doable.
8305000	8306000	And totally doable.
8306000	8307000	Mm-hmm.
8307000	8308000	Okay.
8308000	8312000	Or at least, at least, a game that's very similar to an Elite Beat Agent.
8312000	8313000	Like an Elite Beat Agent.
8313000	8314000	Yeah.
8314000	8315000	Yeah.
8315000	8317000	I would say an Elite Beat Agent's Technica style.
8317000	8319000	Do they have multi-touch on that thing?
8319000	8322000	Because I think it's supposed to be just like the DS screen.
8322000	8323000	I think it's just like a DS screen.
8323000	8325000	It's not like an iPhone or anything like that.
8325000	8326000	Technica won't work.
8326000	8330000	I could make mine, oh, Shitataka and Olendon.
8330000	8332000	You want to change it from Technica to EBA?
8332000	8334000	Well, you know, that type of game.
8334000	8336000	How about Technica or EBA?
8336000	8337000	Okay.
8337000	8341000	Well, just honestly, I liked Olendon better than EBA because I thought the cheerleaders
8341000	8342000	were funny.
8342000	8343000	All right.
8343000	8345000	Well, look at all these serious answers here.
8345000	8347000	My answer is very serious.
8347000	8348000	My number one answer is very serious.
8348000	8352000	And it is a very practical use of the Wii U technology.
8352000	8357000	You can have one thing on the television and you can have one thing on the tablet that
8357000	8358000	sits on your pants.
8358000	8359000	Okay?
8359000	8362000	So my number one answer for my number one game I won.
8362000	8364000	You mean like using the GBA back in the day?
8364000	8365000	Sort of.
8365000	8369000	My game that I want more than anything is called Porn on My Pants.
8369000	8374000	And what happens is that on the TV screen, it looks like you're playing something really
8374000	8379000	cute and chibi, like you're playing like a new Pokemon game, but on your pants, porn.
8379000	8382000	And whatever porn you could possibly imagine.
8382000	8383000	You want straight porn?
8383000	8384000	Fine.
8384000	8385000	You want gay porn?
8385000	8387000	You want five people going at it at once?
8387000	8388000	Fine.
8388000	8391000	Anything you're into is available through the various DLC.
8391000	8392000	Human Sent to Porn.
8392000	8395000	Human Sent to Porn, if that's what you're into, fine.
8395000	8397000	Midget Porn, go for it.
8397000	8401000	Do you know that old person porn is very popular in Japan now?
8401000	8402000	I don't care.
8402000	8403000	Alright, porn.
8403000	8404000	Porn.
8404000	8406000	Not in my version of Porn on My Pants.
8406000	8407000	That shit will stay out.
8407000	8410000	Alright, so Porn on My Pants is my number one answer.
8410000	8411000	Alright.
8411000	8415000	Here we get to the very hard part of Listless.
8415000	8417000	You said hard right after you talked about porn.
8417000	8422000	It's just a necessary part of the game that we play here.
8422000	8426000	By the way, let me read some of the answers from chat because there were some great answers
8426000	8427000	from chat here.
8427000	8428000	Tiger Clawed.
8428000	8429000	Nyan Cat the Game.
8429000	8430000	Act Def'd.
8430000	8431000	Mass Effect.
8431000	8432000	Weeology.
8432000	8435000	Act Def'd said Steam Integration on the Wii U.
8435000	8437000	Act Def'd President Cat Wii U.
8437000	8439000	Black Wolf Mother Wii U.
8439000	8444000	Raginator, a limited edition ABBA and Rocky Horror themed console.
8444000	8448000	SSJ-100 Matt, Goat Say Me for Wii U.
8448000	8452000	SSJ-100 Matt, Ultra Kade Wii U.
8452000	8460000	Raginator, Sky Barbie Horse Adventures Wii U edition is the pack in game.
8460000	8463000	World of Warcraft Wii U is Act Def'd.
8463000	8465000	Frisbee says Dreamcast 2.
8465000	8469000	Going back to an old Listless, but unfortunately none of those answers made the list tonight.
8469000	8473000	One of my other considerations, Rob, was a boob game.
8473000	8474000	There you go.
8474000	8477000	Bobby also says automatically allocates 1 million sales of Eye of Judgment.
8477000	8479000	I'm afraid that that will never happen.
8479000	8482000	Yeah, actually the bet was officially closed a couple years ago, too.
8482000	8484000	It's just, they're not making it anymore.
8484000	8485000	Very sad.
8485000	8487000	Alright, so here we go.
8487000	8488000	Here we go.
8488000	8492000	Now's the time where we're going to go around and eliminate one answer from the list.
8492000	8494000	And the list as it stands right now.
8494000	8495000	New F-Zero game.
8495000	8497000	Mario Kart Wii with track editor.
8497000	8499000	Or, excuse me, Mario Kart with track editor.
8499000	8500000	New Mario Paint.
8500000	8501000	My virtual console games work.
8501000	8503000	Multiple colors, especially blue.
8503000	8505000	Tablet controller is actually a tablet.
8505000	8507000	Pokemon Snap Wii U.
8507000	8508000	The Guardian Legend Wii U.
8508000	8511000	A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.
8511000	8512000	Excite Truck 2.
8512000	8514000	DJ Max Technica or EBA.
8514000	8516000	And porn on my pants.
8516000	8520000	Shane, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8520000	8523000	Because I don't think Nintendo would get it right.
8523000	8525000	Porn on my pants.
8525000	8528000	I knew you would erase that, you ass.
8528000	8532000	But, Nintendo doesn't know how to make anything mature.
8532000	8533000	Ever.
8533000	8540000	So, would you want something so terrible as to taint the name porn on my pants?
8540000	8547000	It could be their breakthrough hit.
8547000	8548000	Right.
8548000	8549000	I just don't have faith.
8549000	8550000	I'm sorry.
8550000	8553000	It is stricken from the list and I'm mad at you forever.
8553000	8554000	Alright.
8554000	8556000	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8556000	8557000	Pokemon Snap Wii U.
8557000	8561000	Because it's something that they could really just include into a new Pokemon game.
8561000	8562000	Which they're doing apparently.
8562000	8563000	Yeah.
8563000	8566000	Alright, it is stricken from the list, unfortunately, for Dark Soccer.
8566000	8568000	But, Dark Soccer, here's your chance for revenge.
8568000	8569000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8569000	8571000	I'm above revenge, Rob.
8571000	8572000	What are you talking about?
8572000	8574000	Excite Truck 2.
8574000	8578000	Because I didn't give a shit about Excite Truck 1 and that's not enough to make me buy one.
8578000	8579000	That's because you never played it.
8579000	8580000	I played it.
8580000	8582000	I didn't care for it.
8582000	8583000	Alright, let's see.
8583000	8586000	Then, to be fair, I need to get rid of one of Shane's answers here.
8586000	8587000	Ooh!
8587000	8589000	I'm getting rid of multiple colors, especially blue.
8589000	8591000	Oh, come on!
8591000	8595000	Because I actually like the rest of the answers.
8595000	8598000	And, I'm sorry, we need a purple.
8598000	8602000	You know I might get the purple one for my birthday because I can't tell the difference
8602000	8604000	between the color.
8604000	8606000	So I'll trade in my aqua blue one for that one.
8606000	8607000	It's gonna be awesome.
8607000	8612000	Alright, so we have narrowed down the list for your voting pleasure.
8612000	8614000	Here's a recap and you guys can place your votes.
8614000	8621000	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom at vognetwork.com, type slash MSG space SKIE,
8621000	8626000	my name's Sky, and your vote, your number one and your number two answers.
8626000	8628000	Here is the list that you can pick from.
8628000	8629000	New F-Zero game.
8629000	8631000	Mario Kart with track editor.
8631000	8632000	New Mario Paint.
8632000	8634000	My virtual console games work.
8634000	8636000	Tablet controller is actually a tablet.
8636000	8638000	The Guardian Legend Wii U.
8638000	8640000	A new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool.
8640000	8643000	And DJ Max Technica or EBA.
8643000	8644000	There it is.
8644000	8648000	We will tally up your votes and have those real soon.
8648000	8650000	A little later on when we start taking calls.
8650000	8651000	So that's it.
8651000	8655000	Shane, anything else you want to talk to us about or say before we let you go?
8655000	8656000	I don't know.
8656000	8657000	Probably not.
8657000	8660000	Alright, well then I guess have fun with pandas.
8660000	8661000	I will.
8661000	8662000	Goodbye.
8662000	8663000	Alright, bye.
8663000	8668000	Well that should make Shane's one fan very happy that he was there on the show.
8668000	8670000	Playing listless with us.
8670000	8675000	Black Wolf is accusing us, by the way, of not enough lols tonight in the match game segment.
8675000	8676000	Not enough lols.
8676000	8678000	We did not bring the lols tonight.
8678000	8679000	Sorry to hear that.
8679000	8680000	Well you know what?
8680000	8682000	We can't be funny all the time.
8682000	8684000	I spend a lot of my funny.
8684000	8686000	But Loki's funny looking all the time.
8686000	8687000	That's true.
8687000	8689000	Kind of Amish.
8689000	8690000	I don't know.
8690000	8692000	I think he looks kind of Amish.
8692000	8693000	A little bit maybe.
8693000	8696000	We need to get you a black hat and some buttons.
8696000	8698000	Alright, let's do a couple more news stories for you guys.
8698000	8702000	Then we're going to get to the Skype line and we'll get to the results of listless as well.
8702000	8704000	Dark Sakura I think we're on right now.
8704000	8708000	Well, it's just a big pile of shit.
8708000	8721000	The court in Holland has ordered that a particular Pirate Bay supporter stop publicizing a work around for the ban that was there.
8721000	8723000	It's called the Dutch Pirate Party.
8723000	8727000	They've been publicizing ways to circumvent the ban on Pirate Bay.
8727000	8738000	And as reported by the BBC, the judge also said that it ceased offering a proxy service so that Dutch Pirate Bay users could access the torrents without having to link the site.
8738000	8743000	I mean, not really surprising that they try to stop it.
8743000	8746000	But it's more and more people finding a way.
8746000	8751000	But honestly people could find a way around it on their own if they were creative.
8751000	8762000	Also, the group's UK branch is actually offering more of a proxy for the country-wide ISP block.
8762000	8766000	So, that's it.
8766000	8773000	The party's campaign officer actually said that they received 2 million hits in over 24 hours.
8773000	8783000	And, of course, the legal campaign in the UK is being spearheaded by the British Phonographic Institute.
8783000	8785000	That's old school there.
8785000	8787000	Phonographic.
8787000	8792000	Phonograph.
8792000	8795000	And then here's something really funny.
8795000	8803000	So, people that play Battlefield 3 are having issues finding servers to actually play their game on.
8803000	8807000	You know how you pay those online passes and then you can't connect to a game?
8807000	8809000	Fan-fucking-tastic.
8809000	8816000	And so, what's ending up happening is apparently you remember that they announced that you can rent servers from EA.
8816000	8822000	Well, apparently the rentals have been so popular that there's not enough servers to go around anymore.
8822000	8832000	Because being smart and having a certain amount of servers available to regular players versus opening up tons of servers so that you can make more profit.
8832000	8836000	You know, enjoyable experience versus profit.
8836000	8838000	They went with profit.
8838000	8842000	So, apparently that's an issue.
8842000	8857000	And they're saying that, of course, they reserve a percentage of the servers for players who prefer to connect through dice-hosted servers.
8857000	8860000	But they won't say what percent of that.
8860000	8864000	And they're also saying that a lot of the servers appear unavailable.
8864000	8880000	In fact, some people are having trouble connecting to a server so long that it's taking them an hour to connect to a game without having to try to connect to one of these private servers which you may or may not get kicked from because it's a private server.
8880000	8883000	That kind of sucks. Money first.
8883000	8885000	I know, that's kind of weird.
8885000	8891000	It's kind of like, sorry, you can't come here because we already rented it out for so-and-so's birthday party.
8891000	8900000	For that guy who runs MegaUpload.com or whatever his name is, rented everything for his private parole party.
8900000	8909000	Well, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, they're saying that basically people are looking for just, you know, to play the regular game types without any sort of custom stuff.
8909000	8913000	And, you know, one guy's saying, I rarely got kicked from a dice server.
8913000	8918000	And it says, you know, but once the rented servers bit took off, got kicked quite a bit.
8918000	8926000	And it's damn near impossible to find an official server in that many of the rented servers features are games with server requirements.
8926000	8931000	I don't want to play Team Deathmatch to 500 kills or Conquest to 700 tickets.
8931000	8935000	So, you know, they're basically saying, no, they're not shutting down servers.
8935000	8947000	But, you know, if dice managed servers appear offline, it's because they've been rented and customized by players.
8947000	8951000	Custom servers have always been extremely popular at Battlefield PC players.
8951000	8955000	With Battlefield 3, we introduced the custom server program to console gamers.
8955000	8957000	Response has been overwhelmingly positive.
8957000	8960000	Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.
8960000	8967000	But just remember that when you're paying for your online pass for your used game that you're not going to necessarily get online.
8967000	8977000	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8977000	8981000	And you might have played Kid Icarus Uprising at this point on the 3DS.
8981000	8984000	And if you haven't, you really should, because it's a good game.
8984000	8987000	Except for the whole, your hand will cramp in 20 different ways.
8987000	8994000	However, it's kind of sad to hear that they're not going to get a chance to redo the controls in a sequel.
8994000	8997000	They will not be doing a sequel.
8997000	9006000	The staff behind Project Sora, which is, you know, really the same people that made Super Smash Brothers, and the various versions, have said that they're not going to be doing a sequel.
9006000	9011000	Mashihiro Sakurai, who of course is the brains behind it, said, quote,
9011000	9015000	If by lasting universe you mean to ask if there's a sequel, the answer is no.
9015000	9023000	We pushed a lot into the game in order to let people have this short yet deep experience, but the novelty of that would likely grow thin in the next game.
9023000	9029000	For now, my thought is that perhaps we'll see someone else besides me make another Kid Icarus in another 25 years.
9029000	9031000	Yikes.
9031000	9038000	At least they tried to make it so that they'd have a ton of replayability on it, but I'm sure they're busy with, you know, Smash Brothers.
9038000	9040000	Exactly. Exactly.
9040000	9043000	So sadly, that will not be coming out any time soon.
9043000	9048000	Hey, we are going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9048000	9054000	The phones are open, so go ahead and give us a call if you want, and let us know your thoughts on tonight's news or anything else that you wanted to share.
9054000	9062000	We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute, but first I was going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories, so I can tally up these last few listless votes that came in.
9062000	9072000	This is kind of funny. Apparently they have a pre-order bonus for The Amazing Spider-Man coming out in June, where you can play as Stan Lee.
9072000	9089000	Like, actually as Stan Lee in the Spider-Man game. And of course he has, you know, some of the powers that Spider-Man has, and he is searching, or he's hunting down, I guess, script pages from his next movie or something.
9089000	9096000	Alright, let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9096000	9098000	It's the one and only Rama.
9098000	9100000	Of course it is. How you doing, Rama?
9100000	9102000	I'm pretty good. Alive, but okay.
9102000	9111000	Should you not be alive? Did you have a weekend filled with devious things that could have got you killed?
9111000	9115000	Yes, it's called Staffia Convention, where I tweaked my knee.
9115000	9117000	Touché.
9117000	9125000	Yes. Or as I was saying at the end of the rave last night, I was raving like nobody else's business until I took a glow stick to the knee.
9125000	9129000	When will that meme die?
9129000	9131000	Not anytime soon.
9131000	9138000	I did put that call out on Twitter as to what game should I play next now that I finally beat Mass Effect, and it looks like I'm gonna do Skyrim.
9138000	9139000	No, don't.
9139000	9142000	No, I have to. I bought it, and I really liked it.
9142000	9149000	It's one of those endless games, and poor Alan's gonna be a gamer widow. We can't have that.
9149000	9151000	Alan's been the one playing it.
9151000	9162000	He's been the one playing. Okay, Alan got to the point where he beat every single quest in Skyrim, save for the ones that are automatically generated, and he knew which one those were.
9162000	9165000	He beat them all.
9165000	9167000	Mmm.
9167000	9173000	So, just saying, I ain't the widow. I mean, he ain't the widow. He should sympathize.
9173000	9176000	I just want to play the main quest. I don't want to do all the science stuff.
9176000	9180000	For the record, I do have to say that I found one good surviving remnant of that meme.
9180000	9181000	What?
9181000	9185000	I was like, I used to think Hawkeye was useless, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
9185000	9186000	That one was good.
9186000	9189000	So, Rama, what did you really call to talk to us about tonight?
9189000	9202000	I want to talk about this Xbox 360 deal. It's just something I was thinking about that doesn't kind of make sense, but it kind of does, when you're trying to compare it in a way of, like, a subsidized cell phone.
9202000	9212000	Now, if you pay $200 for your smartphone, and you have to pay the bill every month, and if you happen to terminate the contract, you have to pay this fee.
9212000	9218000	Now, let's say you don't pay that bill for that month. They'll let you slide.
9218000	9223000	Second month, not so much. They cut the phone off, and the phone is rendered useless.
9223000	9224000	Right.
9224000	9229000	Now, with Microsoft, you pay $99, and you pay $15 a month.
9229000	9233000	Now, let's say you don't pay the bill for the first month. They let it slide.
9233000	9236000	And you're paying the bill for the second month. What's going to happen?
9236000	9242000	You fire your 360. We already know that your live account is canceled.
9242000	9247000	But what else is going to happen? Are you going to get a little pop-up to say that you can't play a console unless you pay the bill?
9247000	9253000	Maybe. I mean, maybe the technology is not there yet, but it's something that they could implement for the next round of consoles.
9253000	9263000	I believe there is some type of $299 fee that you have to pay, or you have to pay some type of big fee for the early cancellation,
9263000	9269000	which basically amounts to the rest of the cost of the console on its own, plus the Kinect.
9269000	9277000	And they would automatically charge it against whatever credit card they have on file for you, or send your ass to collections, for all I know.
9277000	9286000	Well, that I do see happening, but I'm just going to be amused at where people are going to start complaining where they forgot to pay the bill.
9286000	9292000	You get this pop-up with your 360. You cannot play a console unless the bill isn't paid. Please call this number, you know.
9292000	9300000	Well, think about, you know what, this is somewhat modeled after, one could argue, and that is the Blizzard blood pact that came out at the end of last year.
9300000	9305000	If I were to suddenly stop paying my World of Warcraft bill, they would shut off my Diablo 3.
9305000	9308000	They can do that. You just shut it off.
9308000	9322000	Yeah, I can see Microsoft doing where they do this, and you activate your account, like a special extra software gets loaded onto your console where they actually monitor, where if you don't pay the bill, that happens.
9322000	9329000	That sounds like one of those low credit cars, where it won't start if you haven't paid the bill.
9329000	9341000	Mm-hmm. It's scary, but the next round of consoles could have that technology if they decide to go with this. Of course, that's a big if, but we'll see.
9341000	9346000	And somewhere in the corporate offices of Rent-A-Center, they're going, why didn't we think of this?
9346000	9353000	Why didn't we think of this? That's alright, Rent-A-Center still gets to do the televisions and all the stuff that, you know, you have to play the video games on.
9353000	9357000	I had one of those. Did I tell you that?
9357000	9359000	No. You feel like sharing?
9359000	9370000	Sure. I wish I still had it, but as a birthday gift when I was 12, me and my great-grandma went to Rent-A-Center. She bought me a 20-inch TV with a built-in Nintendo from Sharp Electronics.
9370000	9373000	I didn't realize they ever made TVs with built-in Nintendos.
9373000	9374000	Yep.
9374000	9376000	Huh. Okay.
9376000	9388000	Man, I had it for years, but back in, I believe, 2005, I had to sit it out on the side because the tube went and I had paid to get it fixed like twice and it kept going out.
9388000	9393000	Wow. Alright.
9393000	9397000	Are you talking about the C1 NES TV?
9397000	9398000	What was that?
9398000	9400000	The C1 NES TV.
9400000	9405000	I believe so, yeah. And I think in Japan, Sharp actually had a Super Nintendo, a Super Famicom version of that as well.
9405000	9407000	There was one.
9407000	9413000	ActDeft in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says Kmart had them. You know what? Kmart probably still has them if you want to go check it out.
9413000	9419000	If they did, I will buy one right now because the only place I saw them at the time was Rent-A-Center and where I lived, there was no Kmart.
9419000	9423000	I keep forgetting those places like Rent-A-Center exist.
9423000	9426000	I posted a link to that in the chatroom.
9426000	9429000	Oh my gosh. That's so cool. I never realized they made those.
9429000	9437000	Oh, mine was slightly different from that one. Mine was slightly different. It was taller. After the call, I'll find a link and I'll post it, but yeah.
9437000	9442000	That's still pretty rad. Alright, Ramo, we ought to let you go so we can get some more calls. Take care, buddy. Okay?
9442000	9443000	Ain't no problem. Take care.
9443000	9449000	Alright, bye. Any other last minute stories to cover? I do have a couple Twitter things I can do.
9449000	9463000	Chris Sharp made another thing called the Twin Famicom that came out in 1986, only released in Japan, and it's the combination of the Famicom and the disk system in one piece of hardware.
9463000	9479000	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you need to get ahold of us that way. Anything else, Loki? Are we done with last minute stories? There's a bonus 25 minutes of Cave Johnson in the DLC for Portal 2.
9479000	9487000	Good lord, monologues or what? Yeah, pretty much. It's all stuff that they recorded, especially for that. It's brand new stuff.
9487000	9492000	Oh, wow. You can listen to it on YouTube. That's pretty cool that they got him back in to do that.
9492000	9493000	Yep.
9493000	9504000	Alright, going to a few tweets at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Eric RPG on Twitter sent us a tweet with a link from this game from the I Wanna Be the Guy dev.
9504000	9511000	Oh, I'd heard about this. This is like the Castlevania-esque game, isn't it? I'm looking at the link right now that he sent us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9511000	9515000	And I wanna say I heard about this.
9515000	9519000	I just found a Twin Famicom on eBay for 57 bucks.
9519000	9520000	That right there is the trailer for Union High School.
9520000	9523000	He sent us to a link. Oh, there it is. Right here. Here it is.
9523000	9529000	I don't know why, but the link he sent us didn't work and it sent me to the main page of Destructoid because he linked me to the story over there.
9529000	9540000	Oh, wow. That does look a lot like Castlevania. But that's what he's making. A Castlevania-esque platformer. It's called Brave Earth Prologue and it's an homage to old school Castlevania.
9540000	9544000	We could use more homages to old school Castlevania, to be quite honest.
9544000	9547000	Or homages to, like, say, Guardian Legend.
9547000	9555000	Guardian Legend. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's a very 8-bit style game. That's pretty cool. It's gonna appear on Steam and other services for 5 bucks.
9555000	9561000	That's a really good deal, actually. I'm liking the way that looks. Thank you for sharing that.
9561000	9565000	I will probably pick that up. You can't beat 5 bucks.
9565000	9572000	Alright, let's see. Going to Tiger. Oh, let's go to the phones. Phones are lighting up. Why not? Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?
9572000	9576000	Hey. Hey. Who's this?
9576000	9578000	This is Zaku.
9578000	9579000	Hey, Zaku.
9579000	9580000	I'm calling for my cell phone.
9580000	9581000	Are you calling for your cell phone?
9581000	9582000	I'm calling for my cell phone.
9582000	9583000	What's up?
9583000	9595000	Nothing much. I guess I want to bring the fact that E3, the way we know E3, may not be the same this year.
9595000	9598000	What makes you say that?
9598000	9601000	Hello?
9601000	9602000	What makes you say that?
9602000	9612000	Yeah. Well, because of the recent article that was published where the notable figures such as THQ, Nintendo, even Sega are not even present this year.
9612000	9625000	So it's kind of like a scare piece in the sense that the lack of these developers are actually going to be a much more lackluster E3 this year.
9625000	9637000	Do you think a lot of developers are starting to realize, and publishers really, in this age of the internet and everything, maybe they don't need E3?
9637000	9646000	I mean, I guess I probably beat this subject before, but mobile might be eating at some of these companies, like Nintendo in particular.
9646000	9649000	Well, and Facebook games.
9649000	9653000	Zinga's showing for the first time this year.
9653000	9654000	What was that?
9654000	9657000	Zinga's showing for the first time this year.
9657000	9672000	I mean, most of their games, they're going to be all browser-based, but I guess it goes beyond what we typically expect from the developers and the folks that make console games.
9672000	9676000	I guess it's kind of like branching out from the old guard.
9676000	9681000	It's an evolutionary shift in gaming.
9681000	9687000	I don't think consoles will ever die out because there will always be a market for those AAA titles.
9687000	9693000	However, you're going to see another emerging in the form of casual through either mobile or browser-based.
9693000	9709000	So this is where, you're right, Zinga and any other smaller mobile publisher can make inroads due to the fact that these heavy hitter developers are no longer showing up this year or sitting out E3.
9709000	9713000	We've been seeing that develop over the past few years where the casuals are, especially Facebook.
9713000	9725000	I think, yeah, Facebook and iOS games and Android really to an extent too are just the three that are really gaining steam and have almost made up what is this new platform of sorts.
9725000	9727000	At least there are two new platforms really.
9727000	9733000	I would say Facebook and then mobile are just the platforms that now compete with the Vita and the 3DS.
9733000	9743000	Exactly. I remember mentioning this before, but in a couple of years, the next two to three years, you might actually have parity.
9743000	9746000	You're going to get to the point where they're going to converge.
9746000	9759000	Your Vita and your 3DS are going to converge against whatever Apple is offering, whatever is being offered, whatever high-end Android phone will still be out there.
9759000	9764000	And whatever other platform, you know, scales along.
9764000	9782000	You know, if you're a parent out there looking to get a portable game console for your kid to shut them up on long car rides or whatever, you've got to admit, you put a Vita next to an iTouch, which is just the iPhone without the phone, and they're about the same price, and yet the games on one are 99 cents.
9782000	9791000	Right. And even then, it's like when you throw in the iPad in there, you let your kid use your iPad.
9791000	9796000	That pretty much keeps them distracted at that point.
9796000	9799000	Ah, but Shadow Next Gen in our chatroom has a good point.
9799000	9804000	iOS games will never be as good as core games as long as they rely on those virtual controls.
9804000	9811000	Now, an 11-year-old probably doesn't care, but true for the college gamer and even high school gamer and so forth, they're going to care a little more.
9811000	9819000	Right. They are. That is true, but, you know, and the way I see it is this.
9819000	9829000	In the next three years, physical buttons may not be as prevalent in any new platform, as long as they get the tactile feel down to it.
9829000	9833000	I know it's going to be a growing thing, but think about it.
9833000	9842000	I mean, the next evolution besides hardware will have to be some sort of virtual control, something that isn't there, but you touch it and it does something.
9842000	9850000	But it's a lot better. It's either on parity with the hardware button or has more of a natural feeling.
9850000	9857000	Zaku, before we let you go, what do you think will be the biggest shocker out of E3 this year?
9857000	9865000	Well, I mean, we use definitely not in the cards. I'm thinking whatever Microsoft has up their sleeve.
9865000	9877000	And, yeah, not even Sony, I don't even think, because as I said, there isn't a lot of buzz going around of, you know, what actually might steal a show at E3.
9877000	9887000	It could be some other browser-based developer. It could be a mobile developer creating something for multiple platforms that will create a hit.
9887000	9893000	Like Rovio, for example, they're trying to branch out beyond Angry Birds, create a new franchise.
9893000	9901000	So, you know, that might be something as an example, but think if Microsoft might have something up their sleeve.
9901000	9907000	I wouldn't put it past me that they're actually going to reveal the success to 360 or at least hate to it.
9907000	9909000	We'll see. That's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but we'll see.
9909000	9911000	All right, Zaku, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy, okay?
9911000	9913000	All right, have a good one.
9913000	9919000	You got it. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to try and get through here in the last minute or so.
9919000	9928000	One story I wanted to read real quick from Tigerclaw on Twitter. I missed this story earlier in the show, but GameStop apparently cutting down on PSP games.
9928000	9935000	A quarter of the stores will no longer sell PSP games. Please note that's not the PlayStation Vita, that's PSP.
9935000	9941000	So this shouldn't be too big of a surprise, as obviously the Vita is now rolling into probably a lot of that old shelf space.
9941000	9944000	Not really any more PSP games coming out anyways.
9944000	9949000	That's right, so that's kind of on its way out. I would still think there'd be a demand for used games, somewhat.
9949000	9951000	Yeah, but it's going to be a lot smaller. They can shrink that down.
9951000	9956000	Right, and they didn't get rid of all the stores, just a quarter of them, so I imagine some of the little stores.
9956000	9961000	The bigger locations will still carry PSP games as well as the website GameStop.com.
9961000	9967000	So chances are if the GameStop near you is small and doesn't have a lot of shelf space, they were probably one of the 25% that got rid of them.
9967000	9974000	Alright, it doesn't look like our phone line's lighting up, and it's getting to be about 9 o'clock here on the West Coast, so I'm going to go ahead and close that up.
9974000	9979000	And we need to get to listless results. You guys ready for listless results? Because it was very interesting tonight.
9979000	9980000	Let's do it.
9980000	9981000	Let's get to them.
9981000	9994000	We had quite the tie tonight. We have a two-way tie for first place in listless, and we have a two-way tie for what would essentially be third place.
9994000	9999000	Because, you know, when you have a two-way tie for first place, it's first and second, and then you have a two-way tie for third place.
9999000	10001000	So you have the top four answers tonight.
10001000	10002000	Fun.
10002000	10017000	Alright, so here they are as voted by the listeners. Your number tied for number three, new F-Zero game, and new Mario Paint.
10017000	10026000	There you go. Those are the number three things you most want to see on the new 3DS, or excuse me, the new Wii U that will make you go pre-order it that day.
10026000	10028000	A new F-Zero game and a new Mario Paint.
10028000	10033000	Here is the number one answer. We had two answers tie for number one.
10033000	10039000	The tablet controller is actually a tablet. Good luck with that, you guys.
10039000	10041000	I know, it's like a never happens.
10041000	10047000	And lastly, Mario Kart with track editor is number one.
10047000	10048000	Double win for more.
10048000	10053000	Look at that, a double win for Loki. Has that ever happened in the history of list? I don't know.
10053000	10059000	So there it is. Number one tied, Mario Kart with track editor. Tablet controller is actually a tablet.
10059000	10064000	And number three tied, new F-Zero game and new Mario Paint. Crazy ties tonight.
10064000	10074000	But the fans have spoken. Mario Kart, Mario Paint, F-Zero. Bring them. And a free tablet.
10074000	10078000	Well that is going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10078000	10086000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into this whole episode and staying with us, especially the live listeners who have stuck with us through all these disconnects all night.
10086000	10090000	I really appreciate you guys staying with us. I don't know what's causing that.
10090000	10094000	We'll have to see what we can do about next week, make sure all the porn torrents are off.
10094000	10097000	Let's go around and of course get everybody's final thought.
10097000	10098000	We are done with last minute news, right?
10098000	10099000	Yes.
10099000	10100000	I forgot to ask if you had anything else.
10100000	10103000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
10103000	10108000	My final thought tonight is, I would like to be less Flemmy, please.
10108000	10112000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
10112000	10115000	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10115000	10118000	Four words. Robot, unicorn, attack, evolution.
10118000	10120000	Yes.
10120000	10121000	Oh dear.
10121000	10126000	Robot panda, or unit panda, uni-wolf, unit dragon.
10126000	10127000	Oh dear.
10127000	10133000	All right. Thank you guys, all you guys that stayed up late with us listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We really appreciate it.

10169000	10170000	What are you looking at?
10170000	10173000	The panda. Robot panda attack.
10173000	10175000	Makes great radio, just saying.
10175000	10178000	All right, have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you next week.
10178000	10181000	And again, happy Mother's Day to all the mommies.
