10020	12303	Sky, and Loki.
13985	24740	Tonight, May 13th, 2012, the biggest software companies give financial updates, the price drops on older DS models, and could internet browsing finally be coming to the Xbox?
31877	38761	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38921	45564	We are live with episode number 457 of our show for this May the 13th of 2012.
46124	53208	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.
53588	57690	Say hello first off to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
58671	58711	Hi.
59151	61392	I don't think you guys are getting sick.
86465	88428	I have a sore throat Do you really?
88628	93256	I'll make you pay me in coffee Well then maybe you did get sick from me a week ago somehow
93829	96711	Well, then I don't know if I was sick or if it was allergies.
96771	97912	I felt just fine.
123752	129034	I need to introduce, of course, the third host on our show, always here every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki!
129054	129155	Hello.
129175	129795	How are you, Loki?
129815	129995	I'm fine.
130055	131436	Apparently you're getting sick too, that's no good.
147663	149064	Yeah, these things happen.
149384	149544	Yeah.
149924	150204	All right.
151564	164309	Also, of course, we do tape live on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our good pal Bobby Blackwolf over at the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
165729	169290	I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the gamer mommies out there that listen.
169410	170910	I don't know of too many for sure.
170950	173511	I know of one, at least, that usually listens live.
174471	175512	Maybe one other.
176052	183934	But, you know, even if you're not necessarily a gaming mom, you might be a mom figure in somebody else's life, or maybe a mommy to your pets.
184934	188315	So, happy Mother's Day to all who that saying would apply to.
188735	191476	However, for all of you whose girl bits work...
195376	197758	Are you having an unhappy Mother's Day right now?
198479	206687	I've been having a thunk because... And, you know, I've been... Dan and I have been trying for like the last six years.
207348	210511	And I've been trying not to get excited every time I've had a little thing happen.
210531	213094	But I've gotten excited and I've gotten super depressed.
213514	213834	I'm sure.
214435	216477	So I just wanted everyone to shut up.
216958	219240	Well, I understand where you get like really...
219500	226904	It also creeps me the fuck out when people use pictures of their children as their Facebook icons.
227245	234609	I understand being proud of your child, but living through your child and using your child as your avatar is creepy as fuck.
234729	238131	Well, you might change an awful lot once you go through that experience.
238151	239111	I really don't think so.
239171	241333	I've never used a picture of Shermie as my icon.
242433	242954	You should.
243034	243894	Shermie's adorable.
244375	248077	She is adorable, but anytime I've ever used a picture of Shermie, I've been in it.
248877	261793	I have an icon of Shermie on my live journal where I have icons of me and a lot of other people from fandoms and it's the picture of Shermie sitting in Mel B's lap this is another lap dominated by Shermie
262679	263800	Well, we'll see.
264080	267222	I'll keep this recording and someday it'll happen for you.
267522	271564	Remember, true story, my mom and dad didn't get knocked up until my mom was 37.
272004	273245	In a row?
273746	274346	Yes, in a row.
274406	275306	She finally had me at 37.
276227	278248	However, Julian has turned five.
278728	281130	And I have to tell you the funny Mother's Day story from yesterday.
281190	281770	Sure, go ahead.
281930	282951	Then we can talk about games.
283711	289833	I was at Becky's house and Julian runs in from the garage all excited and he hops up in Becky's lap.
290154	292514	He says, Mommy, Mommy, we got you flowers.
293495	294455	But it's a surprise.
296516	298797	And we just started laughing so hard.
299537	300758	Well, it's the kind of flowers.
300778	302918	You can't see it yet because it's a surprise.
303899	306160	And she's like, just know when it's a surprise.
306180	307580	You're not supposed to tell me about it.
308721	311582	Oh, the look on his face was funny.
312022	314603	He's like, oh, you didn't know what kind of flowers.
314943	315823	That was the surprise.
315843	319024	It was just funny because he's like, I can't show you.
319124	320185	This is a surprise.
321065	323546	And just the way he said it, it was so cute.
323606	325887	But yeah, that's my Julian story of the week.
326067	326647	And now he's a kick-ass DJ
349514	350955	I know at least three of the girls are mothers.
350975	352776	Although I have to say one of them, you remember Renee, right?
378348	379068	Oh yeah.
379408	383130	She told me to have a happy Mother's Day because I take care of other people.
383810	384870	That's very nice.
384970	386171	So that made me feel better.
386631	388051	And then I talked to my mommy.
388891	391852	And my mommy was like, I was like, so what are you doing for Mother's Day?
392553	393033	Laundry?
393633	402356	Well, if you think about it, not only are you a mother to Shermie, but you're sort of a godmother to Maruko and Sanrio, our cats, because they have two daddies.
402916	405438	So you're like the womanly influence in their life.
405779	408681	I do get the cuddles from your little prissy dude.
408941	409202	Here you go.
409242	411864	He is kind of a prissy cat with his tail in the air all the time.
411884	413646	It's like, look at my butt.
415027	416348	Going to more comments from our chat room.
416388	421272	TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, for Mother's Day, you should show your mom a violent video game just to see how she reacts.
421612	423194	We already did that like six months ago.
423234	424795	I showed her the new Mortal Kombat game.
424835	425556	It was hilarious.
425616	426797	Oh, what episode number was that?
426937	428579	You taped her reaction.
428759	429100	I did.
429180	433005	It's actually on video, but she said she would disown me if I put the video up.
433085	435608	So I could only play the audio of it for you guys.
436589	438311	Rob, what is this?
438671	442336	Actually, the next thing I want to show her, I want to show her the love scene from Mass Effect 3.
445479	468036	Either the dude on dude or the female on female I want to get my mom Because keep in mind, my mom used to play Super Mario Brothers with me back in the day When I go back to Alabama, I need to get a video Mom today playing Super Mario Brothers She could probably still do 1-1 blindfolded No, no, no, that was 8-1 that you had to do blindfolded Oh, I'm sorry Because it had the same timing every time you freaking did it
469665	482482	DJ Morpheus from Under Sedation Live which is on the VOG Network Saturday nights at a new time 7 Pacific says with Rob's voice cracking periodically it's like being in a time machine and hearing him go through puberty you shut up I'm sick
484679	488081	I'm sick and I'm showing up for this show anyway because I love you guys.
488121	489422	You should say, shut your whore mouth.
489442	490723	That's right, shut your whore mouth.
491804	492864	Hey, video games.
492944	497067	We'll get to our gaming weeks in just a moment, but I thought a couple kickoff topics tonight.
497107	498908	Oh my god, that's so cute.
498968	499189	What?
499729	501030	Something else to distract us now?
501330	505633	No, it was Tigercop listed a picture of him with his old TV.
505673	505913	What?
506593	508415	I had a TV like that.
508435	508815	I want to see.
509958	534952	It has UHF channels and rabbit ears Oh god, I used to have a TV like that in my bedroom Because that was like the ultimate hand-me-down TV Since it is a radio show This is the kind of TV that has the two... Shit Knobs, it had knobs I know, I know, but I'm just realizing as I'm saying this out loud You know, any teenager listening to this show has absolutely no idea what we're talking about And it had a contrast twisty dial Maybe you've seen these at a thrift store
537879	540041	I saw a Blu-ray player at a thrift store, Rob.
540322	544586	I can only imagine that this description should be started with back in my day.
545226	552253	Well, a TV like that, the funny thing is a TV like that wouldn't even work anymore after the whole digital conversion that we had a couple years ago.
552273	555075	However, I'm looking for one for a reason.
555236	555496	Why?
555876	556537	Play my Odyssey 2.
557738	558479	Go to a thrift store.
558499	559379	I'm sure you'd find them there.
559399	559820	I haven't.
560060	561462	I haven't seen them at a thrift store.
561482	561622	Really?
561882	563844	You need to go to like, you know where you need to go?
563864	564745	Just get an RF adapter.
564765	567748	You need to go to Deseret, the Mormon freaking, I know.
568028	569810	I do not like giving the Mormons my money.
569830	572392	I know, but I'll tell you what, they've got everything.
573113	574555	I used to buy old comics there though.
574995	579259	I almost bought, for Rocky, in my defense, it was for Rocky Horror and I don't want to hear it.
580060	581782	I almost bought a wedding dress at Deseret.
584355	586656	I've been with Jessica a number of times getting stuff for clubbing.
586876	586956	Yeah?
586976	587776	Good times.
587796	588916	Because you can get lots of fun.
589236	591617	I've actually bought cosplay stuff there to modify.
591637	592297	There you go.
593137	594697	I bought... The Mormons aren't all bad.
595117	597958	I bought some... Actually, you know what the last thing I bought there was?
598118	598318	What?
598558	600059	Was my copy of Rubber Soul.
600579	601499	The Beatles' Rubber Soul.
602239	602679	On vinyl.
603239	603699	Five bucks.
605120	608641	This other place I went to had a really shitty copy and wanted 50 for it.
608661	610121	And I was like, nah, I'll buy it for the Mormons.
611021	612403	Pre-E3 stuff, what did you want to bring up?
628996	636684	I don't know, there's a lot of big announcements I'm expecting at E3 Alright, is it time to make our E3 predictions?
637244	648555	Now that we know that the press dates have been set and some of them you'll be able to watch live and some of them will only be online or what have you Okay, what are we going to see from Nintendo this year?
648595	651578	This is the easy one What are we going to see from Nintendo this year at their conference?
651857	653378	The Game Boy Micro 2.
656059	662162	I still have my Micro, so... They're just gonna plain say, fuck it, we ain't releasing the Wii U, you bastards.
663723	668626	I'm sure we'll see the Wii U. I just can't get excited about it, though.
668686	668946	I mean...
671149	672089	I don't know.
672449	681112	I don't think there's anything that they can put out for it at launch that's going to make me excited about the Wii U. Excite Truck 2.
681372	684673	That will be a tough, tough day.
686173	687634	But they're not going to announce a date.
687914	689654	They're not going to announce a price.
690415	690835	It's like...
692662	693162	PS3 got delayed.
721724	722265	I don't think so.
722485	725268	I don't think the Wii U can't afford to delay it.
725589	729994	Nintendo already is going down the downward turn with their investors and everything.
730414	734339	If they don't put out the Wii U, you're going to see Mario on the iPhone.
734459	737142	They're going to have to give in to the investors, and that's what the investors want.
737963	739465	They want Nintendo to develop for the iPhone.
742426	750588	So if the Wii U gets delayed... That's the day that Miyamoto will bind his knees and commit seppuku on the roof of the Nintendo building.
750828	751428	Honestly?
752188	752508	Yes.
753168	755049	And then they would sell his head on eBay.
755569	757389	The Wii U's coming, whether it's ready or not.
757409	760090	I hear Foxconn has a nice roof that he can jump off of.
760170	760670	Stop it.
761650	764671	I think Miyamoto has a little more self-respect than that.
764711	766371	I think it would be ritual suicide.
766691	768051	You know, the last one in Japan happened in 1978.
768591	771452	You all are being so morbid and gross and tacky.
772182	774643	I have to read from chatroom, Rob, since you're ignoring it.
774703	775544	I'm not ignoring them.
776124	777545	What do you want to read from chat?
778105	780526	I just lost it because you were busy jabbering.
781887	782187	Oh, yeah.
784687	785708	Great, now I forgot it.
786048	786368	Oh well.
786768	787569	I can't find them anymore.
788149	791251	This is why I usually re-chat.
792291	796094	We have this awesome comment from our chat room and, oh, it's scrolled away.
796194	796754	Where'd it go?
796774	798955	I'm trying to find it.
798975	801757	Someone said, back in my day, oh no, it was one night stands.
801797	803558	Back in my day, we had to blow in our cartridges.
803978	807380	But my retort was, back in my day, my computers used cassette tapes.
808780	809521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
829287	833050	Yay, new Super Mario Bros.
833150	844940	I mean, it's a good game, and they're just making more levels for it, which I've said in the past they should do for the first one, you know, and open it up so everyone else can make levels, but then they won't do that.
847302	851626	I mean, what are they going to really have for... It's not going to be Smash Bros.
851986	853548	They may announce Smash Bros.
853708	856330	because it could be years away before it actually comes out,
856570	858210	But that's not beyond intended to do that.
858270	860211	I mean, hell, when did they announce Pikmin?
860751	861971	What, like a couple years ago?
862731	864392	So, I'm not surprised there.
865932	872574	Probably Animal Crossing will be the holiday game, which is kind of... Yay.
873334	874034	I want to play it.
874334	876975	They may do Luigi's Mansion 2, but eh.
877512	886839	It's kind of been long enough for me since I really got into an Animal Crossing game that I could be, because I really just passed on the Wii one, I really could be convinced to play Animal Crossing 3DS.
886959	888240	I would be pretty easily convinced.
888581	891083	Like, it's really a peer pressure thing for me.
891143	892924	If all my friends do it, I will do it too.
893624	894065	You know what?
894665	896507	I found my copy of Dobutsu no Mori.
897027	897327	Really?
897648	899549	And I was like, I should play this.
899729	902091	And then I was trying to remember why I stopped playing it to begin with.
903112	907135	Because I don't read Kana as well as I thought I did.
908374	910495	This game's hard when you don't natively speak the language.
910755	913716	It's just, I mean, there's not a lot that I can be excited about.
914076	922280	Especially if we're talking about this system's going to be basically like an Xbox 360 with the tablet controller and the Wii controls.
924705	925126	I don't know.
925326	927327	It doesn't seem very exciting to me.
927687	936813	They're going to have probably the same stuff that you saw in the tech demos are probably going to become full-fledged games because that's what they did with the Wii.
936953	938073	Oh, these are only tech demos?
938393	938934	Wii Sports.
939314	939814	Wii Play.
941055	941856	Wii Sports Resort.
941996	943697	It was just all the same shit.
944637	954170	So you'll probably see some sort of compilation that's going to be packed in, like a packing game or something that's going to be like Wii Sports, Wii U Sports or whatever they're going to call it.
954610	956433	And that'll be that.
956493	959517	But I'm kind of interested to see how it's going to work with like...
960578	973510	You know, especially like first person shooters and stuff, that tablet control is cool, but what if like say, I want to have more than just one person playing a first person shooter, you know, are we going to be on the classic controllers now?
973590	979215	I mean, that might not even be that great, because their controllers are kind of lacking compared to some of the other systems.
979235	981797	It's going to be hard to port that stuff over, but
983353	985214	I don't know, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they show.
985454	990095	Alright, let's move on so we don't spend all show on these predictions weeks before the show happens.
990755	991675	How about Microsoft?
992636	996857	I said on Bobby's show a minute ago that I really think Microsoft is hedging all their bets on Halo 4.
997617	1003379	That Halo 4 is going to be the centerpiece of that presentation at the very end, and that's really all the Xbox has going for it right now.
1003399	1004139	No one's going to care.
1005299	1007140	I don't think I'd be that cynical about it.
1007600	1009241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1027635	1028356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1046973	1049996	Please don't make any more resistance to the goddamn dashboard, okay?
1050016	1051978	It's already Windows 8 enough.
1052178	1055201	I mean, so... I don't know.
1056482	1062107	I'm wondering if they won't slip in some things about Windows 8 and kind of maybe how it might interact with the Xbox.
1062147	1064429	Maybe some type of enhanced media center or something?
1064789	1066551	I mean, big question mark there, but...
1067538	1067738	and so on.
1094918	1099843	So you think it'll be a lot of these really weird outside the box things like that that you're talking about that we're going to see from Microsoft?
1099923	1100804	I'm thinking, yeah.
1100884	1102486	Here's how the device does this.
1102646	1105349	Here's how the device makes waffles.
1105529	1110474	Maybe they're going to talk about new properties.
1110615	1114018	It would be nice if they made a new franchise or something like that.
1114158	1116060	Hell, Nintendo, make a new franchise.
1116761	1117502	That would be kind of cool.
1120490	1121210	I said Nintendo needs a new...
1149818	1150398	Sure, Nintendo.
1150458	1151738	Any of them could use the new one.
1151778	1152219	Why not?
1152779	1153499	New IPs rock.
1153819	1163781	Well, maybe that's, you know, with all this retro gaming thing that's been going on, maybe what they need to do is look at the old stuff and bring it screaming into the modern.
1163921	1165342	Yeah, but some of it hasn't worked out too well.
1165362	1166302	Look at Bionic Commando.
1166542	1167562	Oh, yeah, but that was shit.
1167582	1171003	Well, that worked out well for the Xbox Live Arcade games.
1171263	1171904	That's true.
1172044	1175226	The best Bionic Commando were the remade games.
1175246	1176908	Which is ironic because they're by the same people.
1177048	1188818	The other thing, the IPTV stuff, the web TV thing that they're maybe going to be doing, their own TV network type thing, that might be interesting.
1189577	1191538	I would bet you anything that's where Majors Minute goes.
1192398	1194119	Some sort of new show.
1194819	1195379	Interesting.
1195439	1197880	To get rid of the old show to make way for the new show.
1198301	1200341	Alright, let's quickly talk Sony real quick.
1200362	1201642	Because Sony's kind of a wild card.
1201682	1209505	I mean, obviously they're going to be pushing Vita, but we're not going to really see... There's not going to be any peripherals that we can think of that would come out from Sony.
1209525	1210886	There's nothing that they're pushing there.
1211546	1240798	so it's really games games games games games left and right Vita they're going to be having a lot of stuff to talk about the Vita maybe enhancements to that maybe some more move enabled games once again I don't think the move is a bad peripheral honestly out of all of the motion captured things that they have right now I think that one works the best yet I don't want to play anything that's using it
1241218	1242740	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1261478	1269062	Um, I think they're gonna talk a little bit more about, you know, once again, franchises that are gonna be supporting the move and stuff like Bioshock, um, Infinite.
1269923	1276907	Um, I think that they may have, well, obviously, they have a few new games that they're, um, supposed to be announcing, like, you know, the... God of War prequel.
1277027	1280149	Well, the God of War prequel... Stop making God of War prequels.
1280189	1283711	I mean, there's how many God of War... I can't even keep track of the storyline anymore.
1283731	1286052	Sony Smash Brothers or whatever they're calling it, Battle Royale, Extreme.
1286072	1286852	That might be pretty cool.
1287453	1289734	Um, they're gonna probably show, um...
1291875	1294856	What about that one game, Last Guardian?
1295817	1296377	Last Guardian still?
1296417	1299738	Where that guy suddenly disappeared, but they say the game's not canceled.
1299758	1301299	The Last of Us, also.
1301359	1304180	That's their big holiday game.
1305380	1307501	So they're really going to just have game, game, game, game.
1307541	1309022	I think they're just going to have lots of games.
1309142	1309522	That's good.
1309542	1310082	That's what they need.
1310362	1311042	Especially Vita.
1311783	1316144	I'm really excited to see the Vita second half based on some of the early stuff they were announcing before.
1316785	1317005	Yeah.
1317385	1317525	So...
1318792	1319052	All right.
1319733	1323877	Going to our chat room, ShadowNextGen says, there needs to be a Vita price drop announcement at E3.
1323997	1331003	I don't... I mean, I think that will... And then WhatUpG follows that with, there is talk of a PS3 price drop for E3, ShadowNextGen.
1331584	1333505	Again, that's VOGnetwork.com for chat.
1333685	1336688	I could see them doing that because they want to push more systems.
1337649	1339391	They're just bundling right now.
1339471	1340652	They're kind of doing the whole thing.
1341072	1343114	The Vita price drop, I mean...
1344475	1348637	I guess they could do that, but I think they're already losing money on the system.
1349157	1351118	So it's going to be hard for them to do that.
1351138	1356621	Because the system is more powerful than the 3DS, and so therefore it is more expensive.
1356781	1360983	It's just right now I don't think there's a lot of games that people need to have on the Vita.
1361003	1363945	There's nothing like, oh my god, I need to get a Vita for this game.
1364325	1367266	Whereas Mario Kart, oh, I've got to buy a 3DS for that.
1367366	1370268	Or Super Mario 3D Land, because it's just an amazing Mario game.
1370808	1372388	You know, a Zelda game or something like that.
1372448	1374489	Although, the new Zelda game on the 3DS.
1374809	1378130	None of this Nintendo 64 rehash bullshit.
1380350	1380890	Let's see.
1381691	1388132	Actually, speaking of rehash bullshit for the 3DS, I'm surprised they haven't remade the Mario 64.
1388372	1392533	That could be a title that they could just poop out real quick and put out for holiday.
1392713	1394314	It would sell a ton of copies.
1395294	1395414	Um...
1397463	1397824	I don't know.
1398264	1399886	I think there's going to be a lot of things for the Vita.
1399906	1401868	I think Call of Duty is definitely going to help.
1402369	1409116	I think if they end up doing a Max Payne Grand Theft Auto or something of that caliber on there, they could easily do that.
1409336	1413841	You know, I'm actually very interested in LEGO City Stories, which was the...
1414722	1416464	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1434458	1437001	and just more Grand Theft Auto 5.
1437261	1438422	I don't care who shows it.
1438543	1441626	Microsoft, Sony, both of them.
1441946	1444869	Hey, let's just show different things.
1445050	1445850	Every booth has it.
1445910	1447192	EA just put it up there.
1447452	1448553	Hey, it's such an awesome game.
1448573	1449334	We're going to show this too.
1450415	1451597	I think that would be pretty cool.
1451677	1451877	So...
1454833	1474840	I don't know, I hope it's just something that's not cancelled Because once again, all those really cool things that I wanted for the 3DS DJ Hero, Saints Row, that kind of stuff All got fucking cancelled before the 3DS came out So all these things that they announced for the Wii U Like, you know, this Lego City story thing Could easily be cancelled by the time we get to it
1476505	1476785	All right.
1476825	1479806	Well, I'm sure some of you out there have your theories as well.
1480206	1485688	Email us quickly before the leaks start coming because that's going to be the exciting thing over the next few weeks is leaks, leaks, and more leaks.
1485708	1486528	We even have a few tonight.
1486929	1490270	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com to lock in your predictions right now.
1490290	1493371	And I would like to add once again because I don't think I say this enough.
1493471	1498413	I fucking hate Michael Patcher for getting paid lots of money to make stupid guesses.
1498513	1498713	I mean –
1499833	1505797	Hey, hey, I hear that a certain big title from Take-Two got, you know, delayed.
1506037	1508779	Therefore, Grand Theft Auto V is coming out that day.
1509019	1515163	Yes, you could draw that, you know, you can make that argument, I guess, because it's a pretty obvious one to make.
1515543	1524869	You know, or like, hey, I hear that, you know, a studio's making a new Halo game for the X... I think it's gonna be for the Xbox.
1525149	1528672	I mean, come on, that would be kind of the stuff that he makes...
1530205	1530745	Calls on.
1530845	1531185	I don't know.
1531325	1533086	But he gets paid a lot more money than I do.
1533366	1537787	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks because I have a pretty big thing I got to get into in my gaming week this week.
1537847	1540828	So let's start off with ladies first, DarkSakura.
1541208	1542148	How was your gaming week?
1542168	1544688	What type of video games have you been playing this week when you haven't been coughing?
1545449	1554571	I got a Panda to 10 as a brewmaster and talked to the King of Stormwind and realized he's an asshole and quit playing the beta.
1555411	1558232	By the way, she's a Warcraft addict, everybody.
1558892	1559172	Dealer.
1560931	1562052	and I played some Portal 2.
1563273	1566615	Oh, have you played with that new level creator thingy that came out?
1566635	1567496	Not yet, not yet.
1567616	1568157	Oh, you gotta.
1568517	1569377	I need to.
1569538	1570358	Last week was finals.
1571639	1576883	Which I have to say, everybody, be proud of me, made a 97 on my art history final.
1578985	1582067	I have passed the class with an A. Booyah.
1583010	1591195	I need to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.
1591655	1593516	Yeah, I think you might want to cash in on that.
1593576	1595337	It's down to like 20 bucks now.
1595597	1598719	Oh, if it doesn't work, I'll have to wait for another Steam sale.
1598739	1601020	Still, I'm going to point and laugh at you for having missed that boat.
1601040	1607144	I want to thank Actdeft for the gift of the Portal 2 behind the scenes thing.
1607304	1608445	Oh, that's nice.
1609005	1610106	Listeners buy us gifts?
1610726	1611367	I want gifts.
1611387	1612508	The listeners buy me gifts.
1612548	1615611	No, I actually, I have gotten nice things from listeners before.
1615651	1616312	I can't pitch.
1616372	1619375	Speaking of gifts, I already bought you guys Christmas gifts.
1619976	1620456	Already?
1620816	1621117	Really?
1621357	1622078	I already took care of it.
1622318	1622678	Nice.
1623379	1624460	That's being proactive.
1625401	1627203	Now I'm going to remember that when Christmas comes around.
1627383	1628244	You bought that in May.
1629505	1631367	No, I can't wait.
1631567	1633309	It's not ready yet, though.
1633329	1633930	All right.
1635310	1640632	Raidenator in chat says, just an A, no A+, for shame.
1641093	1642553	He's being very much an Asian father right now.
1642573	1643434	Do I look Asian to you?
1645454	1649036	Alright, I'm assuming she's done, so Loki, your gaming week.
1649496	1651377	I just played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
1651537	1659500	I wanted to get to play other things, but I was actually working on some Grand Theft Auto modding tool thing, and I finally finished that, so I'm done with that.
1659540	1662641	I can actually go and work on actual Grand Theft Auto 4 modding.
1663281	1668524	I got to get my stuff that I've been working on for like a year now done before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
1669205	1672687	And then I am going back to Skyrim.
1674428	1675648	It's beckoning me.
1675928	1676649	So I'm going to play that.
1676729	1679190	Now actually, I'm supposed to be getting a copy.
1679430	1682812	I don't know if I'm going to keep it of the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition for the 360.
1683193	1686654	I haven't decided if I'm going to play that or not.
1687075	1692058	I do want Max Payne 3 because I want to rule the online for that.
1692218	1692358	But...
1694299	1694760	We'll see.
1694940	1697763	I have to wait on money.
1698884	1699244	Alright.
1699965	1700525	That's it then.
1701827	1704009	Alright, my gaming week has been all over the map.
1704289	1705370	Let's talk about the big one.
1706511	1708053	I beat my third game for 2012 this week.
1710697	1716041	That means I'd be... Okay, so if we go back... Now, remember, I have Gamer's ADD.
1716361	1718002	I never beat video games.
1718062	1727208	And if you haven't heard me talk about my Gamer ADD on the show before, I have a horrible habit of buying $60 video games, playing the first three stages, and then going, Ooh, shiny!
1727509	1729430	Playing a new game that comes out the very next week.
1729850	1732532	I know I'm not the only podcast host that has this problem.
1732572	1733773	I've heard other guys with this.
1734253	1735234	I don't know what you're talking about.
1735254	1735814	Exactly.
1736314	1740296	I know I'm not the only gamer with this problem, so it happens to all of us.
1740536	1741616	There's not enough hours in the day.
1741717	1747439	You know, sorry, just to interrupt real quick, but you posted on Twitter you needed a new game to play.
1747579	1750180	Yeah, I was going to get to that, but yeah.
1750360	1751041	Well, then let me continue.
1751061	1752481	Well, first I have to talk about my big feat.
1752762	1753882	So I beat my third game.
1753922	1760165	So to recap, this year I beat Mass Effect, and then after that I beat Mass Effect 2.
1760865	1762186	Guess what I beat the other night?
1763126	1763706	Space Harrier
1784232	1795457	So, Rob, how about that ending?
1797378	1799038	So I can finally talk about the ending.
1799298	1800179	I won't spoil, though.
1800519	1806522	Out of respect to those that have not beat Mass Effect 3 yet or are just now getting into Mass Effect, I'm not going to spoil.
1806542	1807562	So which color did you get?
1808992	1835002	I went with green which apparently was not the right thing to do but my thought was oh well I'm not going to go with the obviously paragon or the obviously renegade thing this surely must be the bonus choice that I get for having collected so many war assets which was only about half true yes it is a bonus choice you get for collecting a certain amount of war assets but it's not as great as you think you said ass
1836691	1839914	Anyhow, so without ruining the ending, let me just say this.
1841255	1845178	I pretty much stand by everything I already said about this debacle earlier in the program.
1846591	1852334	Yeah, it's kind of a disappointing end to a series that a lot of people are very rabid over.
1852955	1857737	It's a little weird that no matter what you do, the end result kind of ends up being really the same.
1858418	1871345	And for all this war asset, multiplayer, EA server, it interfaces with the iPad app and the iPhone game and the website and all this stuff.
1871385	1872586	You build up the war.
1873026	1874987	It maybe impacts, you know,
1875427	1904194	three quick time movies you get at the end of the game which is kind of disappointing considering Bioware put so much more into the game otherwise but maybe I don't know maybe they didn't want to branch it out in all these directions because it makes future games in the series a bitch to make I don't know I don't know their reasoning but I'm looking forward to the DLC just like everybody else this is supposed to be the last one surely you don't suggest that they made a terrible ending so that they could sell another game please please it won't be the last Mass Effect game
1905335	1914070	I mean it might be the last in this trilogy but if they can make a Halo 4 they can make a Mass Effect 4 that's for sure
1915197	1942228	um otherwise you know yes the ending is is unfortunate but it doesn't ruin the hundred hours of a gaming experience I had to get there which was a great gameplay experience I'm still playing the multiplayer as recently as earlier today I was playing multiplayer I was playing multiplayer with Shane and and Paul one of our listeners one of his friends last night we were all trying the gold multiplayer and getting our ass kicked but it was so much fun um so you know we're we're having fun with that and um
1944383	1946464	What else did I want to say about the whole ending debacle?
1946484	1947965	There's one other thing I wanted to say about it.
1948665	1958470	Oh, the whole talk about the defective game and turning it back to Amazon and filing the complaint with the FCC.
1958850	1960071	That shit was ridiculous.
1960391	1960811	Oh, really?
1961171	1961311	Yeah.
1961712	1962832	I didn't need to play the game to know that.
1962872	1963913	Yeah, exactly.
1963973	1965654	My thoughts have not changed on that.
1965714	1966694	I just want to make that clear.
1967534	1967875	Am I...
1969113	1971054	Do I think Bioware could have done better?
1971454	1973095	Fuck yeah, I think they could have done better.
1973275	1973975	Absolutely.
1974535	1978997	But I'm not really the type to raise this huge ruckus and stink over it.
1979097	1983959	They were a little busy working on some Star Wars MMO or something.
1984779	1987261	Shane is screaming at me to talk about the theory.
1987821	1989923	But I don't want to spoil it, Shane.
1990023	1992524	I don't want to spoil it for listeners that haven't beat it yet.
1993045	1993925	All I will say is this.
1994406	2002331	He was begging me to watch this one and a half hour long documentary on YouTube that is explaining the ending.
2002871	2007614	And I'm like, Shane, I don't need to watch this hour and a half documentary that explains the ending.
2007855	2010056	Because I kind of already figured it out.
2010176	2011397	Like I was halfway there.
2012157	2014099	And then he says, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2014159	2014539	And I'm like,
2015079	2016120	Oh, okay, I can see that.
2016200	2017041	Yeah, you're probably right.
2017121	2018221	Yeah, that's probably it.
2018261	2020903	You see, they're going to better explain the ending soon, you know.
2020923	2028648	They're going to have the pop-up bubbles, like pop-up video, you know, for the ending once the new Bioware DLC comes out for Mass Effect 3.
2028728	2032130	And he's like, no, you have to watch it anyway because there's so many little things that go into it.
2032150	2035492	I'm like, Shane, I don't need to be sold on the theory.
2035913	2036853	I accept your theory.
2037154	2038114	It makes a lot of sense.
2038454	2039315	All right, I'm on board.
2039415	2039795	You're right.
2039935	2042257	That's the ending, and that's how they're going to fix it in the DLC.
2042757	2043778	No, watch the documentary.
2045439	2058630	Actdeft in the chatroom screaming, exactly, fucking exactly, it's open to interpretation.
2058690	2059210	That it is.
2059871	2060171	It is.
2060732	2061172	A little bit.
2062433	2062753	Anyhow.
2063374	2065616	How about other games that aren't Mass Effect?
2067443	2068804	Which I know, sacrilege, right?
2069204	2069485	Okay.
2070566	2072247	You wanted me to get out the haterade, though?
2072267	2074589	Because I played a really fucking terrible game this week.
2074829	2077671	It is Yaris Bad, you guys.
2077851	2078292	You ready?
2078852	2085638	It was a free game for me on PlayStation Plus, which should start to tell you how terrible it was.
2086158	2088040	And I don't even remember the name of it.
2089321	2091803	I think it was called...
2092643	2098005	Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns
2122194	2126655	Remember how Frogger came out again in like 94 or 95 on the PlayStation?
2126695	2127675	And it wasn't bad.
2127795	2131616	That first Frogger game was kind of a neat reimagining of Frogger on the PlayStation, right?
2132256	2137177	And how every Frogger since then has basically tried to be that PlayStation game all over again.
2137197	2142258	Because I guess that was actually one of the best-selling PlayStation games ever, was that Frogger that came out.
2142478	2143299	But it was awful.
2144439	2144679	So...
2146269	2172701	Frogger Returns is like kind of a mixture of the two like it's trying to be the arcade game in that top overhead style but they've redone the maps to add a sewer level a subway thing and it's just like it's so derpy and I don't really have a better way to explain it like there's power-ups you guys oh my god oh my god okay power-ups power-ups you can make everything stop
2174042	2198139	for a few seconds which surprisingly doesn't make anything easier because sometimes you have to have things moving in order to get from platform to platform so that power up does nothing and then oh my god you guys oh my god you guys super revolutionary frogger power up change your fucking mind blow your blow your fucking mind away ready reverse everything fucking moves backwards oh my god
2201041	2204388	Don't tell me that they have a mirror stage option as well.
2204801	2205302	I don't know.
2205382	2207604	I didn't beat the game, but maybe that's something that comes up.
2207924	2209906	But everything moves backwards.
2210326	2211687	And you know what it changes?
2212408	2212908	Nothing.
2213269	2218653	Because Frogger is just as hard when everything's moving backwards as it is forwards.
2218853	2219294	Hey, Rob.
2219514	2219714	What?
2219854	2221496	There was a good Frogger thing that came out.
2221636	2222076	What's that?
2222597	2225099	Frogger 3 Deep on the Commodore 64 was badass.
2225659	2231004	It was a project using GPS mapping and street sensors.
2231024	2231925	What?
2232125	2238648	to where they had an interactive Frogger that used New York City traffic as the cars and you played the frog.
2239929	2241810	That's already more interesting than the game I played.
2241830	2243211	I don't know, that looked pretty derpy.
2243351	2244331	I thought it was pretty neat.
2244411	2249914	I will say this, for you trophy whores, there are four trophies in Frogger Returns.
2250334	2256538	You get a silver trophy for beating the first stage and then for stages two through four you get a gold trophy.
2256958	2260900	So if you want like an easy gold trophy or two, go play Frogger Returns.
2261940	2280612	free on PlayStation Plus otherwise oh the one I needed to get out there which this is so important the collision detection is awful and in Frogger collision detection is kind of important you think I was nowhere near that car
2281815	2284697	It's like playing a sprite-based game in three dimensions.
2284757	2285317	It's terrible.
2286358	2286678	All right.
2287139	2287699	Moving on.
2288600	2292242	One other game I played on PlayStation 3, although this game's on Xbox Live Arcade as well.
2292542	2295004	I didn't pay for it because it's also free on PlayStation Plus.
2295024	2296745	No, we got found at Fifth Avenue Frogger.
2297346	2300528	And this game was actually worth my time, unlike the other one.
2301068	2301809	Awesome Knots!
2302842	2303723	I will play it!
2326743	2355062	and so I mean imagine if you were playing like a type of Contra where you were just shooting the other people that's kind of what they've made is a side-scroller shooter that's multiplayer head-to-head and yeah it's kind of a neat experience I liked it can you shoot people until they explode yeah you shoot people till they explode they go back to their base and they have to respawn and then you fall down this little rocket and that's that's kind of what fills the time so that way you know you get there is a penalty for you having died and
2355422	2359504	And in a nutshell, you're trying to bust through these little, like, I think they're called turrets.
2359604	2362345	You bust through these little turrets on your way to get to the base.
2362445	2366446	I mean, it's like any other tower defense game, but they've mixed it with a shooter, which makes it kind of unique and fun.
2366846	2368347	So yeah, I liked Awesomenauts.
2368547	2369307	That's worth a look.
2369507	2372508	If you're on PlayStation Plus, especially, it's free.
2373008	2375029	So, like, seriously, go get it.
2375309	2377450	So it wasn't Awesomenauts.
2378010	2390728	well and it has this amazing 80s retro theme song to it and like anime intro and I gotta say it's it's a sharp looking game looks like a cartoon it's great art styles fun so yeah it's where it's worth checking out
2391485	2401394	So I was just thinking now, you know, how you're looking for another game to play, you know, and possibly one that's, you know, we could play with other people.
2401434	2402495	Yes, I put that out on Twitter.
2402555	2404877	Now that I beat Mass Effect 3, what do I play?
2404917	2407139	And of course Shane replied and said, more Mass Effect.
2407179	2411443	I'm like, I want to give it a month before I start my Renegade playthrough.
2411483	2416908	Well, I was just thinking it'd be interesting if we both tried Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.
2418369	2447018	all right look I don't want the Minecraft hate mail I played Minecraft on PC and I just didn't get it but to be fair to be fair everybody put the pens down don't write the hate mail the first time I played Mass Effect about three years ago the first Mass Effect game I didn't get it either and I didn't like it so okay I'm with you Loki let's give let's give Minecraft one more chance I will I will buy it tomorrow all right
2447398	2448939	I am looking for Minecraft for Linux.
2450579	2451480	I'm sure it exists.
2452160	2453941	Why the sudden urge to get into Minecraft, Loki?
2453961	2456302	I don't have a real urge to it, but I think it'd be interesting.
2456322	2465105	It'd be funny if we both played a game, like we set a time during the week or something to play multiplayer and that, and just, whether we hate it or like it, it'll be interesting.
2465266	2465606	That's right.
2465906	2467006	Interesting it will.
2467566	2468587	There is Minecraft for Linux.
2468607	2469347	Of course there is.
2469387	2470488	There's everything for Linux.
2470548	2471528	I don't know.
2471548	2472389	There's Steam for Linux.
2473029	2475610	Or we could play a game that we already have, like Saints Row 3rd.
2476141	2480145	BobbyBlackWolf in our chatroom says, Sky, Minecraft on 360 is a better introduction.
2480205	2480785	That's what I hear.
2480885	2483828	It's set up a little better to get you into the series.
2484228	2484809	I'll check it out.
2484909	2485169	I will.
2485209	2485530	Why not?
2485970	2486190	Sure.
2486450	2486771	All right.
2488472	2495158	Otherwise, I do have all these other games I could be playing, like Fez I need to play more of because I actually really enjoyed the little time I spent with that.
2496119	2496460	Whatever.
2497320	2497821	Let's move on.
2498629	2499970	Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
2500010	2500630	How's that sound?
2501611	2503332	Oh, first, let me plug our Twitters.
2503392	2504653	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2504673	2505994	And, of course, our Facebook.
2506014	2508436	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2508856	2509156	Add us.
2509516	2510177	Be our friend.
2511278	2512478	And we'll be your friend in return.
2512679	2515420	And you can interact with the show and answer our frugal questions every week.
2516221	2518863	Otherwise, housekeeping, there will still be a show next week.
2518903	2519783	But no Dark Sakura.
2519843	2521885	Dark Sakura is going to the happiest place on Earth.
2522605	2523486	And not taking me.
2523506	2523566	Huh?
2525103	2526624	You know, you were invited.
2526684	2529406	I was totally invited, but I can't make it because I have a conflict.
2530147	2531748	That's right, you're conflicted.
2531848	2532928	Yeah, I always am.
2532989	2536131	So Loki and I will be here holding down the fort, maybe a guest host.
2537191	2538793	Alan works on Sunday nights now, so he won't be here.
2538813	2544477	And for the record, Frisbee, wine does not work on my netbook, which I'm running Linux Mint on.
2544677	2545878	So, end of story.
2546018	2549940	And also, I want to say, Nicholson, since I know you're listening, thank you for the pink berry.
2550581	2551001	Right, Jamie?
2552442	2553163	Yes, thank you.
2555402	2557403	It was considerate of you to think of us.
2559904	2560504	It was considerate.
2560524	2561304	He brought it for me.
2562204	2563425	You just sound so sincere.
2563845	2564285	No, you are.
2565846	2566706	It was considerate.
2567206	2569927	Alright, let's move on and get into the news.
2570007	2570247	Loki.
2571314	2572896	E.A.
2572996	2575418	is planning on doing some layoffs.
2575959	2581004	The plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs by September 30th.
2581384	2584147	Basically, what they're doing is restructuring of their employees.
2584167	2586549	Weaning people off?
2588542	2590504	Yes, they're restructuring them out of the company.
2590844	2593826	Okay, see right here, this is our group of employees here.
2594147	2596648	This circle represents the people that are in the company.
2596929	2599551	The people that are outside of the circle, you're fired.
2601092	2603254	So that's kind of how it's going to work.
2604054	2609238	They're basically, I guess, dropping from 1 in 8 engineers to 1 in 2.
2611720	2612461	So, cool.
2613222	2614503	And I guess...
2616627	2623201	They will... By the way, this is all the fault of people that rent games and buy them used.
2623342	2626569	This is all your fault and the blood is on your hands.
2626977	2627657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2655548	2656008	Uh, yeah.
2656148	2666891	And then, of course, they're going to drop the number of employees by 5-10%, which is approximately 500 to 1,000 people.
2667011	2672572	How in the hell does that go from 1 in 8 people being an engineer to 1 in 2 people being an engineer when you're firing 5%?
2673792	2676813	Like, I'm not even a math major, and that doesn't compute to me.
2677273	2680174	Does that mean all these people are suddenly going to be changed into engineers?
2680194	2680734	Yeah.
2681114	2683896	They're just going to... Loki, bam, you're an engineer.
2684316	2687479	They're just going to make him respec, okay, as an engineer.
2687499	2688940	So that's what's going to happen, you know.
2689180	2691802	You were a white mage before, you're now a fucking engineer.
2691882	2694143	They're going to need to pay 120 Microsoft points.
2694183	2698646	Listen, you better learn how to fucking pilot that airship because if not, you're out of there as well.
2699107	2700768	We're going to drop it down to one and one engineers.
2702769	2703109	So yes.
2703250	2705791	Only you could make a shitty thing like job loss hilarious.
2705831	2706392	Thank you, Loki.
2707543	2714464	Hey, not only do I speculate about, you know, game industry stuff, I can also do comedy.
2714885	2716125	Fuck you, Michael Patcher.
2716705	2718105	You can't do comedy for shit.
2718305	2719125	I saw your video.
2720666	2724567	My data says that there are more people that whine than complain.
2725407	2728067	Well, my data says that you're a fucking tard.
2728808	2729048	Allegedly.
2729108	2729628	Allegedly.
2729928	2730488	Allegedly.
2735003	2735584	So there's that.
2735764	2739871	And then, of course, beyond that, they've made some money with Origin.
2741554	2745441	I guess they have 11 million members on Origin.
2745942	2747385	Now, to be fair...
2748148	2752409	If you play an EA game that has multiplayer, you have to sign up on Origin.
2752489	2756011	Yeah, I'm on Origin because of Mass Effect.
2756131	2759312	You may be skewing those numbers a little bit.
2759432	2761693	So, fine.
2761933	2765334	The person who hacked my Xbox signed me up for Origin.
2765394	2767235	I got signed up for Origin.
2768455	2770916	And my Xbox hasn't been hacked, but I'm signed up for it.
2771616	2772996	Somehow, I don't remember doing it.
2773017	2773437	Dragon Age.
2773857	2775417	That's why I did it for Dragon Age.
2776398	2776778	I'm smart.
2777998	2788783	And then, of course, they've made $150 million in revenue during the fiscal year from March 31, 2011 to April 1 of this year.
2789864	2801609	And they're saying that EA's Nucleus cross-platform community network, which, I've got to be honest, I've never heard of, has 220 million members.
2801810	2804711	I don't even know what the fuck that is or why they have so many members for it.
2805531	2816094	Um, and they said, of course, uh, they've allowed 11 million members to provide feedback on Origin and their distribution service.
2816434	2821696	But, I see, once again, it's just because you can't tout those numbers.
2821896	2827418	That's like, for example, the PlayStation, like Sony saying, oh look, the PlayStation Network has all these members.
2828078	2830480	Yes, because it's free to make an account.
2830980	2831981	I have four accounts.
2832141	2832981	Am I four people?
2833101	2834122	No, I am one person.
2834382	2837824	But I have four accounts because I like having accounts in every single region.
2838364	2839585	And also Nelly has an account.
2839905	2842187	But technically it's on the PlayStation, so therefore it's my account.
2842667	2844488	But that doesn't count.
2845749	2846889	So, whatever.
2847010	2847330	Fine.
2847650	2849971	Tout your numbers, but all it really comes down to is revenue.
2850451	2851651	$150 million isn't bad.
2852372	2855413	I don't know what Steam makes during that same time period.
2855693	2857493	I'm assuming a lot more than $150 million.
2857774	2859414	$150 million can save lots of jobs.
2859874	2860174	Never mind.
2860815	2863196	Oh, by the way, it wasn't Dragon Age.
2863316	2863816	It was Sims 3.
2865276	2865777	Whatever.
2867797	2869518	Maybe Sims 3 makes you sign up for Origin?
2870143	2873845	No, but I signed up for an EA registration account.
2874325	2874505	Oh.
2874705	2877687	So it linked my data from when I signed up for Dragon Age.
2877727	2879067	It actually linked my data from Sim 3.
2879268	2879648	Gotcha.
2880248	2886491	Well, it's also weird because I had a Call of Duty Elite account, and yet I never remembered signing up for one.
2886871	2887552	But I did.
2888252	2890013	I just don't remember why.
2891072	2892674	Call of Duty Elite Activision Blizzard Activision Blizzard
2906592	2933480	the net revenue right now 1.17 billion for the period ending on March 31st 2012 that is a 23% drop over 2011 Activision let's see Activision had 23% of net revenues that's down 19% Blizzard accounted for 21% of net revenues down 42% probably because I would imagine because Blizzard had Starcraft 2 sales still pretty strong this time last year and also WoW subscriptions were up
2935140	2942484	Now, of course, Blizzard kind of has this semi-big game coming out Let me think, when is that game going to be out?
2942544	2947266	Oh yeah, tomorrow night, Diablo 3, which should look pretty good for them Pandas!
2948467	2961013	Land of the Panda People is coming out later this year as well And then of course they have a StarCraft 2 expansion on the horizon Do you suppose that maybe getting people to prepay for their full year of... Now, assuming that was prepaid for the Blood Pact, right?
2961833	2962354	No, it was not.
2962875	2965718	It was merely the equivalent of a cell phone contract.
2965738	2968822	You sign it up and agree not to... I thought maybe they were trying to boost their numbers.
2968842	2969963	You don't have to pay anything extra.
2969983	2974428	It's just... We'll give you a pretty pony and this game and a beta...
2975303	2976384	I will say I did this.
2976604	2983967	When I signed up for the blood pact, I switched my account to six months at a time because when you do six months at a time, you get like $2 off a month.
2983987	2986107	You pay like $77 for six months.
2986588	2993530	And so I just did that because I had a nice chunk of money six months ago and then I knew around now I would have to pony up the money again, which I did.
2994731	2995231	And it's okay.
2996351	2997732	So let's see.
2999537	3023935	uh Activision's big stuff uh coming up uh Prototype 2, Amazing Spider-Man, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 yeah they've got well they've got uh well Prototype 2 just came out um obviously their big one Call of Duty later on Skylanders Giants which I hate to say it's probably gonna be a big title for them um and they have a whole bunch of smaller things in between then like uh Ice Age 2 they have a
3024355	3027816	A terrible Battleship game that's coming out also on Tuesday.
3028536	3029857	They also have... Wait a minute.
3029977	3030597	Wait a minute.
3031037	3032417	Battleship was a game.
3033097	3033938	Now it's a movie.
3034138	3035538	The game based off the movie.
3035678	3036518	Based off the game.
3038319	3040259	Yes, they have a game that's coming out.
3041060	3046501	A first person shooter that will probably be passed over by a lot of people coming out as well.
3046961	3051202	And then a couple weeks later, Men in Black, Alien Crisis.
3051342	3053143	Another terrible game based on a movie.
3053363	3053523	Well,
3053783	3055167	Not exactly based on the movies.
3055207	3056891	Based on a lot of secondary characters from the movies.
3057714	3058877	That's also coming out as well.
3058937	3059799	So they're going to have that.
3059919	3061243	And Spider-Man will do well for them.
3063126	3069968	Alright, well, Call of Duty Elite, since Loki brought that up a minute ago, apparently 10 million users are signed up for Call of Duty Elite.
3070528	3072169	2 million are paid subscribers.
3072489	3075630	That's better than nothing, which is what they had a few years ago when the service didn't exist.
3076650	3086153	Apparently that is up 3 million and a half million, so it was 7 million and 1.5 million since February when they last reported on the numbers.
3086573	3088613	So, yeah, it's gone up.
3089053	3090754	I guess people are liking their Call of Duty Elite.
3090874	3091394	DarkSakura.com
3101910	3106333	See, I'm not super into Call of Duty, so that's really not for me, but I could see where that is lucrative.
3106353	3108755	If they had something like that for Mass Effect, I'd be tempted.
3109596	3110416	I hate to say that.
3110536	3119243	Yeah, see, right now we play offline at work, so that would require everybody having those maps in order for it to be beneficial for me to buy those maps.
3119844	3122666	So I just don't buy those maps right now.
3124187	3124487	All right.
3125368	3127670	Well, let's move on with some more news, DarkSakura.
3129204	3133305	Yes, other stuff that is, well, more Blizzard-y things.
3134385	3139667	Blizzard and Valve settled their little trademark disagreement for the D-O-T-A, Dota, whatever it is.
3141007	3154071	So basically, Valve gets to use it, and Blizzard retains non-commercial use of the title for the community, as in keeping it as an acronym available for Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2.
3155832	3161035	In fact, Blizzard is renaming the Blizzard DOTA project.
3161295	3162356	It's called Blizzard All-Stars.
3164157	3168360	This is the quote that came out from Rob Pardo, who's the Blizzard exec.
3169821	3174825	Both Blizzard and Valve recognize that at the end of the day, players just want to be able to play the games they're looking forward to.
3175365	3175445	Soon.
3175465	3175545	Soon.
3201838	3202319	Which is good.
3202519	3203559	I mean, the community wins.
3203700	3207963	And it's not like the community is not going to know one of these games from the other.
3208083	3212206	I mean, Dota-style games are really a rage right now.
3212586	3214267	You know, League of Legends is really huge.
3214327	3216029	It's a game we don't talk about enough on this show.
3216049	3217650	There's a pretty huge community behind it.
3218771	3243427	you know those style of games are very popular so I think everybody's really waiting to see what Blizzard and Valve puts out there as well as there's another one one of the other Dota makers went to go make a third one I can't remember the name I'm sure someone in chat will jump in but there's kind of a third one involved in all this too so and then of course there's League of Legends too so you know they're all kind of very similar but will all be unique in their own way so it'll be neat to see
3245507	3265907	and you know honestly I wish we could see this type of agreement this type of goodwill I would say from more companies that are having little tiffs with each other I would rather them consider their whole the whole reason they have money in their pockets is because of these communities because of the gamers and
3266347	3271170	and they try to, you know, delay things and screw each other over.
3271271	3277535	In the end, they're screwing us over too and back to screwing themselves because they're not getting their money as soon as they would probably like it.
3277855	3281017	WhatUpG in the chatroom says, Can Valve now get to making Half-Life 3?
3281538	3281958	I agree.
3282458	3283899	I definitely agree with that notion.
3284199	3286941	I would like to see them back to making Half-Life 3 at this point.
3288923	3289923	More Half-Life.
3289943	3290864	Alright, moving on.
3291980	3298764	So there's some other rumors or reports, I guess, regarding some stuff that maybe Microsoft's going to be showing off at E3.
3299264	3303987	And this involves ConnectPlayFit and a device called Juul.
3305308	3314994	Basically, what Juul is supposed to be is some sort of device that's going to include a heart rate monitor and other wireless monitoring stuff.
3315074	3318256	Like, for example, I would imagine a pedometer or something like that.
3318596	3323860	And what it's going to do is track your, I guess, exercise across all different Kinect games.
3324761	3338533	And so almost like I would say like those, oh, I don't know what you call them, but the Nike things that they have for like the iPhone or, you know, whatever, where you can jog and they'll, you know, keep track of how far you've jogged.
3338573	3339574	You mean a pedometer?
3339594	3339674	Yeah.
3340214	3343097	Well, no, I understand it's a pedometer, but it's a little bit more than that.
3343197	3347441	It's like a heart rate monitor and stuff, and it actually hooks up to these different software devices.
3348902	3350584	So that's what they're going to be talking about.
3350624	3359953	And I think that's kind of a neat idea because then that way you're not limited to, oh, I have to play a fitness game in order to track how many calories I'm burning or something like that.
3360393	3372718	Almost reminds me a little bit of what they did with the Wii Fit Plus stuff where you can show your progress across a bunch of different things and you have your own dedicated channel for that.
3373618	3380101	I can see them doing something similar, maybe built into the dashboard where you buy this device, maybe comes with an exercise program or something like that.
3380941	3391625	and you wear it for these different Kinect games like Dance Central or something like that and not only are you having fun but you're tracking weight loss and that kind of stuff.
3394066	3394546	Hooray!
3394666	3398067	More weight loss and exercise games for the Kinect.
3398327	3399007	Honestly, you know what?
3399027	3399588	Just what they needed.
3399708	3405470	I think they need more of is not only the weight loss stuff but they need dieting stuff as well.
3405530	3407750	Like, what should you eat?
3407971	3408231	You know?
3409551	3412232	Like a full program, not just, yeah.
3412392	3417195	Not just because, you know, weight loss stuff is a good idea, but if you're only doing that, you're not going to lose anything.
3417235	3422057	So you need like, you know, they need to also say, okay, here's what you should eat too.
3422117	3423858	And hey, recipes, recipes are nice.
3424658	3426799	Tied in with like a Windows phone thing or something.
3426819	3427079	I don't know.
3428649	3430109	Maybe a tie-in with Fidocracy?
3431330	3431890	Sure, why not?
3433110	3433410	Who knows?
3433470	3434210	Anything's possible.
3434930	3438131	Anything is possible, including an internet browser, finally on the 360.
3438931	3439971	What, about six years late?
3440972	3442692	At this point, it's almost not even worth it.
3442952	3447253	How long has the Wii and the PlayStation 3 had a browser?
3447653	3452814	Well, sounds like the Xbox 360 could be getting one of their own, if rumors are to be believed.
3453274	3457655	Internet Explorer 9, which is weird, because I thought they were up to like 10, but whatever...
3458556	3464743	Internet Explorer 9 having Kinect functionality is rumored to be coming to the Xbox in a future update.
3465083	3477458	You'll be able to search with voice input, just like the Bing search bar and all that stuff, and you can browse the web using Kinect-based controls, which I have no idea how that would be practical or whatever, except maybe like...
3478479	3479760	I wanna go back a page.
3480120	3480520	Whoosh!
3482281	3483461	I wanna go back to home.
3484121	3484542	Whoosh!
3485702	3488043	Probably just scrolling through pages because you don't have a mouse.
3488643	3492865	Well, you could use a controller for that, but why would we make things make sense?
3492885	3494426	Why do that when you can go whoosh?
3496306	3497247	The whoosh should be required.
3497307	3498347	I don't want to whoosh.
3498407	3499328	I do that in private.
3502737	3504678	So, a big meh to that.
3506058	3506518	Whatever.
3507338	3509599	I'll download it and try it once and go, huh.
3510600	3518062	I am saying, though, let me be first to... I'm sure I'm not the first, but I'm going to be the first on this show to venture into that area.
3521343	3525824	I can see that there's going to be some dirty uses for the Kinect-enabled browsing.
3526104	3528045	Obviously, since it's hands-free, you know.
3528825	3529606	Find porn!
3530346	3530586	Go!
3532435	3532815	Woosh!
3533516	3533896	Woosh!
3536458	3536838	Enhance.
3537458	3537839	Enhance.
3538359	3538739	Enhance.
3539059	3539400	Woosh!
3541141	3542061	Next video!
3542582	3545403	Suddenly the Kinect starts scrolling up and down very rapidly.
3545483	3547325	Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.
3549786	3551507	We have detected masturbation.
3555390	3562317	We are charting your calorie loss as part of the... We heard you just say connect video chat.
3562537	3564359	DarkSakura, now calling.
3567222	3569084	That would only work if I had a camera.
3570125	3570946	Do you have a connect?
3571826	3572988	Then you have a camera.
3573048	3575310	My connect, Rob, is still in its box.
3575630	3576972	Here's a question for everybody.
3577172	3578173	I want honest answers.
3580287	3586071	Who likes to put a game box or something in front of their Kinect just in case they're spying on you?
3586651	3590393	Because sometimes I like to play Mass Effect 3 with no pants on.
3590473	3590854	You know what?
3590874	3591394	It's my house.
3591434	3592134	I'll do what I want.
3592595	3594416	And I'll sit in that chair with no pants on.
3594436	3602181	I totally do that with my Kinect that's wrapped around, that's not attached to anything that's collecting dust because that's how often I use the Kinect.
3602221	3609205	But I'm afraid one of these days it'll be like, start party with friends and all of a sudden it's like, you started Video Kinect.
3609225	3609265	Ah!
3612864	3614385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3630106	3641654	Or what if there's like an awkward moment where you're throwing a party actually in your house and you do not have enough cups to go around and you have a couple girls that are looking for a drink cup and you're like, there's two girls and I only have one cup.
3642715	3643996	Oh, embarrassing.
3645837	3646998	That's embarrassing.
3648059	3648499	Damn it.
3650000	3651301	Did not want to see that.
3652282	3652902	Who wants dip?
3653823	3654163	Tyler.
3656525	3658445	or what if you have a new pet?
3658525	3660306	Did anyone bring lemons to the party?
3660926	3661586	Ah, shit!
3662326	3665347	Or what if you just got a new pet and you say, look, I have a new goat, see?
3667707	3679090	You know, that's actually funny enough that you should say that actually is a legitimate concern for my sister whose goats are actually having babies so she would have something you want to see my new goat, see?
3679870	3680430	New goat, see?
3682717	3685538	Which I still do want a pet goat to eat the grass in my backyard.
3685619	3688220	TigerClaw on our chat says, Sky, what about the Kinect microphone?
3688260	3689761	That thing would be on and they would hear you.
3689781	3690641	You got to turn that off.
3690981	3691421	You know what?
3691902	3693943	I actually did turn that off in the dashboard.
3693983	3708510	I'm always afraid it's going to like pop back on or something because, you know, like sometimes I'm playing Strangers on Mass Effect 3 and I don't want like, you know, Alan to walk in the room and be all like, honey, the kitty just barfed or something like that.
3708530	3711131	And then everybody hears it on the video game.
3711618	3716281	Well, we used to have Shermie shit in the hall while we recorded the show, so it's not a big thing.
3720583	3722504	And just to let everyone know, Shermie is fine.
3722564	3723505	She's old and smelly.
3724265	3725626	Alright, let's move on, please.
3725726	3726287	Another story.
3728488	3729348	I got texted.
3730789	3732130	You're supposed to be doing a show, young lady.
3732510	3732830	So?
3733411	3734011	Was it my turn?
3734031	3734491	Oh, I'm sorry.
3734812	3735712	Yes, yes, it's your turn.
3735832	3736913	And then release date's coming up.
3737381	3737982	and DarkSakura
3767711	3769112	This was before Kickstarters.
3769632	3772853	This was like my first AX in 1998 or something.
3773613	3776114	But they're doing it in Japan.
3776254	3779355	They're building a 12-foot tall pilotable mecha.
3780275	3784337	And they're using Kinect for running it.
3787138	3791739	Basically, it's as far as the... They actually have a weapon, Rob.
3792060	3792720	It's a water gun.
3792880	3793060	Hmm.
3794548	3797009	Not a big sniper rifle or chain gun.
3797089	3797950	It's a water gun.
3800071	3801712	And they're calling it Vaudeville.
3802052	3804233	If I shoot that water gun right in your eye, it might hurt.
3805794	3806014	Yeah.
3806634	3807675	They're calling it Vaudeville.
3808395	3810316	And it looks like it's four-legged.
3810996	3813898	And there's some shots of it in production.
3813918	3816759	I mean, it looks really freaking not like a Gundam.
3816899	3818000	Can my cat drive it?
3821636	3822457	Kitty Mech.
3822837	3824198	Meow, meow, meow.
3824278	3825219	Did you ever play Battletech?
3826019	3826159	No.
3826660	3827961	Well, it looks like old Battletech stuff.
3827981	3828241	All right.
3828821	3837588	But it's neat, but, you know, I want a mecha so that I can use it to go to work.
3839950	3841751	It brings up that age-old question.
3842091	3842492	Why?
3842512	3842572	Why?
3843886	3845368	And the age-old response, Rob.
3846089	3846610	Why not?
3846650	3847170	Why not?
3847851	3848412	Because.
3849693	3850134	Reasons.
3850274	3850835	I'm bored.
3850955	3851816	Because of reasons.
3853018	3861168	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things coming to a gaming store near you in your country, which may or may not include gaming mechs.
3862595	3868280	Battleship, the newest game from Activision that will be a blockbuster smash I'm sure
3883153	3884435	The source material is excellent.
3884975	3890662	That's coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and Nintendo DS.
3891843	3896708	Also this week, Akai Katana on Xbox 360 if you're a fan of cave shooters.

3931164	3932405	I really want that purple 3DS, actually.
3932425	3939651	In case you're interested, apparently next week is when GameStop's going to start selling the Avenger controller.
3940972	3943434	You know, if you want to throw money out the window, by the way.
3943454	3944555	What's the Avenger controller?

3977999	3978500	You got it.
3978540	3979661	That's exactly what it is.
3979681	3980002	Sweet.
3980302	3982706	And it's on the 3DS, so you know what that means.
3983647	3984589	3D boobs!
3984869	3985450	Woohoo!
3986591	3989192	That's because that's the game we've all really wanted on the 3DS.
3989212	3990533	They've already had one of those.
3990553	3991653	They're going to make another one, too.
3991693	3992654	This one was a sequel.
3993154	3994014	Oh, well, there you go.

4101498	4104760	On the 16th is Ratchet & Clank HD Collection for PS3.
4105681	4107662	And on the 18th, a few things.
4107702	4115368	We have Dragon's Lair for the Xbox 360, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City for PC, and Bruce Willis the game.
4115468	4116489	I'm sorry, Max Payne 3.
4118150	4119331	I don't think the man looks good.
4119952	4121333	He looks like a different character.
4121453	4121773	Bald.
4121953	4122294	Sorry.
4123274	4125216	He looks like he's trying to do that Bruce Willis thing.
4126177	4126717	I'm done.
4128098	4130499	Alright, just a few more stories before the classic game of the week.
4130559	4131280	But first, Loki?
4131800	4134922	So, Assassin's Creed is being sued by a novelist.
4135602	4146648	John Besswanger is suing them because he says that Assassin's Creed stole themes and other things from his book, Link.
4147388	4171416	apparently they stole the themes of assassination and spiritual and biblical tones and also the battle between good and evil that sounds awfully generic if you ask me he's seeking five and a quarter million dollars in damages and basically saying that it could delay the release of Assassin's Creed 3 and of course you know
4174655	4190080	We understand that many gamers are upset by the litigation and the potential for a delay in the release of the next Assassin's Creed video game and as a result of that anger that has been posted posting negative comments on Amazon and other forums about our client and his novel Link.
4190481	4201585	However, copyright laws exist to protect the authors and creators and for people to exploit them from others who copy or create works that are under the law substantially similar
4203106	4206027	I'm sorry, I just, I'm not buying.
4206848	4214332	I think there was also, there was something that was very similar to the Animus that was in Assassin's Creed.
4214352	4219555	I think that's mainly the main tie in there, but it's kind of stretching if you ask me.
4221724	4223705	I'm sure if you went- There's a lot of books that are pretty similar.
4223725	4225907	I know, so see, I'm sure there's a lot of books in the world.
4225947	4227328	There's a lot of books in the world.
4227368	4231711	I'm sure if you go back even further, you might be able to find traces of it somewhere else, right?
4232412	4232652	Yeah.
4232672	4233032	Surely?
4234593	4234913	I don't know.
4235174	4236374	All right, moving on.
4236855	4237855	Let's talk about Zynga.
4238276	4241398	But no, no, no, this is a story that might make you lull a little bit here.
4241918	4244420	Zynga apparently has also filed their own lawsuit.
4244460	4246502	It's against French publisher Kojobo.
4247202	4248424	which sounds very French to me.
4249166	4251831	They have a game on Facebook called Pyramidville.
4252632	4256239	Zynga ain't having that because what's wrong with the name Pyramidville?
4256840	4259646	Oh, Zynga owns Ville apparently.
4260339	4260979	Except they don't.
4261099	4262060	They just think they do.
4262400	4270264	Zynga says that Facebook users are likely to believe erroneously that Pyramidville is a member of Zynga's ville family of games.
4270304	4271465	That's according to the complaint.
4272225	4279869	Given Kajobo's refusal to change their game name, legal action was necessary to defend our famous marks and prevent player confusion.
4281671	4305929	I am kind of confused that they have a game that's called Dream Tower or something like that and it looks very similar to Apparently they own Ville but the same logic will not apply to Nimblebit who owns Tiny Tower although I think their game is called Dream Heights to be fair Oh, my mistake They're going to copyright Heights now
4306192	4306512	PYRAMIDVILLE
4329032	4330174	And you know what?
4330214	4332316	Mental note, guys, for the new VOG site.
4332376	4334919	Bobby, if you're listening, we need to cancel VOGville.
4335199	4335760	It can't happen.
4335800	4336420	No VOGville.
4336641	4337061	Sorry about that.
4337602	4338823	We'll just have to scratch that out.
4339303	4339644	It's gone.
4342172	4349194	Frisbee in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com asks, so does that mean Zynga owns the song Margaritaville?
4349914	4351734	That's a good question.
4352314	4354915	They do have a Facebook game that is Margaritaville as well.
4354975	4358196	Fifth Dream said they wanted to make a Smallville game and Zynga sued.
4360796	4363457	One Night Stand said I play Potville on Facebook.
4363497	4364197	Do they own that?
4365799	4377423	You know, I honestly, I hope that they lose because it's just like Monster, remember Monster Cables or Monster, I don't know which one it was, Monster Cables and Monster Energy, they both kind of sucked, but they sue everybody that uses the name Monster.
4378083	4379843	And so, oh, people are going to get confused.
4380343	4386185	Facebook Games, I'm going to be the generic guy here and say, you know, they all kind of look alike anyways.
4386565	4394068	I understand that maybe this company may or may not have named their, you know, Pyramidville or whatever to get people confused to play their game.
4394828	4394948	Um,
4397119	4397459	I don't know.
4397820	4404667	From what I hear, though, they're suing them for more than they actually made on that game, like three times as much as they made on that game.
4405948	4408952	And all they're doing is they're just, you know, positioning themselves.
4409012	4409993	It was Monster Cable, by the way.
4410393	4412455	Yeah, well, Monster Energy does it, too.
4412736	4414477	Like, they sued Monster Mini Golf.
4415298	4417100	It's like, okay, whatever.
4419477	4419817	I don't know.
4419837	4421498	I just think it's stupid to do that.
4421558	4423279	And fuck, it's karma, bitch.
4425040	4428241	You rip all these other people off and now you're getting yourselves ripped off.
4428842	4429242	Too bad.
4431384	4436648	Alright, let's go to a time when there was no Ville Games and nobody owned that name.
4437429	4439290	It was a simpler time for video games.
4440551	4446555	DarkSakura's gonna open up the gaming vault and find a video game she deems worthy of being the classic game of the week.
4446655	4447276	Yeah, yeah.
4447476	4449197	DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?
4449458	4450799	Streets of Rage.
4451679	4454240	I can't believe this was never the classic game of the week before.
4454260	4456061	I'm always amazed at what you pull up.
4456661	4458402	I'm like, no, she had to have done this.
4458422	4458942	She had to.
4459002	4459142	Nope.
4459622	4460543	Wiki says it's not true.
4460663	4463324	Another suggestion from my lovely husband.
4463424	4464284	That's a good suggestion.
4464364	4466325	Here's a little bit of the music from Streets of Rage.
4466665	4469806	The Japanese name is Bare Knuckle Ikari no Tekken.
4470307	4473668	So two other games have based their names off of this.
4474208	4475529	But I fucking love this music.
4482552	4482932	Right now?
4483253	4485033	No.
4485134	4491957	Which I actually have a Genesis cartridge of Bare Knuckle, but when you play it on the American Nomad, it comes through Streets of Rage.
4492378	4492898	Did you know that?
4493658	4494119	That's weird.
4494319	4496460	It must read the region on the device or something.
4496520	4496880	It must.
4498081	4502123	At any rate, this was the first game, of course, in the Streets of Rage series.
4502203	4503744	There were two and three after that.
4504464	4506266	It's had multiple versions.
4506286	4508889	We've had Game Gear, Mega CD, Master System.
4510350	4513093	It came out for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe.
4513673	4515014	And there's an iOS version.
4515495	4523142	There's a comic strip series that appeared in Sonic the Comic that were based off of Streets of Rage 2.
4524243	4527846	And another thing about this game is that you know who did the soundtrack, Rob?
4528888	4530071	Yuzo Koshiro, Squeak!
4530191	4530812	Yeah!
4531433	4532496	That's why it's fucking good.
4532516	4536244	By the way, if you were listening to last week's show, you know it's a big inspiration for MegaRam as well.
4536584	4537045	Indeed.
4539055	4544116	So basically, it is a side-scroll and beat-em-up, punch-em-in-the-face.
4545117	4550058	It came out around the same time as Double Dragon and Final Fight, but it was its own thing.
4550898	4561861	And you have one special attack per life per level, and your power-ups are shaped like police cars, and you cannot use your special attack in level 8 at all.
4563262	4576293	it doesn't mean any of the enemies only in the Japanese version of a manual do the enemies have names because apparently they care more than we do you can also play
4578214	4582156	One player or two player co-op and you have multiple endings.
4583036	4592000	Of course your enemy is Mr. X. So you can actually end the game as a bad guy if you play in two player mode.
4592960	4599303	So the way that it works is that you get the good ending just for finishing the game.
4600183	4602604	The bad ending, like I said, is only in two-player mode.
4603064	4607405	The boss will ask you to join him, and one says yes, and the other says no.
4608165	4613166	And so the player who said yes must prove their loyalty by killing the other player.
4613626	4620867	And if the yes player wins, and then turns down the boss's offer, then he has to fight the boss alone.
4622028	4628989	And if he succeeds on the bad ending, he will be sitting in the boss's chair that says, you became the boss, you are great.
4631454	4635725	I need a caption of me in a chair that says that You became the boss, you are great
4636829	4641771	and then the character laughs and the word bad end appears.
4642531	4651295	If both of them say yes, the boss will test the player's loyalty by sending them back to an earlier stage and then they have to replay the game from that level.
4652535	4655457	So it had a little bit of interactivity to it.
4656517	4663920	So the characters in the game is Adam Hunter, who is an ex-cop and accomplished boxer.
4664440	4665721	He's slower but tougher.
4667509	4673851	and then Axel, who is an ex-cop and skilled martial artist.
4674631	4685175	And he's the middle one, who is basically all around middle speed, middle other attributes, but he has a weak jumping ability.
4685895	4689217	And then there's Blaze Fielding, an ex-cop and judo expert.
4690437	4693158	A little weaker, but she is more agile and can jump the highest.
4693678	4706777	and her kicks have the longest range she has throws and body slams she's always who I use by the way you have the backup enforcer who is not a playable character but he only comes out during a special attack he's the one good cop
4709060	4716002	So as far as different versions, there was 8-bit versions for the Sega Game Gear and the Master System.
4717122	4721363	The Game Gear version was crap for the record, and it didn't have Adam in it.
4721803	4726944	The Master System version was not actually a port from the Game Gear.
4727084	4728545	It was pretty decent.
4729425	4733726	It has a boss on round 6 that is not in any other version and has no two-player support.
4734706	4738868	The Sega actually brought it out in the arcade for the Mega Touch and Mega Play arcade boards.
4739909	4747833	And in the Mega Tech version, you play for time, not for credits.
4748453	4750074	There's different collections that came out.
4750174	4756177	There's Mega Games 2 that had Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi that came with the Mega Drive.
4757138	4760900	And again, that was the name in Japan and Japan.
4762023	4765226	and the voice effects in the game were redone.
4765306	4771192	Then there was a Sega Genesis 6 pack that had Streets of Rage on it, Hedgehog Columns, Ravenous Shinobi, Golden Axe and Super Hang-On.
4786307	4794013	and the Mega Six that had Streets of Rage, World Cup Italia 90, Columns, Super Monaco, GP, Revenge of Shinobu, and Sonic the Hedgehog.
4794113	4797656	There was a version of the Sega Gems Collection for the GameCube and PS2.
4799818	4805222	They actually took it out of the North American version so that they wouldn't give it a T rating.
4806083	4807304	You can get it on GameChat, by the way.
4808284	4815373	And then, um, they're all in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 on the Wii Virtual Console.
4815713	4822300	And, um, there was the Streets of Rage, um, by Blaze Europe that was, um, handheld.
4823222	4824643	And this iOS version.
4825724	4827827	Now, this is the thing that, um...
4829348	4831129	All three of the games combined.
4831149	4837151	Just in, I guess, continuous levels, but, I mean, of course they were asked to take it down, so it was stopped, but hey, we've got, clearly there are still fans of the series.
4854472	4879555	and you can get the soundtracks which of course we said was done by Yuzo Kishiro and the second one and the third one had work done on it by Multihiro Kalashima so there you go Bare Knuckle Ikari no Tekken your classic game of the week Bare Knuckle or as many of you know it Streets of Rage the first one yes
4879955	4887220	available on the Genesis or Mega Drive and tons and tons of systems after that in various revivals.
4887620	4887940	Indeed.
4888360	4890302	All right, we're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere, guys.
4890322	4894344	We've got more of Orange Lounge Radio coming up in a little bit, including the Fugle Question of the Week.
4894664	4896325	And guess what we're bringing back tonight?
4896345	4897446	We haven't played this in a little while.
4898007	4899588	Listless tonight.
4899628	4900188	Woo-hoo!
4900248	4902469	And I'll tell you guys the topic in just a little while.
4902509	4906392	So stay tuned for Part B and more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4912546	4921192	Welcome back, everybody, to the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday, May the 13th of 2012, Mother's Day.
4921372	4934762	Once again, to those of you that joined us a little late live tonight, a happy Mother's Day to all the gaming mommies who are listening, or the geeky mommies, or mother figures in people's lives, or pets' lives, and everybody that somebody or something could call a mother.
4934922	4936904	Happy day to all of you out there.
4938645	4943488	We are, of course, live as we are every Sunday night on VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.
4943588	4948211	Still kind of a skeleton site there, but lots of exciting stuff to come in the next couple weeks.
4948772	4953835	We've been starting to see some behind-the-scenes things of what's being planned, and it's going to be a good time.
4953975	4957838	So looking forward to Phase 2, which will be around the beginning of June.
4958089	4959070	I'm giving you a hard time
4985746	4990050	If you want to recommend a show for the network, get in touch with me.
4991671	4997416	You can find me idling throughout the week in the VOG chat room or rob at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to email me at.
4997476	5000738	I will have my VOG network address set up soon, but that's a good place.
5001279	5002360	Again, geeky shows.
5002400	5007664	We're actually not really looking for a lot of more gamer shows because we have a few now.
5008184	5012249	Can we set up a VOG Network email account that doesn't get as much spam as we do now?
5012329	5013090	Actually, yes.
5013530	5014291	Oh, thank God!
5014331	5016133	I have to talk to you offline about how that's going to work.
5016153	5017274	But yes, yes you can.
5018655	5023841	So yeah, if you have a show that's of good audio quality, it's very important.
5025282	5027605	I especially am looking for live shows.
5027665	5029447	It's a huge, huge draw.
5031328	5032409	It can be anything about geek.
5032709	5033329	Anything geek.
5033829	5034549	Music geek.
5034890	5035630	Comic geek.
5035930	5036690	TV geek.
5036790	5037491	Movie geek.
5038771	5039411	Book geek.
5039851	5041692	Oh my god, a book club show would be awesome.
5042152	5045994	Anything that you think qualifies as geek, get in touch with me.
5046894	5052476	I'm looking for, most of all, audio quality and consistency is hugely important too.
5052496	5054057	If you can't be bothered to do the show...
5054777	5057558	You know, regularly, then, you know, we can't make it work.
5057638	5059919	But if you're willing to commit, we'll help.
5060199	5061960	We'll do what we can to help you grow an audience.
5062440	5062900	So there you go.
5062960	5064021	Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
5065241	5065522	All right.
5067162	5069103	Anyhow, let's move on.
5069423	5070484	Get into some gaming news.
5070504	5071924	We need a board game podcast.
5072664	5077927	A board, especially, oh my God, there's some like crazy board games out there with like 11 billion pieces.
5077967	5083069	And I know people that I get invited to these board game parties that some friends of mine have.
5083729	5102601	probably about every other month or so and I didn't get to go to the last one because I had a conflict but I went to the first one that I was invited to a couple weeks or a couple months ago and I had a blast and they have like shelves and shelves in their house just full of board games and played some new stuff I would never heard of in my life yeah a board game podcast would rock so I do second Bobby no bronies or wrestling
5106104	5107585	I don't know if Rasslin's geeky.
5107665	5110428	Bronies, let's hear your ideas.
5111289	5114072	I wouldn't necessarily say no to that, but it's got to be real good.
5114552	5115273	Real good.
5116835	5120178	Alright, let's move on and cover some video game news.
5120258	5121720	Loki, rapid fire news.
5122060	5123961	So Bioshock Infinite's been delayed to 2013.
5124341	5132943	They basically made the excuse that it's to put some more polish on the game and apparently that they're working on multiplayer.
5133844	5135424	Because you know every game needs multiplayer.
5137145	5142006	It will not be coming out in October as originally planned.
5142386	5143947	It is now scheduled for February 26, 2013.
5144027	5146248	So that's when you can look forward to that and
5150929	5154974	Certain analysts would let you think that Grand Theft Auto will be coming out that day.
5156015	5157397	Or in October instead.
5157597	5160200	Which, don't get me wrong, I would love that.
5160580	5162422	I would love that, love that, love that.
5162642	5163844	I'd also love it if it comes out in 2013.
5163884	5164044	But yes...
5167868	5168448	Sooner the better.
5169449	5169949	That's my theory.
5171651	5177374	I'm just saying, though, Bioshock, the delay sucks, but at the same time, if they need the time to make the game better, then take it.
5178415	5184759	We have to remember, as much as this news might disappoint, don't rush a game that needs to be good like this.
5185460	5187061	Bioshock Infinite needs to be good.
5187801	5188642	So take your time.
5190703	5194986	Modern Warfare 3 is getting some new content.
5195286	5198028	They're getting a brand new mode, which is called Face Off.
5198048	5205553	It's meant for one-on-one or two-versus-two kind of deathmatch, team deathmatch type stuff.
5205833	5208915	They're actually putting out four maps, two of which are going to be free.
5210076	5211757	Those new maps are Ground and Erosion.
5211897	5218882	Ground is a map with a underground ship, and Erosion, I don't remember the hell that one was, but it looked cool.
5219342	5240665	so that's going to be coming out also of course two more maps that you can buy which will be also part of the content collection so if you happen to be a paid subscriber of Call of Duty Elite you'll be getting those for free and well you're paid for with your subscription but no additional cost I guess
5241386	5270399	and those will be coming out on May 15th for Elite subscribers and I guess everybody else on Xbox on May 21st and then Content Collection 2 is also going to include new multiplayer maps Sanctuary, Foundation, and Oasis and two new spec op missions including Ironclad and Killswitch Ironclad being one where you get to drive a tank and Killswitch is a sniper and infiltration mission
5271921	5272522	So yeah.
5274605	5276646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5305156	5307819	So look for that sometime this summer.
5308820	5311423	And that's kind of neat, I guess.
5312164	5316109	I don't know how that would play, but I know it's going to be popular, especially with a new movie coming out.
5316570	5319471	Well, yeah, and those LEGO games are kind of always big sleeper hits.
5319571	5322012	Like, they might not seem huge to the... They do really well.
5322072	5330014	But yeah, to the core gamer, they don't seem like such a big deal, but they're hugely family-friendly games, and lots of the family owners get those games.
5330194	5332075	So those LEGO games are always a pretty big deal.
5332675	5333596	Except for Rock Band.
5334036	5336497	Maybe didn't do as well, but even that one... It was a neat idea.
5336557	5340618	You know, to be honest, it was a neat idea, and it was a game that I...
5341939	5345300	DJ Morpheus Watch out for Lego Twilight
5365262	5366463	Yeah, I was going to say, here's the problem.
5366503	5368884	There's no content to base a game around.
5369284	5371605	I mean, unless ripping off your shirt.
5371965	5376047	Honestly, what would be funny for Twilight or something like that is like a micro game thing.
5376087	5377347	You know, like WarioWare.
5377707	5378728	Rip off shirt.
5379568	5379988	Brute.
5380708	5382149	Stare at the wall for months.
5382269	5385350	You know, you're like spinning the clock to make the time go faster.
5385430	5385951	Sparkle.
5386531	5387171	Sparkle.
5387211	5389492	You know, that would be pretty funny.
5390533	5391093	I could see that.
5391153	5391453	Do-do.
5393601	5400607	Block Bella from getting eaten by vampires because she poked herself with a knife and is now spewing blood.
5400787	5402949	Alright, you're getting a little tooth carried away there.
5403409	5407753	My wife is starting to read Fifty Shades of Grey and she says it's the worst thing ever.
5408753	5409434	The worst thing.
5409801	5411341	Alright, moving on.
5412582	5414082	Wolfenstein 3D.
5414202	5415102	Remember that game?
5415382	5415803	Hell yeah.
5415943	5417663	Well, if you do remember that game, congrats.
5417683	5422864	You're old because Wolfenstein 3D celebrated its 20th anniversary this week.
5422964	5423865	It's only been 20 years.
5424145	5428286	Yeah, I remember downloading that demo from a local BBS.
5430480	5432601	I remember buying that shareware demo.
5432741	5434242	Well, it wasn't a demo.
5434262	5437304	It was the full first campaign, so it was pretty awesome.
5437545	5438265	Yeah.
5438625	5441027	On a floppy disk at a flea market.
5441107	5442768	Shareware demos used to be the shit.
5442848	5447191	Yeah, it was all of episode one, and then if you wanted episodes two through six, that's what you bought.
5449336	5450117	It's great.
5451098	5453981	It'd be like getting the full game and then you have to buy the DLC later on.
5454041	5454421	Yeah, yeah.
5454862	5455142	Not bad.
5455242	5455763	It's awesome.
5456123	5459747	So anyhow, Wolfenstein 3D, how do they celebrate their 20th anniversary?
5459827	5464112	Well, Wolfenstein 3D is now playable in web browsers, completely free.
5464572	5469398	Wolfenstein.bethsoft.com because Bethesda has the IP now.
5470259	5483993	you can also pick it up on the iPhone devices for free I believe that was only on the actual anniversary though which was on the 9th I don't think it's free anymore I will say this I picked it up and I played it and you know it
5484562	5491004	It's a 20 year old game, but they up-rezzed some things and they added a map to it, which was pretty cool.
5491424	5494325	They did at least make some tweaks to the iOS version.
5494345	5497566	The only thing is it controls like shit, like all iPhone games do.
5497606	5498426	I mean, what a shock, right?
5498506	5501887	I'm not positive, but that may have been the first game I modded.
5503300	5509446	I remember an old-ass map editor that you could download that you could make your own maps.
5509566	5511508	And you could spell fuck out of the walls.
5511548	5512970	We used to make crazy maps.
5513010	5519456	We used to make gore mods where we would take a shareware paint editor and just add more blood, add more blood, add more blood.
5520136	5520637	That was it.
5520797	5527363	or just have the giant room and put like 50 enemies in the giant... It's all it is, just one giant room.
5528424	5530426	We used to make mazes out of the moving blocks.
5530566	5532347	Like just put a ton of moving blocks everywhere.
5534169	5534770	It was awesome.
5534830	5535110	Nice.
5536505	5537185	Kingdom Hearts.
5537346	5541708	A lot of people are excited about the Kingdom Hearts 3D version or Dream Drop Distance.
5542168	5543169	Get excited about this.
5543289	5548412	There's going to be a demo coming out for the 3DS.
5548432	5551714	That's pretty awesome that Nintendo's embracing those demos a little more.
5552134	5556116	It is going to be the Traverse Town demo that's already out in Japan.
5556457	5558918	It's going to be here in North America as well.
5559118	5562280	No clue when, but hopefully soon.
5563040	5566962	They also announced some AR cards for that as well.
5567042	5567823	That's right, huh?
5568223	5570664	Is that the Nintendo AR cards where you can get the little pictures?
5570684	5572765	Yeah, it's something that ties in with the game.
5572845	5575466	What they haven't announced yet is there's going to be a collector's edition.
5575867	5577287	Is there?
5577347	5578628	What's the collector's edition going to have?
5578648	5580369	I have no fucking clue.
5580409	5582190	Of course there's going to be a collector's edition.
5582210	5582350	Sticker!
5585991	5587412	Stickers or something, I'm sure.
5587792	5589873	No, it's more than stickers.
5589933	5592434	Theater Rhythm got Silas and stickers.
5594474	5596595	So I wasn't too far off base suggesting stickers.
5597575	5598396	Maybe a soundtrack.
5598436	5599256	I bet a soundtrack.
5600096	5600917	It could be, yeah.
5601057	5601617	I don't know.
5603041	5604743	What's the theme song for Dream Drop Distance?
5604763	5605283	I have no clue.
5605563	5605944	I don't know.
5607265	5609987	They've always just been kind of using the same one from like, was it 1?
5611408	5612949	They're kind of like doing the score version of 1.
5613090	5623118	Alright, and moving on into what could soon be the trial of the century with one of gaming's most important people, Beyonce Knowles.
5624859	5628823	After all, she was the spokeswoman for the DS, not the 3DS, but the DS.
5629123	5631365	Remember when her and Carrie Underwood were doing those ultra-cute
5631545	5632545	Hey, girls play games too.
5633386	5634586	Yeah, how'd that work out?
5635566	5639587	Well, the DS sold 11 billion units, so I'd say pretty well.
5640428	5642568	Well, Beyonce told me to buy it, so I have to buy it.
5642588	5643109	That's right.
5643809	5645769	I'm not going to play anything Beyonce's not playing.
5647130	5651191	All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, give me money.
5654053	5658359	Anyhow, Gate 5, you might remember this company, is suing Beyoncé.
5658860	5660002	Why are they suing Beyoncé?
5660042	5668754	Because, remember, Beyoncé was supposed to have, like, there was supposed to be, like, this uber-Beyoncé music game that was going to come out, and Beyoncé said, nope, not gonna work.
5670115	5676319	Gate 5 apparently said to Beyonce, you continue to negotiate right up until the time you pull the plug.
5677019	5682462	And the judge said, that's not going to work with me, according to what Beyonce's lawyer said.
5682942	5685683	So Star Power Beyonce was the game.
5686124	5689345	Its cancellation resulted in the firings of 70 employees.
5690226	5698030	And Gate 5 is suing for $100 million in damages, $6.7 million in investment capital, and $100 million in hypothetical profits.
5698751	5699994	So... Hypothetical.
5700234	5700876	Hypothetical.
5701076	5704826	So they're suggesting that they were going to sell...
5707037	5732946	that's actually not that much that's almost like 200,000 copies I mean that's not too bad essentially what this decision has done is said gate 5 has enough information to proceed to an actual court and it is going to go to court unless of course there's a settlement which usually when things get this far along will inevitably happen and I'm sure all parties are being strongly encouraged to settle but as of right now can you imagine what would have happened to that
5735025	5736666	All right, moving on, DarkSakura.
5747876	5748897	Okay, other stuff.
5749577	5762706	Well, for people who are like me, Hatsune Miku fans, there is a Crystal White Vita coming out that's coming with the Hatsune Miku Limited Edition.
5763246	5769090	It's a Crystal White Vita with an exclusive rear touch design that has Miku on it.
5769751	5775535	And it will be shipped on August 30th with the next Project D.Va game.
5775795	5777256	So that's pretty neat.
5778757	5791356	and then there's new download content for Dance Central that is sorry Dance Central 2 that will be the Spice Girls Spice Up Your Life
5793459	5794240	Fuck yeah!
5795341	5802267	And then Hello Good Morning by Diddy Dirty Money, and Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest, and Florida's Low.
5803068	5803988	Who cares?
5805570	5813056	And then, moving on, Marvel's Avengers Battle for Earth will be on Kinect and Wii U, Ubisoft.
5813937	5818682	So, um, it's, uh, well, interesting.
5818722	5824248	It's actually being done by Ubisoft Quebec, and you use the motion controls to fight off the Skrull.
5825310	5825630	Yay.
5825650	5834740	You know, the whole idea, the whole game idea sounded cool until, you know, they mentioned Kinect, and it's just like, eh, it's not gonna be very good.
5835120	5835520	Hey, Jamie.
5867946	5869286	You know they're going to make you do that too.
5870646	5871206	Exactly.
5874287	5875627	Hey, let's go to Fugle.
5882388	5885349	We combine Facebook and Google Plus and we get Fugle.
5885529	5888510	And that's where we ask you a question every week of our listeners.
5888890	5890110	And we read your answers live on air.
5892853	5897215	Alright, so we're going to get to a story here about this $99 Xbox here shortly.
5897955	5913882	So our question is, how would you feel if the Xbox Next 720 Lube, whatever we're calling it, cost $499, but had a subsidized $299 option for a several year Xbox Gold commitment?
5913902	5917004	This is something we hypothesized last week when the story first got brought up.
5918144	5923229	Assuming the specs are all top of the line, is the subsidized console something you would consider buying?
5923309	5924270	Why or why not?
5925150	5936520	So would you buy a subsidized next-gen console, assuming it's all the top-of-the-line features you want, say they knock $200 off the price for a two- or three-year commitment for Xbox Gold?
5936560	5937081	Would you do it?
5937741	5939823	It would not be that different from what they do for the iPhones, right?
5940484	5941024	No, it would not.
5941845	5942886	No, you would not, you say.
5943650	5945732	No, I said no, it would not, and no, I would not.
5945812	5946492	No, you would not.
5946512	5947033	Why wouldn't you?
5947153	5958941	I wouldn't because I've learned well enough from buying in at launches of all these different consoles and stuff that a lot of launch titles aren't that great, and you're going to deal with all the launch bugs and all that fun stuff.
5959021	5966467	So if I'm interested in buying a console like that, I'm just going to save up the money that's required to buy outright to begin with.
5966807	5967447	Because who knows?
5967607	5978411	If it takes you a long time to save up money, like, say, for example, you know, $499, are you really going to tell me that within two years' time that console isn't going to drop in price?
5978991	5982012	It's going to fucking drop in price, and you're still paying fucking money for it.
5982892	5983213	All right.
5983453	5985473	Well, let's get to some answers from Google+.
5985553	5987474	First, we have AJ on Google+.
5987674	5988594	Says, I wouldn't mind.
5988754	5989555	Sounds like a good deal.
5989975	5993036	It's like buying a cell phone for the discounted price and a two-year agreement.
5993096	5995817	Would you really want to buy an Xbox and not want to use it online?
5997574	6007076	Going to some of the Facebook answers, Tiara W, we love Tiara from Geek Life, geek-life.com says, it would need to be more than just the basic model to make it worth the money.
6007456	6016138	The $99 360 sounded like a good deal, even with the extra $5 a month for the gold subscription, until I heard it was for the 4GB console.
6016458	6021599	I can't even put most of my saved games on that little space, let alone save any games to my hard drive.
6023001	6025264	Very interesting perspective from Doug.
6025324	6027006	Somewhat similar to what you said, a little bit.
6043376	6051238	Well, it's just, you know, if I'm going to be that strapped for cash, which I always find a way to buy those consoles at launch because I get excited about it.
6051638	6055740	But let's just say, you know, I'm strapped for cash and I just can't buy it at launch.
6056860	6059501	I don't think it's going to be that horrible.
6059721	6062702	I mean, I've got a console I'm playing tons of games on.
6062782	6063102	It's just...
6064122	6070107	You know, not even necessarily, I have, I mean, they're not going to repeat themselves with the whole Red Ring of Death thing.
6070428	6072329	I mean, they're not that dumb.
6072429	6074151	And technology's gotten a lot better now.
6074511	6081918	I mean, the chips are on, you know, we've got like 20 nanometer chips now that run way cooler, way more power efficient and stuff like that.
6082398	6085561	So, overheating isn't as big of a problem anymore.
6086221	6090165	And I think that they know that they don't want to do that again because they're just going to lose...
6090405	6095588	All sorts of, you know, trust in their consumers if they fuck it up again.
6096208	6098669	So, I mean, I don't think that's really an issue.
6098729	6103932	But if it's going to be that expensive, though, I just have to see what my options are.
6104212	6113056	And if there's really something at launch that I have to, have to, have to have, which I don't really know if there's going to be anything at launch that I really, really need.
6113976	6115337	I'll just have to wait and see what they have.
6115737	6117958	And also, you know, what it's going to cost.
6118178	6119379	And if it's something that I can wait...
6119759	6122881	I can wait and purchase it later on when it goes on sale.
6124963	6130026	Within a couple years time, you're not going to tell me that you're going to find a used system or something like that.
6130347	6131627	There's ways to get it cheaper.
6131788	6142195	Since you're going to be stuck in a contract for multiple years, why would you do that when there's an opportunity to either save up money or just wait for the drop in price?
6142415	6143877	Alright, well let's check out some different answers.
6143977	6153106	Picaruno in our chatroom says, or not chat, but Facebook says, to be perfectly honest, fuck yes, if you get a lot of use out of Xbox Live, then it's definitely worth taking the discount on the console.
6153466	6154947	You do end up paying less overall.
6155308	6161374	It only works if you get a lot of use out of your console and subscription though, and yeah, the console in question had better be semi-decent too.
6162314	6163776	But you're not saving money, though.
6163816	6167138	You're spending $40 more than you would have paid separately.
6167239	6172543	We're making up a hypothetical situation, so we don't really know, to be honest.
6173924	6177827	DarkCharger replied and said, This is a very sensible answer, by the way.
6178268	6183332	Having the option for a subsidized version doesn't bother me, though I would almost always opt for the one-time fee.
6183732	6189677	The actual value will all depend on the games and features of the unit, along with, hopefully, better reliability on launch.
6191039	6208116	I pretty much agree with that one more answer from Chiggers we'll read here I say it depends on how much the monthly gold subscription is if that amount times however many months the commitment is more than what it would be if I bought the damn thing straight up then I say fuck you if I don't save any money by doing it that way then why bother
6209175	6209555	There you go.
6209615	6211015	If I didn't read your answers, sorry about that.
6211055	6214156	We had a lot of answers, but send those via email if you feel strongly.
6214536	6222738	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com And I mean, the problem is they got to know what the other company is doing because if they come out and say, okay, our system is $499.
6222778	6226439	You can get it for $299 and blah, blah, blah.
6226999	6230300	And Sony's like, well, our system just costs $299, so...
6231983	6239525	I have to admit, going into that question, I kind of assumed I would be in the camp of, yes, I would just go ahead and do it because I'm going to get the system anyway and I have Xbox anyway.
6239885	6248107	But I kind of think Doug's answer was right on the money because, you know, I did rush out and buy an Xbox 360.
6248508	6251488	I was tracking what Best Buy in the area actually had it.
6251928	6254349	I remember when they were so hard to get when they first came out.
6254429	6254689	Oh, yeah.
6254809	6258770	And then I finally was able to get one, but it was the one without the hard drives.
6258790	6260951	I had to buy the hard drives separately and ended up paying like $40 more.
6261331	6263834	more, and then the fucking thing died on me after a week.
6264534	6265075	I was so mad.
6265115	6268298	Mine didn't die after a week, but yeah, I remember doing that.
6269519	6270380	So irritating.
6271481	6272302	Got mine on Craigslist.
6272723	6273103	Yeah.
6274004	6276367	Anyway, let's get back into some more gaming news.
6276787	6279690	Thank you to everybody who answered the Voogle question, whether I read it or not.
6280535	6280835	All right.
6281275	6286516	Well, let's talk a little bit about this $99 Xbox.
6286796	6289337	Of course, it was rumored last week, and it ended up being true.
6290497	6292738	Microsoft stores are offering it for $99.
6293318	6300260	Of course, there's a two-year contract, and you're going to pay $14.99 a month for those two years.
6300280	6307401	So it ends up being about $460, which is roughly $40 more than you would pay separately.
6307841	6309542	But if that's what you want to do, then you could do that.
6310342	6310662	and so on.
6331704	6331984	DarkSakura.com
6348316	6348876	I bet you're right.
6348896	6350917	I bet some of them are out of country.
6351097	6351517	It must be.
6352238	6353258	I just looked that up real quick.
6353878	6356439	I seriously think the closest one to us is in Phoenix.
6356619	6357619	Or maybe there's one in LA.
6357639	6358480	There is one in LA.
6358720	6361641	Yeah, but none in Northern California.
6361801	6362321	Bay Area.
6362701	6363662	Is there really one in the Bay Area?
6363742	6365382	Yeah.
6365982	6368163	Cupertino, I think, has one.
6368203	6368783	How ironic.
6368983	6369584	In their mall.
6371664	6372645	I've been to that mall.
6373405	6375888	Yeah, I think there's one down there, but that's a close one.
6375908	6378090	It was probably about 12 years ago, but I've been to that mall.
6380412	6384717	So, I mean, it could very well happen with the next console.
6384837	6385958	I think that's what they're testing out.
6385978	6387840	They're seeing if there's a good response from this.
6388401	6394687	If that's the case, then they may move forward with GameStop doing something like this or another retailer.
6394707	6395648	Yeah.
6397190	6397490	I don't know.
6414147	6416309	Hell, I mean, I don't know.
6416329	6420231	You could get some sort of partner deal with AT&T or something.
6420691	6421072	Who knows?
6422252	6422593	All right.
6422853	6427556	Well, a lot of stuff going on in the handheld world in regards to price drops.
6427916	6429917	The price of the DS has dropped.
6430077	6431818	Nope, I'm not talking about the 3DS.
6431878	6432699	I'm talking about the DSi.
6433459	6438821	For some weird reason, for the longest time, the DSi and the DSi XL had still retained their own old prices.
6439201	6442322	It cost just as much for a DSi XL as it did for a 3DS.
6442542	6446323	I know because Alan wanted one for his birth, or no, for Christmas, and I bought him one.
6446363	6449144	I was like, you want a DSi XL and not a 3DS?
6450385	6455086	I... But, I mean, the screens on those things really are gorgeous, so I wish they would make a 3DS XL.
6456827	6457688	I shouldn't say that
6473527	6479473	Get it for only $99 when you agree to buy 1,000 Nintendo points a month.
6479513	6485138	DSi is dropping to $100 and the DSi XL is dropping to $130.
6485198	6488341	Those prices are effective May 20th, so I wouldn't go buy one now.
6489062	6491903	But that's not a bad deal for a DSi, $100.
6492803	6494064	They are still pretty good systems.
6494824	6495904	But I don't know.
6495944	6499005	I kind of think if you're going to invest, you might as well kick it up to the 3DS.
6499065	6501606	But maybe you really want something to play your advanced games on.
6502166	6503907	But the DSi XL is still a pretty good deal.
6503967	6505527	That's a $50 price drop, by the way.
6505727	6506048	It was $170.
6506488	6509229	Now it's going to be $140 because it's going to be $129.99, which is basically $130.
6509269	6509309	So...
6513490	6514932	Aquablu 3DS is being discontinued in Japan
6531167	6549687	now don't feel too bad for it because there's already all these other colors in Japan including black and I think there's like another shade of blue available in Japan too like the more like regular blue but it is kind of interesting that they're getting rid of one of the colors completely I guess especially one of the launch colors but yeah hmm interesting
6552403	6553703	Maybe it just wasn't selling very well.
6554804	6558105	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Why did you buy Alan what he wanted?
6558425	6560786	You should have gotten him what he should have wanted.
6562466	6564347	I really should do that next time.
6565247	6568889	Although he was standing with me in the store and I was like, Alright, what do you want for Christmas?
6568949	6569469	Pick something.
6569909	6571129	He's like, I want a DSi XL.
6571209	6571489	Really?
6571549	6572930	You answered incorrectly!
6573350	6573770	Zonk!
6575351	6576311	You chose poorly.
6577271	6578372	You will now disintegrate.
6580434	6582155	Not all the news is about the 3DS though.
6582195	6586037	There's also news about the Vitas in regards to how many they've sold.
6586818	6589800	1.8 million Vitas sold worldwide.
6590060	6591081	That's not bad.
6591101	6591861	That's not bad.
6591941	6599266	It's actually, that's what, 600,000 since late February when they last reported their sales figures, which is 1.2 million.
6600106	6600987	That's not bad.
6602628	6607171	It's not incredible, but it's not like the system's dead.
6607191	6608472	I don't know.
6609938	6629419	so, alright let's go ahead and move on to the mailbag, every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we'll choose some of your emails to read here live on air a few of them I will start at the beginning, we only had three
6630612	6633015	Greetings OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
6633716	6636539	One day and 15 hours left, I've been waiting 10 years for this.
6637100	6640604	I thought about taking a day off to play, but I can't justify the loss of income.
6641405	6642567	Hoping it's a rainy weekend.
6643127	6644449	Diablo and Rain go together.
6644849	6649775	To pass the time until the release, I'm playing Dead Space 2, which I bought on Steam sale about 6 months ago.
6650516	6653177	I play at night with my headphones on and a candle lit.
6653517	6656218	My wife gets a kick out of hearing me yell like a girl.
6656919	6658880	It's probably the scariest game I've ever played.
6659100	6659880	Any of you play it?
6660520	6663882	I'm like Rob with game ADD, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.
6664302	6667963	Plus, I heard that the end of Boss is mind-blowing.
6668383	6669564	See you at the Skeleton King.
6669724	6670404	Serious Turtle.
6670544	6671865	Love the VOG Network, kiddos.
6673142	6676708	I have not played Dead Space 2, but I've heard that it's super scary.
6677831	6680616	Somebody else, Acidic Vampire in the chatroom says, excellent game.
6680856	6682880	So you have one supporter there in the chatroom at least.
6683321	6684824	I will be on board with the Diablo 3 train.
6686311	6687652	I'll be choo-chooing along too.
6687832	6690954	Yeah, it helps when the Warcraft addicts are all getting it for free.
6691254	6691714	I know, right?
6692375	6692935	Next email.
6693535	6694276	Hey, OLR.
6694516	6695056	Hey.
6696337	6700640	Specifically, I should be addressing both Rob and Shane.
6701300	6702781	What's up with your taste in men?
6702841	6704342	Kaiden is not that fabulous.
6704702	6705763	Get off my show.
6706423	6710286	I ended up taking Ashley on to Mass Effect 2 instead of Kaiden.
6710846	6711507	I've yet to play 3.
6712587	6714849	I just feel like there are much better fish in the galaxy.
6715749	6717372	Also, Shay needs to call in more.
6718073	6724563	Hearing him always makes me giggle and he's always got something interesting to say even if it's just to call in and say hello with no particular topic in mind.
6725404	6727908	A show without a call from him just isn't complete for me.
6727968	6728529	Hard, hard, hard.
6728894	6730095	Shane has a stalker fan.
6731356	6733257	Don't inflate his ego, for God's sake.
6733718	6735299	And you're especially not going to score points.
6735319	6736260	Can I finish reading, Rob?
6736380	6740823	No, you're not going to score points when you're dogging on Kaden.
6741724	6744206	Yes, there's all kinds of homo all up in this email.
6744246	6744686	Deal with it.
6744906	6745947	I love you all, Osfer.
6746828	6748129	I love Dark Tetsuya.
6748509	6749390	Gay hate mail.
6749510	6751151	Is this a first on OLR?
6751952	6753893	Sadly, no, I don't think it is.
6754614	6757636	This last one is a link, and I'm afraid to follow it.
6759458	6787030	Alright You're here because one of your friends has invited you Page loading, please wait Uh, no Thank you for spamming us, listener Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says Ash does have some great scenes in Mass Effect 3 She gets fucking smashed Doesn't that happen with See, I'll probably take her because I'm going for full-on lesbian Doesn't that She's not a lesbian romance option, sadly Oh, she might be in 3, I don't think she is though That makes my heart hurt
6787651	6790612	Oh, there's plenty of people you can les up with if you want.
6790632	6791292	That's awesome.
6792753	6795814	Aliens and I will say, I will say this.
6795834	6797194	Because that was totally me in Dragon Age 2.
6797635	6810059	There is a, I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say there is a very hot, hot woman, a woman of color in part three that is, she is only a lesbian option.
6810592	6810912	Nice.
6811633	6812714	And there's a shower scene.
6812734	6813594	That's all I'm going to say.
6815135	6815276	Okay.
6815356	6816176	Good times.
6816356	6816697	Okay.
6817157	6817437	Neat.
6819419	6821620	And a sitting vampire confirms she doesn't go lesbian.
6821660	6822061	That's all right.
6822121	6826044	Save yourself for, I guess I can say, save yourself for trainer.
6826844	6827184	It's hot.
6828525	6828826	All right.
6831328	6831808	Moving on.
6832576	6833857	Uh, let's get to the FUs of the week.
6833877	6834758	That was it for emails, huh?
6834778	6835578	You got a spam email?
6836299	6836779	Uh, yeah.
6837179	6837459	Alright.
6837980	6841822	And the good thing I'm on Linux because they don't make viruses for Linux, really.
6842782	6844243	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
6844303	6845424	Every week we get ranty.
6845804	6847465	Um...
6863263	6867487	FU, I have a few actually because I'm tired and sore and bitchy.
6868588	6873853	So FU, as much fun as the Komen walk was, I didn't say that I did that on the show yet, did I?
6874574	6874734	No.
6874874	6888647	I did the Komen walk for breast cancer yesterday and apparently since I've started wearing Vibram five fingers and before I was wearing shape-ups, my stride has changed.
6889247	6892409	I found out that I used to walk on the outsides of my feet.
6892969	6904655	So when I put on my old shape-ups, because my heel pads for my Vibrams wore out, I'm walking, first of all, we had to park our way from the start of the walk.
6904715	6912459	So I walk a mile and a half to the, no, a mile to the start, walk the three and a half miles for the walk, walk another half a mile to get to the convention center.
6912979	6918561	Walking all over the place there and walking back, I have blisters in places on my feet that I've never had blisters before.
6919081	6931266	I have one on the outside of my big toe, and of course I've got the requisite one on my right heel, which is probably another quarter bigger than a half dollar, if anyone remembers what those look like and how big they are.
6932247	6937829	And then I have one on my left foot on the bottom of my next to pinky toe.
6938789	6942476	It's just bizarre, and they're annoying and they hurt.
6945740	6949002	I woke up this morning in so much pain.
6949302	6958826	Because I pretty much walked about eight hours, eight, not eight hours, eight miles continuously over the course of two and a half hours.
6959366	6961747	So, which isn't bad, but, you know.
6962488	6965069	And so, I was just in all kinds of pain.
6965209	6967850	And thankfully, my husband let me sleep in this morning.
6967950	6974113	Dan is, and he woke me up by screaming from the kitchen, Omelette du fromage!
6975752	6976753	So that woke me up.
6976793	6978474	I woke up to Omelette du Fromage.
6979594	6988659	And I've been sore and grumpy all day and I've been sort of snapping at people because I've been too tired to articulate properly exactly what it is that I want to say.
6989520	6996463	The other one goes towards me losing my voice, which is now going on two weeks and all the signage drainage.
6997044	7002727	And then I'm just hoping that all of this crap is cleared up by the time I go to Disneyland because I want to go out and have a good time.
7003607	7011389	So, uh, also, um, FU to, uh, Vibram Speed for being way too expensive for me to get before Disneyland.
7011809	7013269	Marathon FU segment.
7013790	7014210	Loki.
7016290	7019331	Um, I guess FU to my throat being sore.
7020431	7021391	That's really it.
7021471	7022192	It's really annoying.
7022232	7023452	I hate, I hate sore throats.
7023832	7024252	Scratchy.
7024932	7025352	Off drop.
7025432	7026013	Off drop.
7027413	7027853	FU to the fact.
7027873	7028373	I tried honey.
7028493	7030814	That would, that, the sore, it worked for like a minute.
7031014	7031454	No, that's alright.
7031474	7031954	I don't want anything.
7032054	7032995	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7049770	7073118	Friday I went back to work because I had something really important I really wanted to get done and I was feeling a little better but I think because I exerted myself too much I was really sick again yesterday I'm feeling a little better today and I'm hoping by the time I wake up tomorrow I'm all better so I haven't taken my pills and it's time to take my pills and I'm doing alright I'm making it through the show and I'm not as super congested but just go away
7074278	7074899	Be healed!
7075539	7079984	And also F you to the fact that our stream apparently went down about five minutes ago and caused a bunch of people to disconnect.
7080244	7082326	Because that's never good for retaining your listeners.
7082386	7084969	So I hate when the server fucking burps like that.
7085930	7086130	Arrgh!
7087171	7087431	Alright.
7088512	7088813	Anyhow.
7090228	7090548	Of course.
7090568	7091088	Of course.
7116308	7122672	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the latest Kickstarter campaigns because I have a feeling this is not going to go away anytime soon.
7123192	7130537	Kickstarter, the place where you can kickstart any franchise that may or may not need to be kickstarted or you may or may not want kickstarted.
7131077	7132078	Can it kickstart my heart?
7136288	7137089	Battle Chess!
7137909	7142653	They're doing a remake for that, which I was completely unaware of, and I thought that series had died off.
7142913	7144154	Oh no, they want to come back!
7144635	7147197	And they're going to Kickstarter to fund multiplayer.
7148238	7158866	And yeah, they're looking for $100,000 for an online experience that includes skill-based matchmaking, statistics and leaderboards, achievements in in-game chat...
7160787	7163168	and they're $12,000 with 18 days to go.
7163208	7164888	They're probably not going to make it.
7165909	7166849	I like Battle Chess.
7168549	7168909	Too bad.
7169329	7172190	That was the one where the queen would like flat out chop off someone's head, right?
7172210	7173030	Yeah, that was awesome.
7173090	7174651	I might be able to get behind something like this.
7174711	7177431	Two guys from Andromeda, Space Venture.
7177932	7179752	It's the guys that created Space Quest.
7179772	7181072	They're doing a new adventure game.
7181913	7183273	And it looks...
7183573	7186394	Rob Paulson Alan McClain I know her from opera
7211789	7213310	But, uh, she will be in there as well.
7213930	7217031	And, um... You make it sound like you don't know her as GLaDOS.
7219892	7224014	So, uh... Chances of this one succeeding, probably pretty good.
7224054	7226715	You have 30 days left and they're already at a, you know, almost, uh, 115, or, uh, $150,000.
7226775	7226835	So...
7232324	7233465	I'm killing the music.
7233505	7235706	This segment's going on too long.
7261758	7263079	Sorry, I'm trying to be quick.
7263320	7264381	No, that's all right.
7264641	7275631	Another one, Redux, which is a sequel to a game called Dux, which is a 2009 shooter that... Oh, God, I remember that game.
7275651	7276772	It came out in the Dreamcast.
7276932	7277212	Yes.
7277553	7278634	And now they're doing one.
7278954	7282677	They want to do this new game for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Steam.
7283538	7285240	And they need $25,000, which...
7288082	7289944	That's reasonable for a game.
7290705	7291766	They're definitely going to hit it.
7291786	7296030	They're already at almost $24,000 and they've got 25 days to go.
7296890	7299693	There's all sorts of neat rewards for that.
7299713	7304497	If you're a fan of shooters, it might be something to throw your money at, I guess.
7307220	7309282	Last but not least, this one's kind of interesting.
7309902	7313946	Jason Rohrer I hope that's Rohrer
7315127	7318289	He is putting out a game called Diamond Trust of London.
7318770	7320551	It's actually a DS game.
7320751	7322333	It's going to be a retail DS game.
7322413	7323554	He has the game done.
7323834	7326696	He just needs the money now to make the cartridges.
7326736	7338126	Apparently, Nintendo has all these limits or minimums and stuff, and they need $78,000 in order to make... I think it's like... I don't remember how many cartridges they're making.
7338166	7340528	A thousand cartridges, if not more.
7342329	7343409	They're already at $53,000 of the $78,000.
7344410	7349332	They've got 12 days to go.
7349973	7351453	It may not happen.
7352094	7357196	And Diamond Trust of London is kind of like a strategy game where it has to do with diamond trading.
7358177	7361238	It sounded pretty interesting.
7361318	7362819	I actually watched a little video for it.
7363339	7364320	Not my type of game, so...
7364600	7368802	I can't remember what he's worked on, but you would recognize him if you saw him.
7368822	7369083	So that's it.
7369123	7371024	That's for the stuff that's on Kickstarter right now.
7371044	7371844	That's notable, I guess.
7384403	7385664	Sound like Beat Hazard, which was a great game.
7410169	7420180	Uh, FTL, which doesn't look very interesting to me, but okay.
7420240	7421422	I have to go to the next page now.
7422122	7423104	Um...
7424545	7425186	Oh, come on.
7425766	7427488	Because I just thought it was neat because it's kind of related.
7428009	7431573	I mean, because we've poo-pooed on Kickstarters and I honestly still don't like them.
7431633	7432274	I don't trust them.
7432954	7434316	You know, they're... I don't trust them.
7434356	7443366	Well, we talked about there was one dark side of Kickstarter last week where they, you know, the people had stolen the art from DeviantArt or what have you and...
7443860	7445601	There's a few actually.
7445801	7452286	One of the first ones I put money towards, Video Game High School, had their first episode this week.
7452406	7454248	It was actually pretty cool.
7454468	7455088	I'm digging that.
7455248	7464435	It's a neat little web series that they've got going on right now about this high school that basically recruits people that play video games.
7464475	7466717	It's like video games have taken over the world type thing.
7467197	7468258	It's really cool.
7468958	7474422	Okay, so anyways, that guy, he did Passage, which was kind of a browser game that was popular.
7474462	7475643	It was very minimalistic.
7476004	7477625	Between was another one that he did.
7477725	7482448	Sleep is Death, Inside a Star-Filled Sky, and then he has this new one.
7483869	7487232	But a lot of stuff that's been covered in gaming blogs and stuff like that.
7488121	7490343	Tadashi Sugiyama, Mario Kart, Pilotwings, F-Zero
7506275	7511580	is apparently working on a Wii U game which is supposed to be revealed at E3 next month.
7511820	7515843	And apparently it's one that has not been spoiled in this whole early list or whatever that leaked.
7516184	7518266	That was all speculated titles.
7518466	7519967	None of those were actually official.
7520147	7520467	I see.
7520568	7528174	So we'll add this to the list of speculation now because apparently he is working on a game that's going to be revealed at E3 next month.
7528314	7529635	No hints on what it is.
7530416	7542859	But if you consider that he has worked in the past on Mario Kart, which has been on the 3DS, Pilotwings, which has been on the 3DS, and F-Zero, one of those looks really likely.
7543639	7548460	It could be a new IP, granted, or, you know, maybe he's been put on one of the other Nintendo IPs.
7549320	7555122	But that fanboy in me is still a little excited at the possibilities, right?
7555202	7555562	Am I right?
7555822	7556182	Am I right?
7557423	7558463	That would be awesome.
7558503	7559264	It would be awesome.
7559904	7562645	I mean, the last F-Zero game was pretty awesome.
7562825	7563245	Yes.
7563605	7564786	It was just a long time ago.
7564846	7567446	It's just that the arcade version was surprisingly weak.
7567466	7567987	Here's the thing.
7568187	7568727	Here's the thing.
7568807	7574829	Nintendo, sometimes they have really brilliant things that come out, and sometimes they have really...
7576613	7578896	Thanks for watching!
7597615	7614962	and then they just rehash Animal Crossing again you know it's just like I don't know and sometimes I just wonder but I think that all comes down to it's different development teams some people have it some people don't some people just you know do what they can to get on by
7617782	7618022	DarkSakura,
7650728	7651428	Thanks for watching!
7669332	7673273	We're going to come up with a topic, and the topic for tonight I'll reveal in just a minute.
7673593	7680475	And then what you do on this topic is, oh, I'm sorry, you guys here in studio, and we'll have a surprise fourth guest on the phone here in a minute.
7680835	7688377	What we're going to do on the phone and in studio is come up with our top three answers for this topic.
7688997	7690037	That's going to leave us a list of 12.
7690197	7696319	We will then all go around the room and eliminate one from the list, leaving us a list of eight.
7697426	7701470	And then we will put it to a vote in our chat room for their number one and number two answers.
7701870	7703953	And after that, definitive process is done.
7704013	7704373	That's it.
7704453	7706155	This is the list.
7706595	7707616	It's a done deal.
7707736	7708777	There's no arguing.
7708938	7711080	This is what the gamers demand.
7711680	7714823	Highly scientific, tested and true over the past ten years.
7715924	7716305	Am I right?
7716325	7716986	Yeah.
7717706	7718246	Yeah, you're right.
7719327	7719787	Here it is.
7720967	7722428	Tonight's listless topic.
7723008	7724649	Oh, actually, let me get our fourth person on the phone.
7725589	7729410	Sorry, the whole disconnection of the stream kind of screwed me up here.
7729470	7730691	It's Comcast.
7731491	7731991	Apparently.
7732071	7733152	Yeah, because we were having an issue.
7733192	7735192	Wanda's having an issue loading a page.
7735513	7736213	Stupids.
7738697	7740618	All right, let's try to get our person on the line here.
7741778	7742539	Hey, is this Shane?
7743519	7744800	Yeah, holy crap, you're loud.
7744860	7745680	I need to fix this.
7745740	7746380	Boo, surprise.
7746660	7753443	Hey, it's Shane joining us from Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, which can be heard not on the VOG Network yet, but soon.
7754083	7757505	www.hordehouse.com All about the World of Warcraft.
7757805	7758285	Right, Shane?
7758826	7760267	That's actually what I'm playing right now.
7760327	7767872	I'm playing the Pandaria beta because male pandas got new hairstyles, so clearly I have to take it out for a test drive.
7768132	7771654	Wait a minute, you're not playing Mass Effect for a change?
7772595	7776237	Um, I don't always play Mass Effect, just most of the time.
7776277	7776717	Yes, you do.
7776817	7782801	Why is it that on the Warcraft show, you're always playing Mass Effect, and now on the general gaming show, you're always playing Warcraft?
7782921	7783862	I don't understand.
7784062	7785603	Oh my god, Shane, you're a meme.
7785623	7786363	I don't know.
7787484	7792748	I don't always play Mass Effect, but when I do, it's with Kaiden.
7792888	7793669	Yeah, what?
7794249	7797912	Oh my gosh, that letter didn't frame my ego.
7797972	7799734	How could you bash Kaiden?
7800534	7804417	I have to say, we planned this long before we read that email.
7804437	7805778	I had no idea that email was in there.
7805799	7806899	That was a late arriving email.
7807220	7814505	We already knew Shane was going to be our fourth person tonight for Listless, and then that email comes in, and here you are on the show five minutes later.
7814806	7816307	What do you want to say to that emailer?
7817692	7844225	um thank you for inflating my ego but you're wrong about Caden so it's like I don't know I just I can't talk to you all right you ready to play listless with us tonight Shane as long as it doesn't get in the way of playing World of Warcraft yes we'll do our best all right so here's the topic for tonight because everybody's dying to know the topic for tonight E3 Wii U announcement
7846329	7849595	that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7851775	7855838	The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7856238	7861382	Now, chatters, if you want to give us your suggestions, you can start typing those in our chatroom at vognetwork.com.
7861822	7870048	Can't guarantee we're going to use your answers, but if one of us ends up having an answer stolen by another host or something, we tend to look to chatroom for a little bit of help.
7870128	7870749	So what do you think?
7870789	7875312	The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
7875832	7877633	Let's start with Shane.
7877693	7879235	What is your number three answer?
7880015	7884997	Okay, I'm going to have to try to explain this because my writing it out, I didn't do a very good job.
7885477	7901602	So, my number three would be Nintendo announcing a new F-Zero game utilizing the tablet controller as some sort of future racing control dash thing where you'd press the buttons on the screen to go and brake and stuff.
7901662	7908325	And then it would have a stand that you could tilt the controller with for tilt controls.
7909125	7910226	I thought it was neat.
7923576	7937788	Like now you put the tablet on and you could, because it would be awkward to have the acceleration and brake on the touchscreen while you're trying to like use the crappy controller with the analog nub stick or whatever.
7937868	7939589	So it'd be tilt controlled.
7939629	7941851	So it'd be like you're standing on like a console.
7942391	7943993	I see it on Power Rangers all the time.
7944053	7945074	That's where I got the idea.
7945094	7945134	So...
7946975	7948816	If it's good enough for Power Rangers, it's good enough for Shane.
7949076	7949616	All right, too bad.
7949656	7951417	I shortened the answer to New F-Zero Game.
7951517	7951777	All right.
7951877	7952678	Fine, whatever.
7952758	7954638	All right, Loki, what's your number three pick?
7955539	7957840	All these are going to be kind of similar, except for the last one.
7958340	7962542	So the first one is going to be a Mario Kart game with track editor.
7962562	7965183	So it's like Mod Nation Racers with Mario Kart.
7966103	7967584	Really what everyone wants anyways.
7968735	7970456	DarkSakura, your number three answer.
7993698	7994659	and Mario Paint.
7995380	7996641	A new Mario Paint?
7996981	7997241	Yes.
7997502	7999103	Oh, that'd be awesome.
7999483	8000384	Can I change my answer?
8000564	8002766	Only if it has the music mode in it.
8004708	8006510	With the cat meow and the dog barks.
8007030	8011114	It has to have the Undo Doggy too, so if you make a mistake you can click on his face.
8011374	8013156	Yes, alright, as long as Undo Doggy's there.
8013196	8014437	I can actually see that.
8014517	8017840	I mean, if they don't make a Mario Paint game, I mean, come on.
8018340	8021482	I agree, they're kind of dumb if they don't make a Mario Party.
8022563	8025365	I said Mario Party, but they'll probably make one of those too.
8025865	8027206	Alright, my number three answer.
8029768	8033111	E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
8034091	8036813	My virtual console games still work on it.
8036933	8037594	OMG.
8038274	8039575	Because that won't happen.
8039795	8040436	We all know.
8046018	8056301	But it would be nice that all that money I invested on the Wii could somehow carry over into the Wii U and I could take that little tablet into my bedroom and play before I go to bed.
8056381	8057202	Wouldn't that be nice?
8057922	8059082	Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?
8062623	8064044	Shane, your number two answer.
8065384	8070246	Nintendo announcing multiple colors of the system for launch, especially a blue color.
8073480	8076881	I will take either a Midnight Blue, a Cobalt Blue, or a Metallic Blue, but not Aqua Blue.
8077181	8077601	I support Cobalt.
8103089	8104571	Loki, your number two answer.
8105772	8110097	My number two answer... I just had something different, too.
8113481	8119108	Oh, my number two answer would be that that tablet controller could actually be used as a tablet.
8120666	8122087	DarkSakura, your number two answer Pokemon Snap Wii U
8146192	8149215	How would the tablet work in Pokemon Snap Wii U?
8149455	8151697	I would want an augmented reality version.
8151797	8153338	Is that where you pick your balls?
8154579	8155080	They could do that.
8155100	8156441	I think it has a camera on that tablet.
8157122	8163347	Jamie, you know that there's a 3DS application coming out for Black and White 2 that is Pokemon Snap augmented reality.
8163707	8165389	Well, I don't have a 3DS.
8165809	8166870	You need one for it.
8166950	8168071	It's Pokemon Snap.
8168091	8169192	Well, send me one, please.
8171954	8172875	I'm going to Disneyland.
8172895	8173635	That's more important.
8175396	8175736	All right.
8175836	8176976	My number two answer.
8178097	8180758	I bet I'm stealing DarkSakura's number one answer right here, but I don't even care.
8180778	8181278	I don't think you are.
8181518	8182038	I don't even care.
8182078	8182278	All right.
8182298	8182838	My answer.
8183859	8187360	The Guardian Legend Wii U. You're not stealing my number one answer.
8191178	8192758	But I'm sorry, it's a damn good answer.
8193759	8199340	If they say, bam, Guardian Legends coming back, I'll be like, pre-ordered, done, sold.
8200160	8200780	Just give me two.
8201961	8217745	Alright, so far we have new F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, multiple colors, especially blue, tablet controller is actually a tablet, Pokemon Snap Wii U, and the Guardian Legend Wii U. Let's get to the number one answers.
8218305	8218625	Shane.
8219580	8222505	Okay, okay, this is gonna be a complete surprise to everybody.
8222766	8223447	Are you ready for it?
8223467	8224068	Mass Effect.
8225010	8225230	What?
8226408	8253414	a new Mass Effect game and the tablet would have straps so you could strap it to your arm like an Omnitool and then it would have a control scheme similar to Metroid Prime so you'd have awesome you know Omnitool stuff and you would have a really good control scheme and I don't care if it's 4 or whatever I just would love that you just need Mass Effect in your life somehow being brought to the Wii U always fair enough fair enough
8254094	8255916	What a shocking answer from Shane.
8256898	8258880	All right, Loki, your number one answer.
8259160	8260982	Try not to be shocked, but Excite Truck 2.
8265446	8266307	I would buy that system.
8266327	8267528	What a shocking answer.
8268048	8275072	But if there's one fucking minigame in that goddamn racing game, I will fucking burn that console to the ground.
8276493	8277434	Is this an official bet?
8277474	8279095	You will buy a Wii U and set it on fire?
8280056	8281757	No, I will not waste my money.
8282957	8285739	But in my mind, that console deserves to burn.
8285859	8288421	You would imagine really hard and hope you were pyrokinetic.
8288681	8291724	Alright, DarkSakura, your number one answer.
8291924	8295006	All of my answers have been like legit and not smart-assy.
8295627	8297148	So I said DJ Max Technica.
8297929	8299290	That was going to be my number two.
8299310	8302012	Because, yeah.
8302573	8303454	Wouldn't that be fun?
8303674	8304574	Yeah, I could see that.
8304614	8305535	And totally doable.
8305615	8306356	And totally doable.
8306676	8307017	Okay.
8307497	8311580	Or at least, at least, a game that's very similar to Elite Beat Agents.
8311600	8312781	Like an Elite Beat Agents.
8312861	8313102	Yeah.
8313362	8316925	Well, actually, yeah, I would say an Elite Beat Agents Technica style.
8317267	8318768	Do they have multi-touch on that thing?
8318868	8321870	Because I think it's supposed to be just like the DS screen.
8321970	8323171	I think it's just like a DS screen.
8323211	8324852	It's not like an iPhone or anything like that.
8325193	8330356	Well, then, so if I could make mine, um, uh, Oshita Takai Oendan.
8330396	8332318	You want to change it from Technica to EBA?
8332398	8334099	Well, you know, that type of game.
8334199	8335940	How about Technica or EBA?
8336220	8336561	Okay.
8337541	8342305	Well, just honestly, I liked Oendan better than EBA because I thought the cheerleaders were funny.
8342935	8345278	All right, well, look at all these serious answers here.
8345378	8346879	My answer is very serious.
8347360	8352585	My number one answer is very serious, and it is a very practical use of the Wii U technology.
8352886	8359233	You can have one thing on the television, and you can have one thing on the tablet that sits on your pants.
8359593	8362616	So my number one answer for my number one game I won...
8364378	8365459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8388135	8396526	anything you're into is available through the various DLC human centiporn if that's what you're into, fine midget porn, go for it
8397403	8400224	Do you know that old person porn is very popular in Japan now?
8421289	8422470	of the game that we play here.
8422750	8426891	By the way, let me read some of the answers from chat, because there were some great answers from chat here.
8427251	8448699	TigerClawed, Nyan Cat the game, Actdeft, Mass Effect, Wiiology, Actdeft said Steam integration on the Wii U, Actdeft, President Cat Wii U, Black Wolf Mother Wii U, Ragenator, a limited edition ABBA and Rocky Horror themed console, SSJ100MAT, Goat Say Me for Wii U, and
8450988	8459811	SSJ100, Matt, Ultracade, Wii U, Ragenator, Sky, Barbie, Barbie, Barbie Horse Adventures, Wii U Edition is the pack-in game.
8459871	8461852	World of Warcraft, Wii U, this is Actdeft.
8463033	8464793	Frisbee says Dreamcast 2.
8465433	8468875	Going back to an old list list, but unfortunately none of those answers made the list tonight.
8469435	8470755	One of my other considerations, Rob.
8470896	8471096	What?
8471196	8471956	What is a boob game?
8473623	8487778	Bobby also says automatically allocates 1 million sales of Eye of Judgment I'm afraid that that will never happen Yeah, actually the bet was officially closed a couple years ago too It's just, they're not making it anymore Very sad Alright, so here we go Here we go
8488479	8494023	Now's the time where we're going to go around and eliminate one answer from the list, and the list as it stands right now.
8494463	8516097	New F-Zero game, Mario Kart Wii with track editor, or excuse me, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, multiple colors, especially blue, tablet controller is actually a tablet, Pokemon Snap Wii U, the Guardian Legend Wii U, a new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool, Excite Truck 2, DJ Max Technica or EBA, and porn on my pants.
8517157	8520039	Shane, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8520499	8525202	Because I don't think Nintendo would get it right, Porn on My Pants.
8526063	8528865	I knew you would erase that, you ass.
8528885	8533007	Nintendo doesn't know how to make anything mature, ever.
8533668	8541072	So, would you want something so terrible as to taint the name Porn on My Pants?
8542413	8543814	It could be their breakthrough hit.
8543834	8546176	laughter
8547698	8549560	I just don't have faith, I'm sorry.
8549660	8552422	It is stricken from the list, and I'm mad at you forever.
8552662	8555505	Alright, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8555885	8560729	Pokemon Snap Wii U, because it's something that they could really just include into a new Pokemon game.
8561049	8563111	Which they're doing, apparently.
8563691	8566614	Alright, it is stricken from the list, unfortunately, for DarkSakura.
8566634	8568095	But DarkSakura, here's your chance for revenge.
8568155	8569496	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8569818	8571239	I'm above revenge, Rob.
8571279	8572059	What are you talking about?
8572119	8572599	Excite Truck 2?
8574781	8578242	Because I didn't give a shit about Excite Truck 1 and that's not enough to make me buy one.
8578282	8579443	That's because you never played it.
8579923	8580603	I played it.
8580763	8581844	I didn't care for it.
8582644	8583085	All right.
8583105	8583465	Let's see.
8583485	8585846	Then to be fair, I need to get rid of one of Shane's answers here.
8586706	8589128	Oh, I'm getting rid of multiple colors, especially blue.
8589588	8591089	Oh, come on.
8592829	8595031	Because I actually like the rest of the answers.
8595851	8597992	And I'm sorry, we need a purple answer.
8598757	8603460	You know I might get the purple one for my birthday because I can't tell the difference between the color.
8603961	8605782	So I'll trade in my aqua blue one for that one.
8606122	8606883	It's going to be awesome.
8607343	8607823	All right.
8607924	8611726	So we have narrowed down the list for your voting pleasure.
8612066	8614248	Here's a recap, and you guys can place your votes.
8614628	8618211	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room at vognetwork.com.
8618251	8621593	Type slash MSG space S-K-I-E.
8621653	8622334	My name's Sky.
8622894	8623474	and your vote.
8623514	8625776	Your number one and your number two answers.
8626176	8627756	Here is the list that you can pick from.
8628057	8643164	New F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, tablet controller is actually a tablet, the Guardian Legend Wii U, a new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool and DJ Max Technica or EBA.
8643244	8643784	There it is.
8644345	8644805	We will...
8645265	8648126	Tally up your votes and have those real soon.
8648266	8649966	A little later on when we start taking calls.
8650487	8651027	So that's it.
8651127	8654568	Shane, anything else you want to talk to us about or say before we let you go?
8655648	8656068	I don't know.
8656148	8656948	Probably not.
8657909	8659549	Alright, well then I guess have fun with pandas.
8660369	8660669	I will.
8660969	8661370	Goodbye.
8661390	8662050	Alright, bye.
8663210	8666451	Well that should make Shane's one fan very happy that he was there on the show.
8668011	8669052	Playing listless with us.
8670748	8675311	BlackWolf is accusing us, by the way, of not enough lols tonight in the match game segment.
8675351	8676171	Not enough lols.
8676311	8677772	We did not bring the lols tonight.
8678392	8679093	Sorry to hear that.
8679333	8680314	Well, you know what?
8680414	8681874	We can't be funny all the time.
8682895	8687218	I spend a lot of my funny... But Loki's funny looking all the time, so... That's true.
8688318	8689460	DarkSakura, I think we're on right now.
8704477	8706958	Well, it's just a big pile of shit.
8708438	8719822	The court in Holland has ordered that a particular Pirate Bay supporter stop publicizing a workaround for the ban that was there.
8721022	8722623	It's called the Dutch Pirate Party.
8723203	8726324	They've been publicizing ways to circumvent the ban on Pirate Bay.
8727124	8738231	and, as reported by the BBC, the judge also said that it ceased offering a proxy service so that Dutch Pirate Bay users could access the torrents without having to link the site.
8738691	8749238	I mean, not really surprising, you know, they'd try to stop it, but it's more and more people finding a way, but honestly people could find a way around it on their own if they were creative.
8750799	8761008	and also the group's UK branch is actually offering more of a proxy for the countrywide ISP block.
8762814	8764676	So, that's it.
8766017	8772422	The party's campaign officer actually said that they received 2 million hits in over 24 hours.
8773543	8780829	And, of course, the legal campaign in the UK is being spearheaded by the British Phonographic Institute.
8783451	8784512	That's old school there.
8785312	8785432	Europe.
8785472	8786193	Phonographic.
8787434	8788215	Phonograph.
8788235	8788315	Yeah.
8792162	8815797	and then here's something really funny so people that play Battlefield 3 are having issues finding servers to actually play their game on you know how you pay those online passes and then you can't connect to a game fan-fucking-tastic and so what's ending up happening is apparently you remember that they announced that you can rent servers from EA and
8816457	8817078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8837175	8837976	They went with Prophet.
8838236	8841898	So, apparently, that's an issue.
8842279	8854126	And they're saying that, of course, they're going to have... They reserve a percentage of the servers for players who prefer to connect through DICE-hosted servers.
8855047	8855227	And...
8857208	8882570	but you know they won't say what percent of that and they're also saying that you know a lot of the servers appear you know unavailable in fact some people are having trouble connecting to a server so long that it's taking them like an hour to connect to a game without having to you know try to connect to one of these private servers which you may or may not get kicked from because you know it's a private server it kind of sucks money first
8883314	8884394	I know, that's kind of weird.
8884494	8890657	It's kind of like, sorry, you can't come here because we already rented it out for so-and-so's birthday party.
8891237	8899840	For that guy who runs MegaUpload.com or whatever his name is, rented everything for his private parole party.
8900305	8908487	Well, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, they're saying that basically people are looking for just, you know, to play the regular game types without any sort of custom stuff.
8909167	8912368	And, you know, one guy is saying, I really got kicked from a DICE server.
8912788	8918070	And it says, you know, but once the rented servers bit took off, I got kicked quite a bit.
8918590	8925672	And it's damn near impossible to find an official server and that many of the rent servers features are games with server requirements.
8926072	8929433	I don't want to play Team Deathmatch to 500 kills or Conquest to 700 tickets.
8931593	8934814	So they're basically saying no, they're not shutting down servers.
8935354	8947036	But if dice managed servers appear offline, it's because they've been rented and customized by players.
8948056	8951457	Custom servers have always been extremely popular with Battlefield PC players.
8951817	8955098	With Battlefield 3, we introduced a custom server program to console gamers.
8955158	8957158	Response has been overwhelmingly positive.
8957950	8960435	Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.
8960876	8967209	But just remember that when you're paying for your online pass for your used game that you're not going to necessarily get online.
8969734	8987383	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and you might have played Kid Icarus Uprising at this point on the 3DS, and if you haven't, you really should, because it's a good game, except for the whole, your hand will cramp in 20 different ways.
8988804	8989244	However...
8990345	8991226	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9007715	9011737	Masahiro Sakurai, who of course is the brains behind it, said, quote, Yikes.
9031998	9060721	at least they tried to make it so they'd have a ton of replayability on it but I mean I'm sure they're busy with you know Smash Brothers exactly exactly so sadly that will not be coming out anytime soon hey we are going to open up the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio the phones are open so go ahead and give us a call if you want and let us know your thoughts on tonight's news or anything else that you wanted to share we'll get to twitter topics in a minute but first I was going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories so I can tally up these last few uh
9061121	9088950	listless votes that came in this is kind of funny apparently they have a pre-order bonus for The Amazing Spider-Man coming out in June where you can play as Stan Lee like actually as Stan Lee in the Spider-Man game and of course he has you know some of the powers that Spider-Man has and he is searching or he's hunting down I guess script pages from his next movie or something
9090146	9092408	And he has witty banter.
9093269	9094650	Let's go to the phones and take a call.
9094710	9095611	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9095631	9095971	Who's this?
9096532	9097733	It's the one and only Ranma.
9097833	9098394	Of course it is.
9098434	9099074	How you doing, Ranma?
9099975	9100636	I'm pretty good.
9100736	9101617	Alive, but okay.
9102477	9103698	Should you not be alive?
9103798	9110785	Did you have a weekend filled with devious things that could have got you killed?
9111566	9114248	Yes, it's called Staffia Convention where I tweaked my knee.
9115829	9116170	Touche.
9116874	9117175	Yes.
9118017	9124130	Or as I was saying at the end of the rave last night, I was raving like nobody else's business until I took a glow stick to the knee.
9125874	9127477	When will that meme die?
9129901	9130982	Don't, don't, don't, don't
9149913	9151035	Alan's been the one playing it
9166893	9168254	So, just saying.
9168675	9169295	I ain't the widow.
9169495	9170757	Or, I mean, he ain't the widow.
9171577	9172538	He should sympathize.
9173840	9174981	I just want to play the main quest.
9175001	9175902	I don't want to do all the science stuff.
9175962	9179945	For the record, I do want to say that I found one good surviving remnant of that meme.
9180186	9181167	What?
9181287	9183909	I used to think Hawkeye was useless, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
9185110	9186131	That one was good.
9186372	9188534	So, Ranma, what did you really call to talk to us about tonight?
9189141	9191742	I want to talk about this Xbox 360 deal.
9191802	9200266	It's just something I was thinking about that doesn't kind of make sense, but it kind of does, when you're trying to compare it in a way of a subsidized cell phone.
9201946	9211590	Now, if you pay $200 for your smartphone, and you have to pay the bill every month, and if you happen to terminate the contract, you have to pay this fee.
9212210	9213291	Now, let's say...
9214366	9216088	You don't pay that bill for that month.
9216688	9217389	They'll let you slide.
9218030	9219611	Second month, not so much.
9220072	9222855	They cut the phone off, and the phone is rendered useless.
9223395	9228580	Now, with Microsoft, you pay $99, and you pay $15 a month.
9229221	9232404	Now, let's say you don't pay the bill for the first month.
9232464	9233165	They let it slide.
9233625	9235167	And you don't pay the bill for the second month.
9235427	9236148	What's going to happen?
9236368	9236969	You fight with 360.
9237009	9237049	We...
9238971	9242879	You already know that your live account is canceled, but what else is going to happen?
9242899	9246065	You're going to get a little pop-up to say that you can't play your console unless you pay the bill?
9247463	9247743	Maybe.
9248104	9252927	I mean, maybe the technology is not there yet, but it's something that they could implement for the next round of consoles.
9253448	9259552	I believe there is some type of $299 fee that you have to pay.
9260193	9269240	You have to pay some type of big fee for the early cancellation, which basically amounts to the rest of the cost of the console on its own, plus the Kinect.
9270361	9276546	And they would automatically charge it against whatever credit card they have on file for you, or send your ass to collections, for all I know.
9277267	9285760	Well, yeah, that I do see happening, but I'm just going to be amused at where people are going to start complaining where they forgot to pay the bill.
9285920	9290187	You get this pop-up with a 360, you cannot play it constantly unless the bill isn't paid.
9290227	9291930	Please call this number, you know.
9292267	9299493	Well, think about what this is somewhat modeled after, one could argue, and that is the Blizzard Blood Pack that came out at the end of last year.
9299973	9304657	If I were to suddenly stop paying my World of Warcraft bill, they would shut off my Diablo 3.
9304697	9306018	They can do that.
9306338	9307019	You just shut it off.
9308020	9321651	Yeah, I can see Microsoft doing where they do this, and you activate your account, like a special extra software gets loaded onto your console where they actually monitor where if you don't pay the bill, that happens.
9322677	9328739	That sounds like one of those low credit cars where it won't start if you haven't paid the bill.
9332901	9338363	It's scary, but the next round of consoles could have that technology if they decide to go with this.
9338683	9340344	Of course, that's a big if, but we'll see.
9341465	9345606	And somewhere in the corporate offices of Rent-A-Center, they're going, why didn't we think of this?
9346086	9347147	Why didn't we think of this?
9347547	9347907	That's all right.
9347947	9352129	Rent-A-Center still gets to do the televisions and all the stuff that you have to play the video games on.
9353784	9354906	I had one of those.
9354926	9355807	Did I tell you that?
9357188	9357488	No.
9357929	9358690	You feel like sharing?
9359130	9359491	Sure.
9359711	9364736	I wish I still had it, but as a birthday gift when I was 12, me and my great-grandma went to a rental center.
9365257	9369642	She bought me a 20-inch TV with a built-in Nintendo from Sharp Electronics.
9370323	9372825	I didn't realize they ever made TVs with built-in Nintendos.
9373466	9373827	Yep.
9374087	9374387	Huh.
9374708	9374948	Okay.
9376165	9386787	and I had it for years but back in, I believe, 05 I had to sit it out on the side because the tube went and I had paid to get it fixed like twice and it kept going out.
9387947	9388288	Wow.
9392308	9392648	Alright.
9393109	9395569	Are you talking about the C1 NES TV?
9397369	9397810	What was that?
9398270	9399230	The C1 NES TV.
9400416	9401157	I believe so, yeah.
9401197	9405600	And I think in Japan, Sharp actually had a Super Nintendo, Super Famicom version of that as well.
9406240	9406961	There was one.
9407241	9410303	Actdeft in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says Kmart had them.
9410343	9410683	You know what?
9410723	9411964	Kmart probably still has them.
9412164	9413025	If you want to go check it out.
9413085	9418568	If they did, I will buy one right now because the only place I saw them at the time was Renicenter and where I lived, there was no Kmart.
9420870	9423492	I keep forgetting those places like Renicenter exist.
9424056	9425657	Any other last minute stories to cover?
9447879	9451064	You know Sharp made another thing called the Twin Famicom?
9452586	9462662	It came out in 1986, only released in Japan, and it's the combination of the Famicom and the disk system in one piece of hardware.
9463405	9468787	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you need to get a hold of us that way.
9469607	9470207	Anything else, Loki?
9470247	9472328	Are we done with last-minute stories?
9472348	9478910	There's a bonus 25 minutes of Cave Johnson in the DLC for Portal 2.
9479930	9481550	Good lord, monologues or what?
9481810	9482491	Yeah, pretty much.
9482591	9486092	It's all stuff that they recorded, especially for that.
9486132	9487232	It's brand new stuff.
9487839	9488159	Oh, wow.
9488279	9490261	You can listen to it on YouTube.
9490401	9491962	That's pretty cool that they got him back in to do that.
9492523	9492663	Yep.
9493623	9496385	All right, going to a few tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
9497606	9504451	Eric RPG on Twitter sent us a tweet with a link from this game from the I Want to Be the Guy dev.
9504952	9505772	Oh, I'd heard about this.
9505812	9507714	This is like the Castlevania-esque game, isn't it?
9507774	9511376	I'm looking at the link right now that he sent us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
9512117	9513358	And I want to say I heard about this.
9515771	9517594	I just found a Twin Famicom on eBay for $57.
9517655	9519718	Send us to a link on... Oh, there it is, right here.
9524071	9524891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9549404	9549865	Hey Hey Who's this?
9577352	9577892	What makes you say that?
9577912	9580593	Well, because of the recent article that was published where
9607441	9612162	The notable figures such as THQ, Nintendo, even Sega are not even present this year.
9612942	9624845	So it's kind of like a scare piece in the sense that the lack of these developers are actually going to be a much more lackluster E3 this year.
9625225	9626805	That's what they're predicting.
9626905	9635127	Do you think a lot of developers are starting to realize that, and publishers really, in this age of the internet and everything, maybe they don't need E3 anymore?
9637685	9645528	I mean, I guess I probably beat this subject before, but mobile might be eating at some of these companies, like Nintendo in particular.
9646589	9651571	Well, and Facebook games... Zynga's showing for the first time this year.
9653552	9654032	What was that?
9654312	9656073	Zynga's showing for the first time this year.
9657413	9661575	But, I mean, most of their games are going to... I mean, they're going to... Yeah, you're right.
9661595	9663736	They're going to be all browser-based, but...
9664850	9672075	I guess it goes beyond what we typically expect from the developers and the folks that make console games.
9672655	9677138	I guess it's kind of like branching out from the old guard.
9678479	9680921	It's an evolutionary shift in gaming.
9681742	9686445	I don't think consoles will ever die out because there will always be a market for those AAA titles.
9686965	9692389	However, you're going to see another emerging in the form of casual through either mobile or browser-based.
9693544	9701664	So this is where, you're right, Zynga and any other small and mobile publisher can make inroads, you know, due to the fact that these...
9702677	9706839	These big, heavy hitter developers are no longer showing up this year.
9706999	9707559	Or sitting out E3.
9733268	9742514	Exactly, and in the next, I think I remember mentioning this before, but in a couple of years, the next two to three years, it might actually have like parity.
9743055	9758105	I mean, you're going to get to the point where they're going to converge, where both your Vitas and your 3DSs are going to converge against whatever Apple's offering, whatever is being offered, whatever high-end Android phone will still be out there.
9758957	9763499	and whatever other platform, you know, tells the law.
9763619	9780587	You know, if you're a parent out there looking to get a portable game console for your kid to, like, shut him up on long car rides or whatever, you gotta admit, you put a Vita next to an iTouch, which is just the iPhone without the phone, and they're about the same price, and yet the games on one are 99 cents.
9783143	9783443	Right.
9784003	9795767	And even then, it's like, you know, when you throw in the iPad in there, you let your kid use, you know, your iPad, that pretty much, like, you know, keeps them distracted at that point.
9796088	9799289	Ah, but Shadow Next Gen, hold on, Shadow Next Gen in our chat room has a good point.
9799429	9804451	iOS games will never be as good as core games as long as they rely on those virtual controls.
9804831	9811173	Now, an 11-year-old probably doesn't care, but true for the college gamer and even high school gamer and so forth, they're going to care a little more.
9811193	9811333	Right.
9812897	9829361	They are, that is true, but, you know, and the way I see it is this, in the next few years, physical buttons may not be, you know, may not be as prevalent in a new platform, as long as they get the tactile feel down to it.
9829421	9832802	I know it's going to be a growing thing, but think about it.
9833582	9841644	I mean, the next evolution besides hardware will have to be some sort of virtual control, something that isn't there, but you touch it and it does something.
9842563	9843724	but it's a lot better.
9843744	9849787	It's either on parity with the hardware button or has more of a natural feeling.
9850608	9856631	Zaku, before we let you go, what do you think will be the biggest shocker out of E3 this year?
9857992	9861114	Well, I mean, Wii U is definitely not in the cards.
9861534	9868398	I'm thinking whatever Microsoft has up their sleeve and yeah, not even Sony.
9868618	9870659	I don't even think because as I said, it's
9871246	9876429	There isn't a lot of buzz going around of what actually might steal a show at E3.
9877010	9877350	Who knows?
9877410	9880532	It could be some other browser-based developer.
9880552	9886336	It could be a mobile developer creating something for multiple platforms that will create a hit.
9886356	9892600	Like Rovio, for example, they're trying to branch out beyond Angry Birds, create a new franchise.
9893220	9897963	So that might be something as an example, but
9898522	9900744	I think Microsoft might have something up their sleeve.
9901144	9906348	I wouldn't put it past me that they're actually going to reveal the success of the 360 or at least hint to it.
9907168	9907488	We'll see.
9907528	9909130	That's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but we'll see.
9909230	9910230	All right, Zach, I'm going to let you go.
9910410	9911051	Take care, buddy, okay?
9912026	9912647	All right, have a good one.
9928547	9929127	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9957069	9981299	the bigger locations will still carry PSP games as well as the website GameStop.com so chances are if the GameStop near you is small and doesn't have a lot of shelf space they were probably one of the 25% that got rid of them alright doesn't look like our phone line is lighting up and it's getting to be about 9 o'clock here on the west coast so I'm going to go ahead and close that up and we need to get to listless results you guys ready for listless results because it's very interesting tonight let's do it let's get to them
9983823	9984323	New F-Zero Game
10014060	10016601	and New Mario Paint.
10017461	10017981	There you go.
10018001	10026002	Those are the number three things you most want to see on the new Wii U that will make you go pre-order it that day.
10026042	10027643	A new F-Zero game and a new Mario Paint.
10028143	10030083	Here is the number one answer.
10030123	10032423	We had two answers tie for number one.
10033824	10036664	The tablet controller is actually a tablet.
10037724	10038825	Good luck with that, you guys.
10039425	10039605	I know.
10039645	10040345	It's not going to ever happen.
10041955	10047497	And lastly, Mario Kart with Track Editor is number one.
10047517	10048497	Double win for moi.
10048537	10050558	Look at that, a double win for Loki.
10050598	10052519	Has that ever happened in the history of List?
10052599	10052979	I don't know.
10053919	10054619	So there it is.
10054780	10057260	Number one tied, Mario Kart with Track Editor.
10057660	10059201	Tablet Controller is actually a tablet.
