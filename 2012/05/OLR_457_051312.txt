Sky, and Loki.
Tonight, May 13th, 2012, the biggest software companies give financial updates, the price drops on older DS models, and could internet browsing finally be coming to the Xbox?
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live with episode number 457 of our show for this May the 13th of 2012.
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host.
Say hello first off to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
Hi.
I don't think you guys are getting sick.
I have a sore throat Do you really?
I'll make you pay me in coffee Well then maybe you did get sick from me a week ago somehow
Well, then I don't know if I was sick or if it was allergies.
I felt just fine.
I need to introduce, of course, the third host on our show, always here every week, say hello to Tech Master Loki!
Hello.
How are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
Apparently you're getting sick too, that's no good.
Yeah, these things happen.
Yeah.
All right.
Also, of course, we do tape live on the VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our good pal Bobby Blackwolf over at the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the gamer mommies out there that listen.
I don't know of too many for sure.
I know of one, at least, that usually listens live.
Maybe one other.
But, you know, even if you're not necessarily a gaming mom, you might be a mom figure in somebody else's life, or maybe a mommy to your pets.
So, happy Mother's Day to all who that saying would apply to.
However, for all of you whose girl bits work...
Are you having an unhappy Mother's Day right now?
I've been having a thunk because... And, you know, I've been... Dan and I have been trying for like the last six years.
And I've been trying not to get excited every time I've had a little thing happen.
But I've gotten excited and I've gotten super depressed.
I'm sure.
So I just wanted everyone to shut up.
Well, I understand where you get like really...
It also creeps me the fuck out when people use pictures of their children as their Facebook icons.
I understand being proud of your child, but living through your child and using your child as your avatar is creepy as fuck.
Well, you might change an awful lot once you go through that experience.
I really don't think so.
I've never used a picture of Shermie as my icon.
You should.
Shermie's adorable.
She is adorable, but anytime I've ever used a picture of Shermie, I've been in it.
I have an icon of Shermie on my live journal where I have icons of me and a lot of other people from fandoms and it's the picture of Shermie sitting in Mel B's lap this is another lap dominated by Shermie
Well, we'll see.
I'll keep this recording and someday it'll happen for you.
Remember, true story, my mom and dad didn't get knocked up until my mom was 37.
In a row?
Yes, in a row.
She finally had me at 37.
However, Julian has turned five.
And I have to tell you the funny Mother's Day story from yesterday.
Sure, go ahead.
Then we can talk about games.
I was at Becky's house and Julian runs in from the garage all excited and he hops up in Becky's lap.
He says, Mommy, Mommy, we got you flowers.
But it's a surprise.
And we just started laughing so hard.
Well, it's the kind of flowers.
You can't see it yet because it's a surprise.
And she's like, just know when it's a surprise.
You're not supposed to tell me about it.
Oh, the look on his face was funny.
He's like, oh, you didn't know what kind of flowers.
That was the surprise.
It was just funny because he's like, I can't show you.
This is a surprise.
And just the way he said it, it was so cute.
But yeah, that's my Julian story of the week.
And now he's a kick-ass DJ
I know at least three of the girls are mothers.
Although I have to say one of them, you remember Renee, right?
Oh yeah.
She told me to have a happy Mother's Day because I take care of other people.
That's very nice.
So that made me feel better.
And then I talked to my mommy.
And my mommy was like, I was like, so what are you doing for Mother's Day?
Laundry?
Well, if you think about it, not only are you a mother to Shermie, but you're sort of a godmother to Maruko and Sanrio, our cats, because they have two daddies.
So you're like the womanly influence in their life.
I do get the cuddles from your little prissy dude.
Here you go.
He is kind of a prissy cat with his tail in the air all the time.
It's like, look at my butt.
Going to more comments from our chat room.
TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, for Mother's Day, you should show your mom a violent video game just to see how she reacts.
We already did that like six months ago.
I showed her the new Mortal Kombat game.
It was hilarious.
Oh, what episode number was that?
You taped her reaction.
I did.
It's actually on video, but she said she would disown me if I put the video up.
So I could only play the audio of it for you guys.
Rob, what is this?
Actually, the next thing I want to show her, I want to show her the love scene from Mass Effect 3.
Either the dude on dude or the female on female I want to get my mom Because keep in mind, my mom used to play Super Mario Brothers with me back in the day When I go back to Alabama, I need to get a video Mom today playing Super Mario Brothers She could probably still do 1-1 blindfolded No, no, no, that was 8-1 that you had to do blindfolded Oh, I'm sorry Because it had the same timing every time you freaking did it
DJ Morpheus from Under Sedation Live which is on the VOG Network Saturday nights at a new time 7 Pacific says with Rob's voice cracking periodically it's like being in a time machine and hearing him go through puberty you shut up I'm sick
I'm sick and I'm showing up for this show anyway because I love you guys.
You should say, shut your whore mouth.
That's right, shut your whore mouth.
Hey, video games.
We'll get to our gaming weeks in just a moment, but I thought a couple kickoff topics tonight.
Oh my god, that's so cute.
What?
Something else to distract us now?
No, it was Tigercop listed a picture of him with his old TV.
What?
I had a TV like that.
I want to see.
It has UHF channels and rabbit ears Oh god, I used to have a TV like that in my bedroom Because that was like the ultimate hand-me-down TV Since it is a radio show This is the kind of TV that has the two... Shit Knobs, it had knobs I know, I know, but I'm just realizing as I'm saying this out loud You know, any teenager listening to this show has absolutely no idea what we're talking about And it had a contrast twisty dial Maybe you've seen these at a thrift store
I saw a Blu-ray player at a thrift store, Rob.
I can only imagine that this description should be started with back in my day.
Well, a TV like that, the funny thing is a TV like that wouldn't even work anymore after the whole digital conversion that we had a couple years ago.
However, I'm looking for one for a reason.
Why?
Play my Odyssey 2.
Go to a thrift store.
I'm sure you'd find them there.
I haven't.
I haven't seen them at a thrift store.
Really?
You need to go to like, you know where you need to go?
Just get an RF adapter.
You need to go to Deseret, the Mormon freaking, I know.
I do not like giving the Mormons my money.
I know, but I'll tell you what, they've got everything.
I used to buy old comics there though.
I almost bought, for Rocky, in my defense, it was for Rocky Horror and I don't want to hear it.
I almost bought a wedding dress at Deseret.
I've been with Jessica a number of times getting stuff for clubbing.
Yeah?
Good times.
Because you can get lots of fun.
I've actually bought cosplay stuff there to modify.
There you go.
I bought... The Mormons aren't all bad.
I bought some... Actually, you know what the last thing I bought there was?
What?
Was my copy of Rubber Soul.
The Beatles' Rubber Soul.
On vinyl.
Five bucks.
This other place I went to had a really shitty copy and wanted 50 for it.
And I was like, nah, I'll buy it for the Mormons.
Pre-E3 stuff, what did you want to bring up?
I don't know, there's a lot of big announcements I'm expecting at E3 Alright, is it time to make our E3 predictions?
Now that we know that the press dates have been set and some of them you'll be able to watch live and some of them will only be online or what have you Okay, what are we going to see from Nintendo this year?
This is the easy one What are we going to see from Nintendo this year at their conference?
The Game Boy Micro 2.
I still have my Micro, so... They're just gonna plain say, fuck it, we ain't releasing the Wii U, you bastards.
I'm sure we'll see the Wii U. I just can't get excited about it, though.
I mean...
I don't know.
I don't think there's anything that they can put out for it at launch that's going to make me excited about the Wii U. Excite Truck 2.
That will be a tough, tough day.
But they're not going to announce a date.
They're not going to announce a price.
It's like...
PS3 got delayed.
I don't think so.
I don't think the Wii U can't afford to delay it.
Nintendo already is going down the downward turn with their investors and everything.
If they don't put out the Wii U, you're going to see Mario on the iPhone.
They're going to have to give in to the investors, and that's what the investors want.
They want Nintendo to develop for the iPhone.
So if the Wii U gets delayed... That's the day that Miyamoto will bind his knees and commit seppuku on the roof of the Nintendo building.
Honestly?
Yes.
And then they would sell his head on eBay.
The Wii U's coming, whether it's ready or not.
I hear Foxconn has a nice roof that he can jump off of.
Stop it.
I think Miyamoto has a little more self-respect than that.
I think it would be ritual suicide.
You know, the last one in Japan happened in 1978.
You all are being so morbid and gross and tacky.
I have to read from chatroom, Rob, since you're ignoring it.
I'm not ignoring them.
What do you want to read from chat?
I just lost it because you were busy jabbering.
Oh, yeah.
Great, now I forgot it.
Oh well.
I can't find them anymore.
This is why I usually re-chat.
We have this awesome comment from our chat room and, oh, it's scrolled away.
Where'd it go?
I'm trying to find it.
Someone said, back in my day, oh no, it was one night stands.
Back in my day, we had to blow in our cartridges.
But my retort was, back in my day, my computers used cassette tapes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yay, new Super Mario Bros.
I mean, it's a good game, and they're just making more levels for it, which I've said in the past they should do for the first one, you know, and open it up so everyone else can make levels, but then they won't do that.
I mean, what are they going to really have for... It's not going to be Smash Bros.
They may announce Smash Bros.
because it could be years away before it actually comes out,
But that's not beyond intended to do that.
I mean, hell, when did they announce Pikmin?
What, like a couple years ago?
So, I'm not surprised there.
Probably Animal Crossing will be the holiday game, which is kind of... Yay.
I want to play it.
They may do Luigi's Mansion 2, but eh.
It's kind of been long enough for me since I really got into an Animal Crossing game that I could be, because I really just passed on the Wii one, I really could be convinced to play Animal Crossing 3DS.
I would be pretty easily convinced.
Like, it's really a peer pressure thing for me.
If all my friends do it, I will do it too.
You know what?
I found my copy of Dobutsu no Mori.
Really?
And I was like, I should play this.
And then I was trying to remember why I stopped playing it to begin with.
Because I don't read Kana as well as I thought I did.
This game's hard when you don't natively speak the language.
It's just, I mean, there's not a lot that I can be excited about.
Especially if we're talking about this system's going to be basically like an Xbox 360 with the tablet controller and the Wii controls.
I don't know.
It doesn't seem very exciting to me.
They're going to have probably the same stuff that you saw in the tech demos are probably going to become full-fledged games because that's what they did with the Wii.
Oh, these are only tech demos?
Wii Sports.
Wii Play.
Wii Sports Resort.
It was just all the same shit.
So you'll probably see some sort of compilation that's going to be packed in, like a packing game or something that's going to be like Wii Sports, Wii U Sports or whatever they're going to call it.
And that'll be that.
But I'm kind of interested to see how it's going to work with like...
You know, especially like first person shooters and stuff, that tablet control is cool, but what if like say, I want to have more than just one person playing a first person shooter, you know, are we going to be on the classic controllers now?
I mean, that might not even be that great, because their controllers are kind of lacking compared to some of the other systems.
It's going to be hard to port that stuff over, but
I don't know, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they show.
Alright, let's move on so we don't spend all show on these predictions weeks before the show happens.
How about Microsoft?
I said on Bobby's show a minute ago that I really think Microsoft is hedging all their bets on Halo 4.
That Halo 4 is going to be the centerpiece of that presentation at the very end, and that's really all the Xbox has going for it right now.
No one's going to care.
I don't think I'd be that cynical about it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Please don't make any more resistance to the goddamn dashboard, okay?
It's already Windows 8 enough.
I mean, so... I don't know.
I'm wondering if they won't slip in some things about Windows 8 and kind of maybe how it might interact with the Xbox.
Maybe some type of enhanced media center or something?
I mean, big question mark there, but...
and so on.
So you think it'll be a lot of these really weird outside the box things like that that you're talking about that we're going to see from Microsoft?
I'm thinking, yeah.
Here's how the device does this.
Here's how the device makes waffles.
Maybe they're going to talk about new properties.
It would be nice if they made a new franchise or something like that.
Hell, Nintendo, make a new franchise.
That would be kind of cool.
I said Nintendo needs a new...
Sure, Nintendo.
Any of them could use the new one.
Why not?
New IPs rock.
Well, maybe that's, you know, with all this retro gaming thing that's been going on, maybe what they need to do is look at the old stuff and bring it screaming into the modern.
Yeah, but some of it hasn't worked out too well.
Look at Bionic Commando.
Oh, yeah, but that was shit.
Well, that worked out well for the Xbox Live Arcade games.
That's true.
The best Bionic Commando were the remade games.
Which is ironic because they're by the same people.
The other thing, the IPTV stuff, the web TV thing that they're maybe going to be doing, their own TV network type thing, that might be interesting.
I would bet you anything that's where Majors Minute goes.
Some sort of new show.
Interesting.
To get rid of the old show to make way for the new show.
Alright, let's quickly talk Sony real quick.
Because Sony's kind of a wild card.
I mean, obviously they're going to be pushing Vita, but we're not going to really see... There's not going to be any peripherals that we can think of that would come out from Sony.
There's nothing that they're pushing there.
so it's really games games games games games left and right Vita they're going to be having a lot of stuff to talk about the Vita maybe enhancements to that maybe some more move enabled games once again I don't think the move is a bad peripheral honestly out of all of the motion captured things that they have right now I think that one works the best yet I don't want to play anything that's using it
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Um, I think they're gonna talk a little bit more about, you know, once again, franchises that are gonna be supporting the move and stuff like Bioshock, um, Infinite.
Um, I think that they may have, well, obviously, they have a few new games that they're, um, supposed to be announcing, like, you know, the... God of War prequel.
Well, the God of War prequel... Stop making God of War prequels.
I mean, there's how many God of War... I can't even keep track of the storyline anymore.
Sony Smash Brothers or whatever they're calling it, Battle Royale, Extreme.
That might be pretty cool.
Um, they're gonna probably show, um...
What about that one game, Last Guardian?
Last Guardian still?
Where that guy suddenly disappeared, but they say the game's not canceled.
The Last of Us, also.
That's their big holiday game.
So they're really going to just have game, game, game, game.
I think they're just going to have lots of games.
That's good.
That's what they need.
Especially Vita.
I'm really excited to see the Vita second half based on some of the early stuff they were announcing before.
Yeah.
So...
All right.
Going to our chat room, ShadowNextGen says, there needs to be a Vita price drop announcement at E3.
I don't... I mean, I think that will... And then WhatUpG follows that with, there is talk of a PS3 price drop for E3, ShadowNextGen.
Again, that's VOGnetwork.com for chat.
I could see them doing that because they want to push more systems.
They're just bundling right now.
They're kind of doing the whole thing.
The Vita price drop, I mean...
I guess they could do that, but I think they're already losing money on the system.
So it's going to be hard for them to do that.
Because the system is more powerful than the 3DS, and so therefore it is more expensive.
It's just right now I don't think there's a lot of games that people need to have on the Vita.
There's nothing like, oh my god, I need to get a Vita for this game.
Whereas Mario Kart, oh, I've got to buy a 3DS for that.
Or Super Mario 3D Land, because it's just an amazing Mario game.
You know, a Zelda game or something like that.
Although, the new Zelda game on the 3DS.
None of this Nintendo 64 rehash bullshit.
Let's see.
Actually, speaking of rehash bullshit for the 3DS, I'm surprised they haven't remade the Mario 64.
That could be a title that they could just poop out real quick and put out for holiday.
It would sell a ton of copies.
Um...
I don't know.
I think there's going to be a lot of things for the Vita.
I think Call of Duty is definitely going to help.
I think if they end up doing a Max Payne Grand Theft Auto or something of that caliber on there, they could easily do that.
You know, I'm actually very interested in LEGO City Stories, which was the...
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and just more Grand Theft Auto 5.
I don't care who shows it.
Microsoft, Sony, both of them.
Hey, let's just show different things.
Every booth has it.
EA just put it up there.
Hey, it's such an awesome game.
We're going to show this too.
I think that would be pretty cool.
So...
I don't know, I hope it's just something that's not cancelled Because once again, all those really cool things that I wanted for the 3DS DJ Hero, Saints Row, that kind of stuff All got fucking cancelled before the 3DS came out So all these things that they announced for the Wii U Like, you know, this Lego City story thing Could easily be cancelled by the time we get to it
All right.
Well, I'm sure some of you out there have your theories as well.
Email us quickly before the leaks start coming because that's going to be the exciting thing over the next few weeks is leaks, leaks, and more leaks.
We even have a few tonight.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com to lock in your predictions right now.
And I would like to add once again because I don't think I say this enough.
I fucking hate Michael Patcher for getting paid lots of money to make stupid guesses.
I mean –
Hey, hey, I hear that a certain big title from Take-Two got, you know, delayed.
Therefore, Grand Theft Auto V is coming out that day.
Yes, you could draw that, you know, you can make that argument, I guess, because it's a pretty obvious one to make.
You know, or like, hey, I hear that, you know, a studio's making a new Halo game for the X... I think it's gonna be for the Xbox.
I mean, come on, that would be kind of the stuff that he makes...
Calls on.
I don't know.
But he gets paid a lot more money than I do.
All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks because I have a pretty big thing I got to get into in my gaming week this week.
So let's start off with ladies first, DarkSakura.
How was your gaming week?
What type of video games have you been playing this week when you haven't been coughing?
I got a Panda to 10 as a brewmaster and talked to the King of Stormwind and realized he's an asshole and quit playing the beta.
By the way, she's a Warcraft addict, everybody.
Dealer.
and I played some Portal 2.
Oh, have you played with that new level creator thingy that came out?
Not yet, not yet.
Oh, you gotta.
I need to.
Last week was finals.
Which I have to say, everybody, be proud of me, made a 97 on my art history final.
I have passed the class with an A. Booyah.
I need to go home tonight and make sure that goddamn code for the digital version of Portal 2 for PC works.
Yeah, I think you might want to cash in on that.
It's down to like 20 bucks now.
Oh, if it doesn't work, I'll have to wait for another Steam sale.
Still, I'm going to point and laugh at you for having missed that boat.
I want to thank Actdeft for the gift of the Portal 2 behind the scenes thing.
Oh, that's nice.
Listeners buy us gifts?
I want gifts.
The listeners buy me gifts.
No, I actually, I have gotten nice things from listeners before.
I can't pitch.
Speaking of gifts, I already bought you guys Christmas gifts.
Already?
Really?
I already took care of it.
Nice.
That's being proactive.
Now I'm going to remember that when Christmas comes around.
You bought that in May.
No, I can't wait.
It's not ready yet, though.
All right.
Raidenator in chat says, just an A, no A+, for shame.
He's being very much an Asian father right now.
Do I look Asian to you?
Alright, I'm assuming she's done, so Loki, your gaming week.
I just played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
I wanted to get to play other things, but I was actually working on some Grand Theft Auto modding tool thing, and I finally finished that, so I'm done with that.
I can actually go and work on actual Grand Theft Auto 4 modding.
I got to get my stuff that I've been working on for like a year now done before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
And then I am going back to Skyrim.
It's beckoning me.
So I'm going to play that.
Now actually, I'm supposed to be getting a copy.
I don't know if I'm going to keep it of the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition for the 360.
I haven't decided if I'm going to play that or not.
I do want Max Payne 3 because I want to rule the online for that.
But...
We'll see.
I have to wait on money.
Alright.
That's it then.
Alright, my gaming week has been all over the map.
Let's talk about the big one.
I beat my third game for 2012 this week.
That means I'd be... Okay, so if we go back... Now, remember, I have Gamer's ADD.
I never beat video games.
And if you haven't heard me talk about my Gamer ADD on the show before, I have a horrible habit of buying $60 video games, playing the first three stages, and then going, Ooh, shiny!
Playing a new game that comes out the very next week.
I know I'm not the only podcast host that has this problem.
I've heard other guys with this.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Exactly.
I know I'm not the only gamer with this problem, so it happens to all of us.
There's not enough hours in the day.
You know, sorry, just to interrupt real quick, but you posted on Twitter you needed a new game to play.
Yeah, I was going to get to that, but yeah.
Well, then let me continue.
Well, first I have to talk about my big feat.
So I beat my third game.
So to recap, this year I beat Mass Effect, and then after that I beat Mass Effect 2.
Guess what I beat the other night?
Space Harrier
So, Rob, how about that ending?
So I can finally talk about the ending.
I won't spoil, though.
Out of respect to those that have not beat Mass Effect 3 yet or are just now getting into Mass Effect, I'm not going to spoil.
So which color did you get?
I went with green which apparently was not the right thing to do but my thought was oh well I'm not going to go with the obviously paragon or the obviously renegade thing this surely must be the bonus choice that I get for having collected so many war assets which was only about half true yes it is a bonus choice you get for collecting a certain amount of war assets but it's not as great as you think you said ass
Anyhow, so without ruining the ending, let me just say this.
I pretty much stand by everything I already said about this debacle earlier in the program.
Yeah, it's kind of a disappointing end to a series that a lot of people are very rabid over.
It's a little weird that no matter what you do, the end result kind of ends up being really the same.
And for all this war asset, multiplayer, EA server, it interfaces with the iPad app and the iPhone game and the website and all this stuff.
You build up the war.
It maybe impacts, you know,
three quick time movies you get at the end of the game which is kind of disappointing considering Bioware put so much more into the game otherwise but maybe I don't know maybe they didn't want to branch it out in all these directions because it makes future games in the series a bitch to make I don't know I don't know their reasoning but I'm looking forward to the DLC just like everybody else this is supposed to be the last one surely you don't suggest that they made a terrible ending so that they could sell another game please please it won't be the last Mass Effect game
I mean it might be the last in this trilogy but if they can make a Halo 4 they can make a Mass Effect 4 that's for sure
um otherwise you know yes the ending is is unfortunate but it doesn't ruin the hundred hours of a gaming experience I had to get there which was a great gameplay experience I'm still playing the multiplayer as recently as earlier today I was playing multiplayer I was playing multiplayer with Shane and and Paul one of our listeners one of his friends last night we were all trying the gold multiplayer and getting our ass kicked but it was so much fun um so you know we're we're having fun with that and um
What else did I want to say about the whole ending debacle?
There's one other thing I wanted to say about it.
Oh, the whole talk about the defective game and turning it back to Amazon and filing the complaint with the FCC.
That shit was ridiculous.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I didn't need to play the game to know that.
Yeah, exactly.
My thoughts have not changed on that.
I just want to make that clear.
Am I...
Do I think Bioware could have done better?
Fuck yeah, I think they could have done better.
Absolutely.
But I'm not really the type to raise this huge ruckus and stink over it.
They were a little busy working on some Star Wars MMO or something.
Shane is screaming at me to talk about the theory.
But I don't want to spoil it, Shane.
I don't want to spoil it for listeners that haven't beat it yet.
All I will say is this.
He was begging me to watch this one and a half hour long documentary on YouTube that is explaining the ending.
And I'm like, Shane, I don't need to watch this hour and a half documentary that explains the ending.
Because I kind of already figured it out.
Like I was halfway there.
And then he says, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And I'm like,
Oh, okay, I can see that.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Yeah, that's probably it.
You see, they're going to better explain the ending soon, you know.
They're going to have the pop-up bubbles, like pop-up video, you know, for the ending once the new Bioware DLC comes out for Mass Effect 3.
And he's like, no, you have to watch it anyway because there's so many little things that go into it.
I'm like, Shane, I don't need to be sold on the theory.
I accept your theory.
It makes a lot of sense.
All right, I'm on board.
You're right.
That's the ending, and that's how they're going to fix it in the DLC.
No, watch the documentary.
Actdeft in the chatroom screaming, exactly, fucking exactly, it's open to interpretation.
That it is.
It is.
A little bit.
Anyhow.
How about other games that aren't Mass Effect?
Which I know, sacrilege, right?
Okay.
You wanted me to get out the haterade, though?
Because I played a really fucking terrible game this week.
It is Yaris Bad, you guys.
You ready?
It was a free game for me on PlayStation Plus, which should start to tell you how terrible it was.
And I don't even remember the name of it.
I think it was called...
Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns Frogger Returns
Remember how Frogger came out again in like 94 or 95 on the PlayStation?
And it wasn't bad.
That first Frogger game was kind of a neat reimagining of Frogger on the PlayStation, right?
And how every Frogger since then has basically tried to be that PlayStation game all over again.
Because I guess that was actually one of the best-selling PlayStation games ever, was that Frogger that came out.
But it was awful.
So...
Frogger Returns is like kind of a mixture of the two like it's trying to be the arcade game in that top overhead style but they've redone the maps to add a sewer level a subway thing and it's just like it's so derpy and I don't really have a better way to explain it like there's power-ups you guys oh my god oh my god okay power-ups power-ups you can make everything stop
for a few seconds which surprisingly doesn't make anything easier because sometimes you have to have things moving in order to get from platform to platform so that power up does nothing and then oh my god you guys oh my god you guys super revolutionary frogger power up change your fucking mind blow your blow your fucking mind away ready reverse everything fucking moves backwards oh my god
Don't tell me that they have a mirror stage option as well.
I don't know.
I didn't beat the game, but maybe that's something that comes up.
But everything moves backwards.
And you know what it changes?
Nothing.
Because Frogger is just as hard when everything's moving backwards as it is forwards.
Hey, Rob.
What?
There was a good Frogger thing that came out.
What's that?
Frogger 3 Deep on the Commodore 64 was badass.
It was a project using GPS mapping and street sensors.
What?
to where they had an interactive Frogger that used New York City traffic as the cars and you played the frog.
That's already more interesting than the game I played.
I don't know, that looked pretty derpy.
I thought it was pretty neat.
I will say this, for you trophy whores, there are four trophies in Frogger Returns.
You get a silver trophy for beating the first stage and then for stages two through four you get a gold trophy.
So if you want like an easy gold trophy or two, go play Frogger Returns.
free on PlayStation Plus otherwise oh the one I needed to get out there which this is so important the collision detection is awful and in Frogger collision detection is kind of important you think I was nowhere near that car
It's like playing a sprite-based game in three dimensions.
It's terrible.
All right.
Moving on.
One other game I played on PlayStation 3, although this game's on Xbox Live Arcade as well.
I didn't pay for it because it's also free on PlayStation Plus.
No, we got found at Fifth Avenue Frogger.
And this game was actually worth my time, unlike the other one.
Awesome Knots!
I will play it!
and so I mean imagine if you were playing like a type of Contra where you were just shooting the other people that's kind of what they've made is a side-scroller shooter that's multiplayer head-to-head and yeah it's kind of a neat experience I liked it can you shoot people until they explode yeah you shoot people till they explode they go back to their base and they have to respawn and then you fall down this little rocket and that's that's kind of what fills the time so that way you know you get there is a penalty for you having died and
And in a nutshell, you're trying to bust through these little, like, I think they're called turrets.
You bust through these little turrets on your way to get to the base.
I mean, it's like any other tower defense game, but they've mixed it with a shooter, which makes it kind of unique and fun.
So yeah, I liked Awesomenauts.
That's worth a look.
If you're on PlayStation Plus, especially, it's free.
So, like, seriously, go get it.
So it wasn't Awesomenauts.
well and it has this amazing 80s retro theme song to it and like anime intro and I gotta say it's it's a sharp looking game looks like a cartoon it's great art styles fun so yeah it's where it's worth checking out
So I was just thinking now, you know, how you're looking for another game to play, you know, and possibly one that's, you know, we could play with other people.
Yes, I put that out on Twitter.
Now that I beat Mass Effect 3, what do I play?
And of course Shane replied and said, more Mass Effect.
I'm like, I want to give it a month before I start my Renegade playthrough.
Well, I was just thinking it'd be interesting if we both tried Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.
all right look I don't want the Minecraft hate mail I played Minecraft on PC and I just didn't get it but to be fair to be fair everybody put the pens down don't write the hate mail the first time I played Mass Effect about three years ago the first Mass Effect game I didn't get it either and I didn't like it so okay I'm with you Loki let's give let's give Minecraft one more chance I will I will buy it tomorrow all right
I am looking for Minecraft for Linux.
I'm sure it exists.
Why the sudden urge to get into Minecraft, Loki?
I don't have a real urge to it, but I think it'd be interesting.
It'd be funny if we both played a game, like we set a time during the week or something to play multiplayer and that, and just, whether we hate it or like it, it'll be interesting.
That's right.
Interesting it will.
There is Minecraft for Linux.
Of course there is.
There's everything for Linux.
I don't know.
There's Steam for Linux.
Or we could play a game that we already have, like Saints Row 3rd.
BobbyBlackWolf in our chatroom says, Sky, Minecraft on 360 is a better introduction.
That's what I hear.
It's set up a little better to get you into the series.
I'll check it out.
I will.
Why not?
Sure.
All right.
Otherwise, I do have all these other games I could be playing, like Fez I need to play more of because I actually really enjoyed the little time I spent with that.
Whatever.
Let's move on.
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
How's that sound?
Oh, first, let me plug our Twitters.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
And, of course, our Facebook.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Add us.
Be our friend.
And we'll be your friend in return.
And you can interact with the show and answer our frugal questions every week.
Otherwise, housekeeping, there will still be a show next week.
But no Dark Sakura.
Dark Sakura is going to the happiest place on Earth.
And not taking me.
Huh?
You know, you were invited.
I was totally invited, but I can't make it because I have a conflict.
That's right, you're conflicted.
Yeah, I always am.
So Loki and I will be here holding down the fort, maybe a guest host.
Alan works on Sunday nights now, so he won't be here.
And for the record, Frisbee, wine does not work on my netbook, which I'm running Linux Mint on.
So, end of story.
And also, I want to say, Nicholson, since I know you're listening, thank you for the pink berry.
Right, Jamie?
Yes, thank you.
It was considerate of you to think of us.
It was considerate.
He brought it for me.
You just sound so sincere.
No, you are.
It was considerate.
Alright, let's move on and get into the news.
Loki.
E.A.
is planning on doing some layoffs.
The plan is that they're going to finish these layoffs by September 30th.
Basically, what they're doing is restructuring of their employees.
Weaning people off?
Yes, they're restructuring them out of the company.
Okay, see right here, this is our group of employees here.
This circle represents the people that are in the company.
The people that are outside of the circle, you're fired.
So that's kind of how it's going to work.
They're basically, I guess, dropping from 1 in 8 engineers to 1 in 2.
So, cool.
And I guess...
They will... By the way, this is all the fault of people that rent games and buy them used.
This is all your fault and the blood is on your hands.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Uh, yeah.
And then, of course, they're going to drop the number of employees by 5-10%, which is approximately 500 to 1,000 people.
How in the hell does that go from 1 in 8 people being an engineer to 1 in 2 people being an engineer when you're firing 5%?
Like, I'm not even a math major, and that doesn't compute to me.
Does that mean all these people are suddenly going to be changed into engineers?
Yeah.
They're just going to... Loki, bam, you're an engineer.
They're just going to make him respec, okay, as an engineer.
So that's what's going to happen, you know.
You were a white mage before, you're now a fucking engineer.
They're going to need to pay 120 Microsoft points.
Listen, you better learn how to fucking pilot that airship because if not, you're out of there as well.
We're going to drop it down to one and one engineers.
So yes.
Only you could make a shitty thing like job loss hilarious.
Thank you, Loki.
Hey, not only do I speculate about, you know, game industry stuff, I can also do comedy.
Fuck you, Michael Patcher.
You can't do comedy for shit.
I saw your video.
My data says that there are more people that whine than complain.
Well, my data says that you're a fucking tard.
Allegedly.
Allegedly.
Allegedly.
So there's that.
And then, of course, beyond that, they've made some money with Origin.
I guess they have 11 million members on Origin.
Now, to be fair...
If you play an EA game that has multiplayer, you have to sign up on Origin.
Yeah, I'm on Origin because of Mass Effect.
You may be skewing those numbers a little bit.
So, fine.
The person who hacked my Xbox signed me up for Origin.
I got signed up for Origin.
And my Xbox hasn't been hacked, but I'm signed up for it.
Somehow, I don't remember doing it.
Dragon Age.
That's why I did it for Dragon Age.
I'm smart.
And then, of course, they've made $150 million in revenue during the fiscal year from March 31, 2011 to April 1 of this year.
And they're saying that EA's Nucleus cross-platform community network, which, I've got to be honest, I've never heard of, has 220 million members.
I don't even know what the fuck that is or why they have so many members for it.
Um, and they said, of course, uh, they've allowed 11 million members to provide feedback on Origin and their distribution service.
But, I see, once again, it's just because you can't tout those numbers.
That's like, for example, the PlayStation, like Sony saying, oh look, the PlayStation Network has all these members.
Yes, because it's free to make an account.
I have four accounts.
Am I four people?
No, I am one person.
But I have four accounts because I like having accounts in every single region.
And also Nelly has an account.
But technically it's on the PlayStation, so therefore it's my account.
But that doesn't count.
So, whatever.
Fine.
Tout your numbers, but all it really comes down to is revenue.
$150 million isn't bad.
I don't know what Steam makes during that same time period.
I'm assuming a lot more than $150 million.
$150 million can save lots of jobs.
Never mind.
Oh, by the way, it wasn't Dragon Age.
It was Sims 3.
Whatever.
Maybe Sims 3 makes you sign up for Origin?
No, but I signed up for an EA registration account.
Oh.
So it linked my data from when I signed up for Dragon Age.
It actually linked my data from Sim 3.
Gotcha.
Well, it's also weird because I had a Call of Duty Elite account, and yet I never remembered signing up for one.
But I did.
I just don't remember why.
Call of Duty Elite Activision Blizzard Activision Blizzard
the net revenue right now 1.17 billion for the period ending on March 31st 2012 that is a 23% drop over 2011 Activision let's see Activision had 23% of net revenues that's down 19% Blizzard accounted for 21% of net revenues down 42% probably because I would imagine because Blizzard had Starcraft 2 sales still pretty strong this time last year and also WoW subscriptions were up
Now, of course, Blizzard kind of has this semi-big game coming out Let me think, when is that game going to be out?
Oh yeah, tomorrow night, Diablo 3, which should look pretty good for them Pandas!
Land of the Panda People is coming out later this year as well And then of course they have a StarCraft 2 expansion on the horizon Do you suppose that maybe getting people to prepay for their full year of... Now, assuming that was prepaid for the Blood Pact, right?
No, it was not.
It was merely the equivalent of a cell phone contract.
You sign it up and agree not to... I thought maybe they were trying to boost their numbers.
You don't have to pay anything extra.
It's just... We'll give you a pretty pony and this game and a beta...
I will say I did this.
When I signed up for the blood pact, I switched my account to six months at a time because when you do six months at a time, you get like $2 off a month.
You pay like $77 for six months.
And so I just did that because I had a nice chunk of money six months ago and then I knew around now I would have to pony up the money again, which I did.
And it's okay.
So let's see.
uh Activision's big stuff uh coming up uh Prototype 2, Amazing Spider-Man, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 yeah they've got well they've got uh well Prototype 2 just came out um obviously their big one Call of Duty later on Skylanders Giants which I hate to say it's probably gonna be a big title for them um and they have a whole bunch of smaller things in between then like uh Ice Age 2 they have a
A terrible Battleship game that's coming out also on Tuesday.
They also have... Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Battleship was a game.
Now it's a movie.
The game based off the movie.
Based off the game.
Yes, they have a game that's coming out.
A first person shooter that will probably be passed over by a lot of people coming out as well.
And then a couple weeks later, Men in Black, Alien Crisis.
Another terrible game based on a movie.
Well,
Not exactly based on the movies.
Based on a lot of secondary characters from the movies.
That's also coming out as well.
So they're going to have that.
And Spider-Man will do well for them.
Alright, well, Call of Duty Elite, since Loki brought that up a minute ago, apparently 10 million users are signed up for Call of Duty Elite.
2 million are paid subscribers.
That's better than nothing, which is what they had a few years ago when the service didn't exist.
Apparently that is up 3 million and a half million, so it was 7 million and 1.5 million since February when they last reported on the numbers.
So, yeah, it's gone up.
I guess people are liking their Call of Duty Elite.
DarkSakura.com
See, I'm not super into Call of Duty, so that's really not for me, but I could see where that is lucrative.
If they had something like that for Mass Effect, I'd be tempted.
I hate to say that.
Yeah, see, right now we play offline at work, so that would require everybody having those maps in order for it to be beneficial for me to buy those maps.
So I just don't buy those maps right now.
All right.
Well, let's move on with some more news, DarkSakura.
Yes, other stuff that is, well, more Blizzard-y things.
Blizzard and Valve settled their little trademark disagreement for the D-O-T-A, Dota, whatever it is.
So basically, Valve gets to use it, and Blizzard retains non-commercial use of the title for the community, as in keeping it as an acronym available for Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2.
In fact, Blizzard is renaming the Blizzard DOTA project.
It's called Blizzard All-Stars.
This is the quote that came out from Rob Pardo, who's the Blizzard exec.
Both Blizzard and Valve recognize that at the end of the day, players just want to be able to play the games they're looking forward to.
Soon.
Soon.
Which is good.
I mean, the community wins.
And it's not like the community is not going to know one of these games from the other.
I mean, Dota-style games are really a rage right now.
You know, League of Legends is really huge.
It's a game we don't talk about enough on this show.
There's a pretty huge community behind it.
you know those style of games are very popular so I think everybody's really waiting to see what Blizzard and Valve puts out there as well as there's another one one of the other Dota makers went to go make a third one I can't remember the name I'm sure someone in chat will jump in but there's kind of a third one involved in all this too so and then of course there's League of Legends too so you know they're all kind of very similar but will all be unique in their own way so it'll be neat to see
and you know honestly I wish we could see this type of agreement this type of goodwill I would say from more companies that are having little tiffs with each other I would rather them consider their whole the whole reason they have money in their pockets is because of these communities because of the gamers and
and they try to, you know, delay things and screw each other over.
In the end, they're screwing us over too and back to screwing themselves because they're not getting their money as soon as they would probably like it.
WhatUpG in the chatroom says, Can Valve now get to making Half-Life 3?
I agree.
I definitely agree with that notion.
I would like to see them back to making Half-Life 3 at this point.
More Half-Life.
Alright, moving on.
So there's some other rumors or reports, I guess, regarding some stuff that maybe Microsoft's going to be showing off at E3.
And this involves ConnectPlayFit and a device called Juul.
Basically, what Juul is supposed to be is some sort of device that's going to include a heart rate monitor and other wireless monitoring stuff.
Like, for example, I would imagine a pedometer or something like that.
And what it's going to do is track your, I guess, exercise across all different Kinect games.
And so almost like I would say like those, oh, I don't know what you call them, but the Nike things that they have for like the iPhone or, you know, whatever, where you can jog and they'll, you know, keep track of how far you've jogged.
You mean a pedometer?
Yeah.
Well, no, I understand it's a pedometer, but it's a little bit more than that.
It's like a heart rate monitor and stuff, and it actually hooks up to these different software devices.
So that's what they're going to be talking about.
And I think that's kind of a neat idea because then that way you're not limited to, oh, I have to play a fitness game in order to track how many calories I'm burning or something like that.
Almost reminds me a little bit of what they did with the Wii Fit Plus stuff where you can show your progress across a bunch of different things and you have your own dedicated channel for that.
I can see them doing something similar, maybe built into the dashboard where you buy this device, maybe comes with an exercise program or something like that.
and you wear it for these different Kinect games like Dance Central or something like that and not only are you having fun but you're tracking weight loss and that kind of stuff.
Hooray!
More weight loss and exercise games for the Kinect.
Honestly, you know what?
Just what they needed.
I think they need more of is not only the weight loss stuff but they need dieting stuff as well.
Like, what should you eat?
You know?
Like a full program, not just, yeah.
Not just because, you know, weight loss stuff is a good idea, but if you're only doing that, you're not going to lose anything.
So you need like, you know, they need to also say, okay, here's what you should eat too.
And hey, recipes, recipes are nice.
Tied in with like a Windows phone thing or something.
I don't know.
Maybe a tie-in with Fidocracy?
Sure, why not?
Who knows?
Anything's possible.
Anything is possible, including an internet browser, finally on the 360.
What, about six years late?
At this point, it's almost not even worth it.
How long has the Wii and the PlayStation 3 had a browser?
Well, sounds like the Xbox 360 could be getting one of their own, if rumors are to be believed.
Internet Explorer 9, which is weird, because I thought they were up to like 10, but whatever...
Internet Explorer 9 having Kinect functionality is rumored to be coming to the Xbox in a future update.
You'll be able to search with voice input, just like the Bing search bar and all that stuff, and you can browse the web using Kinect-based controls, which I have no idea how that would be practical or whatever, except maybe like...
I wanna go back a page.
Whoosh!
I wanna go back to home.
Whoosh!
Probably just scrolling through pages because you don't have a mouse.
Well, you could use a controller for that, but why would we make things make sense?
Why do that when you can go whoosh?
The whoosh should be required.
I don't want to whoosh.
I do that in private.
So, a big meh to that.
Whatever.
I'll download it and try it once and go, huh.
I am saying, though, let me be first to... I'm sure I'm not the first, but I'm going to be the first on this show to venture into that area.
I can see that there's going to be some dirty uses for the Kinect-enabled browsing.
Obviously, since it's hands-free, you know.
Find porn!
Go!
Woosh!
Woosh!
Enhance.
Enhance.
Enhance.
Woosh!
Next video!
Suddenly the Kinect starts scrolling up and down very rapidly.
Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.
We have detected masturbation.
We are charting your calorie loss as part of the... We heard you just say connect video chat.
DarkSakura, now calling.
That would only work if I had a camera.
Do you have a connect?
Then you have a camera.
My connect, Rob, is still in its box.
Here's a question for everybody.
I want honest answers.
Who likes to put a game box or something in front of their Kinect just in case they're spying on you?
Because sometimes I like to play Mass Effect 3 with no pants on.
You know what?
It's my house.
I'll do what I want.
And I'll sit in that chair with no pants on.
I totally do that with my Kinect that's wrapped around, that's not attached to anything that's collecting dust because that's how often I use the Kinect.
But I'm afraid one of these days it'll be like, start party with friends and all of a sudden it's like, you started Video Kinect.
Ah!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Or what if there's like an awkward moment where you're throwing a party actually in your house and you do not have enough cups to go around and you have a couple girls that are looking for a drink cup and you're like, there's two girls and I only have one cup.
Oh, embarrassing.
That's embarrassing.
Damn it.
Did not want to see that.
Who wants dip?
Tyler.
or what if you have a new pet?
Did anyone bring lemons to the party?
Ah, shit!
Or what if you just got a new pet and you say, look, I have a new goat, see?
You know, that's actually funny enough that you should say that actually is a legitimate concern for my sister whose goats are actually having babies so she would have something you want to see my new goat, see?
New goat, see?
Which I still do want a pet goat to eat the grass in my backyard.
TigerClaw on our chat says, Sky, what about the Kinect microphone?
That thing would be on and they would hear you.
You got to turn that off.
You know what?
I actually did turn that off in the dashboard.
I'm always afraid it's going to like pop back on or something because, you know, like sometimes I'm playing Strangers on Mass Effect 3 and I don't want like, you know, Alan to walk in the room and be all like, honey, the kitty just barfed or something like that.
And then everybody hears it on the video game.
Well, we used to have Shermie shit in the hall while we recorded the show, so it's not a big thing.
And just to let everyone know, Shermie is fine.
She's old and smelly.
Alright, let's move on, please.
Another story.
I got texted.
You're supposed to be doing a show, young lady.
So?
Was it my turn?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, yes, it's your turn.
And then release date's coming up.
and DarkSakura
This was before Kickstarters.
This was like my first AX in 1998 or something.
But they're doing it in Japan.
They're building a 12-foot tall pilotable mecha.
And they're using Kinect for running it.
Basically, it's as far as the... They actually have a weapon, Rob.
It's a water gun.
Hmm.
Not a big sniper rifle or chain gun.
It's a water gun.
And they're calling it Vaudeville.
If I shoot that water gun right in your eye, it might hurt.
Yeah.
They're calling it Vaudeville.
And it looks like it's four-legged.
And there's some shots of it in production.
I mean, it looks really freaking not like a Gundam.
Can my cat drive it?
Kitty Mech.
Meow, meow, meow.
Did you ever play Battletech?
No.
Well, it looks like old Battletech stuff.
All right.
But it's neat, but, you know, I want a mecha so that I can use it to go to work.
It brings up that age-old question.
Why?
Why?
And the age-old response, Rob.
Why not?
Why not?
Because.
Reasons.
I'm bored.
Because of reasons.
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things coming to a gaming store near you in your country, which may or may not include gaming mechs.
Battleship, the newest game from Activision that will be a blockbuster smash I'm sure
The source material is excellent.

He looks like he's trying to do that Bruce Willis thing.
I'm done.
Alright, just a few more stories before the classic game of the week.
But first, Loki?
So, Assassin's Creed is being sued by a novelist.
John Besswanger is suing them because he says that Assassin's Creed stole themes and other things from his book, Link.
apparently they stole the themes of assassination and spiritual and biblical tones and also the battle between good and evil that sounds awfully generic if you ask me he's seeking five and a quarter million dollars in damages and basically saying that it could delay the release of Assassin's Creed 3 and of course you know
We understand that many gamers are upset by the litigation and the potential for a delay in the release of the next Assassin's Creed video game and as a result of that anger that has been posted posting negative comments on Amazon and other forums about our client and his novel Link.
However, copyright laws exist to protect the authors and creators and for people to exploit them from others who copy or create works that are under the law substantially similar
I'm sorry, I just, I'm not buying.
I think there was also, there was something that was very similar to the Animus that was in Assassin's Creed.
I think that's mainly the main tie in there, but it's kind of stretching if you ask me.
I'm sure if you went- There's a lot of books that are pretty similar.
I know, so see, I'm sure there's a lot of books in the world.
There's a lot of books in the world.
I'm sure if you go back even further, you might be able to find traces of it somewhere else, right?
Yeah.
Surely?
I don't know.
All right, moving on.
Let's talk about Zynga.
But no, no, no, this is a story that might make you lull a little bit here.
Zynga apparently has also filed their own lawsuit.
It's against French publisher Kojobo.
which sounds very French to me.
They have a game on Facebook called Pyramidville.
Zynga ain't having that because what's wrong with the name Pyramidville?
Oh, Zynga owns Ville apparently.
Except they don't.
They just think they do.
Zynga says that Facebook users are likely to believe erroneously that Pyramidville is a member of Zynga's ville family of games.
That's according to the complaint.
Given Kajobo's refusal to change their game name, legal action was necessary to defend our famous marks and prevent player confusion.
I am kind of confused that they have a game that's called Dream Tower or something like that and it looks very similar to Apparently they own Ville but the same logic will not apply to Nimblebit who owns Tiny Tower although I think their game is called Dream Heights to be fair Oh, my mistake They're going to copyright Heights now
PYRAMIDVILLE
And you know what?
Mental note, guys, for the new VOG site.
Bobby, if you're listening, we need to cancel VOGville.
It can't happen.
No VOGville.
Sorry about that.
We'll just have to scratch that out.
It's gone.
Frisbee in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com asks, so does that mean Zynga owns the song Margaritaville?
That's a good question.
They do have a Facebook game that is Margaritaville as well.
Fifth Dream said they wanted to make a Smallville game and Zynga sued.
One Night Stand said I play Potville on Facebook.
Do they own that?
You know, I honestly, I hope that they lose because it's just like Monster, remember Monster Cables or Monster, I don't know which one it was, Monster Cables and Monster Energy, they both kind of sucked, but they sue everybody that uses the name Monster.
And so, oh, people are going to get confused.
Facebook Games, I'm going to be the generic guy here and say, you know, they all kind of look alike anyways.
I understand that maybe this company may or may not have named their, you know, Pyramidville or whatever to get people confused to play their game.
Um,
I don't know.
From what I hear, though, they're suing them for more than they actually made on that game, like three times as much as they made on that game.
And all they're doing is they're just, you know, positioning themselves.
It was Monster Cable, by the way.
Yeah, well, Monster Energy does it, too.
Like, they sued Monster Mini Golf.
It's like, okay, whatever.
I don't know.
I just think it's stupid to do that.
And fuck, it's karma, bitch.
You rip all these other people off and now you're getting yourselves ripped off.
Too bad.
Alright, let's go to a time when there was no Ville Games and nobody owned that name.
It was a simpler time for video games.
DarkSakura's gonna open up the gaming vault and find a video game she deems worthy of being the classic game of the week.
Yeah, yeah.
DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?
Streets of Rage.
I can't believe this was never the classic game of the week before.
I'm always amazed at what you pull up.
I'm like, no, she had to have done this.
She had to.
Nope.
Wiki says it's not true.
Another suggestion from my lovely husband.
That's a good suggestion.
Here's a little bit of the music from Streets of Rage.
The Japanese name is Bare Knuckle Ikari no Tekken.
So two other games have based their names off of this.
But I fucking love this music.
Right now?
No.
Which I actually have a Genesis cartridge of Bare Knuckle, but when you play it on the American Nomad, it comes through Streets of Rage.
Did you know that?
That's weird.
It must read the region on the device or something.
It must.
At any rate, this was the first game, of course, in the Streets of Rage series.
There were two and three after that.
It's had multiple versions.
We've had Game Gear, Mega CD, Master System.
It came out for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe.
And there's an iOS version.
There's a comic strip series that appeared in Sonic the Comic that were based off of Streets of Rage 2.
And another thing about this game is that you know who did the soundtrack, Rob?
Yuzo Koshiro, Squeak!
Yeah!
That's why it's fucking good.
By the way, if you were listening to last week's show, you know it's a big inspiration for MegaRam as well.
Indeed.
So basically, it is a side-scroll and beat-em-up, punch-em-in-the-face.
It came out around the same time as Double Dragon and Final Fight, but it was its own thing.
And you have one special attack per life per level, and your power-ups are shaped like police cars, and you cannot use your special attack in level 8 at all.
it doesn't mean any of the enemies only in the Japanese version of a manual do the enemies have names because apparently they care more than we do you can also play
One player or two player co-op and you have multiple endings.
Of course your enemy is Mr. X. So you can actually end the game as a bad guy if you play in two player mode.
So the way that it works is that you get the good ending just for finishing the game.
The bad ending, like I said, is only in two-player mode.
The boss will ask you to join him, and one says yes, and the other says no.
And so the player who said yes must prove their loyalty by killing the other player.
And if the yes player wins, and then turns down the boss's offer, then he has to fight the boss alone.
And if he succeeds on the bad ending, he will be sitting in the boss's chair that says, you became the boss, you are great.
I need a caption of me in a chair that says that You became the boss, you are great
and then the character laughs and the word bad end appears.
If both of them say yes, the boss will test the player's loyalty by sending them back to an earlier stage and then they have to replay the game from that level.
So it had a little bit of interactivity to it.
So the characters in the game is Adam Hunter, who is an ex-cop and accomplished boxer.
He's slower but tougher.
and then Axel, who is an ex-cop and skilled martial artist.
And he's the middle one, who is basically all around middle speed, middle other attributes, but he has a weak jumping ability.
And then there's Blaze Fielding, an ex-cop and judo expert.
A little weaker, but she is more agile and can jump the highest.
and her kicks have the longest range she has throws and body slams she's always who I use by the way you have the backup enforcer who is not a playable character but he only comes out during a special attack he's the one good cop
So as far as different versions, there was 8-bit versions for the Sega Game Gear and the Master System.
The Game Gear version was crap for the record, and it didn't have Adam in it.
The Master System version was not actually a port from the Game Gear.
It was pretty decent.
It has a boss on round 6 that is not in any other version and has no two-player support.
The Sega actually brought it out in the arcade for the Mega Touch and Mega Play arcade boards.
And in the Mega Tech version, you play for time, not for credits.
There's different collections that came out.
There's Mega Games 2 that had Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi that came with the Mega Drive.
And again, that was the name in Japan and Japan.
and the voice effects in the game were redone.
Then there was a Sega Genesis 6 pack that had Streets of Rage on it, Hedgehog Columns, Ravenous Shinobi, Golden Axe and Super Hang-On.
and the Mega Six that had Streets of Rage, World Cup Italia 90, Columns, Super Monaco, GP, Revenge of Shinobu, and Sonic the Hedgehog.
There was a version of the Sega Gems Collection for the GameCube and PS2.
They actually took it out of the North American version so that they wouldn't give it a T rating.
You can get it on GameChat, by the way.
And then, um, they're all in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 on the Wii Virtual Console.
And, um, there was the Streets of Rage, um, by Blaze Europe that was, um, handheld.
And this iOS version.
Now, this is the thing that, um...
All three of the games combined.
Just in, I guess, continuous levels, but, I mean, of course they were asked to take it down, so it was stopped, but hey, we've got, clearly there are still fans of the series.
and you can get the soundtracks which of course we said was done by Yuzo Kishiro and the second one and the third one had work done on it by Multihiro Kalashima so there you go Bare Knuckle Ikari no Tekken your classic game of the week Bare Knuckle or as many of you know it Streets of Rage the first one yes
available on the Genesis or Mega Drive and tons and tons of systems after that in various revivals.
Indeed.
All right, we're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere, guys.
We've got more of Orange Lounge Radio coming up in a little bit, including the Fugle Question of the Week.
And guess what we're bringing back tonight?
We haven't played this in a little while.
Listless tonight.
Woo-hoo!
And I'll tell you guys the topic in just a little while.
So stay tuned for Part B and more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday, May the 13th of 2012, Mother's Day.
Once again, to those of you that joined us a little late live tonight, a happy Mother's Day to all the gaming mommies who are listening, or the geeky mommies, or mother figures in people's lives, or pets' lives, and everybody that somebody or something could call a mother.
Happy day to all of you out there.
We are, of course, live as we are every Sunday night on VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.
Still kind of a skeleton site there, but lots of exciting stuff to come in the next couple weeks.
We've been starting to see some behind-the-scenes things of what's being planned, and it's going to be a good time.
So looking forward to Phase 2, which will be around the beginning of June.
I'm giving you a hard time
If you want to recommend a show for the network, get in touch with me.
You can find me idling throughout the week in the VOG chat room or rob at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to email me at.
I will have my VOG network address set up soon, but that's a good place.
Again, geeky shows.
We're actually not really looking for a lot of more gamer shows because we have a few now.
Can we set up a VOG Network email account that doesn't get as much spam as we do now?
Actually, yes.
Oh, thank God!
I have to talk to you offline about how that's going to work.
But yes, yes you can.
So yeah, if you have a show that's of good audio quality, it's very important.
I especially am looking for live shows.
It's a huge, huge draw.
It can be anything about geek.
Anything geek.
Music geek.
Comic geek.
TV geek.
Movie geek.
Book geek.
Oh my god, a book club show would be awesome.
Anything that you think qualifies as geek, get in touch with me.
I'm looking for, most of all, audio quality and consistency is hugely important too.
If you can't be bothered to do the show...
You know, regularly, then, you know, we can't make it work.
But if you're willing to commit, we'll help.
We'll do what we can to help you grow an audience.
So there you go.
Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on.
Get into some gaming news.
We need a board game podcast.
A board, especially, oh my God, there's some like crazy board games out there with like 11 billion pieces.
And I know people that I get invited to these board game parties that some friends of mine have.
probably about every other month or so and I didn't get to go to the last one because I had a conflict but I went to the first one that I was invited to a couple weeks or a couple months ago and I had a blast and they have like shelves and shelves in their house just full of board games and played some new stuff I would never heard of in my life yeah a board game podcast would rock so I do second Bobby no bronies or wrestling
I don't know if Rasslin's geeky.
Bronies, let's hear your ideas.
I wouldn't necessarily say no to that, but it's got to be real good.
Real good.
Alright, let's move on and cover some video game news.
Loki, rapid fire news.
So Bioshock Infinite's been delayed to 2013.
They basically made the excuse that it's to put some more polish on the game and apparently that they're working on multiplayer.
Because you know every game needs multiplayer.
It will not be coming out in October as originally planned.
It is now scheduled for February 26, 2013.
So that's when you can look forward to that and
Certain analysts would let you think that Grand Theft Auto will be coming out that day.
Or in October instead.
Which, don't get me wrong, I would love that.
I would love that, love that, love that.
I'd also love it if it comes out in 2013.
But yes...
Sooner the better.
That's my theory.
I'm just saying, though, Bioshock, the delay sucks, but at the same time, if they need the time to make the game better, then take it.
We have to remember, as much as this news might disappoint, don't rush a game that needs to be good like this.
Bioshock Infinite needs to be good.
So take your time.
Modern Warfare 3 is getting some new content.
They're getting a brand new mode, which is called Face Off.
It's meant for one-on-one or two-versus-two kind of deathmatch, team deathmatch type stuff.
They're actually putting out four maps, two of which are going to be free.
Those new maps are Ground and Erosion.
Ground is a map with a underground ship, and Erosion, I don't remember the hell that one was, but it looked cool.
so that's going to be coming out also of course two more maps that you can buy which will be also part of the content collection so if you happen to be a paid subscriber of Call of Duty Elite you'll be getting those for free and well you're paid for with your subscription but no additional cost I guess
and those will be coming out on May 15th for Elite subscribers and I guess everybody else on Xbox on May 21st and then Content Collection 2 is also going to include new multiplayer maps Sanctuary, Foundation, and Oasis and two new spec op missions including Ironclad and Killswitch Ironclad being one where you get to drive a tank and Killswitch is a sniper and infiltration mission
So yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So look for that sometime this summer.
And that's kind of neat, I guess.
I don't know how that would play, but I know it's going to be popular, especially with a new movie coming out.
Well, yeah, and those LEGO games are kind of always big sleeper hits.
Like, they might not seem huge to the... They do really well.
But yeah, to the core gamer, they don't seem like such a big deal, but they're hugely family-friendly games, and lots of the family owners get those games.
So those LEGO games are always a pretty big deal.
Except for Rock Band.
Maybe didn't do as well, but even that one... It was a neat idea.
You know, to be honest, it was a neat idea, and it was a game that I...
DJ Morpheus Watch out for Lego Twilight
Yeah, I was going to say, here's the problem.
There's no content to base a game around.
I mean, unless ripping off your shirt.
Honestly, what would be funny for Twilight or something like that is like a micro game thing.
You know, like WarioWare.
Rip off shirt.
Brute.
Stare at the wall for months.
You know, you're like spinning the clock to make the time go faster.
Sparkle.
Sparkle.
You know, that would be pretty funny.
I could see that.
Do-do.
Block Bella from getting eaten by vampires because she poked herself with a knife and is now spewing blood.
Alright, you're getting a little tooth carried away there.
My wife is starting to read Fifty Shades of Grey and she says it's the worst thing ever.
The worst thing.
Alright, moving on.
Wolfenstein 3D.
Remember that game?
Hell yeah.
Well, if you do remember that game, congrats.
You're old because Wolfenstein 3D celebrated its 20th anniversary this week.
It's only been 20 years.
Yeah, I remember downloading that demo from a local BBS.
I remember buying that shareware demo.
Well, it wasn't a demo.
It was the full first campaign, so it was pretty awesome.
Yeah.
On a floppy disk at a flea market.
Shareware demos used to be the shit.
Yeah, it was all of episode one, and then if you wanted episodes two through six, that's what you bought.
It's great.
It'd be like getting the full game and then you have to buy the DLC later on.
Yeah, yeah.
Not bad.
It's awesome.
So anyhow, Wolfenstein 3D, how do they celebrate their 20th anniversary?
Well, Wolfenstein 3D is now playable in web browsers, completely free.
Wolfenstein.bethsoft.com because Bethesda has the IP now.
you can also pick it up on the iPhone devices for free I believe that was only on the actual anniversary though which was on the 9th I don't think it's free anymore I will say this I picked it up and I played it and you know it
It's a 20 year old game, but they up-rezzed some things and they added a map to it, which was pretty cool.
They did at least make some tweaks to the iOS version.
The only thing is it controls like shit, like all iPhone games do.
I mean, what a shock, right?
I'm not positive, but that may have been the first game I modded.
I remember an old-ass map editor that you could download that you could make your own maps.
And you could spell fuck out of the walls.
We used to make crazy maps.
We used to make gore mods where we would take a shareware paint editor and just add more blood, add more blood, add more blood.
That was it.
or just have the giant room and put like 50 enemies in the giant... It's all it is, just one giant room.
We used to make mazes out of the moving blocks.
Like just put a ton of moving blocks everywhere.
It was awesome.
Nice.
Kingdom Hearts.
A lot of people are excited about the Kingdom Hearts 3D version or Dream Drop Distance.
Get excited about this.
There's going to be a demo coming out for the 3DS.
That's pretty awesome that Nintendo's embracing those demos a little more.
It is going to be the Traverse Town demo that's already out in Japan.
It's going to be here in North America as well.
No clue when, but hopefully soon.
They also announced some AR cards for that as well.
That's right, huh?
Is that the Nintendo AR cards where you can get the little pictures?
Yeah, it's something that ties in with the game.
What they haven't announced yet is there's going to be a collector's edition.
Is there?
What's the collector's edition going to have?
I have no fucking clue.
Of course there's going to be a collector's edition.
Sticker!
Stickers or something, I'm sure.
No, it's more than stickers.
Theater Rhythm got Silas and stickers.
So I wasn't too far off base suggesting stickers.
Maybe a soundtrack.
I bet a soundtrack.
It could be, yeah.
I don't know.
What's the theme song for Dream Drop Distance?
I have no clue.
I don't know.
They've always just been kind of using the same one from like, was it 1?
They're kind of like doing the score version of 1.
Alright, and moving on into what could soon be the trial of the century with one of gaming's most important people, Beyonce Knowles.
After all, she was the spokeswoman for the DS, not the 3DS, but the DS.
Remember when her and Carrie Underwood were doing those ultra-cute
Hey, girls play games too.
Yeah, how'd that work out?
Well, the DS sold 11 billion units, so I'd say pretty well.
Well, Beyonce told me to buy it, so I have to buy it.
That's right.
I'm not going to play anything Beyonce's not playing.
All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, give me money.
Anyhow, Gate 5, you might remember this company, is suing Beyoncé.
Why are they suing Beyoncé?
Because, remember, Beyoncé was supposed to have, like, there was supposed to be, like, this uber-Beyoncé music game that was going to come out, and Beyoncé said, nope, not gonna work.
Gate 5 apparently said to Beyonce, you continue to negotiate right up until the time you pull the plug.
And the judge said, that's not going to work with me, according to what Beyonce's lawyer said.
So Star Power Beyonce was the game.
Its cancellation resulted in the firings of 70 employees.
And Gate 5 is suing for $100 million in damages, $6.7 million in investment capital, and $100 million in hypothetical profits.
So... Hypothetical.
Hypothetical.
So they're suggesting that they were going to sell...
that's actually not that much that's almost like 200,000 copies I mean that's not too bad essentially what this decision has done is said gate 5 has enough information to proceed to an actual court and it is going to go to court unless of course there's a settlement which usually when things get this far along will inevitably happen and I'm sure all parties are being strongly encouraged to settle but as of right now can you imagine what would have happened to that
All right, moving on, DarkSakura.
Okay, other stuff.
Well, for people who are like me, Hatsune Miku fans, there is a Crystal White Vita coming out that's coming with the Hatsune Miku Limited Edition.
It's a Crystal White Vita with an exclusive rear touch design that has Miku on it.
And it will be shipped on August 30th with the next Project D.Va game.
So that's pretty neat.
and then there's new download content for Dance Central that is sorry Dance Central 2 that will be the Spice Girls Spice Up Your Life
Fuck yeah!
And then Hello Good Morning by Diddy Dirty Money, and Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest, and Florida's Low.
Who cares?
And then, moving on, Marvel's Avengers Battle for Earth will be on Kinect and Wii U, Ubisoft.
So, um, it's, uh, well, interesting.
It's actually being done by Ubisoft Quebec, and you use the motion controls to fight off the Skrull.
Yay.
You know, the whole idea, the whole game idea sounded cool until, you know, they mentioned Kinect, and it's just like, eh, it's not gonna be very good.
Hey, Jamie.
You know they're going to make you do that too.
Exactly.
Hey, let's go to Fugle.
We combine Facebook and Google Plus and we get Fugle.
And that's where we ask you a question every week of our listeners.
And we read your answers live on air.
Alright, so we're going to get to a story here about this $99 Xbox here shortly.
So our question is, how would you feel if the Xbox Next 720 Lube, whatever we're calling it, cost $499, but had a subsidized $299 option for a several year Xbox Gold commitment?
This is something we hypothesized last week when the story first got brought up.
Assuming the specs are all top of the line, is the subsidized console something you would consider buying?
Why or why not?
So would you buy a subsidized next-gen console, assuming it's all the top-of-the-line features you want, say they knock $200 off the price for a two- or three-year commitment for Xbox Gold?
Would you do it?
It would not be that different from what they do for the iPhones, right?
No, it would not.
No, you would not, you say.
No, I said no, it would not, and no, I would not.
No, you would not.
Why wouldn't you?
I wouldn't because I've learned well enough from buying in at launches of all these different consoles and stuff that a lot of launch titles aren't that great, and you're going to deal with all the launch bugs and all that fun stuff.
So if I'm interested in buying a console like that, I'm just going to save up the money that's required to buy outright to begin with.
Because who knows?
If it takes you a long time to save up money, like, say, for example, you know, $499, are you really going to tell me that within two years' time that console isn't going to drop in price?
It's going to fucking drop in price, and you're still paying fucking money for it.
All right.
Well, let's get to some answers from Google+.
First, we have AJ on Google+.
Says, I wouldn't mind.
Sounds like a good deal.
It's like buying a cell phone for the discounted price and a two-year agreement.
Would you really want to buy an Xbox and not want to use it online?
Going to some of the Facebook answers, Tiara W, we love Tiara from Geek Life, geek-life.com says, it would need to be more than just the basic model to make it worth the money.
The $99 360 sounded like a good deal, even with the extra $5 a month for the gold subscription, until I heard it was for the 4GB console.
I can't even put most of my saved games on that little space, let alone save any games to my hard drive.
Very interesting perspective from Doug.
Somewhat similar to what you said, a little bit.
Well, it's just, you know, if I'm going to be that strapped for cash, which I always find a way to buy those consoles at launch because I get excited about it.
But let's just say, you know, I'm strapped for cash and I just can't buy it at launch.
I don't think it's going to be that horrible.
I mean, I've got a console I'm playing tons of games on.
It's just...
You know, not even necessarily, I have, I mean, they're not going to repeat themselves with the whole Red Ring of Death thing.
I mean, they're not that dumb.
And technology's gotten a lot better now.
I mean, the chips are on, you know, we've got like 20 nanometer chips now that run way cooler, way more power efficient and stuff like that.
So, overheating isn't as big of a problem anymore.
And I think that they know that they don't want to do that again because they're just going to lose...
All sorts of, you know, trust in their consumers if they fuck it up again.
So, I mean, I don't think that's really an issue.
But if it's going to be that expensive, though, I just have to see what my options are.
And if there's really something at launch that I have to, have to, have to have, which I don't really know if there's going to be anything at launch that I really, really need.
I'll just have to wait and see what they have.
And also, you know, what it's going to cost.
And if it's something that I can wait...
I can wait and purchase it later on when it goes on sale.
Within a couple years time, you're not going to tell me that you're going to find a used system or something like that.
There's ways to get it cheaper.
Since you're going to be stuck in a contract for multiple years, why would you do that when there's an opportunity to either save up money or just wait for the drop in price?
Alright, well let's check out some different answers.
Picaruno in our chatroom says, or not chat, but Facebook says, to be perfectly honest, fuck yes, if you get a lot of use out of Xbox Live, then it's definitely worth taking the discount on the console.
You do end up paying less overall.
It only works if you get a lot of use out of your console and subscription though, and yeah, the console in question had better be semi-decent too.
But you're not saving money, though.
You're spending $40 more than you would have paid separately.
We're making up a hypothetical situation, so we don't really know, to be honest.
DarkCharger replied and said, This is a very sensible answer, by the way.
Having the option for a subsidized version doesn't bother me, though I would almost always opt for the one-time fee.
The actual value will all depend on the games and features of the unit, along with, hopefully, better reliability on launch.
I pretty much agree with that one more answer from Chiggers we'll read here I say it depends on how much the monthly gold subscription is if that amount times however many months the commitment is more than what it would be if I bought the damn thing straight up then I say fuck you if I don't save any money by doing it that way then why bother
There you go.
If I didn't read your answers, sorry about that.
We had a lot of answers, but send those via email if you feel strongly.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com And I mean, the problem is they got to know what the other company is doing because if they come out and say, okay, our system is $499.
You can get it for $299 and blah, blah, blah.
And Sony's like, well, our system just costs $299, so...
I have to admit, going into that question, I kind of assumed I would be in the camp of, yes, I would just go ahead and do it because I'm going to get the system anyway and I have Xbox anyway.
But I kind of think Doug's answer was right on the money because, you know, I did rush out and buy an Xbox 360.
I was tracking what Best Buy in the area actually had it.
I remember when they were so hard to get when they first came out.
Oh, yeah.
And then I finally was able to get one, but it was the one without the hard drives.
I had to buy the hard drives separately and ended up paying like $40 more.
more, and then the fucking thing died on me after a week.
I was so mad.
Mine didn't die after a week, but yeah, I remember doing that.
So irritating.
Got mine on Craigslist.
Yeah.
Anyway, let's get back into some more gaming news.
Thank you to everybody who answered the Voogle question, whether I read it or not.
All right.
Well, let's talk a little bit about this $99 Xbox.
Of course, it was rumored last week, and it ended up being true.
Microsoft stores are offering it for $99.
Of course, there's a two-year contract, and you're going to pay $14.99 a month for those two years.
So it ends up being about $460, which is roughly $40 more than you would pay separately.
But if that's what you want to do, then you could do that.
and so on.
DarkSakura.com
I bet you're right.
I bet some of them are out of country.
It must be.
I just looked that up real quick.
I seriously think the closest one to us is in Phoenix.
Or maybe there's one in LA.
There is one in LA.
Yeah, but none in Northern California.
Bay Area.
Is there really one in the Bay Area?
Yeah.
Cupertino, I think, has one.
How ironic.
In their mall.
I've been to that mall.
Yeah, I think there's one down there, but that's a close one.
It was probably about 12 years ago, but I've been to that mall.
So, I mean, it could very well happen with the next console.
I think that's what they're testing out.
They're seeing if there's a good response from this.
If that's the case, then they may move forward with GameStop doing something like this or another retailer.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Hell, I mean, I don't know.
You could get some sort of partner deal with AT&T or something.
Who knows?
All right.
Well, a lot of stuff going on in the handheld world in regards to price drops.
The price of the DS has dropped.
Nope, I'm not talking about the 3DS.
I'm talking about the DSi.
For some weird reason, for the longest time, the DSi and the DSi XL had still retained their own old prices.
It cost just as much for a DSi XL as it did for a 3DS.
I know because Alan wanted one for his birth, or no, for Christmas, and I bought him one.
I was like, you want a DSi XL and not a 3DS?
I... But, I mean, the screens on those things really are gorgeous, so I wish they would make a 3DS XL.
I shouldn't say that
Get it for only $99 when you agree to buy 1,000 Nintendo points a month.
DSi is dropping to $100 and the DSi XL is dropping to $130.
Those prices are effective May 20th, so I wouldn't go buy one now.
But that's not a bad deal for a DSi, $100.
They are still pretty good systems.
But I don't know.
I kind of think if you're going to invest, you might as well kick it up to the 3DS.
But maybe you really want something to play your advanced games on.
But the DSi XL is still a pretty good deal.
That's a $50 price drop, by the way.
It was $170.
Now it's going to be $140 because it's going to be $129.99, which is basically $130.
So...
Aquablu 3DS is being discontinued in Japan
now don't feel too bad for it because there's already all these other colors in Japan including black and I think there's like another shade of blue available in Japan too like the more like regular blue but it is kind of interesting that they're getting rid of one of the colors completely I guess especially one of the launch colors but yeah hmm interesting
Maybe it just wasn't selling very well.
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Why did you buy Alan what he wanted?
You should have gotten him what he should have wanted.
I really should do that next time.
Although he was standing with me in the store and I was like, Alright, what do you want for Christmas?
Pick something.
He's like, I want a DSi XL.
Really?
You answered incorrectly!
Zonk!
You chose poorly.
You will now disintegrate.
Not all the news is about the 3DS though.
There's also news about the Vitas in regards to how many they've sold.
1.8 million Vitas sold worldwide.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
It's actually, that's what, 600,000 since late February when they last reported their sales figures, which is 1.2 million.
That's not bad.
It's not incredible, but it's not like the system's dead.
I don't know.
so, alright let's go ahead and move on to the mailbag, every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we'll choose some of your emails to read here live on air a few of them I will start at the beginning, we only had three
Greetings OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
One day and 15 hours left, I've been waiting 10 years for this.
I thought about taking a day off to play, but I can't justify the loss of income.
Hoping it's a rainy weekend.
Diablo and Rain go together.
To pass the time until the release, I'm playing Dead Space 2, which I bought on Steam sale about 6 months ago.
I play at night with my headphones on and a candle lit.
My wife gets a kick out of hearing me yell like a girl.
It's probably the scariest game I've ever played.
Any of you play it?
I'm like Rob with game ADD, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.
Plus, I heard that the end of Boss is mind-blowing.
See you at the Skeleton King.
Serious Turtle.
Love the VOG Network, kiddos.
I have not played Dead Space 2, but I've heard that it's super scary.
Somebody else, Acidic Vampire in the chatroom says, excellent game.
So you have one supporter there in the chatroom at least.
I will be on board with the Diablo 3 train.
I'll be choo-chooing along too.
Yeah, it helps when the Warcraft addicts are all getting it for free.
I know, right?
Next email.
Hey, OLR.
Hey.
Specifically, I should be addressing both Rob and Shane.
What's up with your taste in men?
Kaiden is not that fabulous.
Get off my show.
I ended up taking Ashley on to Mass Effect 2 instead of Kaiden.
I've yet to play 3.
I just feel like there are much better fish in the galaxy.
Also, Shay needs to call in more.
Hearing him always makes me giggle and he's always got something interesting to say even if it's just to call in and say hello with no particular topic in mind.
A show without a call from him just isn't complete for me.
Hard, hard, hard.
Shane has a stalker fan.
Don't inflate his ego, for God's sake.
And you're especially not going to score points.
Can I finish reading, Rob?
No, you're not going to score points when you're dogging on Kaden.
Yes, there's all kinds of homo all up in this email.
Deal with it.
I love you all, Osfer.
I love Dark Tetsuya.
Gay hate mail.
Is this a first on OLR?
Sadly, no, I don't think it is.
This last one is a link, and I'm afraid to follow it.
Alright You're here because one of your friends has invited you Page loading, please wait Uh, no Thank you for spamming us, listener Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says Ash does have some great scenes in Mass Effect 3 She gets fucking smashed Doesn't that happen with See, I'll probably take her because I'm going for full-on lesbian Doesn't that She's not a lesbian romance option, sadly Oh, she might be in 3, I don't think she is though That makes my heart hurt
Oh, there's plenty of people you can les up with if you want.
That's awesome.
Aliens and I will say, I will say this.
Because that was totally me in Dragon Age 2.
There is a, I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say there is a very hot, hot woman, a woman of color in part three that is, she is only a lesbian option.
Nice.
And there's a shower scene.
That's all I'm going to say.
Okay.
Good times.
Okay.
Neat.
And a sitting vampire confirms she doesn't go lesbian.
That's all right.
Save yourself for, I guess I can say, save yourself for trainer.
It's hot.
All right.
Moving on.
Uh, let's get to the FUs of the week.
That was it for emails, huh?
You got a spam email?
Uh, yeah.
Alright.
And the good thing I'm on Linux because they don't make viruses for Linux, really.
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
Every week we get ranty.
Um...
FU, I have a few actually because I'm tired and sore and bitchy.
So FU, as much fun as the Komen walk was, I didn't say that I did that on the show yet, did I?
No.
I did the Komen walk for breast cancer yesterday and apparently since I've started wearing Vibram five fingers and before I was wearing shape-ups, my stride has changed.
I found out that I used to walk on the outsides of my feet.
So when I put on my old shape-ups, because my heel pads for my Vibrams wore out, I'm walking, first of all, we had to park our way from the start of the walk.
So I walk a mile and a half to the, no, a mile to the start, walk the three and a half miles for the walk, walk another half a mile to get to the convention center.
Walking all over the place there and walking back, I have blisters in places on my feet that I've never had blisters before.
I have one on the outside of my big toe, and of course I've got the requisite one on my right heel, which is probably another quarter bigger than a half dollar, if anyone remembers what those look like and how big they are.
And then I have one on my left foot on the bottom of my next to pinky toe.
It's just bizarre, and they're annoying and they hurt.
I woke up this morning in so much pain.
Because I pretty much walked about eight hours, eight, not eight hours, eight miles continuously over the course of two and a half hours.
So, which isn't bad, but, you know.
And so, I was just in all kinds of pain.
And thankfully, my husband let me sleep in this morning.
Dan is, and he woke me up by screaming from the kitchen, Omelette du fromage!
So that woke me up.
I woke up to Omelette du Fromage.
And I've been sore and grumpy all day and I've been sort of snapping at people because I've been too tired to articulate properly exactly what it is that I want to say.
The other one goes towards me losing my voice, which is now going on two weeks and all the signage drainage.
And then I'm just hoping that all of this crap is cleared up by the time I go to Disneyland because I want to go out and have a good time.
So, uh, also, um, FU to, uh, Vibram Speed for being way too expensive for me to get before Disneyland.
Marathon FU segment.
Loki.
Um, I guess FU to my throat being sore.
That's really it.
It's really annoying.
I hate, I hate sore throats.
Scratchy.
Off drop.
Off drop.
FU to the fact.
I tried honey.
That would, that, the sore, it worked for like a minute.
No, that's alright.
I don't want anything.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Friday I went back to work because I had something really important I really wanted to get done and I was feeling a little better but I think because I exerted myself too much I was really sick again yesterday I'm feeling a little better today and I'm hoping by the time I wake up tomorrow I'm all better so I haven't taken my pills and it's time to take my pills and I'm doing alright I'm making it through the show and I'm not as super congested but just go away
Be healed!
And also F you to the fact that our stream apparently went down about five minutes ago and caused a bunch of people to disconnect.
Because that's never good for retaining your listeners.
So I hate when the server fucking burps like that.
Arrgh!
Alright.
Anyhow.
Of course.
Of course.
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the latest Kickstarter campaigns because I have a feeling this is not going to go away anytime soon.
Kickstarter, the place where you can kickstart any franchise that may or may not need to be kickstarted or you may or may not want kickstarted.
Can it kickstart my heart?
Battle Chess!
They're doing a remake for that, which I was completely unaware of, and I thought that series had died off.
Oh no, they want to come back!
And they're going to Kickstarter to fund multiplayer.
And yeah, they're looking for $100,000 for an online experience that includes skill-based matchmaking, statistics and leaderboards, achievements in in-game chat...
and they're $12,000 with 18 days to go.
They're probably not going to make it.
I like Battle Chess.
Too bad.
That was the one where the queen would like flat out chop off someone's head, right?
Yeah, that was awesome.
I might be able to get behind something like this.
Two guys from Andromeda, Space Venture.
It's the guys that created Space Quest.
They're doing a new adventure game.
And it looks...
Rob Paulson Alan McClain I know her from opera
But, uh, she will be in there as well.
And, um... You make it sound like you don't know her as GLaDOS.
So, uh... Chances of this one succeeding, probably pretty good.
You have 30 days left and they're already at a, you know, almost, uh, 115, or, uh, $150,000.
So...
I'm killing the music.
This segment's going on too long.
Sorry, I'm trying to be quick.
No, that's all right.
Another one, Redux, which is a sequel to a game called Dux, which is a 2009 shooter that... Oh, God, I remember that game.
It came out in the Dreamcast.
Yes.
And now they're doing one.
They want to do this new game for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Steam.
And they need $25,000, which...
That's reasonable for a game.
They're definitely going to hit it.
They're already at almost $24,000 and they've got 25 days to go.
There's all sorts of neat rewards for that.
If you're a fan of shooters, it might be something to throw your money at, I guess.
Last but not least, this one's kind of interesting.
Jason Rohrer I hope that's Rohrer
He is putting out a game called Diamond Trust of London.
It's actually a DS game.
It's going to be a retail DS game.
He has the game done.
He just needs the money now to make the cartridges.
Apparently, Nintendo has all these limits or minimums and stuff, and they need $78,000 in order to make... I think it's like... I don't remember how many cartridges they're making.
A thousand cartridges, if not more.
They're already at $53,000 of the $78,000.
They've got 12 days to go.
It may not happen.
And Diamond Trust of London is kind of like a strategy game where it has to do with diamond trading.
It sounded pretty interesting.
I actually watched a little video for it.
Not my type of game, so...
I can't remember what he's worked on, but you would recognize him if you saw him.
So that's it.
That's for the stuff that's on Kickstarter right now.
That's notable, I guess.
Sound like Beat Hazard, which was a great game.
Uh, FTL, which doesn't look very interesting to me, but okay.
I have to go to the next page now.
Um...
Oh, come on.
Because I just thought it was neat because it's kind of related.
I mean, because we've poo-pooed on Kickstarters and I honestly still don't like them.
I don't trust them.
You know, they're... I don't trust them.
Well, we talked about there was one dark side of Kickstarter last week where they, you know, the people had stolen the art from DeviantArt or what have you and...
There's a few actually.
One of the first ones I put money towards, Video Game High School, had their first episode this week.
It was actually pretty cool.
I'm digging that.
It's a neat little web series that they've got going on right now about this high school that basically recruits people that play video games.
It's like video games have taken over the world type thing.
It's really cool.
Okay, so anyways, that guy, he did Passage, which was kind of a browser game that was popular.
It was very minimalistic.
Between was another one that he did.
Sleep is Death, Inside a Star-Filled Sky, and then he has this new one.
But a lot of stuff that's been covered in gaming blogs and stuff like that.
Tadashi Sugiyama, Mario Kart, Pilotwings, F-Zero
is apparently working on a Wii U game which is supposed to be revealed at E3 next month.
And apparently it's one that has not been spoiled in this whole early list or whatever that leaked.
That was all speculated titles.
None of those were actually official.
I see.
So we'll add this to the list of speculation now because apparently he is working on a game that's going to be revealed at E3 next month.
No hints on what it is.
But if you consider that he has worked in the past on Mario Kart, which has been on the 3DS, Pilotwings, which has been on the 3DS, and F-Zero, one of those looks really likely.
It could be a new IP, granted, or, you know, maybe he's been put on one of the other Nintendo IPs.
But that fanboy in me is still a little excited at the possibilities, right?
Am I right?
Am I right?
That would be awesome.
It would be awesome.
I mean, the last F-Zero game was pretty awesome.
Yes.
It was just a long time ago.
It's just that the arcade version was surprisingly weak.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
Nintendo, sometimes they have really brilliant things that come out, and sometimes they have really...
Thanks for watching!
and then they just rehash Animal Crossing again you know it's just like I don't know and sometimes I just wonder but I think that all comes down to it's different development teams some people have it some people don't some people just you know do what they can to get on by
DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
We're going to come up with a topic, and the topic for tonight I'll reveal in just a minute.
And then what you do on this topic is, oh, I'm sorry, you guys here in studio, and we'll have a surprise fourth guest on the phone here in a minute.
What we're going to do on the phone and in studio is come up with our top three answers for this topic.
That's going to leave us a list of 12.
We will then all go around the room and eliminate one from the list, leaving us a list of eight.
And then we will put it to a vote in our chat room for their number one and number two answers.
And after that, definitive process is done.
That's it.
This is the list.
It's a done deal.
There's no arguing.
This is what the gamers demand.
Highly scientific, tested and true over the past ten years.
Am I right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Here it is.
Tonight's listless topic.
Oh, actually, let me get our fourth person on the phone.
Sorry, the whole disconnection of the stream kind of screwed me up here.
It's Comcast.
Apparently.
Yeah, because we were having an issue.
Wanda's having an issue loading a page.
Stupids.
All right, let's try to get our person on the line here.
Hey, is this Shane?
Yeah, holy crap, you're loud.
I need to fix this.
Boo, surprise.
Hey, it's Shane joining us from Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, which can be heard not on the VOG Network yet, but soon.
www.hordehouse.com All about the World of Warcraft.
Right, Shane?
That's actually what I'm playing right now.
I'm playing the Pandaria beta because male pandas got new hairstyles, so clearly I have to take it out for a test drive.
Wait a minute, you're not playing Mass Effect for a change?
Um, I don't always play Mass Effect, just most of the time.
Yes, you do.
Why is it that on the Warcraft show, you're always playing Mass Effect, and now on the general gaming show, you're always playing Warcraft?
I don't understand.
Oh my god, Shane, you're a meme.
I don't know.
I don't always play Mass Effect, but when I do, it's with Kaiden.
Yeah, what?
Oh my gosh, that letter didn't frame my ego.
How could you bash Kaiden?
I have to say, we planned this long before we read that email.
I had no idea that email was in there.
That was a late arriving email.
We already knew Shane was going to be our fourth person tonight for Listless, and then that email comes in, and here you are on the show five minutes later.
What do you want to say to that emailer?
um thank you for inflating my ego but you're wrong about Caden so it's like I don't know I just I can't talk to you all right you ready to play listless with us tonight Shane as long as it doesn't get in the way of playing World of Warcraft yes we'll do our best all right so here's the topic for tonight because everybody's dying to know the topic for tonight E3 Wii U announcement
that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
Now, chatters, if you want to give us your suggestions, you can start typing those in our chatroom at vognetwork.com.
Can't guarantee we're going to use your answers, but if one of us ends up having an answer stolen by another host or something, we tend to look to chatroom for a little bit of help.
So what do you think?
The E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
Let's start with Shane.
What is your number three answer?
Okay, I'm going to have to try to explain this because my writing it out, I didn't do a very good job.
So, my number three would be Nintendo announcing a new F-Zero game utilizing the tablet controller as some sort of future racing control dash thing where you'd press the buttons on the screen to go and brake and stuff.
And then it would have a stand that you could tilt the controller with for tilt controls.
I thought it was neat.
Like now you put the tablet on and you could, because it would be awkward to have the acceleration and brake on the touchscreen while you're trying to like use the crappy controller with the analog nub stick or whatever.
So it'd be tilt controlled.
So it'd be like you're standing on like a console.
I see it on Power Rangers all the time.
That's where I got the idea.
So...
If it's good enough for Power Rangers, it's good enough for Shane.
All right, too bad.
I shortened the answer to New F-Zero Game.
All right.
Fine, whatever.
All right, Loki, what's your number three pick?
All these are going to be kind of similar, except for the last one.
So the first one is going to be a Mario Kart game with track editor.
So it's like Mod Nation Racers with Mario Kart.
Really what everyone wants anyways.
DarkSakura, your number three answer.
and Mario Paint.
A new Mario Paint?
Yes.
Oh, that'd be awesome.
Can I change my answer?
Only if it has the music mode in it.
With the cat meow and the dog barks.
It has to have the Undo Doggy too, so if you make a mistake you can click on his face.
Yes, alright, as long as Undo Doggy's there.
I can actually see that.
I mean, if they don't make a Mario Paint game, I mean, come on.
I agree, they're kind of dumb if they don't make a Mario Party.
I said Mario Party, but they'll probably make one of those too.
Alright, my number three answer.
E3 Wii U announcement that will make me walk to GameStop and pre-order it that day.
My virtual console games still work on it.
OMG.
Because that won't happen.
We all know.
But it would be nice that all that money I invested on the Wii could somehow carry over into the Wii U and I could take that little tablet into my bedroom and play before I go to bed.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?
Shane, your number two answer.
Nintendo announcing multiple colors of the system for launch, especially a blue color.
I will take either a Midnight Blue, a Cobalt Blue, or a Metallic Blue, but not Aqua Blue.
I support Cobalt.
Loki, your number two answer.
My number two answer... I just had something different, too.
Oh, my number two answer would be that that tablet controller could actually be used as a tablet.
DarkSakura, your number two answer Pokemon Snap Wii U
How would the tablet work in Pokemon Snap Wii U?
I would want an augmented reality version.
Is that where you pick your balls?
They could do that.
I think it has a camera on that tablet.
Jamie, you know that there's a 3DS application coming out for Black and White 2 that is Pokemon Snap augmented reality.
Well, I don't have a 3DS.
You need one for it.
It's Pokemon Snap.
Well, send me one, please.
I'm going to Disneyland.
That's more important.
All right.
My number two answer.
I bet I'm stealing DarkSakura's number one answer right here, but I don't even care.
I don't think you are.
I don't even care.
All right.
My answer.
The Guardian Legend Wii U. You're not stealing my number one answer.
But I'm sorry, it's a damn good answer.
If they say, bam, Guardian Legends coming back, I'll be like, pre-ordered, done, sold.
Just give me two.
Alright, so far we have new F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, multiple colors, especially blue, tablet controller is actually a tablet, Pokemon Snap Wii U, and the Guardian Legend Wii U. Let's get to the number one answers.
Shane.
Okay, okay, this is gonna be a complete surprise to everybody.
Are you ready for it?
Mass Effect.
What?
a new Mass Effect game and the tablet would have straps so you could strap it to your arm like an Omnitool and then it would have a control scheme similar to Metroid Prime so you'd have awesome you know Omnitool stuff and you would have a really good control scheme and I don't care if it's 4 or whatever I just would love that you just need Mass Effect in your life somehow being brought to the Wii U always fair enough fair enough
What a shocking answer from Shane.
All right, Loki, your number one answer.
Try not to be shocked, but Excite Truck 2.
I would buy that system.
What a shocking answer.
But if there's one fucking minigame in that goddamn racing game, I will fucking burn that console to the ground.
Is this an official bet?
You will buy a Wii U and set it on fire?
No, I will not waste my money.
But in my mind, that console deserves to burn.
You would imagine really hard and hope you were pyrokinetic.
Alright, DarkSakura, your number one answer.
All of my answers have been like legit and not smart-assy.
So I said DJ Max Technica.
That was going to be my number two.
Because, yeah.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Yeah, I could see that.
And totally doable.
And totally doable.
Okay.
Or at least, at least, a game that's very similar to Elite Beat Agents.
Like an Elite Beat Agents.
Yeah.
Well, actually, yeah, I would say an Elite Beat Agents Technica style.
Do they have multi-touch on that thing?
Because I think it's supposed to be just like the DS screen.
I think it's just like a DS screen.
It's not like an iPhone or anything like that.
Well, then, so if I could make mine, um, uh, Oshita Takai Oendan.
You want to change it from Technica to EBA?
Well, you know, that type of game.
How about Technica or EBA?
Okay.
Well, just honestly, I liked Oendan better than EBA because I thought the cheerleaders were funny.
All right, well, look at all these serious answers here.
My answer is very serious.
My number one answer is very serious, and it is a very practical use of the Wii U technology.
You can have one thing on the television, and you can have one thing on the tablet that sits on your pants.
So my number one answer for my number one game I won...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
anything you're into is available through the various DLC human centiporn if that's what you're into, fine midget porn, go for it
Do you know that old person porn is very popular in Japan now?

World of Warcraft, Wii U, this is Actdeft.
Frisbee says Dreamcast 2.
Going back to an old list list, but unfortunately none of those answers made the list tonight.
One of my other considerations, Rob.
What?
What is a boob game?
Bobby also says automatically allocates 1 million sales of Eye of Judgment I'm afraid that that will never happen Yeah, actually the bet was officially closed a couple years ago too It's just, they're not making it anymore Very sad Alright, so here we go Here we go
Now's the time where we're going to go around and eliminate one answer from the list, and the list as it stands right now.
New F-Zero game, Mario Kart Wii with track editor, or excuse me, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, multiple colors, especially blue, tablet controller is actually a tablet, Pokemon Snap Wii U, the Guardian Legend Wii U, a new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool, Excite Truck 2, DJ Max Technica or EBA, and porn on my pants.
Shane, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Because I don't think Nintendo would get it right, Porn on My Pants.
I knew you would erase that, you ass.
Nintendo doesn't know how to make anything mature, ever.
So, would you want something so terrible as to taint the name Porn on My Pants?
It could be their breakthrough hit.
laughter
I just don't have faith, I'm sorry.
It is stricken from the list, and I'm mad at you forever.
Alright, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Pokemon Snap Wii U, because it's something that they could really just include into a new Pokemon game.
Which they're doing, apparently.
Alright, it is stricken from the list, unfortunately, for DarkSakura.
But DarkSakura, here's your chance for revenge.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
I'm above revenge, Rob.
What are you talking about?
Excite Truck 2?
Because I didn't give a shit about Excite Truck 1 and that's not enough to make me buy one.
That's because you never played it.
I played it.
I didn't care for it.
All right.
Let's see.
Then to be fair, I need to get rid of one of Shane's answers here.
Oh, I'm getting rid of multiple colors, especially blue.
Oh, come on.
Because I actually like the rest of the answers.
And I'm sorry, we need a purple answer.
You know I might get the purple one for my birthday because I can't tell the difference between the color.
So I'll trade in my aqua blue one for that one.
It's going to be awesome.
All right.
So we have narrowed down the list for your voting pleasure.
Here's a recap, and you guys can place your votes.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room at vognetwork.com.
Type slash MSG space S-K-I-E.
My name's Sky.
and your vote.
Your number one and your number two answers.
Here is the list that you can pick from.
New F-Zero game, Mario Kart with track editor, new Mario Paint, my virtual console games work, tablet controller is actually a tablet, the Guardian Legend Wii U, a new Mass Effect game tablet is Omnitool and DJ Max Technica or EBA.
There it is.
We will...
Tally up your votes and have those real soon.
A little later on when we start taking calls.
So that's it.
Shane, anything else you want to talk to us about or say before we let you go?
I don't know.
Probably not.
Alright, well then I guess have fun with pandas.
I will.
Goodbye.
Alright, bye.
Well that should make Shane's one fan very happy that he was there on the show.
Playing listless with us.
BlackWolf is accusing us, by the way, of not enough lols tonight in the match game segment.
Not enough lols.
We did not bring the lols tonight.
Sorry to hear that.
Well, you know what?
We can't be funny all the time.
I spend a lot of my funny... But Loki's funny looking all the time, so... That's true.
DarkSakura, I think we're on right now.
Well, it's just a big pile of shit.
The court in Holland has ordered that a particular Pirate Bay supporter stop publicizing a workaround for the ban that was there.
It's called the Dutch Pirate Party.
They've been publicizing ways to circumvent the ban on Pirate Bay.
and, as reported by the BBC, the judge also said that it ceased offering a proxy service so that Dutch Pirate Bay users could access the torrents without having to link the site.
I mean, not really surprising, you know, they'd try to stop it, but it's more and more people finding a way, but honestly people could find a way around it on their own if they were creative.
and also the group's UK branch is actually offering more of a proxy for the countrywide ISP block.
So, that's it.
The party's campaign officer actually said that they received 2 million hits in over 24 hours.
And, of course, the legal campaign in the UK is being spearheaded by the British Phonographic Institute.
That's old school there.
Europe.
Phonographic.
Phonograph.
Yeah.
and then here's something really funny so people that play Battlefield 3 are having issues finding servers to actually play their game on you know how you pay those online passes and then you can't connect to a game fan-fucking-tastic and so what's ending up happening is apparently you remember that they announced that you can rent servers from EA and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
They went with Prophet.
So, apparently, that's an issue.
And they're saying that, of course, they're going to have... They reserve a percentage of the servers for players who prefer to connect through DICE-hosted servers.
And...
but you know they won't say what percent of that and they're also saying that you know a lot of the servers appear you know unavailable in fact some people are having trouble connecting to a server so long that it's taking them like an hour to connect to a game without having to you know try to connect to one of these private servers which you may or may not get kicked from because you know it's a private server it kind of sucks money first
I know, that's kind of weird.
It's kind of like, sorry, you can't come here because we already rented it out for so-and-so's birthday party.
For that guy who runs MegaUpload.com or whatever his name is, rented everything for his private parole party.
Well, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, they're saying that basically people are looking for just, you know, to play the regular game types without any sort of custom stuff.
And, you know, one guy is saying, I really got kicked from a DICE server.
And it says, you know, but once the rented servers bit took off, I got kicked quite a bit.
And it's damn near impossible to find an official server and that many of the rent servers features are games with server requirements.
I don't want to play Team Deathmatch to 500 kills or Conquest to 700 tickets.
So they're basically saying no, they're not shutting down servers.
But if dice managed servers appear offline, it's because they've been rented and customized by players.
Custom servers have always been extremely popular with Battlefield PC players.
With Battlefield 3, we introduced a custom server program to console gamers.
Response has been overwhelmingly positive.
Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.
But just remember that when you're paying for your online pass for your used game that you're not going to necessarily get online.
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and you might have played Kid Icarus Uprising at this point on the 3DS, and if you haven't, you really should, because it's a good game, except for the whole, your hand will cramp in 20 different ways.
However...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Masahiro Sakurai, who of course is the brains behind it, said, quote, Yikes.
at least they tried to make it so they'd have a ton of replayability on it but I mean I'm sure they're busy with you know Smash Brothers exactly exactly so sadly that will not be coming out anytime soon hey we are going to open up the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio the phones are open so go ahead and give us a call if you want and let us know your thoughts on tonight's news or anything else that you wanted to share we'll get to twitter topics in a minute but first I was going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories so I can tally up these last few uh
listless votes that came in this is kind of funny apparently they have a pre-order bonus for The Amazing Spider-Man coming out in June where you can play as Stan Lee like actually as Stan Lee in the Spider-Man game and of course he has you know some of the powers that Spider-Man has and he is searching or he's hunting down I guess script pages from his next movie or something
And he has witty banter.
Let's go to the phones and take a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's the one and only Ranma.
Of course it is.
How you doing, Ranma?
I'm pretty good.
Alive, but okay.
Should you not be alive?
Did you have a weekend filled with devious things that could have got you killed?
Yes, it's called Staffia Convention where I tweaked my knee.
Touche.
Yes.
Or as I was saying at the end of the rave last night, I was raving like nobody else's business until I took a glow stick to the knee.
When will that meme die?
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Alan's been the one playing it
So, just saying.
I ain't the widow.
Or, I mean, he ain't the widow.
He should sympathize.
I just want to play the main quest.
I don't want to do all the science stuff.
For the record, I do want to say that I found one good surviving remnant of that meme.
What?
I used to think Hawkeye was useless, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
That one was good.
So, Ranma, what did you really call to talk to us about tonight?
I want to talk about this Xbox 360 deal.
It's just something I was thinking about that doesn't kind of make sense, but it kind of does, when you're trying to compare it in a way of a subsidized cell phone.
Now, if you pay $200 for your smartphone, and you have to pay the bill every month, and if you happen to terminate the contract, you have to pay this fee.
Now, let's say...
You don't pay that bill for that month.
They'll let you slide.
Second month, not so much.
They cut the phone off, and the phone is rendered useless.
Now, with Microsoft, you pay $99, and you pay $15 a month.
Now, let's say you don't pay the bill for the first month.
They let it slide.
And you don't pay the bill for the second month.
What's going to happen?
You fight with 360.
We...
You already know that your live account is canceled, but what else is going to happen?
You're going to get a little pop-up to say that you can't play your console unless you pay the bill?
Maybe.
I mean, maybe the technology is not there yet, but it's something that they could implement for the next round of consoles.
I believe there is some type of $299 fee that you have to pay.
You have to pay some type of big fee for the early cancellation, which basically amounts to the rest of the cost of the console on its own, plus the Kinect.
And they would automatically charge it against whatever credit card they have on file for you, or send your ass to collections, for all I know.
Well, yeah, that I do see happening, but I'm just going to be amused at where people are going to start complaining where they forgot to pay the bill.
You get this pop-up with a 360, you cannot play it constantly unless the bill isn't paid.
Please call this number, you know.
Well, think about what this is somewhat modeled after, one could argue, and that is the Blizzard Blood Pack that came out at the end of last year.
If I were to suddenly stop paying my World of Warcraft bill, they would shut off my Diablo 3.
They can do that.
You just shut it off.
Yeah, I can see Microsoft doing where they do this, and you activate your account, like a special extra software gets loaded onto your console where they actually monitor where if you don't pay the bill, that happens.
That sounds like one of those low credit cars where it won't start if you haven't paid the bill.
It's scary, but the next round of consoles could have that technology if they decide to go with this.
Of course, that's a big if, but we'll see.
And somewhere in the corporate offices of Rent-A-Center, they're going, why didn't we think of this?
Why didn't we think of this?
That's all right.
Rent-A-Center still gets to do the televisions and all the stuff that you have to play the video games on.
I had one of those.
Did I tell you that?
No.
You feel like sharing?
Sure.
I wish I still had it, but as a birthday gift when I was 12, me and my great-grandma went to a rental center.
She bought me a 20-inch TV with a built-in Nintendo from Sharp Electronics.
I didn't realize they ever made TVs with built-in Nintendos.
Yep.
Huh.
Okay.
and I had it for years but back in, I believe, 05 I had to sit it out on the side because the tube went and I had paid to get it fixed like twice and it kept going out.
Wow.
Alright.
Are you talking about the C1 NES TV?
What was that?
The C1 NES TV.
I believe so, yeah.
And I think in Japan, Sharp actually had a Super Nintendo, Super Famicom version of that as well.
There was one.
Actdeft in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says Kmart had them.
You know what?
Kmart probably still has them.
If you want to go check it out.
If they did, I will buy one right now because the only place I saw them at the time was Renicenter and where I lived, there was no Kmart.
I keep forgetting those places like Renicenter exist.
Any other last minute stories to cover?
You know Sharp made another thing called the Twin Famicom?
It came out in 1986, only released in Japan, and it's the combination of the Famicom and the disk system in one piece of hardware.
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you need to get a hold of us that way.
Anything else, Loki?
Are we done with last-minute stories?
There's a bonus 25 minutes of Cave Johnson in the DLC for Portal 2.
Good lord, monologues or what?
Yeah, pretty much.
It's all stuff that they recorded, especially for that.
It's brand new stuff.
Oh, wow.
You can listen to it on YouTube.
That's pretty cool that they got him back in to do that.
Yep.
All right, going to a few tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
Eric RPG on Twitter sent us a tweet with a link from this game from the I Want to Be the Guy dev.
Oh, I'd heard about this.
This is like the Castlevania-esque game, isn't it?
I'm looking at the link right now that he sent us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
And I want to say I heard about this.
I just found a Twin Famicom on eBay for $57.
Send us to a link on... Oh, there it is, right here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey Hey Who's this?
What makes you say that?
Well, because of the recent article that was published where
The notable figures such as THQ, Nintendo, even Sega are not even present this year.
So it's kind of like a scare piece in the sense that the lack of these developers are actually going to be a much more lackluster E3 this year.
That's what they're predicting.
Do you think a lot of developers are starting to realize that, and publishers really, in this age of the internet and everything, maybe they don't need E3 anymore?
I mean, I guess I probably beat this subject before, but mobile might be eating at some of these companies, like Nintendo in particular.
Well, and Facebook games... Zynga's showing for the first time this year.
What was that?
Zynga's showing for the first time this year.
But, I mean, most of their games are going to... I mean, they're going to... Yeah, you're right.
They're going to be all browser-based, but...
I guess it goes beyond what we typically expect from the developers and the folks that make console games.
I guess it's kind of like branching out from the old guard.
It's an evolutionary shift in gaming.
I don't think consoles will ever die out because there will always be a market for those AAA titles.
However, you're going to see another emerging in the form of casual through either mobile or browser-based.
So this is where, you're right, Zynga and any other small and mobile publisher can make inroads, you know, due to the fact that these...
These big, heavy hitter developers are no longer showing up this year.
Or sitting out E3.
Exactly, and in the next, I think I remember mentioning this before, but in a couple of years, the next two to three years, it might actually have like parity.
I mean, you're going to get to the point where they're going to converge, where both your Vitas and your 3DSs are going to converge against whatever Apple's offering, whatever is being offered, whatever high-end Android phone will still be out there.
and whatever other platform, you know, tells the law.
You know, if you're a parent out there looking to get a portable game console for your kid to, like, shut him up on long car rides or whatever, you gotta admit, you put a Vita next to an iTouch, which is just the iPhone without the phone, and they're about the same price, and yet the games on one are 99 cents.
Right.
And even then, it's like, you know, when you throw in the iPad in there, you let your kid use, you know, your iPad, that pretty much, like, you know, keeps them distracted at that point.
Ah, but Shadow Next Gen, hold on, Shadow Next Gen in our chat room has a good point.
iOS games will never be as good as core games as long as they rely on those virtual controls.
Now, an 11-year-old probably doesn't care, but true for the college gamer and even high school gamer and so forth, they're going to care a little more.
Right.
They are, that is true, but, you know, and the way I see it is this, in the next few years, physical buttons may not be, you know, may not be as prevalent in a new platform, as long as they get the tactile feel down to it.
I know it's going to be a growing thing, but think about it.
I mean, the next evolution besides hardware will have to be some sort of virtual control, something that isn't there, but you touch it and it does something.
but it's a lot better.
It's either on parity with the hardware button or has more of a natural feeling.
Zaku, before we let you go, what do you think will be the biggest shocker out of E3 this year?
Well, I mean, Wii U is definitely not in the cards.
I'm thinking whatever Microsoft has up their sleeve and yeah, not even Sony.
I don't even think because as I said, it's
There isn't a lot of buzz going around of what actually might steal a show at E3.
Who knows?
It could be some other browser-based developer.
It could be a mobile developer creating something for multiple platforms that will create a hit.
Like Rovio, for example, they're trying to branch out beyond Angry Birds, create a new franchise.
So that might be something as an example, but
I think Microsoft might have something up their sleeve.
I wouldn't put it past me that they're actually going to reveal the success of the 360 or at least hint to it.
We'll see.
That's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but we'll see.
All right, Zach, I'm going to let you go.
Take care, buddy, okay?
All right, have a good one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
the bigger locations will still carry PSP games as well as the website GameStop.com so chances are if the GameStop near you is small and doesn't have a lot of shelf space they were probably one of the 25% that got rid of them alright doesn't look like our phone line is lighting up and it's getting to be about 9 o'clock here on the west coast so I'm going to go ahead and close that up and we need to get to listless results you guys ready for listless results because it's very interesting tonight let's do it let's get to them
New F-Zero Game
and New Mario Paint.
There you go.
Those are the number three things you most want to see on the new Wii U that will make you go pre-order it that day.
A new F-Zero game and a new Mario Paint.
Here is the number one answer.
We had two answers tie for number one.
The tablet controller is actually a tablet.
Good luck with that, you guys.
I know.
It's not going to ever happen.
And lastly, Mario Kart with Track Editor is number one.
Double win for moi.
Look at that, a double win for Loki.
Has that ever happened in the history of List?
I don't know.
So there it is.
Number one tied, Mario Kart with Track Editor.
Tablet Controller is actually a tablet.
And number three tied, new F-Zero game and new Mario Paint.
Crazy ties tonight.
But the fans have spoken.
Mario Kart, Mario Paint, F-Zero, bring them, and a free tablet.
Well, that is going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
