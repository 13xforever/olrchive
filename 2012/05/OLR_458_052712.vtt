00:00.000 --> 00:19.780
Tonight, May 27th, 2012, a new Star Wars game is set to be unveiled.

00:19.780 --> 00:25.340
After weeks of speculation, 38 Studios shuts its doors, and a major game publisher is sued

00:25.340 --> 00:31.680
for fraud.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.240 --> 00:40.280
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about

00:43.280 --> 00:48.040
video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, with my co-host here in studio.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.040
Welcome back tonight, the one and only Dark Sakura.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
Hi.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.800
Boy, you missed a fun show last week.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.800
No, I didn't because I was eating at Bucket of Meat.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.480
I guess that is a little better, but we'll talk more about that in a minute.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.680
Yeah, I was very sad though.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.320
I sent you my support from afar as I was eating barbecue chicken.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.680
Now, for those that don't know what Bucket of Meat is, dot, dot, dot.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.720
It is the Big Thunder barbecue restaurant at Disneyland.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Of course.

01:10.720 --> 01:17.680
Where it's like 30 bucks a head and you get all you can eat meat, like beef ribs, sausages,

01:17.680 --> 01:25.240
chicken, cornbread, coleslaw, beans, and they all come in these big shiny, well not kind

01:25.240 --> 01:30.320
of shiny, but big iron buckets, which a couple of people ran off with one.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.560
Are you a fan of finding big sausages at Disneyland?

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
Oh yes.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
Oh yes, Rob.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.900
All right, also say hello, joining us tonight, to Tech Master Loki.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.720
That sounds like a Southern Brazilian barbecue.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.160
It kind of does a little bit, but Brazilian barbecue is amazing.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.680
Oh, I don't know though.

01:48.680 --> 01:49.680
Cornbread could make it better.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.680
You know what?

01:50.680 --> 01:54.640
Well, they did, they did have cornbread, but they also, the people there on the stage performing

01:54.640 --> 01:57.000
did You Got a Friend in Me, all kind of blue grassy.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh, how fun.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It was great.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
All right.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.080
Um, we're going to go around and talk about how our weeks were in video games, but first

02:04.080 --> 02:07.900
I want to start off tonight talking about what happened last week because the podcasties

02:07.900 --> 02:10.800
are sitting here going, wait a minute, Dark Soccer was on the last show.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.880
There just, there wasn't a show on the feed last week.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.320
I also have to say one thing for GOVDA.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.240
The place did have vegetarian options.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.800
They had a skewer with peppers and vegetables and tofu.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.200
Well, isn't that special?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
It was delicious.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
All right.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
Anyhow, off food on show.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.760
I'm just saying it's cool that they have vegetarian options, but I mean it's bucket of meat.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.640
If it was bucket of salad, I wouldn't be touching the place.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.840
Same if I was a vegetarian and I went to a place that's called bucket of meat, probably

02:36.840 --> 02:37.840
wouldn't be my thing.

02:37.840 --> 02:38.840
All right.

02:38.840 --> 02:39.840
Look, last week's show.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.800
So live, we were here last week live and no, this is not a case of me being lazy and not

02:44.800 --> 02:46.000
updating the podcast feed.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Here's what happened.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.960
We were live, we were doing a show and while we were in the middle of the classic game

02:51.960 --> 02:55.740
of the week segment, which as you know, is always at the end of the first half, the power

02:55.740 --> 02:56.980
went out completely.

02:56.980 --> 02:59.000
The power shut off in the apartment.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.120
It wasn't just my place.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
It was the whole unit.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.080
It was the whole stretch.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.920
We still don't know to this tonight what caused the issue.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.440
But unfortunately what happened is that it caused the live listeners got to hear at least

03:10.440 --> 03:16.480
half a show, but because we were unable to retrieve the MP3 from backup, which, you know,

03:16.480 --> 03:18.720
if you want to get technical, it's not really an MP3.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.500
It's a raw Adobe audition file, but it was all wrong.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.200
Like it's just, it was, it was too much to be able to fix and props to Travis from other

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
station life.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
He tried to fix it.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.920
He tried to go in and move the little packets that were out of order, but he said after

03:32.920 --> 03:36.280
about 10 minutes worth of show, he gave up and I don't, I don't blame him.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.060
I don't have the patience for that either.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.080
So that's like trying to like knit something.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.560
So unfortunately last week's show is gone.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.240
So we want to catch you up a little bit on what you missed last week.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.920
So last week we were joined here in studio by Flaco Jones, who you might know if you

03:51.920 --> 03:56.080
listen to Hoard House, he's the number one fan of Hoard House, my Warcraft show, but

03:56.080 --> 03:58.760
I don't think he'd been on OLR.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.520
He certainly had not never gone on as a host before.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.500
I don't think he'd even been on as a guest in a very long time.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.880
He talked a lot about his days working at Konami and some of the stuff he got to beta

04:06.880 --> 04:11.320
test who has a league tester on the winks games, which I'm really sad.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.560
That's that was, that was the part of the show you have that raw file.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
I do.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.160
And it's like, that's the part of the show I might have to stream together and put on

04:19.160 --> 04:20.160
Twitter.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.340
So you guys can hear, you should just send it to me and maybe I'll, yeah, we'll see.

04:23.340 --> 04:27.040
But that's a, Oh man, that's the part of the show you really have to hear if anything else.

04:27.040 --> 04:32.880
But there's a couple important revelations that came up last week too, that for the OLR

04:32.880 --> 04:36.720
continuity, cause believe it or not, this show has a storyline over the past 10 years.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
It's very important.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.040
You understand one of the discussions we had last week, so we're going to rehab it a little

04:41.040 --> 04:42.340
bit here tonight.

04:42.340 --> 04:48.400
So Loki, how was your gaming week last week that no doubt spills into this week?

04:48.400 --> 04:53.300
I play a lot of Minecraft.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.500
A lot of Minecraft.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.560
As did I.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.080
A lot of Minecraft.

04:58.080 --> 05:03.160
As in every night I signed onto Xbox, Loki, OLR is playing Minecraft.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.080
And I'm very sad when I see you sign on and you're not playing Minecraft.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.920
Because I'm playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer usually.

05:09.920 --> 05:14.640
But here's the deal, as you guys know, a few months ago on the show, we talked about, you

05:14.640 --> 05:17.520
know what, we tried Minecraft.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
We don't get it.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.720
I don't, you know, it's cool.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.440
For those of you that are into Minecraft, it's cool.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.460
But for us, we don't understand.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.740
All hell broke loose when the 360 version came out.

05:25.740 --> 05:33.000
Because for me, it was about, Oh, there's a tutorial mode that is explaining the point.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.760
This game now has a point.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.200
And I just, once I kind of was able to get the basic parts down, and plus it's important

05:40.200 --> 05:45.280
to note that the 360 version really simplifies crafting and da da da da da, once I understood

05:45.280 --> 05:47.880
all that, I was like, okay, I'm into this.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.720
And Loki, I'm imagining it's a similar thing for you.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
Yeah, pretty much.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.680
It's just, you know, I went through part of the tutorial, not even the whole tutorial,

05:54.680 --> 05:58.680
just like the very basic stuff and then once I figured out, okay, this is how I craft stuff,

05:58.680 --> 06:04.480
this is how you do this, this is what this is for, okay, I'm just gonna start my own

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
world.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.480
Yeah.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.480
But you know what?

06:07.480 --> 06:08.480
What?

06:08.480 --> 06:09.480
Tacos.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.480
Yeah.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.800
Dark Sakura is yet to try Minecraft on the 360 and she has not been turned yet, but we're

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
working on her.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.360
You know what, if I have to pay for it, probably not.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.560
Well, there's a free one on PC, technically, but anyway, we won't go there.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.560
We won't go there.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
I played the PC one.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
There's the trial.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
But anyway, anyway.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.960
Um, so what you need to know, Loki and I are both now really, I mean, Loki more so than

06:28.960 --> 06:31.120
me, both really into Minecraft.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.920
Bobby Blackwell's a part of this too.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.160
He's, I mean, I visited his world, he visited mine, we're both in Loki's world.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.160
Which is...

06:38.160 --> 06:41.040
By the way, you really do need to visit the southern part of the map.

06:41.040 --> 06:45.520
See, we're playing on the same seed, so, you know, but you need to visit, the southern

06:45.520 --> 06:47.720
part of the map is friggin' awesome.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.420
Now here's another important comparison I brought up last week that the podcast-y folks

06:51.420 --> 06:55.920
didn't get to hear, because we realize there's been a lot of slammin' on the 360 by the PC

06:55.920 --> 06:58.600
fans because it's not as advanced.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.600
It's based on an earlier version of the game.

07:00.600 --> 07:05.080
And the other big, big, big one I hear is the finite size of the map.

07:05.080 --> 07:09.920
Is only, what, 1024 by 1024, which for me is big enough, I got enough to work with,

07:09.920 --> 07:13.880
but I understand where the PC fans, especially if you're playing a bunch of people on one

07:13.880 --> 07:19.700
of those servers, really feel a little constricted by the map size, although they say they might

07:19.700 --> 07:20.700
change it on Xbox.

07:20.700 --> 07:25.640
But the comparison I made is I said, well, you've got Civilization IV, Civilization

07:25.640 --> 07:28.160
V on the PC, it's kind of a complicated game.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.440
It's a hard game to jump into and just learn and kind of figure out all the facets of it.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.560
But on the consoles a few years ago, they made a console version of it called Civilization

07:36.560 --> 07:41.040
Revolution, which really kind of, for lack of a better term, dumbed it down.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.760
And they didn't make it a bad game.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.240
It actually is a really fun game.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.640
It's a good way to get a Civ fix really quick when you don't have hours and hours and hours

07:48.640 --> 07:54.660
to play Civ V, because Civ V can go for hours and hours and hours.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.200
But Civ Rev is a really good way to kind of get a quick fix.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.660
So I enjoyed both games, and I think that's where I'm at with Minecraft now.

08:01.660 --> 08:06.040
Because of me getting into the 360 version, Alan has been obsessed with the PC version

08:06.040 --> 08:07.040
lately.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.920
I mean, well, I see, just as like kind of getting ideas, one of the first things I did

08:10.920 --> 08:17.520
after I built a few things was, okay, what are cool things I could build on the 360 version?

08:17.520 --> 08:22.160
So a bunch of internet searches on YouTube, well, just YouTube searches and stuff.

08:22.160 --> 08:27.120
And it just kind of bookmarked a bunch of things that I want to make.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
And so I did that.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.880
But there's a lot of cool mods, like industry craft and stuff like that, that you could

08:30.880 --> 08:36.460
build machines that'll do mining for you, and like ridiculous stuff like power drills

08:36.460 --> 08:41.000
and like batteries and piping and all sorts of crazy stuff.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.420
But I mean, it's really cool, and I hope they implement.

08:45.420 --> 08:49.080
Within the next week, I want to go back and give another game a try that I originally

08:49.080 --> 08:52.480
kind of, I didn't really diss it on the show, but I just kind of gave it a review of I Don't

08:52.480 --> 08:54.120
Get It, LOL.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.000
And that's the game Terraria.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.760
Because supposedly that's the 2D Minecraft.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.840
So now that I get Minecraft, I'm going to try Terraria again and I'll let you guys know

09:02.840 --> 09:05.920
next week how that goes, because that's something else I want to explore.

09:05.920 --> 09:12.440
By the way, since we did Bring It Up, Civ 5 is on sale on Steam today for $7.49.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.440
Thank you.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.920
And I was going to actually call that out from our chat room, which I have yet to mention.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
Sorry, guys.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
Vognetwork.com.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.760
I just want to get you caught up on last week.

09:19.760 --> 09:24.080
Vognetwork.com, it's right there on the page, is the chat room.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.640
And we have Act Deft giving the FYI on that as well.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.320
And Civ 5 for $7.49, that's a steal.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.480
That's an absolute steal.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.200
They're pushing that expansion pack coming out in a month, I bet, but I love Civ 5.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.200
It's totally worth it.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.040
Well, my friend's been playing it on Xbox.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.120
Becky's husband.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.440
There is no Civ 5 on Xbox.

09:40.440 --> 09:44.160
You must be thinking Civilization Revolution, which is the game I mentioned a minute ago.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
But I've been watching that and it actually was pretty cool, except you know, that's totally

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
not my thing.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.320
Just like Minecraft 360, it's a good way to get your feet wet with the series.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.320
All right.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.820
Other things you might have missed last week.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.900
We had an exclusive story, but we're going to repeat that at the top of tonight's show,

09:56.900 --> 09:59.040
so we'll come back to that in a minute.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.560
You guys missed a lot last week.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.800
And there was also the Classic Game of the Week, just for housekeeping purposes.

10:05.800 --> 10:11.420
We decided because Jim was not able to finish his Classic Game of the Week, we're not going

10:11.420 --> 10:14.520
to have that officially be the Classic Game of the Week.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.280
We are going to invite him back on the show, whenever he wants to come back as a fourth

10:18.280 --> 10:20.880
host even, and let him finish what he started.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.240
Jamie said she would kindly give over the Classic Game of the Week segment, whatever

10:24.240 --> 10:27.600
week he comes back, so he can finish what he started that night.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.160
So just, and if you didn't, if you don't know what the Classic Game is, well I have to leave

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
some suspense.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.120
So you'll just have to figure it out in a later week.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.480
I think that was about it.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.520
I think that was all the stuff that came up last week that was important and worth mentioning.

10:41.520 --> 10:47.800
So let's get into, how was your gaming, oh, VOG Network, I want to say really quickly

10:47.800 --> 10:50.320
about VOG Network.

10:50.320 --> 10:56.720
Friday night, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern, the next phase of VOG will be revealed.

10:56.720 --> 11:03.440
Yes, I'm teasing a teaser, but I think if you guys are really interested in what we're

11:03.440 --> 11:07.280
up to and what the full vision is here, and I know there's a lot of people out there that

11:07.280 --> 11:12.560
still have questions like, why did you leave where you were at before just to do yet another

11:12.560 --> 11:13.840
radio network?

11:13.840 --> 11:18.520
There's more to it than a radio network and some of that is going to be unveiled on Friday,

11:18.520 --> 11:19.740
so I'm really excited about that.

11:19.740 --> 11:25.240
So again, Friday, 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern right here at vognetwork.com.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.920
We're supposed to have an interview at 6.30 tonight and I teased that on the Twitter a

11:28.920 --> 11:29.920
little bit.

11:29.920 --> 11:35.300
Her name is Susan, she's with the website hackedonxbox.com and we're going to talk a

11:35.300 --> 11:40.160
little bit about what, she's basically the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week

11:40.160 --> 11:46.200
and I say that with love, I love Nancy Drew, but she really got down to the bottom of what

11:46.200 --> 11:53.720
is really going on on Xbox 360 with what they're not calling Xbox hackings, but Xbox jackings

11:53.720 --> 11:56.680
and we'll talk a little bit about the difference and why that is.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.320
Hopefully we get her on the show here in 10 minutes, unfortunately just, we don't see

12:01.320 --> 12:05.480
her, it's kind of like that interview we had two weeks ago where the dude disappeared for

12:05.480 --> 12:06.480
a little bit.

12:06.480 --> 12:11.500
I haven't heard from her on Twitter or Skype today, these things happen, especially because

12:11.500 --> 12:14.920
her piece got picked up by a lot of the big gaming blogs.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.040
She might just be very popular and in demand right now, so we're going to see if we can't

12:19.040 --> 12:20.040
get her on.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.640
If we can't, we'll just roll it over to a later week when she can come on, but we'll

12:23.640 --> 12:25.320
check in with you guys in 10 minutes.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.640
Alright, for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.780
DarkSakura, you've been out for a week, how was your gaming weeks?

12:29.780 --> 12:32.320
I've actually played stuff.

12:32.320 --> 12:38.040
Played lots of things, although I still haven't played Mass Effect, I'm very sorry.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.240
I played a lot of Portal 2 while I was out.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.000
I've been playing Words with Friends because I figured since I already paid for it, Zynga

12:46.000 --> 12:48.360
already got my damn money.

12:48.360 --> 12:53.240
And honestly, while I'm at work, it's kind of something I can keep up with Dan, so I've

12:53.240 --> 12:55.760
been keeping up with that.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.680
I did try to play Draw Something, but I'm using the free version just because I want

12:58.680 --> 13:00.360
to see what all the fuss is about.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.800
It's cute, I like it.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.360
I am playing, I started playing a lot more fractal.

13:08.360 --> 13:17.160
In fact, if you look on my Facebook fan page for Jamie Summers, I posted a screencap of

13:17.160 --> 13:19.120
what fractal looks like.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.160
And I'm going to be actually showcasing a different game on Steam that I'm playing so

13:23.160 --> 13:25.320
that everyone can see what it is.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.080
I'm going to be starting Fallout New Vegas again, just starting over from scratch.

13:29.080 --> 13:33.260
I've been playing Droplets, I got Droplets on iPhone, which is kind of weird and not

13:33.260 --> 13:35.560
as fun as playing it on Steam.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.400
And I've played some WoW, but I've really been playing Diablo 3.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.320
I played a crap ton of it last night.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.680
And I was like, you know what, this is like playing Ragnarok online without people.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.560
This is great.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.560
So I've really been getting into Diablo.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.520
Because it was free, because I signed over the blood pact.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.120
It was free with a big footnote.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
Yeah.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.440
Well, as you saw, when I told my friend on Facebook that it was free, he said, great

14:02.440 --> 14:05.440
Hal, Dan said she signed her life away.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
For a year.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.440
For a year.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.880
Which, you know, was what, a third over?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.680
So it's not bad.

14:11.680 --> 14:19.760
But yeah, I think everyone's playing Diablo, because I'll log on to WoW and say, hey, where's

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
all my peeps at?

14:20.760 --> 14:26.160
And they're all on Diablo, and whatever.

14:26.160 --> 14:30.600
And then I've been playing some more Puzzle Bobble again, best move.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.400
Because I really love that game, and it's really great to play when...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
I don't know what it is, but when I'm sick.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.280
And I'm over my cold, guys, I just sound like I'm on the tail of it.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.560
But I slept for two days.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.140
It was glorious.

14:43.140 --> 14:46.320
I was really sick two weeks ago, you might remember, and I'm still coughing.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
I'm still having coughing.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
People at my work.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.280
And see, I had that sinus attack.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.900
And then I had it bad at Disneyland.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.800
And then I came back to a full blown cold.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
I ran a fever.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
You know what I just remembered?

14:55.800 --> 14:57.920
I have coffee brewing in the kitchen.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
Bye.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
Yes, you do.

15:00.920 --> 15:07.880
Anyway, so when I'm sick, it's like I don't really have this mental focus.

15:07.880 --> 15:13.640
However, I think when my brain shuts down, I become really fantastic at puzzle games.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.360
And that was like clearing out levels on Fractal that I had never been able to pass before.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.000
And for anyone, it's not an easy game.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.880
It really is not very easy, because you've got so much to keep in mind with the direction

15:25.880 --> 15:27.520
of how your little things move.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.200
But I still tell everyone, get Fractal, it is worth the money.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.640
It is such a fun game.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.040
Again, it's called Fractal, make blooms, not war.

15:37.040 --> 15:43.080
And I hope that they pay me for my sponsorship, because I am doing that for free.

15:43.080 --> 15:51.400
And then I'm also supposed to be sitting down, because our friend loaned us the Street Fighter

15:51.400 --> 15:52.880
cross Tekken.

15:52.880 --> 15:58.320
And I'm kind of afraid to try it, because I do not want to play against the Mega Man.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.800
But I'm thinking about it, so meh.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.640
Did you play anything other than Minecraft?

16:04.640 --> 16:08.720
I play Minecraft, lots of Minecraft.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.120
Let's see, what did I do this week in Minecraft?

16:11.120 --> 16:13.280
I think I finished my rail system.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.080
Now we mentioned it on Bobby's show, but I don't think we mentioned it here.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.420
Your Minecraft level is intricate.

16:18.420 --> 16:22.120
You built a tunnel underneath the ocean, I don't even know how the hell you did that,

16:22.120 --> 16:23.240
or underneath a lake.

16:23.240 --> 16:27.640
You built a tunnel under the lake, and you have a glass ceiling on said tunnel, so that

16:27.640 --> 16:29.660
you can look up and see the water.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.440
And you built this entire tram system.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.600
He built the deep run tram.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
He did.

16:35.600 --> 16:42.800
So when we are talking that Loki started playing Minecraft, we're not fucking around.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.960
He is really into Minecraft.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.600
And what's great is when I go into Loki's world, I can hear Nellie laughing in the background

16:49.600 --> 16:51.860
whenever something stupid happens.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.760
So she's got to be into this a little bit too, right?

16:53.760 --> 16:55.260
She's not into it at all.

16:55.260 --> 16:58.600
She keeps asking me, aren't you sick of this game yet?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.420
What's the point of this game?

17:01.420 --> 17:03.420
And I'm just like, there is no point.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.920
It's just like Legos.

17:04.920 --> 17:05.920
But yeah.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.920
It's Legos.

17:06.920 --> 17:07.920
For men!

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
And girls.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.000
I have been playing Minecraft more than Call of Duty this week.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.980
I did play Call of Duty though.

17:12.980 --> 17:19.140
We finally got to check out the new, well they're maps technically for the new game

17:19.140 --> 17:22.800
type face off, however you can use them for anything.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.200
So we've been playing on them for just our deathmatch maps since we only have like two

17:27.200 --> 17:30.040
to four people usually playing at a time.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.440
Well three to four people.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.500
But you know, it's perfect for what we use it for.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.800
So we've been actually enjoying those quite a bit.

17:39.800 --> 17:47.140
However one of the new maps, Ground, it's quite apparent that the spawn points in there

17:47.140 --> 17:49.160
aren't that random.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.900
And like there was one time I literally, I killed somebody and they spawned again right

17:52.900 --> 17:53.900
in front of me.

17:53.900 --> 17:57.500
So I knifed them to death and then they spawned again right in the next room.

17:57.500 --> 18:02.720
It's like wow, that's pretty close.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.160
See other things, well let's go back to Minecraft.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.840
So the first thing I did in Minecraft this week is I explored the whole map, or as much

18:08.840 --> 18:13.800
of the map as I could because I was looking for a spot to dig with dynamite.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.800
And that's what I did.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.240
Because I duped a bunch of dynamite and that kind of stuff.

18:17.240 --> 18:23.120
We also made a portal to the Nether and went there and I got my glowstone and my, I don't

18:23.120 --> 18:24.120
remember what it's called.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.940
It's the dirt that's all in the ender that you can set on fire and that will burn forever.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.400
So that's kind of cool.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.960
And there's some other like sand, soul sand or something that makes people walk slow.

18:33.960 --> 18:38.140
I don't really know what the point would that be for.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.440
So I have that.

18:39.440 --> 18:46.180
And then, oh so I started digging with dynamite and I did that and unfortunately I did make

18:46.180 --> 18:50.800
it all the way down to the bedrock but I got killed by lava many, many, many times.

18:50.800 --> 18:57.200
So I decided to go ahead and build a roof over the top of the giant hole that I made.

18:57.200 --> 19:01.280
So I did that and now it's a glass top roof so you can walk over it and see this giant

19:01.280 --> 19:03.840
hole all the way down to the bedrock.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.520
And I'm slowly hollowing it out for I don't know what purpose.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.520
I'm just doing it right now.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.520
You should fill it with candy.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.520
They don't have candy.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.040
I can't fill it with candy yet.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.400
That's why Minecraft isn't a 10.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.400
It's only about a nine.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.360
You should fill it with whatever those things that try to kill you are.

19:18.360 --> 19:23.720
There's no, there's no, um, there's no coffee and there's no candy, but there are, well

19:23.720 --> 19:24.720
see you're Jewish.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.040
I was going to say there are pork chops, which is pretty exciting, but, oh yes, there is

19:28.040 --> 19:29.040
cake.

19:29.040 --> 19:33.160
Fill it, fill it with cake, fill it with cake and sheep.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.320
Like throw sheep down the hole.

19:34.320 --> 19:39.400
You apparently can, however, I don't know if you've noticed, if you pick up an egg,

19:39.400 --> 19:41.560
have you tried throwing an egg?

19:41.560 --> 19:42.840
It'll create a chicken.

19:42.840 --> 19:43.840
Does it really?

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
No, I didn't try that.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.760
You throw an egg, it creates a chicken.

19:46.760 --> 19:52.840
So I've seen an actual video where someone took eggs, well see they probably didn't dupe

19:52.840 --> 19:55.960
them like I would, but okay, let's say I duplicate all of them.

19:55.960 --> 20:02.080
So I have stacks of 64 eggs and you put that in one of the dispensers, you maybe put those

20:02.080 --> 20:06.520
in like say 10 dispensers or whatever, and you turn them all on and then all of a sudden

20:06.520 --> 20:11.920
you have hundreds of chickens, which then I can automate a system to kill all of those

20:11.920 --> 20:12.920
chickens.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.040
Wait, are you talking about an automated death machine for chickens?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.460
Yes, I've actually thought of that.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.460
Nothing is safe.

20:20.460 --> 20:25.360
I've thought of that for the pigs, but, and I actually built a trap to catch the pigs,

20:25.360 --> 20:31.280
but it doesn't seem to work too well because they, when you sleep or whatever, the animals

20:31.280 --> 20:37.400
respawn and they don't get, they don't stay in the pen that I made, which is kind of lame.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.920
But yeah, then Bobby helped me dig out.

20:40.920 --> 20:46.400
See basically I dug down in that initial cave system that I found until I got to the furthest

20:46.400 --> 20:51.520
point away, and then I dug straight up into, he's all, you know you're digging into the

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
ocean dude.

20:52.520 --> 20:57.440
I'm like, eh, we'll worry about that when we get to it, and so we did.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.240
And ended up, it was kind of cool, I started by digging a hole up through the top.

21:01.240 --> 21:08.000
Swam to the top, and then basically built a barrier around where my staircase was, and

21:08.000 --> 21:12.100
you know, if you fill it in with anything, dirt or whatever, and then you dig it back

21:12.100 --> 21:13.720
out again, the water's gone.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.720
So that's how I did it.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.840
I just dug to this, I basically created a stack, boxed it all in and filled it in and

21:19.840 --> 21:20.840
dug it back out again.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.760
And that's how I got a thing through the ocean.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.760
Tacos.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.600
And then I tried putting a glass top ceiling in one of the caves, you know, under the ocean.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.240
And I kept drowning myself, though, when I did that, so I said, eh, fuck that, I'm not

21:32.240 --> 21:33.240
doing that.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
Now, at least.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.240
So that's what I did.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.600
I also played Pocket Edition, Pocket Edition's pretty fun.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
More Minecraft.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
My gaming week.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.480
I didn't play a lot of new stuff, mostly because I've been content playing Diablo 3.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.660
Mass Effect 3's got a big multiplayer thing going on this weekend, and I don't know what

21:50.660 --> 21:56.080
made me think I would even remotely possibly hit that goal of promoting three people during

21:56.080 --> 21:59.960
the weekend, but, you know, I thought I'd try.

21:59.960 --> 22:04.840
And yeah, I don't think I've really played a lot else other than that in Minecraft.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.000
A little bit of Minecraft, too, not as much as Matt.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.080
And the stuff I build isn't nearly as intricate, but I'm just lucky if I can kind of get down

22:12.080 --> 22:14.360
to finding lava without getting killed.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.400
I think I'm going to try playing a little more often in peaceful mode.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
All right.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.800
So here's the part where I'm going to get judged by some people, and I'm going to get

22:21.800 --> 22:24.400
congratulated by others.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.400
I bought an iPad.

22:25.400 --> 22:30.000
Yeah, I bought one of the new iPads, and, you know, I wanted one.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.240
I'm really not going to give you any better reason than that.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.240
I wanted one.

22:33.240 --> 22:38.720
I'm in a slightly different position at work now where I might be doing some more travel-oriented

22:38.720 --> 22:42.840
things again, and I thought the iPad would come in very handy for that because my laptop

22:42.840 --> 22:46.880
is kind of getting a little bit old, and there is some stuff you can do with an iPad, and

22:46.880 --> 22:49.960
some of that does include remote taping and broadcasting a podcast.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.400
I've thought of that, too.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.840
But in the meantime, before I get to all that busy, busy work stuff, I'm doing fun stuff

22:54.840 --> 22:56.920
on the iPad, like playing games.

22:56.920 --> 23:03.440
And one of the games that I got addicted to is Temple Run, and it's one of those games

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
that's really stupidly simple in design.

23:05.440 --> 23:10.400
It's like one of the, the game itself could have been on the Atari 2600 for all I know.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.640
It's like you swipe up to jump, you swipe down to slide, left and right to go left and

23:14.640 --> 23:19.120
right, and the whole kitchen of the game is you're running fast to escape these monkeys

23:19.120 --> 23:23.040
that if they catch you, they're going to eat you because I guess you took their treasure

23:23.040 --> 23:24.200
or whatever.

23:24.200 --> 23:29.080
And it's so, so, so simple and so stupid, yet it is so addicting, I can't stop playing

23:29.080 --> 23:30.160
it.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.260
So yeah, Temple Run's what I've been playing a lot on my iPad.

23:33.260 --> 23:34.920
That's like the iPad go-to game right now.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.680
And the screen's really pretty, you guys.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.680
We were watching Archer.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.160
I'm like, it's pretty for a cartoon.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
Don't shake your head at me.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
That's you judging me.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
I can hear you.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.160
I am.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.600
So that was pretty much my week.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.880
All right.

23:49.880 --> 23:54.000
So a little bit of housekeeping, and then we're going to get into some news and so forth.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Housekeeping.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.760
I want to mention, this got a little bit derailed in my eyes and in the eyes here in studio

24:01.760 --> 24:06.880
because this whole VOG network thing happened in the past month and we were not able to

24:06.880 --> 24:11.000
give our full attention to The Hunt going on on orangelandtrady.com.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.120
Dark Tetsuya really put a ton of effort to make this like pseudo-game going on based

24:16.120 --> 24:22.900
on, you know, Ready Player One, that book series, and he ran this whole virtual contest

24:22.900 --> 24:29.160
where people had to like play and joust and find the hidden Easter egg screen in adventure

24:29.160 --> 24:32.120
and just, you know, cute fun stuff.

24:32.120 --> 24:37.340
You know, there was no point, no seriousness, just let's have fun on the internet.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.660
And that's really what it was.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.660
And it has a winner.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.600
So I want to congratulate Orange Right won The Hunt this week.

24:42.600 --> 24:48.000
So yay Orange Right, you win something.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.100
We're going to send Orange Right something from OLR Studios.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.440
I will find out if I get his address later.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.520
I know he, do you mean that?

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
Cause I'll go.

24:57.520 --> 25:01.880
All right, we're going to send Orange Right a lock of Dark Soccer's hair and something

25:01.880 --> 25:04.400
else actually useful from OLR Studios.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.840
I think I know what we can send him.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.840
Some cat litter.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.840
All right.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.840
We're not sending him cat litter.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
It's useful.

25:09.840 --> 25:13.160
You can use cat litter for a whole bunch of stuff, Rob.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.160
All right.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.320
You know, if you spill oil, if oil drips from your car, you can put cat litter on it.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.040
I think we have posters over there.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
Just stop.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
All right.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
I'll send him a post.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.120
Well, posters are kind of a bitch to mail.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.040
I was thinking we have, we have a bunch of these little guys here, so I'll send him one

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
of these.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.040
All right.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.040
All right.

25:29.040 --> 25:34.400
Um, I also, I know he's a Bamani fan and in the other room I have literally stacks and

25:34.400 --> 25:37.420
stacks of promo CDs we were going to give away at live events.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.420
We never did.

25:38.420 --> 25:41.720
So I'm just going to put a bunch of those in a box and be all like, LOL, have fun.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.560
And I think he'll get a kick out of that.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.960
All right.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.720
Um, let's see.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Second place.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.720
You get nothing.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
Sorry.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.200
That's a tough life lesson learned.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.200
All right.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.200
Uh, let's see.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.680
The other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention was that we will not be here live next week.

25:57.680 --> 26:02.000
Sorry to say I am going to be at bucket of meat or Disneyland.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.240
Um, so I have to make the most out of my past because the prices just went up and I, there's

26:06.240 --> 26:08.440
no way I'm renewing at the end of the year.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.960
So, uh, I am going this next week.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.120
Um, so there will be no live show.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.640
We are going to try to pre tape a show earlier in the week.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.680
We just have to find something that, uh, blends with all of our schedules.

26:19.680 --> 26:24.480
So I'm sorry, uh, live listeners, you won't have anything here, but think of, think of

26:24.480 --> 26:28.780
it as fair because last week you got a show that the podcasters never heard.

26:28.780 --> 26:32.640
So next week you're going to have to get the podcast show just like a lot of other people

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
do.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.240
So that's next week's show.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.000
I think that's it I have for housekeeping.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
All right.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.800
The other thing I have for housekeeping, um, we were supposed to be having an interview

26:41.800 --> 26:45.720
right now with Susan from hacked on xbox.com.

26:45.720 --> 26:50.000
Uh, unfortunately she's not online.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.040
This is almost exactly what happened with mega ran a couple of weeks ago.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.320
What is it about our show?

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
Are we, are we scary?

26:55.320 --> 26:56.320
I don't know.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.320
No, I don't.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.320
You know what?

26:58.320 --> 27:00.440
I was looking at her personal Twitter and it said something about, I got two hours of

27:00.440 --> 27:01.440
sleep last night.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.440
That was yesterday.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
Oh, was it?

27:03.440 --> 27:04.440
Oh, I thought it was today.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.180
Well, you know, it is a busy weekend here in the States.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.240
I don't know what's up.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.760
You know, I don't take it personally.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.520
You know, we did talk about it on Friday and I'm always the kind of person that's like,

27:11.520 --> 27:14.180
if I don't write it down five times, I'm going to forget.

27:14.180 --> 27:16.220
So for whatever reason, she's unfortunately not online.

27:16.220 --> 27:21.100
If she shows up later, as we did with mega ran, we'll bring her on the show later.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.660
I was going to use this interview to talk about something that's been going on in the

27:24.660 --> 27:25.920
news this week.

27:25.920 --> 27:31.760
Loki, hopefully you can talk about it instead since Susan's not here, but apparently there

27:31.760 --> 27:37.040
was some stuff going on with the whole, we think we know how some accounts are getting

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
stolen.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.040
Yeah.

27:39.040 --> 27:45.440
So basically, um, Susan had actually put together, um, an article on her website talking about

27:45.440 --> 27:48.760
how she kind of figured out, um, how some of this is going down.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.720
Now I'm not sure how she came about the website.

27:50.720 --> 27:55.280
I'm assuming just web searches because, you know, doing the same similar type of web search

27:55.280 --> 27:58.580
was able to pull up, uh, the same information.

27:58.580 --> 28:03.440
So basically what it was is she found out that it's not necessarily account hacking

28:03.440 --> 28:04.440
that's going on.

28:04.440 --> 28:10.340
It's basically jacking or, uh, the so-called hackers are social engineering, Microsoft

28:10.340 --> 28:16.320
and other companies to get information, to recover your account on their system.

28:16.320 --> 28:23.440
And it doesn't matter what sort of safe, um, you know, any sort of passwords, uh, questions,

28:23.440 --> 28:24.440
whatever.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.400
It doesn't matter cause they find a way to get that information from Microsoft or the

28:29.400 --> 28:33.400
third party companies representing Microsoft customer service or whatever it is.

28:33.400 --> 28:40.240
So they basically, there is this, um, it was on, uh, I'm trying to remember which website

28:40.240 --> 28:41.240
it was now.

28:41.240 --> 28:45.560
Um, picked it up and then it was originally on hacked on xbox.com and then Kotaku picked

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
it up.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.560
Right.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.560
And that's where it really kind of blew up.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.560
Yeah.

28:49.560 --> 28:55.000
Um, but basically the, the one of the websites, I can't remember what the original website,

28:55.000 --> 29:00.720
um, that had this step by step information, uh, cause they actually had this like a tutorial

29:00.720 --> 29:03.440
on how to do it cause this guy's like, Oh, I'm quitting hacking.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.700
Well, yeah, it didn't now, now I had joked at the beginning of the show, Susan was kind

29:07.700 --> 29:11.120
of the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week because she kind of got down to the bottom

29:11.120 --> 29:13.500
of what exactly was going on.

29:13.500 --> 29:19.720
But part of the way she did that was that I guess turned remorseful Jackers, game tag

29:19.720 --> 29:20.720
Jackers.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.200
I shouldn't just say remorseful Jackers.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.640
I could be talking about other stuff.

29:23.640 --> 29:28.400
Game tag Jackers actually contacted her and I don't know, I told her how it was.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.800
I don't even think they contact her.

29:29.800 --> 29:35.760
I think it was just a post that happened that she happened to run across on this website.

29:35.760 --> 29:41.820
And um, cause I actually, I remember reading it, I couldn't view it because it was basically

29:41.820 --> 29:47.160
one of those underground forums, whatever that you have to be, you have to be invited

29:47.160 --> 29:48.160
to.

29:48.160 --> 29:53.480
But however, one of those people that normally are entities that gets invited to any website

29:53.480 --> 29:59.720
would be a Google, you know, bot that happened to cash the page and that pops up in the preview

29:59.720 --> 30:02.800
and you can read information from there.

30:02.800 --> 30:08.800
Um, so basically, you know, the, you know, they talk about what, you know, the strategy

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
to do it.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.720
First you go to xbox.com, you click support and basically at the bottom of the page there's

30:13.720 --> 30:15.480
a contact us stuff.

30:15.480 --> 30:22.800
Um, on that page you click the email us link and then xbox live and then you basically

30:22.800 --> 30:29.380
at that point they, um, impersonate an employee of Microsoft.

30:29.380 --> 30:34.840
So they put, you know, an email address at Microsoft.com, they put the agent's name,

30:34.840 --> 30:38.360
somebody that they, I guess, talk to, they could, you know, call up customer service

30:38.360 --> 30:41.400
and hi, blah, blah, blah, my name is blah, blah, blah.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.000
They write it down, you know, and they go through this web form.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.200
Um, you put the customer and basically they, you fill out like a little note to them, you

30:51.200 --> 30:57.920
know, customer and you put the name, you know, verified the 16 digit, um, credit card number.

30:57.920 --> 31:02.020
He has made an inquiry and about how he has forgotten his accounts information.

31:02.020 --> 31:06.960
Since I am tier, I am a tier one agent, I am unable to view the customer's gamertag.

31:06.960 --> 31:12.080
He has requested to have an answer change to, and then, you know, you put some realistic

31:12.080 --> 31:17.080
answer I guess for the question, uh, the xbox slave gamertag is, and you put the gamertag

31:17.080 --> 31:23.000
down, um, you know, and then the person's name is supposedly contacting them that you're

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
spoofing.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.760
So basically they're working it by because Microsoft is so big and there's so many departments

31:30.760 --> 31:35.400
that don't talk to each other, essentially they're impersonating department to department.

31:35.400 --> 31:40.860
They're impersonating the many branches of Microsoft in order to get your gamertag and

31:40.860 --> 31:44.640
there ain't shit you can do about it except don't put a credit card on xbox.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.840
Yeah, there's really nothing you could do about it because they're literally going and

31:47.840 --> 31:51.320
finding the answers to your, you know, the questions that you put down.

31:51.320 --> 31:55.960
Even if you put down, you know, which city were you born in and you put down Abraham

31:55.960 --> 31:59.080
Lincoln or something like that, they can still get the answer to it and they're basically

31:59.080 --> 32:01.000
changing it to whatever they want.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.140
Um, now unfortunately, you know, one of the things I want to ask Susan tonight from hacked

32:05.140 --> 32:09.160
on xbox.com and I got to hand it to the chatters at a vog network.com.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.520
SGA 100 Matt says, even the best show hosts get canceled on Carson Letterman have been

32:13.520 --> 32:14.820
canceled on too.

32:14.820 --> 32:15.820
And what up?

32:15.820 --> 32:17.680
G says, when the interview comes on, it should be good even late.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.680
And I agree.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.640
And hopefully maybe she forgot it was Memorial day weekend.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.640
I don't know.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.640
But anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hopefully get her on next week.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.640
Yeah.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.640
There's always another time.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.640
Yeah.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.640
Yeah.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.640
We'll figure something out.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.240
But anyway, one thing I want to ask her about was that apparently Microsoft responded via

32:32.240 --> 32:34.120
Kotaku to her, to her report.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
Did you see that?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.120
Yes.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.720
They basically said, um, well, you can't do this anymore.

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
Well, okay.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.480
I don't really see.

32:43.480 --> 32:49.680
They're basically, you know, um, yeah, I thought it was irritating because they really tried

32:49.680 --> 32:56.480
to poopoo her story and it, it kind of pissed me off because it's kind of like, well, you

32:56.480 --> 33:01.120
never Microsoft, you never acknowledged that this was happening.

33:01.120 --> 33:04.960
And now you're trying to poopoo it like, well, you can't do it anymore.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.160
And I understand that Microsoft certainly to save their image, doesn't want to admit

33:08.160 --> 33:12.480
that they had a problem, but at the same time being that they are, I mean, they are on the

33:12.480 --> 33:13.480
stock market.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.480
Yes.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.480
They're a publicly traded company, right?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.480
Yeah.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.320
Isn't there some sort of responsibility that they should be reporting this shit's happening?

33:19.320 --> 33:20.320
Yeah.

33:20.320 --> 33:25.320
And they basically said, okay, here's what their Microsoft or Kotaku asked for comment

33:25.320 --> 33:26.320
from them.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.800
And they're all, their response was, there are several or there are several different

33:29.800 --> 33:34.600
methods malicious users employed to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.260
Social engineering is one of them.

33:36.260 --> 33:40.440
We are aware of vulnerabilities that social engineering pose and continue to address these

33:40.440 --> 33:46.760
through tools and training to help our members, um, uh, keep our members safe and secure.

33:46.760 --> 33:50.880
Well, right there, that sounds like tools and train their members.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.480
It sounds like us.

33:52.480 --> 33:58.680
They're teaching us how to not be social engineered, which cool, but that doesn't really seem to,

33:58.680 --> 34:02.720
you know, apply to us because we're not the ones being contacted by these people.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.800
It's your customer service reps.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.560
Here's another thing I really wanted to get into as much as I respect what Susan's done

34:09.560 --> 34:13.360
this week and what she's been able to find out and put out what needed to be out there

34:13.360 --> 34:14.640
on the internet.

34:14.640 --> 34:19.200
She put out what people needed to hear this week and I so respect her for that.

34:19.200 --> 34:23.080
I don't think it is the sole reason this stuff is happening.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.760
Now I'm having a hard time remembering when I was hacked.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.740
I think it was about six months ago at this point.

34:28.740 --> 34:34.280
I seem to recall my password was never changed, which would tell me that this didn't happen

34:34.280 --> 34:38.100
to me because they're resetting your password in this, right?

34:38.100 --> 34:40.680
I don't think that they're resetting your password actually.

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
Really?

34:41.680 --> 34:42.680
Yeah.

34:42.680 --> 34:46.040
Cause I took away from it that they're trying to get into your security questions that they

34:46.040 --> 34:47.560
can reset your password.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
Not necessarily.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.080
So here, here's what it is.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
Okay.

34:51.080 --> 34:56.160
So, so it starts off, they send the inquiry about the security question via email and

34:56.160 --> 35:00.320
then, um, obviously they're not going to your response because you know, they're not at

35:00.320 --> 35:05.280
that email that you call up Xbox, um, 30 minutes later.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.840
And uh, after the ants, after the answer, you say that you got disconnected from a tier

35:08.840 --> 35:11.200
two agent and asked to be transferred back.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.000
So they transfer you to a tier two agent.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.200
You give them the number, the one that you wrote, um, the one that you, I guess your

35:17.200 --> 35:20.440
customer, so they act like they have, what was it?

35:20.440 --> 35:27.680
Um, once they pull it up, say, um, they'll say it'll take a little while to change it.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.920
Uh, call back, say you forgot your email, but you know what the security question or

35:31.920 --> 35:37.420
the secret question answer is and they will ask for your gamer tag and um, answer them

35:37.420 --> 35:39.720
and they will give you the email.

35:39.720 --> 35:48.520
So now, um, so I guess, uh, let's see here.

35:48.520 --> 35:53.360
So basically now you have their email and I guess their security question, I'm not really

35:53.360 --> 35:55.960
sure how, I guess I don't know if that allows you to change it immediately.

35:55.960 --> 36:00.880
I thought they would send you a, maybe I just want to deny, deny, deny.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.800
Just like I want to deny that I couldn't have been phished either.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.640
You know, I just, maybe I'm just being a little hard headed, but I kind of think like, why

36:07.640 --> 36:09.680
would someone want my account?

36:09.680 --> 36:15.160
I mean, granted, maybe I, although I don't think I have much of a public face, I have

36:15.160 --> 36:17.960
a public face thanks to this podcast nonetheless.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.200
So maybe some a-hole out there wanted it.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.720
I don't know why they used it to play FIFA 13 though.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.280
I don't, I don't think it's necessarily that they're, they're saying there's a few reasons

36:26.280 --> 36:28.880
why they have our accounts get hacked.

36:28.880 --> 36:33.440
One is the original gamer tag, which means, um, you know, you have a gamer tag that's

36:33.440 --> 36:39.280
like, you know, awesome or, you know, which I don't, I don't think I have a name people

36:39.280 --> 36:40.280
want.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.280
Yeah.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.280
So it's not necessarily that.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.160
Or, um, sometimes accounts get hacked because you're, you know, you're a member of live

36:46.160 --> 36:48.280
for X number of years.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.480
That could be that I would agree.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.200
I don't know why zone one account for that, but, but I, okay, but the other, sorry, but

36:54.200 --> 36:59.200
the other thing I have friends who were hacked that hadn't touched their Xbox in years and

36:59.200 --> 37:00.720
it's just, it's not clicking for me.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.800
They can just, they can just probably find random people.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.080
Maybe there's try it on one or another.

37:07.080 --> 37:11.420
Perhaps it's a given the amount of time has gone since it's been used.

37:11.420 --> 37:14.360
It makes it an easy target because it's someone less likely to check.

37:14.360 --> 37:20.680
I feel like this story has blown a hole in it, but it hasn't still yet shown us everything

37:20.680 --> 37:21.680
that's going on.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.200
Let me quickly go to the chat room because there's some good comments here from the chat

37:24.200 --> 37:25.200
room.

37:25.200 --> 37:29.840
Uh, DJ Morpheus from under station live Saturday nights here on VOG says, has anyone considered

37:29.840 --> 37:35.400
the possibility if there is inside help within the Xbox call centers for the Jackers?

37:35.400 --> 37:37.120
That's a scary thought, isn't it?

37:37.120 --> 37:38.560
But it's not unheard of.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.960
It is not unheard of.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.600
Well, here's an example.

37:41.600 --> 37:47.520
When I worked for, um, the, uh, mortgage service or I used to work for one of our clients had

37:47.520 --> 37:53.400
a bunch of information stolen by one of their employees stealing a laptop.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
Wow.

37:54.400 --> 38:03.480
And it had something like, um, I want to say, uh, 3000, uh, bank account information, new

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
bank accounts.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.520
So just saying it happens within companies.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.520
It does.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.520
It does.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.520
You know, I work in the insurance industry and there's laws set in place to prosecute

38:12.520 --> 38:16.640
people who use the information that they find in malicious ways because, you know, imagine

38:16.640 --> 38:21.680
if you could access a celebrity's medical records, the things that might happen there,

38:21.680 --> 38:24.720
you know, but there's, there's laws in place to protect everybody.

38:24.720 --> 38:29.160
Like with my job now, I have, I run into the same thing, you know, with inspections.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.160
Yeah.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.400
Let me, uh, let me read this comment from ACDEF in our chat room as well, cause I like

38:33.400 --> 38:36.840
this too at vognetwork.com ACDEF says, let me put it this way.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.280
PlayStation network handled their hacking issue horribly, but they handled it nonetheless.

38:41.280 --> 38:45.200
Steam handled their forums being hacked really well and keep, kept the users informed of

38:45.200 --> 38:47.480
and users of what was happening.

38:47.480 --> 38:52.600
Microsoft handling the Xbox live jackings is non-existent, which is worse of what Sony

38:52.600 --> 38:53.600
did.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.140
And, uh, DJ Morpheus added to that, remember this is Microsoft.

38:57.140 --> 38:59.120
They never admit issues until necessary.

38:59.120 --> 39:03.160
Look at Vista and how it was a disaster and ACDEF said, yeah, pretty much what I'm saying.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.560
Microsoft denying the whole issue is worse than what Sony did.

39:06.560 --> 39:10.480
And we're talking that Sony didn't handle the problem that well to begin with.

39:10.480 --> 39:15.780
And I've said this for months now, as much as we give Sony shit and yes, they do deserve

39:15.780 --> 39:18.980
quite a bit of shit over what happened and you know, kind of how they made themselves

39:18.980 --> 39:20.560
a target and everything.

39:20.560 --> 39:25.360
Although we give them shit, at least they said what was going on and they did take their

39:25.360 --> 39:27.320
network down when it was a problem.

39:27.320 --> 39:36.840
And you know, most of all, they never had money actually stolen.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.080
Yet here we are on Xbox this much later and we're still hearing stories about how it's

39:42.080 --> 39:43.080
done.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.960
And you go to that website hacked on xbox.com.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.460
It is still happening.

39:47.460 --> 39:54.240
If you have not changed your password on Xbox live in the past six months, you are a fool

39:54.240 --> 39:55.240
to not do it.

39:55.240 --> 39:59.140
Now, if you do not change your password on Xbox live, you have sat through all of these

39:59.140 --> 40:02.820
stories and it's still not changed your Xbox live password.

40:02.820 --> 40:12.840
You are a fool and I wish you the best of luck.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.560
Now that I paraded everybody, hopefully that wasn't anybody actually listening and let

40:16.560 --> 40:19.080
you know, I should go change my password right now.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.520
I forgive you if it's the first time you've ever heard me ranting, maybe you didn't think

40:22.520 --> 40:25.440
to change it before, but if you've been sitting here for the past six months and you still

40:25.440 --> 40:28.960
haven't changed it, you're, you're, you're just asking for it.

40:28.960 --> 40:33.080
I've done mine twice since then cause I routinely change my passwords every three months.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.640
Well, here's the weird thing too, and this actually just came up in the past week and

40:36.640 --> 40:37.640
a half.

40:37.640 --> 40:42.800
I got an email or I tried to log into xbox.com or something and it made me change my password.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.120
But it wasn't a reset or something.

40:46.120 --> 40:50.240
It was some type of somebody's been trying to log into your account too many times.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.820
You better change your password.

40:51.820 --> 40:56.320
And so that made me, you know, the first thing I went to my bank account to make sure no

40:56.320 --> 40:59.520
more money had been stolen or any of that crap is going on.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.280
But they, you know, I looked in the game history of they've been in there, been able to play

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
anything.

41:03.280 --> 41:08.320
Thankfully, no, um, no one actually got in there, but it made me go, they're still fucking

41:08.320 --> 41:13.720
trying.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
All right.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
Anyhow.

41:15.720 --> 41:20.160
Anyways, there was hackforms.net is where this stuff originated from.

41:20.160 --> 41:24.160
They have the whole priv7 how to jack any xbox account.

41:24.160 --> 41:26.880
That's where all that information was from on her website.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.880
All right.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.200
Well, I'm hoping, um, you know, we can get her on here to tell us more about the story

41:31.200 --> 41:34.960
about how she found it and you know, kind of her opinions really having heard so many

41:34.960 --> 41:38.300
of these stories on what Microsoft should do.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.080
But we'll have to get that in a later week.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.080
All right.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.400
For now, let's get into the rest of the week's news.

41:44.400 --> 41:48.000
We're going to start off with a repeat from last week because this, this still hasn't

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
really broken, right?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
No, it hasn't broken yet.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
All right.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.880
So sorry, live listeners, you're going to be hearing this for the second time, but for

41:52.880 --> 41:55.480
the podcasters, let's, let's take it away.

41:55.480 --> 42:01.320
So this is a kind of neat, um, we figured out, uh, who the lead character is going to

42:01.320 --> 42:05.240
be for dead rising three, or at least who will be voicing said lead character for dead

42:05.240 --> 42:06.240
rising three.

42:06.240 --> 42:10.160
Um, that individual is actor, uh, George Diaz.

42:10.160 --> 42:15.120
George Diaz, in case you're not familiar with that name is, uh, done quite a few things.

42:15.120 --> 42:21.000
Um, one of being, uh, the brothers Garcia, which was a TV series, um, back in early two

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
thousands.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.400
Uh, also recently was in, um, was it Love Concord, um, which is kind of like a video

42:27.400 --> 42:33.360
game-ish movie, but, um, this is directly actually from him, um, kind of long story

42:33.360 --> 42:36.320
short how we kind of came about that.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.200
I had a coworker who was actually talking to him about Love Concord, um, you know, cause

42:41.200 --> 42:48.120
he's kind of big in the indie stuff and actually, um, saw, you know, the friends of my coworker,

42:48.120 --> 42:51.280
um, had, you know, friend of his Facebook or whatever.

42:51.280 --> 42:56.960
Say, Hey, um, so by the way, man, uh, tell your friend, um, who liked this post that

42:56.960 --> 42:59.480
I'm the new face of dead rising three lol.

42:59.480 --> 43:04.500
I saw he works for, um, for video games, the trailer should be coming out soon in the next

43:04.500 --> 43:05.560
month or two.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.560
It's crazy.

43:06.560 --> 43:10.480
They sent me to this place called Mova in San Francisco, insane technology.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.960
They did Benjamin Button.

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
Looks so real.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
I'll post it on here when they give it to me.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.960
Um, just real quick.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.280
Are you sure the name's not Jorge?

43:17.280 --> 43:18.280
Who starts with the T?

43:18.280 --> 43:19.280
I'm sorry.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.280
Yeah, it's Jorge.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
But okay.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.280
Just making sure.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.280
Jorge Diaz.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.280
Jorge Diaz.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.840
Um, and he'll get a kick out of it.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.400
So, um, kind of neat.

43:28.400 --> 43:32.960
It's actually, I mean, if you go go look up Jorge Diaz on Facebook, you can actually see

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
said post.

43:33.960 --> 43:40.360
Um, but yeah, uh, I guess we'll see that in, um, uh, well, when they talk a little bit

43:40.360 --> 43:46.040
about during E3 and also kind of goes back to the rumor about the plot for dead rising

43:46.040 --> 43:49.760
three where it's supposed to be this, uh, auto mechanic and there was supposed to be,

43:49.760 --> 43:56.340
um, you know, an LA and sort of this, you know, illegal immigrant spin thing on there

43:56.340 --> 44:01.360
where they have these aliens, um, that they're trying to smuggle across borders.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.080
But the aliens are actually a little controversy to, uh, let's, let's use something, uh, politically

44:06.080 --> 44:08.180
buzz worthy to try and sell more copies.

44:08.180 --> 44:09.180
That's taste.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.180
Yeah.

44:10.180 --> 44:14.040
And the aliens would be these, uh, or illegals they call them, um, would be a group of infected

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
people that aren't ready.

44:15.040 --> 44:19.040
They're literally illegal aliens because they're silly.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
All right.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.040
Anyway, whatever.

44:22.040 --> 44:27.280
Um, but it also confirms dead rising three basically because every Capcom has not confirmed

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
dead rising three.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.280
Everything out there is speculation.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.280
Yes.

44:30.280 --> 44:34.480
So they will be announcing dead rising three at E3 for sure.

44:34.480 --> 44:38.600
That'll probably be one of like Xbox or playstations things.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
Sure.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Sure.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.600
So there you go.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.480
No Frank West or the other guy.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.000
No, of course not.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Okay.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Yet.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Until DL.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
No man.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Like Frank West.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.120
Yeah, dead rising two off the record bond.

44:52.120 --> 44:57.720
So well, because I think a lot of people will kind of saw it as a, I think a lot of people

44:57.720 --> 44:59.600
saw it for what it was.

44:59.600 --> 45:04.040
It was a cheap attempt to try and get dead rising two more popularity when it just should

45:04.040 --> 45:05.040
have been there to begin with.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.240
You know what I mean?

45:06.240 --> 45:10.200
I think people are starting to call Capcom out on a lot of this shit and it's kind of

45:10.200 --> 45:15.800
fun to watch like watching a soap opera a little bit and it's just, Hey, just like,

45:15.800 --> 45:23.120
you know, all the on disc DLC for street fighter cross Tekken and dragon dog, dragon's dog.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.840
Let's talk Minecraft.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.840
I bet Loki will be excited about this.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.960
I bet you never thought this would be something happening on OLR Minecraft segment.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
All right.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.800
We used to talk about Minecraft updates all the time.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.680
I will have, you know, okay, here, here we go.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.680
No, this is some serious Minecraft news.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.700
Um, Xbox live arcade.

45:40.700 --> 45:44.280
What game is being played the most online?

45:44.280 --> 45:49.160
Well it's still modern warfare three, but Minecraft has now edged out call of duty black

45:49.160 --> 45:53.400
ops for the number two spot.

45:53.400 --> 45:58.940
This is a game that's been out a month, not even, not even.

45:58.940 --> 46:01.500
That's pretty and online completely.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.000
Can't buy it in stores.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.480
That's pretty impressive.

46:06.480 --> 46:13.840
There is supposedly an adventure update thing coming to Minecraft, Xbox live arcade eventually.

46:13.840 --> 46:19.680
Now I guess the next update for Minecraft is going to be 1.7.3, which will add pistons

46:19.680 --> 46:21.280
into the game, which is awesome.

46:21.280 --> 46:26.440
That's the next thing that Xbox is slated to get, but at some point 1.8, which was the

46:26.440 --> 46:32.140
adventure update on the PC that will be coming to Xbox live arcade, uh, the quote from four

46:32.140 --> 46:33.140
J studios.

46:33.140 --> 46:35.440
They're the ones who ported the game for Xbox live arcade.

46:35.440 --> 46:40.420
There are no big architecture changes with the move to 1.7.3 so it's been quite straightforward.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.760
The move to 1.8.2 is much more challenging.

46:43.760 --> 46:48.480
We are working with Daniel Kaplan at Mojang to define what is going in the Xbox version,

46:48.480 --> 46:53.360
but the aim is to include as many of the PC features that make sense on the Xbox as possible.

46:53.360 --> 46:55.360
The game isn't Minecraft on the Xbox.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.080
It's Minecraft Xbox 360 edition.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.720
So it isn't really a direct port of the PC game.

47:00.720 --> 47:06.000
That's kind of them as I'm trying to weave these tangled words of, we didn't promise

47:06.000 --> 47:10.880
you everything, but I got to say it's still, you know, especially for somebody who's new

47:10.880 --> 47:14.040
to the whole damn thing like me, it's still pretty impressive and I'll be looking forward

47:14.040 --> 47:15.480
to these updates.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.120
So there you go.

47:17.120 --> 47:21.200
This update, by the way, the endermen, those are the ones that you can't make direct eye

47:21.200 --> 47:22.200
contact with.

47:22.200 --> 47:23.200
Right?

47:23.200 --> 47:26.720
Oh, Alan was showing me one of those guys and I thought creepers were scary.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.720
Good Lord.

47:27.720 --> 47:32.720
Uh, new kinds of building materials, a new mode called creative mode and some changes

47:32.720 --> 47:34.160
to combat mechanics.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.460
And that'll be the patch where you're going to have to eat food to survive.

47:37.460 --> 47:43.960
Although I imagine there'll still be a casual mode that won't have that element in it.

47:43.960 --> 47:52.320
So Minecraft sales figures, 6 million sold on the PC, 9 million across all platforms

47:52.320 --> 47:57.640
when you factor in Xbox, Android, and iOS, maybe 9.2 million.

47:57.640 --> 48:02.240
That's according to Daniel Kaplan with, uh, Mojang has a lot.

48:02.240 --> 48:06.720
That's a lot, especially considering I don't think the iOS and I can't imagine those sold

48:06.720 --> 48:07.720
a lot.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.320
I mean, I don't think in the millions, maybe a million a pop.

48:10.320 --> 48:14.440
I mean, the Xbox ones probably sold at least a million and a half at this point.

48:14.440 --> 48:18.040
So I, well, they said they were profitable within 10 hours.

48:18.040 --> 48:22.500
That's that is, this is, this is the type of thing that they're going to look back on

48:22.500 --> 48:29.640
in 10 years and be all like, Hey, remember in the 2010s when people played Minecraft,

48:29.640 --> 48:35.880
just like we kind of look back and go, Hey, remember the pet rock, you know, I think it'll

48:35.880 --> 48:41.080
be that whole thing where it's still, um, I just have a feeling that like Lego is just

48:41.080 --> 48:43.560
kicking themselves going, damn it.

48:43.560 --> 48:45.160
We could have done something like this.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.200
Like we could have so done something like this.

48:48.200 --> 48:51.080
You're going to see this on VH1 in 10 years.

48:51.080 --> 48:56.360
Michael Ian Black commenting on VH1's I love the 10s anymore.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.120
I love the 10s.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.120
Remember Minecraft?

48:59.120 --> 49:08.960
Remember when we used to have this show, do countdowns of decades and stuff and just stopped.

49:08.960 --> 49:12.200
All right, so there you go.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.640
That's, that's what's going on in Minecraft world.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.400
So dark soccer, if you want to talk about a different game, now would be a good chance.

49:17.400 --> 49:23.680
Well, I said, if people want me to play the damn game, they need to buy it for me on PC.

49:23.680 --> 49:24.680
That's cute.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.280
You live in a world, you think you live in a world where that will happen.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.240
That means I don't have to play it.

49:29.240 --> 49:32.760
No, no, don't even try to get out of it like that.

49:32.760 --> 49:38.520
You can download the classic version completely free on their website, but I don't want the

49:38.520 --> 49:39.520
classic version.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.520
Yeah.

49:40.520 --> 49:41.520
Yeah.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.520
And I've tried it.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.520
The terms have changed.

49:43.520 --> 49:47.080
I've tried it because I want to see what all this, you know, neat crap is, but it's not

49:47.080 --> 49:51.600
worth it to me unless I'm playing for free because you know, I'm cheap that way.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.800
So how about some Star Wars?

49:53.800 --> 49:57.640
There's going to be a new Star Wars franchise unveiled next week.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
Ooh.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
And it's a bold vision.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.640
Ooh.

50:00.640 --> 50:04.540
And we don't know what the crap it is, but it's going to be on GTTV.

50:04.540 --> 50:06.120
So good.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.760
That's on Thursday.

50:08.760 --> 50:14.160
What it was said though is that it actually had a pretty high caliber team on it and it's

50:14.160 --> 50:18.160
going to be very bold, very bold, but we don't know what it is.

50:18.160 --> 50:23.760
So I mean, hopefully it's going to be better than the MMO because the MMO is losing people

50:23.760 --> 50:26.880
and it really wasn't all that great that I saw.

50:26.880 --> 50:32.080
I'm not impressed by it except I do kind of like the alignment change thing, but that's

50:32.080 --> 50:33.080
about it.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.080
That's really about it.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
Yay.

50:35.080 --> 50:37.680
It's going to be a new Battlefront series and that sounds awesome.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.680
You think?

50:38.680 --> 50:39.680
I think so.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.680
That would be worth it.

50:40.680 --> 50:41.680
They're just going to call it something different.

50:41.680 --> 50:45.680
How about, you know, how about a return to like the, um, uh, super Nintendo style side

50:45.680 --> 50:46.680
scroller games?

50:46.680 --> 50:47.680
That would be rad.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.400
Yeah, that'd be cool.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.640
But, and of course a lot of times when I think about Lucas art, I think about the point and

50:52.640 --> 50:56.560
click adventure games from back in the day, like loom and Indiana Jones and shit.

50:56.560 --> 51:02.120
So how about a fucking like, you know, Hey, tell tales kind of, you know, made that industry

51:02.120 --> 51:05.160
like cool again with the whole walking deads doing very well.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.160
Right.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.280
Since they're already on a star Wars game like that, since they're already, you know,

51:09.280 --> 51:13.760
stealing from Blizzard, why don't they just keep doing it and do like a Diablo style,

51:13.760 --> 51:19.960
you know, play like that since they're already, I'm sorry, borrowing from Blizzard.

51:19.960 --> 51:24.840
I am with dark Tetsuya in our chat room at vognetwork.com as long as it's not Han Solo's

51:24.840 --> 51:28.560
dance party for the connect.

51:28.560 --> 51:31.240
You know what Han Solo's dance party would be?

51:31.240 --> 51:32.500
Him shooting people.

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
The end.

51:33.500 --> 51:40.800
Uh, God, I just, I hope they don't make a sequel to that game cause it was terrible.

51:40.800 --> 51:46.000
It probably sold okay, but man, it was a terrible game.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.640
Speaking of terrible, there's been some terrible things going on at 38 studios and big, huge

51:51.640 --> 51:52.640
games.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.640
They've laid off their entire staff.

51:53.640 --> 52:00.440
Apparently, uh, kingdoms of Amalur wasn't doing very well and, um, they owed a lot of

52:00.440 --> 52:05.840
money to Rhode Island, you know, they had a, basically they were supposed to be paying

52:05.840 --> 52:13.960
back $50 million and, uh, of the $75 million loan that they got from Rhode Island.

52:13.960 --> 52:17.720
And you know, their franchise wasn't worth very much.

52:17.720 --> 52:21.440
Um, kingdoms of Amalur reckoning didn't sell like they had hoped it would.

52:21.440 --> 52:26.920
They needed to sell 3 million units to break even and they only sold about 700,000.

52:26.920 --> 52:29.060
So, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:29.060 --> 52:34.420
Wasn't there a tweet that something like they had sold 1.2 million or something or was that

52:34.420 --> 52:38.800
like shipped versus sold and that whole clever math that we see in the gaming industry?

52:38.800 --> 52:44.680
Honestly, I don't know when that update was, but it sold well under 3 million units, that's

52:44.680 --> 52:45.680
for sure.

52:45.680 --> 52:51.600
Um, I mean, that stuff takes time, but not enough time to repay their debts.

52:51.600 --> 52:58.120
And it's just, there was a whole bunch of, uh, just terrible stuff going on there.

52:58.120 --> 53:04.480
I was reading things, uh, oh yeah, 1.22 million units in the first 90 days is what they said.

53:04.480 --> 53:11.200
Um, but also like I heard stuff where some of the employees that were relocated to work

53:11.200 --> 53:18.440
for this company, oh, by the way, you know, that house that we bought for you, um, yeah,

53:18.440 --> 53:20.520
we never paid for it.

53:20.520 --> 53:24.160
So you've got, we took a second mortgage out on your home to see, you know, yeah, I heard

53:24.160 --> 53:26.160
about that mortgage now.

53:26.160 --> 53:29.240
Yeah, that sucks.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.480
And that kind of stuff can really fuck your credit.

53:31.480 --> 53:37.260
I mean, that's, that's the really sad thing about this, you know, but hooray to the gaming

53:37.260 --> 53:40.600
industry for at least trying to, you know, cause usually you think of the gaming industry

53:40.600 --> 53:44.480
and it's, you know, you think of the people on Xbox live, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck,

53:44.480 --> 53:45.840
fag, fag, fag, you know.

53:45.840 --> 53:52.360
And also, I mean, considering that there was almost 380 employees at 38 studios, um, so

53:52.360 --> 53:57.080
they, you know, people on Twitter have been kind of rallying, um, to, you know, with 38,

53:57.080 --> 54:02.440
the hashtag, uh, 38 jobs, also Facebook group, um, 38 jobs.

54:02.440 --> 54:07.760
And they've got, you know, people including like Alex Rubens, um, you know, game journalist

54:07.760 --> 54:12.760
and he's been, you know, collecting like a stuff into a Google doc with all these different

54:12.760 --> 54:14.720
studios with openings and stuff.

54:14.720 --> 54:18.440
And there's also job fairs going on in their area and they're kind of letting these people

54:18.440 --> 54:19.440
know.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.840
Uh, he might be a listener of the show because him and I have followed each other on Twitter

54:21.840 --> 54:22.840
for a while.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.000
And so I actually kind of saw his tweets about that when he was putting it together, his

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
whole Google docs thing.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.160
And I thought that was a really cool idea.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.160
So props to him.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.840
I'm glad you're getting your, especially cause I know he's an aspiring game journalist.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.140
This is a good thing.

54:33.140 --> 54:36.140
You know, good begets good.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.200
You know what I mean?

54:37.200 --> 54:38.680
So good for him.

54:38.680 --> 54:39.680
Yeah.

54:39.680 --> 54:45.120
Um, so yeah, it's, it's a terrible situation, uh, thankfully though they're a talented group

54:45.120 --> 54:49.200
of people and so they should hopefully be able to find work pretty quick.

54:49.200 --> 54:52.880
And God, I mean, that's just, I don't know.

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
Now that's not good.

54:53.880 --> 54:57.600
SSJ 100, Matt has taken the cheap shot in our chat room at vog network.com that a lot

54:57.600 --> 55:01.920
of people have been taking Kurt Schilling always been a douche.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.640
So I had a clever retort.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.640
Okay.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.640
What is your retort young lady?

55:06.640 --> 55:12.680
The douches keep girl bits clean, so how's that bad?

55:12.680 --> 55:17.440
Well look, whatever he is, um, uh, he's apparently not the best businessman in the world.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.000
Uh, we can certainly say that.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.280
So I mean, what about the repercussions that are being felt for, you know, the fact that

55:25.280 --> 55:32.120
his name basically got a state to believe in his company enough to give them this huge

55:32.120 --> 55:34.320
loan that now they're going to have to eat.

55:34.320 --> 55:37.520
I mean, what's the longterm repercussion of this?

55:37.520 --> 55:39.880
You think, well, taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.

55:39.880 --> 55:43.600
And I think they estimated it was like a over a hundred million dollars that the taxpayers

55:43.600 --> 55:44.600
would be accountable for.

55:44.600 --> 55:52.400
I want to say it was like 112 in chains or something like that, but, um, yeah, it sucks.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.880
Rhode Island's not a big state.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.280
That's that's a lot of money.

55:56.280 --> 56:00.760
A dungeon buster in our chat room says Amalur wasn't that bad of a game, but the timing

56:00.760 --> 56:05.760
for its release couldn't get out from Skyrim shadow, which I mean, I don't know what a

56:05.760 --> 56:08.040
lot of people are going to do Skyrim by the time they come out.

56:08.040 --> 56:11.200
I wouldn't blame Skyrim because it was a few months after Skyrim.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.300
I would blame Mass Effect 3 because it came out literally like three weeks before Mass

56:15.300 --> 56:16.300
Effect 3.

56:16.300 --> 56:20.880
Well, not even that, but maybe it's just me and the fact that I don't watch a lot of TV

56:20.880 --> 56:23.560
or when I do, I watch it without commercials.

56:23.560 --> 56:27.840
I hadn't really heard a lot about this game, which, you know, considering I do this show,

56:27.840 --> 56:28.840
you'd think be honest.

56:28.840 --> 56:29.840
It's the first I've ever heard of it.

56:29.840 --> 56:30.840
Right.

56:30.840 --> 56:31.840
Maybe that's a problem.

56:31.840 --> 56:35.860
Well, it is a problem considering it's EA, the one publishing it and they usually pimp

56:35.860 --> 56:37.040
the shit out of their games.

56:37.040 --> 56:41.120
Um, I mean, I heard about it and stuff and they, I saw, you know, they had a demo and

56:41.120 --> 56:43.960
I didn't really see any TV advertisement for it.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.840
But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so I mean, it's possible that they had stuff

56:47.840 --> 56:49.120
for it.

56:49.120 --> 56:53.760
Um, but it's not like, you know, Madden or something that you'd spend a lot of money

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
on it.

56:54.760 --> 56:59.440
Uh, Phantasm, our chairman says reckoning had a bad release window with Skyrim and Mass

56:59.440 --> 57:00.440
Effect 3.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.280
Is it possible that the game just released at a bad time?

57:03.280 --> 57:06.120
I, once again, I'm not going to blame Skyrim.

57:06.120 --> 57:10.560
Skyrim was two months before it, but what about could contribute, but I think there

57:10.560 --> 57:11.560
might be other factors.

57:11.560 --> 57:15.760
What about just the fact that maybe the month it released usually isn't a big month for

57:15.760 --> 57:19.200
games, especially maybe they should have held it off till summer because those first few

57:19.200 --> 57:20.920
weeks really do make or break your game.

57:20.920 --> 57:21.920
You know what I'm going to blame?

57:21.920 --> 57:25.900
I'm going to blame the fucking online pass because it was a game that had an online,

57:25.900 --> 57:30.360
they literally called it an online pass for a game that had no online component.

57:30.360 --> 57:32.600
Oh, that's right.

57:32.600 --> 57:33.600
That was this.

57:33.600 --> 57:38.400
They had no online component, but the online pass, they literally called an online pass

57:38.400 --> 57:40.720
was just, you know, bonus DLC.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.760
Yeah, that didn't help.

57:42.760 --> 57:49.000
So I mean, just call it bonus DLC, you know, then if you don't buy it at launch, you don't

57:49.000 --> 57:53.680
get the bonus DLC and all you can do is go, well, damn, I should have bought the game

57:53.680 --> 57:54.680
at launch.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.440
I mean, I don't see how that's a bad thing at all.

57:56.440 --> 58:00.640
And instead of calling it an online pass, oh, you got to pay this extra money to get

58:00.640 --> 58:02.960
online and download this extra DLC.

58:02.960 --> 58:07.320
I don't really know what the spin was on that, but all right, well, continuing with things

58:07.320 --> 58:12.320
that might, um, drive the gaming industry further into a hole, um, you've got to hear

58:12.320 --> 58:14.640
about this patent that was discovered this week.

58:14.640 --> 58:19.440
Sony Computer Entertainment America or SCA filed for this patent in 2011.

58:19.440 --> 58:22.040
It usually takes a little time for these patents to be found.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.720
So yes, it's an older patent, but it's just being found now.

58:24.720 --> 58:30.200
Um, the patent was for an advertising system where a game will be suspended during play

58:30.200 --> 58:32.420
for an advertisement to come up.

58:32.420 --> 58:33.960
Then the game will continue.

58:33.960 --> 58:39.000
Think of it, excuse me, think of it like how TV commercials interrupt your show, Hulu,

58:39.000 --> 58:46.780
or Hulu ads would be proceeded by a warning and a slow down of gameplay with another warning

58:46.780 --> 58:49.820
displayed when gameplay is about to resume.

58:49.820 --> 58:53.280
So it's kind of like ad incoming.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.280
Everything's low.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.280
Bye Pepsi.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
Oh, okay.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.280
Let's get back into the game.

58:59.280 --> 59:04.960
Yeah, seriously, that, that reminds me of Mr. Sensei with 2000 movie sign.

59:04.960 --> 59:09.800
Um, now just because they filed the patent doesn't mean it will be implemented.

59:09.800 --> 59:12.760
It's just, you know, again, patents are to kind of protect ideas or what have you, which

59:12.760 --> 59:16.920
is weird because I thought I, I thought IOS games did this shit already.

59:16.920 --> 59:20.360
Doesn't word with friends kind of do something like this where you play and then you get

59:20.360 --> 59:21.360
mad.

59:21.360 --> 59:26.120
If you have the free version, yeah, if you, I have the paid version of words with friends

59:26.120 --> 59:27.600
that never does that crap to me.

59:27.600 --> 59:33.280
I don't know, would this be terrible if it was to support like free full console games?

59:33.280 --> 59:36.920
Like for example, ad supported stuff like for, you know, say I want to get a little

59:36.920 --> 59:40.920
big planet too and it, I can add supported version that stops gameplay once in a while

59:40.920 --> 59:43.320
to pimp me Pepsi or something.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.120
I would probably, I'd probably just want to buy the regular game, which is what they want

59:47.120 --> 59:50.040
you to do in the first place, but they can make more ad revenue.

59:50.040 --> 59:54.200
If this shit pops up in a fucking retail game, I'm not fucking buying that.

59:54.200 --> 59:56.840
This was in wipeout as well, wasn't it sorta, sorta.

59:56.840 --> 59:59.880
I mean, it didn't really pause gameplay, but it doesn't like the loading screens.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:06.080
Well, that's one thing if they have it as a, as something that's not gonna be obtrusive,

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.720
you know, if it's not gonna interrupt your gameplay, I don't so much have a problem with

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.880
it.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:18.540
I'm cool with the billboards and racing games, but I think that if they're doing this as

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.720
a way to bring in more revenue, they need to decrease the price of the game.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720
Absolutely.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.520
Now, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room and says, don't effing get me started

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.720
on patents.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.480
Had my phone delayed in customs a week or so ago because of a BS Apple patent.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.840
Well, you know, a lot of folks are saying the patent industry in this country is really

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.680
screwed up right now.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.640
And it's a lot of just offensive and defensive maneuvers.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.240
Remember when Twitter came out and said, we have all of these patents, they actually put

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.580
out a press release that said, we have acquired all these patents and we only plan to use

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.680
them defensively.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.040
Like, it's a fucking game of chess.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.240
That's what the patent industry in this country has become.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.920
So, yeah, maybe Sony is not even going to do anything with this.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.160
It's just, we just want to, you know, defend ourselves against when somebody tries to call

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.200
us on it or something weird to throw my political two cents into it.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.600
This is what happens when you allow certain businesses to go deregulated DJ Morpheus is

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.200
in our chat room and gives us an example of what could come to a PlayStation game near

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200
you.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.600
We'll return you to your blood carnage marathon game after this message from some feminine

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.720
yeast infection product.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.240
Could be that would be freaking hilarious actually that I could support just for the

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.840
comic value alone, because I'd want to see a reaction videos to that on the interwebs

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.120
be hilarious.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.800
Now maybe this is related news, but Sony online entertainment or SOE has announced a free

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.520
to play game called bullet run.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:51.400
It's a revamped game from Acony games or this head head head one or head in was the game

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400
with a new title.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400
H-E-D-O-N-E.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.400
Head one.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400
Yeah.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400
Had one.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Could be heading.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400
I don't know.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.920
But this is the bullet run is now kind of the new version of this.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.400
And you can see this at bullet run the game.com.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.200
It's a free to play shooter.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.760
It has a reality show premise to it.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.480
So, you know, reality show killing sprees are all the rage right now, thanks to hunger

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480
games.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.800
So I guess this is kind of like the hunger games, but with like commandos and stuff like

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.800
that.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.140
So, uh, there you go.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:25.040
The developers known for such games as APB and battle forge, meaning they haven't had

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.100
a lot of luck so far, but maybe this will be it.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.920
And maybe this will make Sony money because, Oh, I'm about to score a headshot on my opponent

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:39.480
and have you tried summers Eve?

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.480
Speaking of douches.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.720
It'd be funnier.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.920
It's just relative to the conversation.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
Yes.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:54.600
It'd be funnier if it was in max pain three bullet time advertisement, bullet time over

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.440
advertisement gone.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.760
Interesting.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.640
Tiger call on our chat room says, and you know, those ads that appear in billboards

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.680
and games and such, they actually find ways to block those ads from loading in games.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.720
You know, that ad that pops up on the Xbox live dashboard, there's a little tweak you

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.760
can make the blocks it.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760
So it doesn't load.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.280
I seem to remember reading something about that once where it's like on your router,

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.600
you block a certain domain or something.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.180
It's never have to see that shit.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:24.000
You basically, you redirect, um, certain IPs to your local domain so that it doesn't pop.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.720
Doesn't load those things up.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.520
Um, but yeah, I mean you could do that.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.760
It would be, it depends, but you would all, you would be, you'd be interrupted with a

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.860
blank screen instead.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.640
You know what my favorite way of getting rid of ads is?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.120
I'm not giving a fuck.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.520
Ignore it.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520
How about that?

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.280
Don't give a fuck.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.280
Or just don't.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.360
I mean, this is the day, age of the internet.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.280
You're going to know when there's going to be some source software out there that has

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280
ads in it.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280
It's getting me out of fucking blocks.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.560
Hey, can you imagine this next, uh, God of War game has fucking ads for like, you know,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.960
subway in the middle, middle of the damn game.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.800
Are you out of fucks to give?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.600
Try new Folgers instant coffee.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.400
It will perk you right back up.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400
You'll have plenty of fucks.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400
This is my thing.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.760
If it's free or a very inexpensive service, I don't really care about if there's ads.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.440
You know, if it keeps the costs low or free, fine.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
That's great.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:27.040
You know, if, and then offer, you know, a paid option if you don't want to see the ads.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.920
That's, you know, that I think is fair.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.600
But when you've already paid the money for the game, that's, I think, and then you have

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.880
your game interrupted, that's a little too far.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880
I'm with you.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:44.800
If that and the micro transaction stuff, the Facebook style game in your $60 game, that

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.160
shit pisses me the fuck off.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.040
They're going to keep doing it because they can charge $60 for a game and someone's going

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.400
to pay for it and then they'll just watch the game.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.960
If they charge 20 bucks for the game.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.320
That's why there's going to be another video game industry crash.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
Wait.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.040
If they pay, now if they charge $20 for a game and then had, I refuse to use the word,

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.320
had individual transactions within the game, that I could understand a little bit more

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.080
because then you're paying for the cost of development.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.960
You're paying for the cost of advertising and you're paying for the shipping.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.920
So you're a supporter of Ridge Racer for the Vita, which was basically a $30 game that

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.080
came with nothing.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.360
It was basically a six, six, no, I'm sorry, six cars, three tracks.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.240
That game can ask my D. You know what?

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.880
I paid two bucks for Bust Move and I paid for all the maps, all the puzzles.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.680
I ended up spending six bucks on that game.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.200
You have a two versus 30 is a huge difference, but I'm saying as an example, all right, going

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.080
to our, a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on shadow next gen in our

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.920
chat room at vog network.com says too much effort for something that really doesn't mean

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920
anything.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.600
And I believe that's in regards to blocking the ads.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.800
A Sep when says, I don't have a problem with ads when they fit like ads in a sports game

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.160
that look like the ads you see at a real game.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.120
Yeah, believe it or not, I don't, I don't give a shit about those at all.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.120
It kind of adds to the experience really.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.560
It makes it more realistic.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.760
I mean, it really does.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:08.280
Um, YouTube ads, however, Infinel says stupid ads like on X-Box dashboard make me want to

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.520
avoid that product or service.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
Here's what you do.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520
I don't know if I go that far with it.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520
Here's what you do.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.360
Add people, and this is pure ad genius right here.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:22.840
You make a fighting game, Allah smash brothers or you know, Sony mascot battle rail where

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.960
they're calling it.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:29.260
Um, and you just make it with the mascots from those advertisements and there you go.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.680
It's one big ad that actually fits within the game.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.600
There were a whole games around mascots.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:40.840
Remember like the yonoid and cool spot and exactly and I'm saying make kids, but you

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.760
know what people and how about like Burger King did with their little sneak king and

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.760
all of that.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.040
I saw a copy of sneak king at the flea market yesterday and I almost bought it.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.160
Where the fuck is my goddamn connect games Burger King.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
I've been waiting.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.040
It's so may connect.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.320
That's good advertising.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.280
I think that is clever.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.920
Those Burger King games were one of the best things I've seen actually.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.520
I mean, although the games were stupid, I mean just the fact that they even made them

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.520
is quite astounding.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.920
All right, quickly, I want to read this comment from chat and then we need to move on for

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920
time.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.500
Blender in our chat room says I bought a subway sandwich for the uncharted three freebies.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.280
I got to say that was a really good promotion too.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.280
It really was.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.280
Yeah.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.040
I bought a subway sandwich for those uncharted three freebies as well and they didn't give

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040
up to me.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.520
Yeah, but that's, that's your individual subways fault.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.880
I've been like multiple subways for the stew.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.760
I've been getting like the large, you know, they're all, yeah, by a large drink and you

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.600
get code for some battleship thing.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:39.700
I have yet to get a fucking code and like five different subways, a battleship thing.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.700
It's like for money.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.960
I don't know, but it's, it's tying it with the movie, but not one of them.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.960
I get it.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:50.040
I get it because, because they're sub sandwiches.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040
Congratulations.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.040
You figured it out.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.680
That movie is gonna be such a sink.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:03.200
I saw the best article on, oh no, they didn't, which is one of my favorite websites on the

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.320
entire internet.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.120
It was an article that was just, here is the complete bits of dialogue that Rihanna had

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:16.000
in the movie battleship.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Oh my God.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.680
It was just, it was great.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.800
Anyway, let's move on.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
Video game news.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.000
How about something that's actually cool?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Less battleship.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yes.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.480
Let's move on to the Jima news.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.560
There's been some artwork revealed for a particular game that I know a lot of people are super

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560
excited about.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560
You know what that is?

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.560
No.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.720
A new zone of the Enders.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:42.400
It's the Enders project is in an experimental phase and he's trying to develop the game

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.720
using the Fox engine.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.040
So hopefully we can see this out before too long.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.280
Right now though, it's supposed to be a fully fledged sequel to Zone of the Enders, the

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.840
second runner.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.440
And so hopefully we can see that out before too long.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.960
And there's also been plenty of artwork tweeted by people who were at the press event.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.240
I'd like to see a new zone of the Enders game.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.240
That would be fun.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.240
Yep.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.520
And this event actually was specific for the Zone of the Enders HD collection.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.040
What's up with all these HD collections?

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040
People are buying them.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.320
That's what's up with them.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.720
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some games that are going to be coming

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.160
out a whole lot sooner, as in this week as we travel the world with release dates.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.280
Loki, US.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.200
There's not a whole lot coming out this week.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.360
I mean, some re-releases I guess, or I don't know.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:40.200
We've got Batman Arkham City Game of the Year edition, which is coming out this week, on

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:48.200
PS3 and Xbox 360, with that wonderful Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC and crap thrown in.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200
Hey!

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200
I like how they talk about...

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.160
I know people genuinely excited about that, and I gotta say, it sounds pretty robust.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.800
I'm into it.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800
Robust.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
Like Catwoman.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800
It's robust.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800
Bust.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800
Whatever.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800
Whatever.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:09.640
Let's see, other fun things this week, Dear Drive, Legends on the 3DS.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.040
Get your deer hunting on in 3D.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.640
Atelier Maruru, The Apprentice of Arland on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.440
Resistance, Burning Skies on the Vita.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440
Might have to check that out.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.640
That looks pretty neat.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.760
There's not a whole lot this week.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.280
A lot of it getting cancelled.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.480
Max Payne 3.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.480
That's right.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480
The first is this Friday.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.960
Max Payne 3, Special Edition and the Regular Edition on PC coming out as well.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960
And that's it.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.800
Alright, let's travel to Japan.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.800
Check out the games that are coming out over there in Japan on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.040
I don't think there's a Disney game this week, but for some reason a bunch of character cases

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.040
are coming out.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.320
So if you've ever wanted to stitch character case, import one from Japan, because there's

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.400
a bunch of those coming out there from Hori.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.440
Must tie in to Dream Drop Distance somehow, it must.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.640
But what is coming out on the 3DS, this is kind of a big deal.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.200
Dragon Quest Monsters, Terry No Wonderland 3D.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.520
So it's not in the main series of Dragon Quest games, but still it carries the name.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.760
It is from Square Enix, so it will be a little bit of a deal there.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.660
Guild 01 from level 5 comes out as well.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.000
That's all again on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.880
Taking a look at the other handheld real quick, the Vita, nothing this week.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.740
The next big game is Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny on June the 7th.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:40.200
Taking a look at the consoles real quick on the Playstation 3, Atelier Meru Alchemist

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.400
of Arland 3 gets a price drop into the best collection.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.920
That's also Atelier Rorona gets that same price drop.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.360
Coming out from Sega this week, Jisen Pachi Slot Hishihoho Hokuto no Ken F Sekimatsu Kaishu

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.960
Seisu Densetsu, it's basically another Pachino game, Pachinko, Pachinko game.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960
Not like Al Pachinko.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.960
I heard legend in there somewhere.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.040
Yeah, it's a Sega Pachinko game.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.720
That's what you get.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:11.200
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13, but that is in English, but it's getting a Japanese release.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.240
And hey, Portal 2 gets a price reduction, so if you want to hear what GLaDOS sounds

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.280
like in Japanese, there you go.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.920
Lastly in the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Portal 2 gets that same price reduction, and

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.440
that's really it.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.760
How about the UK, Darkstalker?

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.160
Three things.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:34.040
Mad Riders for Xbox 360 and Resistance Burning Skies for Vita on the 30th, and then we have

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.000
on June 1st, Max Payne 3 for PC.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That's about it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.760
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760
week.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760
But first, Loki.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760
Ah, yes.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.420
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of funny, uh, Kinect.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:57.160
They have new technology now, new technology, where they can detect you sitting down.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:03.880
That's right, Kinect Software Development Kit Update 1.5 now features the ability to

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:08.480
Kinect with you sitting on the couch.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480
And uh...

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.480
Now, it can't tell if I'm wearing pants or not, right?

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.400
Because you know I have this legit fear about the Kinect, that if I, you know, it's my house,

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.200
I'll do what I want, and if I'm sitting in front of the Xbox 360 not wearing pants and

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.280
playing Minecraft, I don't want that image broadcast to the internet, and I have this

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.280
fear in the back of my mind.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.440
I put a little box in front of the Kinect when I don't want to be seen by the internet.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.600
Um, yeah, they don't have that ability in here.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.440
It's not one of the listed features, but uh, other fun stuff, they've got a development

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.440
kit for face tracking, um, also some human interface guidelines and other improvements.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:54.200
Um, also, they're saying that, um, you know, they have full seated skeletal tracking mode,

01:13:54.200 --> 01:14:01.000
which is, you know, to track people sitting down, and uh, they said also that um, I think

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.720
this is more, obviously this is only on, you know, PC, but I think a little bit, since

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.560
most people on PC are probably sitting down to interface with stuff, I would hate to have

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.160
to stand up to, I don't know, read an email or something like that with Kinect.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:23.360
Well it'll be nice too that now you can play Kinect without actually having to move.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.840
It's kind of the nice, you know, antithesis.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:32.000
I'm pretty sure, I mean, the Kinect does detect you sitting down, um, like for some things,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.880
like you can browse menus and stuff like that on the Xbox Kinect, just, uh, I think sitting

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.880
down.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:44.520
I can stand up to browse video menus and stuff like that, um, then again, I'm not, you know,

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.080
stupid enough to hook up Kinect to do that when I can go, huh, controller is faster,

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.960
you know, seriously, why would I need, I never understood why I need to browse those menus

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:03.720
with my arm when I can just put the controller in my hand and just do that, I mean, I, it's

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.240
faster, it really is faster.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:12.520
Voice searches, that's kinda cool, but, you know, moving my hand around to select things,

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.600
that is slower.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.600
Well we will see what this brings into games later on, although couldn't you play Joyride

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.600
sitting down?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.120
Was it supposed to be able to see your hands driving the car?

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.840
Um, I didn't play that long.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.160
Maybe it's because it was only looking at your hands, it wasn't looking at the rest

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.800
of your body, I don't know.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.880
Well there's somewhat of an in-joke amongst the, uh, community of Konami fans that have

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.200
been following them for some time and it's called Konami Will Sue, but maybe this week

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.120
the joke should be changed to Konami Will Be Sued, because Konami was sued this week

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.920
and, uh, you'd be pretty impressed what it's for, it's pretty crazy.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:52.560
City National Bank is the one that's filed the suit against Konami and Autumn Games,

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.480
and it's over fraud, and the reason why is because the bank hasn't received any return

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.080
on a 15 million dollar line of credit that it approved to both Konami and Autumn Games,

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:10.080
and the court documents claim that the financial state of Autumn and Konami were faults at

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.520
the time that they were made and that defendants never had any intention of repaying the loan

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.120
as promised.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.840
That's all a quote from the court documents and so is this, rather than paying game-related

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.980
proceeds directly to CNB or City National Bank as agreed, defendant have kept all game-related

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:32.520
proceeds for themselves and have refused to remit any such proceeds to City National Bank.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.720
Here's what I think, here's what I think the problem is.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.960
I think that they think that those games, or, you know, Def Jam Rapstar was going to

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.060
be successful, and they're like, where's our percentage of, you know, of the profits?

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.960
Why are we only getting, like, ten dollars?

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.880
Well, that is your percentage, actually.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.560
You can't divide by zero, stupid!

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.560
Sorry, uh, that's how much, that's how many copies we sold.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.640
You get a big fat check for twenty dollars.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.540
By the way, that's not the first time there's been a lawsuit over this game, because what

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:09.160
happened in March, EMI Music Group actually also filed a suit over the game's licensed

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:15.720
tracks were not supposed to be there, apparently, so this game has caused a lot more headache,

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.720
probably, for these companies than it was worth, although I do still stand by it, even

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:24.800
though not everybody's into rap music, it really wasn't a bad music game.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.800
It was really kind of too bad that all this shit has fallen out because of it, because

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.800
it really wasn't a bad music game, if, you know, especially if you actually like rap,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800
so.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.660
Alright, let's travel back to a time when we didn't have to read about all these lawsuits

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.760
going on, because there was no internet, or I guess in the particular case of this game,

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.520
there was a little internet, but there were no lawsuits.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.680
There were no laws.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.160
There were no, yes, right, there were no laws in this game, actually, I think this is a

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160
perfect thing.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160
It was lawless land.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.360
Let's travel back in time and visit the classic game of the week.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:05.280
Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks,

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.280
hey, you ungrateful little brat, so you're newfangled crap, go back and play something

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.720
old school, like this.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.360
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.840
There was a game that used to eat up all of my time in early 2000, and I would sit and

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.720
point and click and click and click and click and click, and my husband was so pissed off

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.680
because I was deaf all night playing this damn game.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680
Diablo 2?

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.680
No.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.720
Keep in mind, I didn't play the first two Diablo games.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:39.800
This is Ragnarok Online, which was my crack, and I have, from time to time, been known

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.760
to go back on a free server.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:47.400
I am also one of the people who basically has a permanent account on IRO, the International

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.440
Ragnarok Online, because I played in the beta.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.640
I played in the Korean beta, I played in the Japanese beta, and I played in the US beta.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.360
Yeah, I've played a lot of Ragnarok.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.760
And my last, I think-

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.920
Fuck, even I remember this music.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.160
I remember when I gave you the hair bow, Rob, when you were playing with me.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
I was very pretty with that little hair bow.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160
You were lovely.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160
And you had the red hair.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.160
The red boy hair.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.640
Back when my hair actually looked like that.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640
Yeah.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.760
But I played the ton of this, and I think the last server I played on was EssenceRO.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.480
Good server if anyone's looking for a private server.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.480
Great people.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.320
Anyway, it's made by Gravity.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:31.680
It is based off of the manhwa, which is called Ragnarok, and there was a Ragnarok 3 animation

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680
based off of it.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.320
It was actually a pretty, pretty good little anime.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.320
It really captured the game very well.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.940
You've got different types of gameplay that are in that you have PvE, you have guild versus

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.400
guild, and PvP.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.040
So you can initiate PvP anywhere.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.480
Guild versus guild, I really, really, really liked that function.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.880
Because it was a big capture the flag kind of thing.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.280
And I think that's something that-

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:11.240
And now while I'm not a PvP fan, that is kind of the only reason why I like Battlegrounds

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.240
at all in WoW.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.960
It's because it kind of reminds me of this, even though I didn't do it that often.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.040
Because honestly, I was a PvE person.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.760
I'm always a PvE person.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:30.860
It's sprite based, it is with different 3D environments, and you basically travel all

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:36.280
over this little world in the game getting different creatures.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:42.040
And as long as I played this damn game, Rob, I have not been everywhere in it.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040
It is big.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:49.120
I mean, yeah, I've been to every needed thing on the main map, but there's all the little

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.640
caves and the dungeons and the special areas, and I haven't been everywhere in the game.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:00.480
Although I have been to certain areas of the game many times, like the freaking toy factory.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480
Or pronterra.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480
Pronterra.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.120
Warp to pront, please.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.640
Warp to pront, please.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.240
I'm glad that they took out that warping thing, because that was such a pain.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.520
Usually priests could teleport, and they could open warp portals, and they did something

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.560
because that's not there anymore.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:28.160
But yeah, you also, it really was based heavily off of Norse mythology, and you have different

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.800
classes.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:35.620
They also offered transcendent classes that keep going forward.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.560
So yeah, with the different versions, you have your jobs.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.800
Swordsman starts off as a novice, and then you actually can become a super novice, where

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.960
you get different aspects of other classes.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.140
Then you have a swordman who can become a knight or a crusader, and then rebirth classes

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:56.280
where you start over and rebuild them with more goodies.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:02.260
So basically, your first job class is swordsman, mage, archer, merchant, thief, acolyte.

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.800
And then you can expand to guns, you also have expanded classes such as gunslinger,

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.600
or taequan, which, playing a taequan was actually really fun.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.600
The chat room was getting upset with the music, because it's the only music you ever heard

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.160
in the game, so I switched it, because there was more than one song in Ragnarok Online.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.960
Oh I love that music, that's Juno, isn't it?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.960
I love that area.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.960
Anyway.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.640
I thought you might approve.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.480
After the 2-1, you can actually become a knight, wizard, hunter, blacksmith, assassin, or priest.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.840
I played a blacksmith for a while named Tony Stark, just saying.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.040
Because you can get mecha later on, too.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.320
Moving forward, you also have the 2-2 classes, which is crusader, sage, bard dancer, alchemist,

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.200
rogue, and monk.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:47.200
And then the further go, once they rebirth, you have the 2-1 job, which is lord knight,

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.360
high wizard, sniper, master smith, who gets a mecha, that's awesome, assassin, cross,

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.600
and high priest.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.440
Or the 2-2 job classes, which are paladin, scholar, minstrel, gypsy, biochemist, stalker,

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.440
and champion.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.760
I actually have to say that minstrels are pretty fun.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.720
For female ones, you had a dancer, who basically looks like a harem chick.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.320
There's a soundtrack come out.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.840
There's all kinds of stuff for this.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:20.640
There are pay-to-play servers, and then there's tons of freemium stuff that goes on with it,

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.640
too.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.220
Like the caffer shop, you can buy different stuff.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:30.880
With free-to-play servers, basically, you can play for free, but to support the servers,

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.280
they usually have special freebie goods, or special goods that you can pay for.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.880
Like for one server I played on, there used to be these little dolls you could get that

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880
sit on top of your head.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880
They were selling doll hats.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.560
They had a sprite artist who would make doll hats.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.100
And you paid like 20 bucks, and you got a doll hat.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.080
And it was good because it kept the server paid for, because it does cost money to keep

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080
these going off.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:24:00.560
There's also Ragnarok Mobile, that you can use to focus on your characters.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.720
And then there was the Ragnarok RPG that I've been playing.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:10.040
And there's a version on Game Boy that I, um, you got me the Japanese version of it,

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040
didn't you?

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.040
Yeah.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.040
I played the crap out of that.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.140
Because I could read Prontera, and I knew where I was on the damn map.

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.800
And I think an English version of that since came out, too.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.080
But it is really fun.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:30.000
I would say that if you're looking for just like a little freebie RPG to get into, Ragnarok

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.320
Online is really fun.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.960
And like my favorite class still to this day is Assassin, because it's like pow pow pow

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960
pow.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960
It's just all speed.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960
It was awesome.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.960
So yeah, my game is Ragnarok Online.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:46.080
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Ragnarok Online for the PC.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.000
And various spinoffs on other devices that Darsak are named.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yes.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.320
A game I haven't played in about 10 years.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.880
I have, I've been playing the one on the iPhone lately, and it's pretty fun.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880
That's cool.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:56.880
Yeah.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.880
I might have to check that out.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.480
You play a total- On my shiny new iPad.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.880
You play a total asshole, though.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880
He's so fun.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.880
Good times.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.760
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:12.240
We're going to take a break here live as we are taping our episode number 458B here live

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.880
on May the 27th of 2012.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.400
We're going to take a quick break here.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.400
But don't go anywhere, guys.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.120
We've got plenty more show to come.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.760
We've got some rapid fire news.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:25.480
We have the mailbag FUs of the week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.640
on Skype are all coming up in a little while.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640
So stay tuned.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640
Don't go anywhere.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:38.040
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.520
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:45.600
We are live on this Memorial Day weekend, May the 27th of 2012, with episode number

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.340
458B of our podcast.

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.160
Why is it episode 458B?

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.600
Well, go back and listen to the first part of the show if you want to know why it is

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600
458B.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.800
Anyhow, we're going to get back in with some rapid fire news here.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:07.360
Again, I just want to really plug the VOG conference on Friday at 7 Pacific 10 Eastern

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.120
live at vognetwork.com.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.040
And I'm getting some people that are just sending me their ideas for VOG stuff, and

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040
I love it.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.360
And I know Bobby wants to hear it.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.760
Dark Soccer would like to hear it.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.920
Shit, anybody you can talk to that's one of the hosts on VOG somewhere, Loki, Travis,

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.200
whoever, we love hearing the ideas.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.600
And I'm talking to somebody about one idea right now, I'm like, well, that is a good

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.940
idea actually, yes, we should do that.

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:34.000
And so I love it because it's, you know, just like Orange Lounge Radio, where every gamer

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.840
has a voice was never really just about us, VOG network isn't really just about us either.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.880
So it's about me, everybody know me and my fabulousness.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.880
Stop hating, Rob.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.880
Stop being a parody.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.880
All right.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880
Stop hating.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880
Let's move on.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:48.880
It's about the gaming news.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.980
Now we're going to travel around and check out some quick stories in a segment we call

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.400
Rapid Fire News.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.400
Loki.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.600
All right.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.000
Let's talk a little bit about some upcoming games.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.160
XCOM Enemy Unknown actually has been announced to be coming out on October 9th.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.800
Now I thought, you know, when I first saw this that this means, ah, damn, I guess, you

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:17.640
know, I guess we're not going to have any Grand Theft Auto 5 game announcement for October.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.640
I'm not so sure if that's going to be the case anymore because actually there was an

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:29.520
announcement for, was it Take-Two put out their estimates for their fiscal years and

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:40.280
for 2013, which would cover up through now through, was it March of, March 31st, 2013,

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.660
and then we'll play some awesome music.

01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:50.800
They have about $700 million or, you know, unaccounted revenue in there and even if like

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.000
some of these games do really well, I don't think they're going to hit that spot.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So people are thinking, maybe that's Grand Theft Auto 5 in there somewhere, which honestly

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.600
if it were to come out in October, it would, it probably wouldn't compete very well.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.400
You know, they wouldn't, wouldn't cannibalize stuff.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.280
So God, I hope it's October.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:21.880
Anyways, so yes, XCOM Enemy Unknown, October 9th and I guess 13th internationally as well.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.000
So pretty cool.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.360
And then of course, there's rumors, spoiler, I don't know, that EA's next Need for Speed

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.720
game is actually going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.200
Perhaps a reboot of that franchise.

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.720
Wait, they already had a Most Wanted.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.720
Yes, they did.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.560
They also had a Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but that didn't stop them from having that

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.320
last year.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:51.800
So perhaps Most Wanted could be, you know, put out again.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.460
You know, a new title with the same, I hope it's not the same thing.

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:55.920
It's like Apple's methodology.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.600
It's the new Most Wanted.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.600
Yeah.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.600
So.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600
More Wanted-er.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.840
Maybe Most Wanted 2, I don't know.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:09.280
Apparently there's, you know, a schedule going around showing, you know, that the game's

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:16.880
going to be shown on like EA's booth and also apparently it was, there was a Twitch TV feed

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.960
or something like that for E3 that also has that listed on there as well amongst some

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.640
other TVA titles from Ubisoft.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.120
So yeah, we'll probably see something from, you know, EA for Need for Speed Most Wanted

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.200
whether it be, I hope it's not the same damn title because that's going to be confusing

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.680
because it didn't come out that long ago.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.300
That was only like five years ago.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.440
That's not, that's not that long in game time.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.160
And last but not least, Carmageddon Reincarnation has hit their goal with ten days left to go

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:53.200
and of course, you know, I guess that means we're going to be getting a remade Carmageddon

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200
game.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.840
Also they're saying that they're going to be adding some DLC to it now and probably

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:02.540
going to be setting some different stretch goals for that as well and, you know, funding

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:06.600
will be done in a few more days.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.640
All right, let's move on with some other news.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.760
You ever been to a website where you have to punch in CAPTCHA?

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.120
You know, like if you want to like download something or if you want to register for an

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.280
account, you have to put in CAPTCHA.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.560
And sometimes the words are very like nonsense.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.320
I love this mock up where somebody put kill me in the CAPTCHA.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.320
Well I love this.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.200
Apparently there is- I had destroy enemies once.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200
Did you really?

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.200
Yes I did.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200
That's awesome.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.000
I guess there is a new Detroit based startup company and they're called Are You a Human?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.880
And what they aim to do, they want to replace the CAPTCHA box that people use with mini

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.340
games.

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.340
Why not?

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.340
It accomplishes the same thing.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.880
You wouldn't be able to beat the game if you weren't actually a human.

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:52.600
The tool they're developing is called PlayThrough and it's going to allow a website owner to

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.000
fight bots and spammers by using simple mini games.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.960
For example, there could be a level where you put tools in a toolbox or you put toppings

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.880
on a pizza.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:07.200
Some websites that are already using this, Quicken Loans and Fathead.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.960
I don't know what Fathead does, but-

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.080
Fathead makes giant posters on the wall of sports figures.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080
Oh.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.160
That's why I had no idea who they were.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.160
I don't own any of those.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.680
But I do have a sweet Tron poster.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.720
I don't own any of those either, but the reason I know they do that is because they also have

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.920
that option for your Xbox Live avatar and I'm like why the fuck would I want a six foot

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.520
tall picture of my avatar on the wall.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.920
I really have a big problem with your Tron poster.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.920
What?

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.120
Because it looks like all those little teleporting effects are just really bad use of the blur

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120
tool.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.120
Well, I'm sorry.

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:41.880
Speaking of Tron, I did happen to see that that episode of Tron Uprising was on Disney

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.760
last night and I was like, ooh, that's right, we're only a couple of weeks away from actual

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760
new episodes.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.280
Well, you know what I found out is that funny enough, a week from tonight, they are going

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.600
to be doing some type of kickoff event at Downtown Disney.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.300
Guess where I'm going to be, yo?

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.160
So I plan to bring you a vlog-

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.760
Better bring me Tron stuff.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760
I'm going to-

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.680
We're going to have a neon blue carpet.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:08.560
I am so going, and there will be a full report on vlog for sure, so I'm not expecting much

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.560
though.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.200
For all I know, they're just going to have a giant screen out in the middle of Downtown

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.200
Disney that's playing it.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.200
So we'll see.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.200
Elijah wouldn't be there.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.200
You're going to get kidnapped by a recognizer.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.200
I'd be alright with that.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.200
Paul Rubins was there.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.620
Oh my gosh, it'd be awesome.

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.620
So we'll see.

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.620
We'll see.

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:22.620
I'm not going to hold my breath.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.620
He needs to record a bumper.

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.480
You know who was at Disneyland, by the way, last weekend when we were there?

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.800
Lady Gaga.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.800
Shut the front door.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.600
She was posted on Facebook.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.600
Isn't she like touring?

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.560
Like she was supposed to go to Indonesia and there's the whole hub-a-loo going on there?

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.400
There was a post on her Facebook thing that was at Disneyland.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.280
Well maybe she was at like Hong Kong Disney.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.600
I don't know, but-

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.920
I don't think Hong Kong Disney exists anymore.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920
We looked for her.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920
Yeah, they have.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.600
It used to be an airport years ago.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.000
Anyhow, don't ask me how I know that.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That's Shanghai Disney.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Alright, moving on.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.760
Uh, rumors about a new Castlevania game on the 3DS.

01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:00.280
Apparently the name has leaked out, Castlevania Mirror of Faith.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.800
Supposedly this is a game that's going to be shown at E3.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800
Makes sense to me.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.480
It's about time there's a new Castlevania game out on a handheld.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.480
I have no reason to disbelieve this.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:09.480
Yeah.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.920
Especially because, it's funny because this particular site is a site Nintendo Netherlands

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.000
or whatever.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.140
You might remember, OLR blew the story on that about six years ago.

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.560
One of the DS games we had the exclusive on.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.340
So I have no reason to doubt them.

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:24.340
They're sloppy.

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.040
Let's get out.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.240
It would be interesting if this information that got out is also true.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.980
It has to do with Wii U details.

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:39.880
These are very specific details from Ubisoft Milan apparently leaked these details.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.400
It's Wii U related information.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.920
It was found on an Italian message board.

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.240
Some very specific details.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.640
Now granted this could all be fanboy wank, but I don't know.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.480
They're claiming it's directly from Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft would know some of this

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.860
shit because they are doing some of the launch games.

01:33:54.860 --> 01:34:01.000
Which include for Ubisoft Rayman Legends, The Avengers, Assassin's Creed 3 and Just

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.120
Dance 4.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.280
A game called Killer Freaks from Outer Space, supposed to arrive a few weeks after launch.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.360
Those are some pretty specific, I mean granted about three of those are a duh, but Killer

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.360
Freaks from Outer Space.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360
You can't guess that.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.360
That was announced at E3 last year.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360
Oh was it?

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360
I don't remember that one.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.520
Yeah they even had video of it.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.920
Alright, so maybe it's just somebody using logic, but we'll see.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.880
It looks like a cross between the Rabbids and Critters.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.720
Like the Rabbids were like evil alien things.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.560
Wii U does DirectX 11.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.720
It's already running Unreal Engine 4.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.280
Two gigs of RAM.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.200
560 megs of that dedicated to the OS.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.680
November 23rd, the launch date, but remember that's coming out of Milan so could be a little

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.840
bit around there for other regions.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:47.400
Launch price hasn't yet been decided, but they're saying 350 to 450 which tells me 399.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.040
Multiple versions of the console out there with developers.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.920
Graphics being powered by a Radeon HD 6770 chipset.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:57.120
Assassin's Creed 3 is 60 frames a second at 1080p.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.240
It is only running 720p on the other consoles right now.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:04.320
November 23rd would be a Friday, I don't know if they'd launch it.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.240
But that's, again, that's Milan.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.820
That's not America.

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.080
So there's some time is some shift with the days.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080
And you know the other thing.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080
Add those Italians.

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:17.080
Well here's the problem I have with Ubisoft, this information coming from Ubisoft Milan,

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:23.360
because Ubisoft Milan would be a, it's basically a portion of the company that does development

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360
for certain games.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.240
So which game are they working on that they would be privy to this information?

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:34.840
Because, you know, Ubisoft Milan, let's see, let's, I'm sorry, I can't hear Ubisoft Milan

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:42.480
without hearing in the back of my head RuPaul saying, London, Paris, Milan.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.320
I fully expect nobody listening to this show will get that joke.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.000
But maybe one, maybe one person.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.280
Alright.

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.560
The Wii U comes with pre-installed software, which really wouldn't be a stretch for Nintendo.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.280
You know, they have some basic shit on all their platforms, like the Mii Plaza, for example

01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.320
on 3DS.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:05.160
Most interesting about this, Valve working on a digital distribution platform and portal

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.160
ports.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.840
That could be very interesting if Valve is involved with the Wii.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.400
That's going to bring a heck of a lot of, you know, like, core gamer quote unquote oomph

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.400
to the Wii U.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.400
That would be amazing.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.840
One other thing I'll say here, the new button supposedly has some link to the Wii Vitality

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840
sensor.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.720
So maybe a new form of it or something like that.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.840
Well I figured it would be a biometric button.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:33.960
Alright so, that's it for the Wii U rumors, so let's move on with some more rapid fire

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.960
news.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:42.520
Okay, Rob, well, how about some stuff having to do with touch screen graffiti controls

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.400
for Jet Set Radio.

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.360
This is for the Vita release.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:50.760
Basically, well, and there's still not a date on it yet, but they're saying that they're

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:58.400
bringing in touch screen controls and camera integration so that I guess you can, for customizing

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.860
your tags in the game.

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:02.780
So that should be pretty cool.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:09.480
And then this is the thing that I lusted over yesterday, and, oh my god I want this so bad,

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:22.200
it like seriously makes me moist, the Street Fighter 25th anniversary collector set that

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:34.040
comes in a big black box has a Ryu figure, 15 discs that includes on it, Super Street

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.480
Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, Super Street

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.320
Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, and the DLC, and Street Fighter Cross Tekken, and the DLC with

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:48.040
a documentary, two anime movies, the full Street Fighter animated series, and 11 discs

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.040
of music.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.880
And it has a light up Ryu statue and Ryu's belt.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.360
That is too much Street Fighter.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.120
For 150 bucks.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120
You know what?

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120
I want it.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.440
Of course you do, because you are a consumer whore.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440
And how.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.720
But really, I don't care because I freaking love Street Fighter.

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:10.600
I'm looking at this set and oh my dear god, it just, I'm literally moist right now, I

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.240
can't help it.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.760
So how about Harry Potter stuff?

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:15.760
How about it?

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Um, apparently there's going to be a Harry Potter for Kinect and there's a trailer out.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.160
It's got a really creepy face capture thing on it.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.600
It does, but it actually looks pretty good.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:34.880
As long, I, it looks good in the trailer, but then I'm like, the games are never really

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.220
like that.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:38.360
Just make the damn MMO already.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.160
You know what?

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:47.280
Screw Harry Potter because fucking Ryu, no he's underage, statue, not anymore, statues,

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:54.720
statue of Ryu that lights up with, it even has a certificate of authen-fucking-ticity.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.720
How can you pass that off?

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.840
So you know it's authen-fucking-tistic.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.400
It'll go on my wall and I will stare at Ryu for hours because that, you know, that was

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.080
my first video game crush was Ryu when I was a little kid.

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.000
Aww, that's kind of adorable.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yep.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Okay.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I'm done.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm spent.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I'm really spent.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Alright.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:24.440
Let's move on to the foogle question of the week.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.720
The foogle question of the week is a segment of our show where we ask a question on Facebook

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.880
and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880
We didn't ask one tonight.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.300
Some of you might have said, hey, I didn't see a new question on Facebook or Google this

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300
week.

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:41.920
That's because, you know, we never got to read last week's answers because of the crash

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.880
and it was a pretty timely question.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.080
So I want to go through some of those right now.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.680
So we're going to start on our Google Plus page.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.080
Shit.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.680
I just dropped that brand new iPad of mine.

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.040
How convenient.

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.040
That's why I have a case on it.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040
Well, here's the weird thing.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.760
I can't access Facebook right now.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.360
Can you access Facebook, Logan?

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.640
Can I access Facebook?

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640
Oh, there it went.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.640
It just went.

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.640
Okay, good.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.520
Because I was getting worried that I was going to miss the questions here.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.520
Alright, anyhow.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.520
The question of the week, more and more games are incorporating multiplayer into their games.

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.560
For example, Mass Effect 3.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.920
Some in the industry have been quoted as saying that multiplayer is essential in this day

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.120
and age to having a successful game.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.080
How important do you feel that multiplayer is to the games you purchase?

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.040
Have you ever been swayed on a game purchase because of the fact that it did or did not

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.240
have multiplayer?

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.080
Reddertainment answers the question and says, multiplayer is irrelevant to me due to my

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:41.040
ISP being fucking incompetent, PSN being incompetent, and me canceling Xbox Live Gold as part of

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.040
my effort to buy a house.

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:47.080
So in other words, the world is out to get him.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.280
Vilagas responds and says, these are all from Google Plus again, Uncharted, Gears, Halo,

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280
etc.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.000
All have some form of competitive multiplayer that I've never tried.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.920
I only buy games for the single player component due to the rampant negativity on the online

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.920
services.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.000
I do love co-op multiplayer with my family or friends.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.840
Tell Jamie I apologize for my bad grammar and punctuation.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.960
Well, you apologize to the wrong person.

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.960
And I'm mad.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:13.960
No, I'm just kidding.

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:14.960
You actually didn't do a bad job.

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.040
I'm, I'm, I have pretty bad grammar myself, so I'm usually pretty forgiving.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.040
All right.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.760
And lastly, Jim from who he was supposed to be here last week to answer this in person,

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.440
but he decided to go on Google Plus and answer instead.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.920
Flaco Jones, I don't care much for multiplayer modes in games because I'm all about the story

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.260
and it doesn't make much sense story wise when there are seven Nathan Drakes running

01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:36.600
around shooting other players at the same time.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:44.360
Plus, I rent or buy used, so I don't get even get to play multiplayer thanks to online passes.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.120
Let's go to the Facebook community now that Facebook is working for me at facebook.com

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.180
slash orange lounge radio and read some of the answers that you guys sent us over there.

01:41:53.180 --> 01:42:00.260
And we're going to start off with a reply from DDR dollar bill who says never as in

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:05.120
has you ever been swayed, never multiplayer, never made or break a purchase for me.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.400
It was nice, but it wasn't life or death either.

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:12.840
And it wouldn't change a game grade by one point if it was included nor excluded JV Mon

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.520
says I almost never play multiplayer online.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.720
And if I do, it's only with friends who usually don't buy the same games as me.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.900
Even then cross game chat fixes that problem and we can hang out while playing.

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.220
So would it sway me?

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.040
Not at all.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.240
So we have a lot of people that are like no, no, no, never, never, never.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.240
Let's go to an answer from Red the Haze.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.100
I've no problems with added multiplayer as long as it's good, builds on the single player

01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:44.880
game and adds to the experience but has no negative consequences to the single player.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.360
Just like when I bought Mass Effect 3 when it was on sale for 30 bucks just for multiplayer

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.420
even though I haven't played Mass Effect 2, but I plan to play 3 once I get to.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:57.640
So that's somebody who kind of went and bought a game that's more known as a single player

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.940
experience for the multiplayer component.

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.400
Kind of interesting.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.160
Panaxium responded and said I do enjoy multiplayer as an option but only when the production

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.420
quality is high.

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:10.600
An example is Metroid Prime 2.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.360
It included multiplayer but it was half-assed and got boring very quickly.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.480
However Prime Hunters was a lot more fun except for the cramping controls but I digress.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:26.520
In the end I would rather have an amazing single experience than half-baked multiplayer.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.680
Mike B. responded saying I think it's great as long as it has a co-op story mode.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.000
It is fun playing through the story with friends.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.240
I kind of like that whole co-op versus versus too because I think the type of multiplayer

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.360
can really change a lot too.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.960
I think that's really important to state too.

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.580
I think a game like LittleBigPlanet really is enhanced by the multiplayer and that's

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.000
one game I didn't really see get brought up here but a game like LittleBigPlanet really

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.560
gets enhanced because it's more of a co-op.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.080
And of course I'm into Mass Effect 3 right now and a lot of that is because it's co-op.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.320
Acidic Vampire brings up Mass Effect and says it isn't necessary especially for established

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:09.900
single player franchises but sometimes it can be a welcome addition that doesn't take

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.440
away from its campaign.

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.680
Portal 2, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 are just a few examples.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.340
Those are all really good examples.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:27.800
Let me read one more from John K. I've never bought a game because multiplayer was included.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.760
In fact, sometimes attempts to shove multiplayer into a great single player franchise can take

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.620
a lot away from the experience.

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:37.320
For example, the most recent Ratchet and Clank game.

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.680
All for One was designed to be four player co-op and the changes to the camera and controls

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.720
to allow for all that but made the game unplayable.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.880
Even playing as a single player, it was more frustrating than fun.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.200
So again those are all answers from our Facebook account, facebook.com slash orange lounge

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200
radio.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.700
Come thumbs up us over there and you can answer a question in a future week.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.320
How about you guys here in studio?

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.880
How important is multiplayer to you?

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.880
Not at all.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.280
I don't really give a crap about it.

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.280
You really go out of your way to avoid it.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.400
But yet you play an MMO.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.640
Yeah but you notice what do I do most of the time?

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.560
I quest, I play by myself and just chat with people.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.260
It's the having to play with other people.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.720
Like I like raiding okay because I'm with my guild mates.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.640
I'm with people that I pretty much know.

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.200
PvP I hate.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.100
I mean I don't really mind doing like the most fun that I have in dungeons is when basically

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:36.480
I've just tagged along with you know with the ones that you've done for like what was

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:42.560
that one that was really fun that you drug me around in your motorcycle for?

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.560
The Isle of Conquest?

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.280
Yeah, Isle of Conquest.

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:47.560
That was fun because I was playing with you and Alan.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.560
Yeah.

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560
That was fun.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.600
But I I just have this thing about the random stranger thing.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:57.520
I'm all you know appearances to the contrary I am a bit of an introvert.

01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:04.980
You know I I've taught myself how to be outwardly extroverted but really I kind of like to do

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.440
my own thing and stick with the folks I know.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.140
You know so I lost my train of thought.

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:14.140
That's all right.

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.240
I'll go ahead and just say I really agree with the answer that said it's best when it

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.760
more enhances a single-player game that's already there especially the the examples

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:27.880
of Portal 2 and Mass Effect 3 I think are two great examples of where multiplayer really

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:32.760
just sweetened the pot for a game that would have already been worth the asking price.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:36.720
See I would play Portal 2 multiplayer as long as I played with someone I know.

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.720
Right which I think you I don't think you can play Portal 2 with strangers can you?

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:49.720
But it's like now when I used to do PSO fantasy star online you know you could run into people

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.460
just wait looking for groups in random but for the most part I played with my friends

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:57.680
we would lock the room and put stupid passwords on them like butt cheese.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:00.840
That was one of our passwords.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.840
You're so mature.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.880
All right before I get to Loki's answer let me get to our chat room.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.240
Some folks talking about Skyrim because you know obviously Skyrim gets brought up as a

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.800
game that didn't need multiplayer to be successful.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.120
Jim Sally says Skyrim is awesome but it would be twice as good if a co-op mode was added

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.920
and a lot of people have been asking for something like that.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.360
But Shadow Next Gen says I don't know if Skyrim would be good with co-op that game is really

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360
all about your personal choices.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.840
Very true.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.640
Loki lastly with you what how important is multiplayer to you?

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.760
It all depends on the game I mean some games I don't really care other games kind of want

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:40.320
it in there like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty or Minecraft I don't know it just

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:48.840
it depends like I don't necessarily need multiplayer for Final Fantasy or something like that.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.080
Blender brings up a great point in our chat room what about Journey Orange Lounge Radio

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.960
and he's not talking about the one from the 80s about the band he's talking about that

01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.440
new one on PlayStation Network and I gotta say no one's bought it for me yet well I have

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.440
it and I've played through it and I gotta say Journey is like on a whole nother level

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:08.840
with the multiplayer it's like a new type of multiplayer experience you can't even really

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.520
define don't have to talk to them do you know you never do perfect you that's the beautiful

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.620
thing about Journey they're there and they're with you they can only talk to you through

01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:22.360
song through one button that kind of hums a little tune and it's your choice you can

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.740
follow this person you can try to work with it and try to develop your own communication

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:32.640
style it which it's it's so crazy like the simplicity of the game and kind of what it's

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.640
done for multiplayer games Journey again if you haven't played it on PlayStation 3 and

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.440
you own a PlayStation 3 you really gotta check it out it just it's amazing it was better

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:47.260
when people didn't tell you there was a multiplayer component and I did not even know there was

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:53.280
gonna be multiplayer in it and I was just blown away amazing anyhow that's gonna do

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.520
it for the frugal question of the week thank you to everybody who responded we had a ton

01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:00.520
of answers on Facebook I'm so sorry I didn't have time to read all of them but answer us

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.840
in a future week and we'll try to get some in you can always get your thoughts through

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:10.080
to our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll read those in a future week for

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.420
now we don't have any yeah sadly we didn't get any mail this week so we don't have anything

01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:20.480
to read but maybe in a future week for now though let's get to some news Loki all right

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:27.040
so let's talk a little bit about I don't know Activision you may remember that Bungie has

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:33.600
entered into an agreement with them to create this next big franchise and they are they're

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.620
actually right now according to the leaked documents that you know kind of show this

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:46.560
agreement it's for a project called destiny and also you know they're talking about like

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:52.080
some of the expected you know bonuses and stuff based on you know performance and also

01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.320
saying that you know they're gonna have you know a version of the game is gonna come out

01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:04.760
on the Xbox 360 you know also in the fall 2013 and that there's gonna be follow-ups

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:09.720
in multiple years and it's supposed to be a four-part you know four game deal and also

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:17.320
at the end of that they're gonna have the option to fund a new marathon game so that's

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:25.280
kind of neat I mean that's definitely a lot of corporate mumbo-jumbo at least in the leaked

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:30.240
document but it'd be cool to see what this new destiny game supposed to be like a code

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:35.360
name it'll probably be like Halo I'm thinking it will be I was hoping it would be Pimps

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.480
at sea but you know unfortunately we can dream but that's not gonna happen but yeah it'll

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:49.200
be pretty cool all right let's go to a story about Diablo 3 because unfortunately Diablo

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:58.160
3 allegedly hacking going on in Diablo 3 right now and a lot of people coming into Diablo

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.120
3 remembering Diablo 1 and 2 as a single-player game have no part of this whole authenticator

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.520
and ways to protect their account so you know Blizzard's coming in and saying well people

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:16.080
need to be more careful with their account information but apparently and I apparently

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.480
it has come through in recent days that there are a small number of accounts that are being

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:26.720
hacked with authenticators on them but it's coming through malware on the user system

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:30.560
and the blue posts that are on the forums are very adamant that yeah we're looking at

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.660
the msinfo files of people that are saying they're getting hacked with an authenticator

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:39.740
and they've got all sorts of malware on the system and that's where it's coming from so

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:43.940
this whole single-player always connected experience is really starting to rub people

01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:48.600
the wrong way and this is just the latest feather in that hat like really I did not

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.320
want to fucking deal with this and now people are getting hacked and all this shit because

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:56.880
they don't have an authenticator on their account I mean Blizzard or Diablo 3 had amazing

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.800
sales in their first week but what is the long-term damage this shit is causing we talked

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:06.160
a little more about this on Hoard House this week at www.hoardhouse.com my World of Warcraft

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:11.240
themed spin-off show but to kind of ask here a little bit Loki I think you're a good one

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:16.640
to ask because you're not as sucked into this Warcraft phenomenon as Dark Soccer and I are

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:22.400
what are your thoughts about Diablo 3 being always connected and have they screwed PC

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:28.320
games that might want to explore this in the future with this consistent botched thing

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.480
after another well I never like any always connected games there you know especially

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:36.440
if it's not required if it's not an MMO then what's the point of me having to be always

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:41.000
required you know a connection for this to happen I mean because you know say if I want

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.040
to game my laptop doesn't mean I'm gonna have Wi-Fi anywhere you know everywhere I go and

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.440
you know that kind of sucks if I can't play my game that I purchased because I don't have

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:58.720
an internet connection at the time I mean I don't know it yeah it's another reason why

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:04.480
I wouldn't get the game I guess other than you know just don't really want to buy the

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.720
game burn our chat room asks so it's malware the rumor was it was joining public games

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:16.160
that opens you up to it you know Blizzard is passionately denying those claims as we've

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.340
learned though throughout other parts of the game industry that doesn't necessarily always

01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:25.880
mean anything though I would like to think that that they've tested that and it's true

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:29.260
but and just because you have more where I mean because there's a lot of malware out

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:35.560
there but I mean just saying up well we can see that yeah malware on your system is it

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.080
the same malware for each thing I mean is it I mean what kind of what exactly is this

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:45.040
malware do is it's like because there's malware that just I go search something on Google

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.560
and also I get transferred to another page that has nothing to do with what I just search

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.480
for it's like another search engine or is it something that's like I'm specifically

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:58.760
putting this malware on your system to steal your information also why can't Blizzard just

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:03.700
to give extra protection to the accounts very similar to what Star Wars the Old Republic

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:08.440
did you have these personal questions that only you would know the answer to and whenever

01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.280
Star Wars suspects that you're making a major change or you're doing something weird where

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:18.000
it might not really be you it asks you to answer three of those questions at random

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:25.160
you know why couldn't they gee you usually play Diablo 3 in Sacramento California all

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:30.000
of a sudden you're trying to log in from China maybe I should ask you a private question

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
that only you would know the answer to because the odds that you were playing in California

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.460
and now you're suddenly playing in China are very very low or here's a thought since we've

01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:48.600
you know we've gotten these MS you know these little readouts of what processes you have

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.160
running and stuff and we've noticed that there's specific malware you know programs or whatever

01:54:54.160 --> 01:55:01.020
running hey you know you have some sort of device that runs before the program launches

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.760
to detect for people using cheat devices and stuff maybe I don't know add these programs

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:11.880
in there so that you know hey you try to launch Diablo and you get this you know pop-up saying

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:16.360
hey there's more and your system is gonna steal your Diablo identity if you play Diablo

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.440
maybe you should I don't know clear that off or something why don't they have that since

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.960
they could do that very easily oh it's because probably none of that has any information

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.560
it's like saying oh well you know you you've got some sort of virus on your computer so

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.920
there must be how that must be how they're hacking your system and seriously most malware

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.760
that you'll find are usually like site trackers that type of thing nothing that's really going

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:49.040
to have anything it's for advertising that's all it is so all right let's hope Blizzard

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:53.080
can patch this shit up I I seriously think they're doing some long-term damage here I

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.240
did find a new patch applied last night oh yeah yeah I didn't see what it was for but

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.880
they did patch my game last night I think they've been doing as a variety of fixes they

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:05.040
keep pushing back that real money auction house that's the other thing that tells you

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.280
there's a problem that was supposed to be Diablo's bread and butter and hasn't happened

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:15.880
so anyhow we were going to move on to the mailbag at this point but I believe when you

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:21.680
check before the show started it was empty right to quote a line from a masterpiece of

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:29.960
a movie which is called Spaceballs we ain't found shit if you I guess some people in chat

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.880
are saying they emailed within the past hour or so well check it again you want to check

01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:38.480
it again we'll do that we'll do the FUs of the week first so usually the time we do that

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.840
oh I was looking was to jump in well I was just gonna jump in with some random stuff

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:48.340
so I figured I'd already logged in we have one I was doing Google searches for information

01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:52.500
regarding you know this Xbox jacking stuff it's actually a whole bunch of information

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:59.240
about doxing which is finding up finding out the information on people like their name

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:04.520
city state all the personal information based on some of their stuff and that's how they

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:11.760
steal accounts it's by knowing all your personal information tons of ebooks on it too be careful

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.920
who you add on your social networks that's for sure so we have one all right yay we do

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.960
have an email after all of course question for the staff what has to be the single most

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.440
expensive gaming accessory you have purchased for your gaming console and to read the disclaimer

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.640
this email was brought to you by anime jam session the podcast about anime cosplay convention

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:35.800

01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:45.040
ever seen in the history of this show I'm gonna ask a really generic question and then

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:51.040
plug I read it out of my mic mic machines that's all right you know what because we

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:57.360
love anime jam session john machina was great we're gonna allow it yes all right I did buy

01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:05.520
my husband steel battalion oh yeah yeah I paid 300 bucks and bought him steel battalion

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:11.980
of course he in return has bought me thousands of dollars of beymani equipment you know we

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:18.800
bought my uh both my dance pads for uh together for 160 for my dreamcast ddr which I think

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.400
the game was also about 70 bucks so um but keep in mind if you look at my beymani collection

01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:31.280
I've got a pop music controller I have four 2dx controllers now I have two guitar freaks

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:36.940
controllers a key I have a keyboard for keyboard mania I have a drum controller for um drum

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:41.840
mania and then we have all this crap we have for guitar hero so it's really hard to say

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:45.680
when you look at the whole thing but I think the single most expensive has to be the steel

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:52.240
battalion controller because that was 300 bucks um I would say the most expensive I

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.040
know this probably doesn't count for the original question but I fucking bought a Japanese PlayStation

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.060
2 just so I could play all those beymani games back in the day so I think I think I get that

01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:05.880
one especially you know I bought the controller I bought the ddr mats all to work with the

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:12.120
Japanese we bought a jps2 yeah keyboard I bought I bought fucking keyboard mania okay

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.480
I think I think that qualifies I can tell you what our most expensive game was what

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:22.720
was probably dracula x oh yeah yeah that's right Loki um I bought an arcade cabinet to

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:28.640
put in ddr in never really got around to putting ddr in it though but looking at accessories

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:35.480
on their own what is the most small my rock man stuff because I have you know a hundred

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:42.040
dollar guitar here and drum set and another bass guitar they got specially that's collecting

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:49.040
dust under my desk at work now what was your most expensive system what is the most you've

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:58.040
ever paid for a single video game system my first xbox 360 oh you you dumb bastard you

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:09.080
did pay a lot for that most I paid for a system might be my playstation 3 I think a ps3 was

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:13.520
more expensive than importing the playstation 2 I will second that because keep in mind

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:19.240
when we bought ours we still have our first model ps3 and thanks to discover we got a

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.080
hundred bucks knocked off of it because we got a reward on it so we paid 600 bucks for

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:28.980
our first model ps3 now the one and only bobby blackwolf in our chat room at vog network

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:34.880
dot com said I own a very expensive set of Roland V drums and I just put it on twit pic

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:40.880
so that is that does work with that does but that's not really necessarily an accessory

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:44.960
okay so then moving forward to it let's because I really like elaborating on this one what's

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:50.720
the most you've ever paid for a game the most I've ever paid for a game um again Japanese

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:58.360
importing probably beat media 2d x6 style I want to say was probably the most expensive

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.280
one I got because I got that when it was brand brand new I eventually paid more than a hundred

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.360
dollars for a game no I don't think I paid a hundred and twenty dollars for the Sailor

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:12.720
Moon's super s fighting game on Super Famicom actually I take that back add up all the months

02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.360
of World of Warcraft but I'm saying for the game itself hey Alan's joining us and I think

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:25.240
wants to say something hi Alan so we're talking about more most spent on a game yes sir when

02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:30.280
I was there was a year or two where I was importing Japanese games and I only got four

02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.760
or five of them but I want to say Tobel number two the sequel to the square fighting game

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:41.260
I think I spent close to like 90 95 bucks all told to get that game it also had the

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:48.340
demo on it though for um Final Fantasy 7 wasn't it yeah uh Alan remember when we had disposable

02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:53.840
income I know right what about you let me ask my iPad says hi what's the most you've

02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:02.040
ever paid for a game standalone didn't come with anything else Motorstorm apocalypse because

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:07.520
it was a beta or it was a bear yeah you bought that on eBay or something didn't you yeah

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.760
yeah so I would know what about people who bought that Capcom met game that was like

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:19.100
200 bucks because they had the whole controller oh still battalion I've got I've no check

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:26.440
this now I have two copies and two controllers you're sick but I mean that would love okay

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:33.680
so no no no no what is the rarest system that you own I love SSG 100 Matt the most I've

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:39.800
ever spent on a game was Yaris for zero points paid way too much for it I agree I'm sorry

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.200
the most we ever spent on a what a system what do you think is your most valuable system

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:50.960
that you own in terms of personal value and then in terms of financial value my still

02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.240
working Super Nintendo in terms of personal value in terms of actual I don't really have

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:05.080
a lot of rare systems I don't really have any old shit that still works the HD DVD player

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:16.000
on my Xbox 360 arcade system for most valuable and for personal value the Xbox of Fame the

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Xbox oh good answer the one that's been autographed by one of the Avengers now yes look at that

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.360
so for me and yeah I know I've got the collection and this is unfair but actually I think that

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:35.160
our most I think our most valuable one is our Neo Geo although we do have a turbo duo

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:40.640
but my personal favorite is the turbo duo because no country lockout you can play your

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:46.800
Japanese games no problem unless you get a game that requires the arcade card and then

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:53.620
you have to have a duo RX alright let's talk about how much money we've spent on this sick

02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:59.800
obsession here burn the chat room is trying to call me out saying sky had disposable income

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:04.600
that could have gone to improving the show talking about that stinkin power device did

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:10.380
but it's a lot of money into the show hey this iPad I just did the Facebook questions

02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:15.600
for the frugal question of the week off the iPad so it did go to improving the show just

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:21.080
so you know me by the way I'd like to answer a niche or is it niche or niche whatever I

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:26.400
think is Nietzsche Nietzsche that's not how the philosophers name is spelled well whatever

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:32.040
there should be a T and a Z in there we did not buy a 3do because there is all of crap

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:39.080
for 3do we did almost buy a CDI if you want me to go through the list of what we own no

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:44.600
we'll need a whole other show for that all right that's it for the mailbag now we will

02:04:44.600 --> 02:05:06.920
do the F use of the week angst anger rawr

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:12.880
I'm angry at being sick because I mean I feel tons better now this is what's funny I slept

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.460
all day yesterday I mean literally almost all day yesterday and that sucks most of this

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:22.760
morning had weird ass freakin fever dreams and then I go out on my bicycle feeling like

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:26.920
crap because I needed to go get Nyquil from the Kmart around the corner for my house so

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:30.400
I mean it's about a mile you know I rode my bike a mile there got all my stuff wrote it

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:37.020
back with a backpack full of stuff and I was so hot and feverish and shaky when I got home

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:42.280
I think my fever broke from my bike ride because now like my lungs feel better I still have

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:46.480
a do you know the stupid sinus headache but I feel like infinitely better than I have

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:53.080

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:41.680
then my other F you the week goes to this cough that will not leave because I've had

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.440
this cough for like two weeks you remember when I was sick on the show a couple weeks

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:48.400
ago that I still have the cough if I may just hiding it well yes ma'am dark soccer's medical

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:55.360

it causing the cough anymore okay that's how mine has gotten better all right and lots

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.160
of nyquil a couple more stories for you guys then you guys on the skype line at one eight

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:51.560
seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio loki all right so let's

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.280
talk once again about more Activision drama this kind of ties in with the whole lawsuit

02:07:56.280 --> 02:08:06.040
between you know the Wesson Zampella versus Activision and just some of the dirty stuff

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:11.000
that went on obviously the first part of the lawsuits been settled but there's still the

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:17.820
whole lawsuit against those people there was this thing that came out called project icebreaker

02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:23.260
apparently it was an initiative designed by Activision to secretly scour the computers

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:29.680
of those two individuals for evidence that would support a firing this involved them

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:36.720
attempting to hack into their accounts or their systems also the possibility of faking

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:40.400
a fire drill to get them to leave the building so that someone could go and hack into their

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:48.120
computers just dirty shit I mean seriously I can't believe that they would even I can

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:55.040
believe that they could do that because it's Activision also you know of course some of

02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:00.840
the stuff you know during that's been released is spreadsheets talking about the top 20 and

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:06.140
Finney Ward employees and their salaries and of course Wesson Zampella have made quite

02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:14.120
a bit of money apparently they've each you know they were expecting bonuses over six

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:21.200
hundred thousand dollars and supposed to be getting additional losses from you know the

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.600
sale of new games for one point four to two point five million dollars that's quite a

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:35.520
bit of money thirteen million dollars in bonuses total for 2010 I was reading some of that

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.380
crazy shit on the internet those Activision emails and so forth and it's just it's a scary

02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:46.960
inside look to how some of this shit operates it's it's man it's almost evil it is evil

02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:56.120
it's not almost evil we know how evil they are when you're asking some for like a lawyer's

02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:02.760
asking somebody to do something illegal and they're you know they're like I don't know

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.920
if I'm comfortable with doing that you know it's just ridiculous well let's move from

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:15.200
something evil to just kind of shady it has to do with THQ and I guess they're gonna be

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:19.160
having a June 29 stockholders meeting where they're gonna do what's called a reverse stock

02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:24.360
split to avoid a delisting from Nasdaq I guess that's really not shady it's just business

02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:29.200
but it's I guess it's sad a tricky way of doing it is it's totally is a little bit like

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:35.120
the shell game they are gonna have some pissed off investors so anyhow apparently what's

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:40.080
gonna happen is that they have to do the stock split to maintain one dollar per share minimum

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.840
that Nasdaq requires apparently they're gonna be three options in the process one of three

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:51.080
one of five and one of ten reverse stock split ratios any of these options it means there

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:56.080
are fewer outstanding shares with an increased apparent value per share so for example if

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:01.640
they do a one to three reverse stock split each stockholder will own one stock for every

02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:06.800
three that they had prior to the split even though the total value of the company doesn't

02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.240
change so that sixty one cents that they're currently trading at they do a one of ten

02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:16.760
now it's oh it's six dollars ten cents a share but hopefully one share and say I only have

02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:22.880
one share instead of ten exactly but they can do that they have happens if you have

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:27.280
like two stock or two share that's how I was gonna say there's a lot of not people to get

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:31.080
novelty stock you know they just buy one share but then again how many people just buy one

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.000
share of thq probably not you got more people to do that shit with like Facebook or Disney

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.940
or you know coca-cola or Pepsi you know what big companies there's there's there's actually

02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:46.440
a company out there some website and I hate that I'm giving them free advertising but

02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.560
whatever it's like buy one share calm or one share calm and they actually do this whole

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.400
little stick where they they'll print out a certificate you can frame it you know it's

02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.080
like a gift-giving thing it's kind of a kind of a neat idea for a gift like imagine it

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:04.640
I think they did a report on some website the other day and it was like if you had bought

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:11.760
a one share of Apple in like 1982 it would be worth a thousand dollars now my mom who

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:17.080
actually worked for Intel for a while you know part of their thing was that each employee

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:23.280
got you know a certain amount of stock well this is way back you know in the seventies

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.800
and eighties and stuff and she still has to she found their certificate in the attic the

02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:33.920
other day wow and it's funny as we looked into it and that's split so many times since

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.880
you know that one like one share of stock were around I only think is one shares like

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:43.760
a few shares of stock is like a hundred and fifty shares of stock now it's just like ridiculous

02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:51.160
oh wow that's still really cool though yeah like you can sell that you know alright well

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.800
now we're going to get to the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to give us

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:59.680
a call right now one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:03.360
radio give us a call we'll talk about anything we've talked about prior tonight or maybe

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:06.100

02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.000
was a lot of stuff we had to cut from tonight's show and it's just it's picking up as we move

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:30.840
towards e3 um I'm sure we've got some stuff here of course I'm not ready as usual um still

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:36.680
looking at those the hacking stuff it's very interesting just I can't believe all the information

02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:40.800
that they have out there you know basically telling you use like those like white pages

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:47.080
or reverse searches and stuff like that to find um how people's personal information

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:52.480
um that you know your phone company and stuff collects so you can hack someone's xbox live

02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.720
account it's ridiculous um let's see here we can talk about uh silicon knights this

02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:01.680
is kind of funny silicon knights you know they were um had this lawsuit against epic

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.320
because they're saying your engine was too hard to use that's why our game sucked balls

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:16.280
um and apparently they they failed to um provide evidence you know of damages or whatever uh

02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:21.360
for their lawsuit and so the um the judge assigned them their own value of a dollar

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.600
so if they win their claim they get a dollar a whole dollar a whole dollar you can buy

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.640
a candy bar with that maybe all right we got a call coming in let's go to the phones hi

02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:33.440
you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the one person actually sent an email into

02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:38.080
the mailbag ron you know what's funny is that the chatters were like no rama doesn't get

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:41.940
through tonight rama does not get to calling because he sent an email but when nobody else

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:48.480
calls you guys i can't help it i have the fastest internet in america to beat everybody

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:53.720
else 99 at a time you're just that awesome what's on your mind tonight rama um my what's

02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.660
on my mind is a bit of a hardware review which is in conjunction with the email that i sent

02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:02.880
earlier when i was at pax east playing uh at the squirt enix booth they had these nice

02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:07.800
headphones and i was playing a theater rhythm with it i was like the music quality is just

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.660
phenomenal where did you get it they told me they had it at the astro gaming booth i

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:17.080
checked out their equipment and after thinking about it for all of five seconds i decided

02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:21.900
to buy them but not right away i decided to save my money get them for my birthday and

02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:30.980
which i did so now i own a pair of astro a30 gaming headsets with a powered mix amp which

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:41.140
is perfect for xbox 360 pc television and cell phone and i have to say audio quality

02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:48.220
is quite phenomenal compared to what i was used to listening to sorry we just we i'm

02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:51.880
yelling with the chatters because apparently we had a drop but i'm showing that we've we

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:58.340
didn't usually if we drop we show that our scent information drops way down but i don't

02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:02.700
see that so whatever no they're just saying it because i'm on the phone they're just like

02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:07.540
drop the stream so i get off the phone no haters gonna hate the timer reset to one minute

02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:11.020
30 seconds so maybe there was a hiccup but that's weird because usually that number resets

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:17.220
anyway podcast listeners don't care about this so exactly the hardware so how how expensive

02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:24.940
is this thing supposed to be okay the headset itself is 129 dollars the mix amp is 99 but

02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:34.180
you can get it as a bundle for 199 dollars is it worth it if you're an audiophile i say

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:42.380
yes but if you're looking to change your normal headphones for your cell phone or mp3 player

02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:46.820
if you're looking for something a bit of a change like for mobile gaming i would definitely

02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:54.100
go with the headset stand alone the mix amp like i said gives better audio quality i mean

02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:59.540
one of the songs i actually tested to see how well the clarity of the music is was low-keys

02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:04.220
uh verbalicious remix which is one of my personal now here's the thing though are those um headphones

02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:07.980
surround sound headphones or are they just standard headphones the headphones itself

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:15.060
are standard you get the surround sound 7.1 with the mix amp i have those kind of headsets

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:18.380
i like the headset with the surround sound built-in it's kind of fun yeah i've got a

02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:24.580
pair at home but i i paid a lot less than 200 for them yeah me too uh because they're

02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:28.180
i don't they weren't turtle beach i don't remember how i got their tritons the ones

02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:32.900
i have i i actually tried on a pair of tritons and they were phenomenal i was playing them

02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:40.540
with uh bioshock too all right well rama i'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls

02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:26.980
well i don't have any accessories or a very expensive video game i think the most expensive

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:36.940
one i have paid for is uh vidminia 12 right sky but i have spent tons and tons of money

02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:46.540
on pokemon plushies pokeballs and why is that is it and you know i was thinking that this

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:51.520
call was going to go in the direction of because you live in mexico and not every company releases

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.580
their products officially in mexico sometimes you have to pay these crazy ass import fees

02:18:55.580 --> 02:19:02.780
and is is it kind of along the same lines for pokemon well most of the time uh since

02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:08.700
a friend helped me uh get get most of the stuff i uh i get from the united states so

02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:17.780
i very important so i i pretty much pay what you would pay uh for something like that but

02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:23.900
it's still a pretty expensive uh little hobby if you want if you want to call it like that

02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:28.020
how often do you because you don't live that far from the u.s border right you're about

02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:33.660

02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:39.700
oh shit i live pretty close oh okay shit that's nothing so how often do you just drive up

02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:48.700
into uh the states to pick up what you want well uh unfortunately i can't right now because

02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:55.100
i don't have a passport or a visa oh so i cannot cross the border but i used to and

02:19:55.100 --> 02:20:03.400
uh well depends on how much traffic is there it usually it can take up to an hour to cross

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:09.280
the border and pretty much go to the to the to the next town there's a game stop uh there's

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:16.620
a mall too and there's a best buy and there's pretty much uh uh well very uh renowned stores

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:22.120
uh to go and buy stuff and so it's not that difficult and please tell me you live in one

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:25.840
of those parts of mexico i'm not seeing on the news like you live in one of the safer

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:33.220
parts i hope um more or less you know take care of yourself buddy i don't i don't like

02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:38.860
some of the stuff i see on the news it makes me very sad so it is safe around where i live

thoughts your guys's way because i always you know it's when i see that stuff on the

02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:02.300
news i believe it or not i do think about i know people in mexico and i hope this is

02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.620
not something they're they're having to deal with you know but mexico is a big place so

02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:12.220
i know there's a lot of like parts you see on tv and parts that are just fine so um anyhow

02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:16.060
didn't mean to steer the conversation a totally different direction but that'll happen sometimes

02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:22.900

02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:46.800

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:53.780
you take it's pretty much uh well compelling it sucks you in i hear it's a great game i've

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:53.620
i was more saddened by robin gibb no no bg's no um by uh adam yelch uh mca yeah that that

02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:58.340
was because he was young too well it's not just you know that he was famous it was all

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:04.620
the good stuff he was doing and just how absolutely brilliant of a person he was that big chorizo

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:11.340
fan so donna summer you know and i know there's been a lot of stuff said about her and some

02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:15.220
of her relationship with the gay community in the past but you know a lot of that was

02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:19.060
in the past and sometimes the media likes to take things and run with it so you know

02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:25.000
what i think donna summer was a pretty okay lady and and she had a lot of wonderful wonderful

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:32.900
songs and and it's just me or did she stay gorgeous yes she did she sure did so you know

02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:40.040
1877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio um oh we have a call coming in

02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:45.500
right now so let's go to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this chugga chugga chugga

02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:53.100
choo choo you sexy people it's jib sally hey your trains your trains behind schedule you're

02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:57.780
usually on the bobby blackpool show but you're delayed three hours tonight i got delayed

02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:02.320
i went on the wrong side of the tracks well you know we we've been saying for a few weeks

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:07.660
now that you know we made a left turn at alberkirky and other folks we used to work with made

02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:11.420
a right so i was thinking maybe you just maybe you just made the wrong turn at alberkirky

02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:15.980
listen you can't you can't make any can't do anything right when you're doing it in

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:23.020
alberkirky that's very true that's very true so what's up jim listen we were talking we

02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:28.380
talked earlier about putting multiplayer and things in different games it needs to be in

02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:32.460
skyrim i'm playing this stupid game a lot and lately and i i wish there was like every

02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:37.260
night again i'd roll up to somebody like me that was uber powerful and could kill everything

02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:43.100
and it had way too much money well what do you think about the whole elder scrolls online

02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:46.300
we were talking about that either last week or the week before you know i guess that's

02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:50.780
trying to appease some of these people who want their multiplayer uh elder scrolls is

02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:54.940
that enough for you i think it would be great if it was just little missions like go out

02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:58.600
and hunt a criminal like if i do a lot of bad stuff in the town maybe that town can

02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.100
just pay another player to come chase me and good luck because you ain't gonna kill jim

02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:07.860
sally in this game i'm stupid powerful do you find when you're playing these games like

02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:12.840
i'm an accountant so i'm very good with numbers and maximizing productivity i find i just

02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:18.300
overpower everything in the game it's it's pretty insane right now i i wonder if um

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:22.820
there'll be some type of how do you play skyrim on the pc or do you play on console um i played

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:30.020
on the console because consoles are better and and um i'm better so that's why i played

02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:33.620
on the console i gotta say though that might end up being the problem and what keeps you

02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:37.660
from multiplayer because i seem to remember on pc now granted i play on the console too

02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:40.940
and i play on the playstation 3 which most people say is the worst way to play it but

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:47.580
i don't care um the thing is is that on the pc that game gets modded and even oblivion

02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:52.940
ended up having a multiplayer mod in it at some point so i don't i i would firmly believe

02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:59.020
there's going to be some type of unofficial multiplayer mod for skyrim eventually yeah

02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:03.540
but i'm never gonna see it on the console that's true that's when they when they did

02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:07.580
it on the on the pc it was janky like someone would pause the game and then my game would

02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:10.700
just not work i'd have to sit there and wait for two minutes while the guy plays with his

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:14.700
menus and then i would get the pause and he'd have to wait for two minutes while i play

02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:20.220
with my menus they need like oblivion needs to do it oblivion sorry bethesda needs to

02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:25.860
do it right well you know it's anything's possible we don't know much about these expansions

02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:29.260
that are supposed to be coming to skyrim i imagine an e3 will finally hear about this

02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:34.380
first expansion that's coming to skyrim um but since they haven't been releasing them

02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:38.780
with the frequency that they did for oblivion you know these packs are going to be huge

02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:42.320
so i would say nothing's off the table maybe we're going to get multiplayer in an expansion

02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:47.040
pack but i kind of don't think they're going to cannibalize from elder scrolls online i

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:51.060
kind of think it's skyrim is going to stay single player and they're going to really

02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:55.540
try to push you to pay that monthly fee if you want to take it multiplayer so it's about

02:26:55.540 --> 02:27:00.620
time that they just let obsidian do it for them they make the best sequels to games perfectly

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:04.500
solid and stable they should just let obsidian make it they've done it with follow let them

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:09.680
do it with oblivion well i i hope they're listening to your suggestion but sadly they

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.060
probably aren't all right you got that right all right well jim anything else you want

02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:19.420
to share with us tonight also yeah i play way too much of that walking dead game that

02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:25.180
the last caller just called about hey people are loving it oh my god the one you you know

02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:29.180
what brother i'm going to tell you this right now the only the hardest part about the zombie

02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:37.060
apocalypse we'll be pretending i'm not excited oh my god kim sally's getting ready i'm getting

02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:43.220
ready well i i i will pass the word along to my friend at telltale because they're very

02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:47.180
proud of that game and they should be and you know before we were talking about minecrafts

02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:52.300
you know record-breaking figures uh walking dead was doing very well for itself on xbox

02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:57.220
live arcade so uh i i think that's some really good news you know because there's a lot of

02:27:57.220 --> 02:28:01.020
people that think adventure games are like a niche thing you know and yeah telltale's

02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:05.380
filling that niche very well but walking dead's really kind of broken a mainstream forum and

02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:32.860
here but let me ask uh loki first any last minute stories uh yeah i was gonna talk about

02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:38.740
um shoot mania which was part of this mania planet series you may remember them from track

02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:48.060
mania um shoot mania is their um fps editor and it also is a game um shoot mania storm

02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:52.000
is the first thing they have right now that's in beta and they actually have the registration

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.900
open for that uh you can check it out but um it looks pretty cool and you can basically

02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:01.780
create your own fps game with this and they've got all the tools to make i think it's an

02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:06.720
online fps maker um also should be noted that they're supposed to have quest mania at some

02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:12.820
point so that means a really cool rpg maker so kind of interested in that sign up for

02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:16.620
the beta so we'll see when that happens i was checking that out by the way the binding

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:35.260

02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:40.020

02:30:53.340 --> 02:30:59.420
to a couple don't hate me going to a couple tweets from tiger claw death spank the bakening

02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:04.620
indie game the movie will be steam's first full-length film release i had no idea steam

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:08.420
was looking into doing this but apparently steam is going to start giving out movies

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:12.700
that's right the 1080p video will be drm'd as much as any other steam product or game

02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:17.380
for those of you that were worried about that um so you will have to have the steam client

02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:22.500
in order to watch it but you can pre-order the movie on steam for $8.99 that includes

02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:28.040
a 10 discount until june 12th when the movie's coming out so this is a new area for steam

02:31:28.040 --> 02:31:33.380
now they're gonna take on itunes hey by the way huh you know what else is um on that uh

02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:39.480
sale on steam since you mentioned it what's that psychonauts five bucks five bucks guess

02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:44.980
who's buying it and not buying minecraft you know what though it's pretty hard psychonauts

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:50.560
is a good choice even even the most hardcore of minecraft fan would be hard to argue with

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:56.100
you there um i'm trying to load up this other story from tiger claw but our internet's being

02:31:56.100 --> 02:32:01.260
a little wonky but it's titled a video game designed to help doctors to recognize drug

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:07.060
abuse what the hell would that game be but it's not loading because the website is being

02:32:07.060 --> 02:32:12.160
wonky let me try one more time here there it goes um let's see it's probably heroine

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:18.180
hero or heroine hero where you have to chase the chase the giant sword it's using the same

02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:24.820
technology used to train fbi agents in interrogation tactics a combination of self-disclosure and

02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:30.100
non-verbal cues the game uses an actor's voice to stimulate a hypothetical conversation with

02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:35.340
a patient seeking for example pain relievers the program generates responses based on the

02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:40.300
doctor's questions and the doctor must identify indicators of possible addiction or abuse

02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:44.560
based on the simulated patient appearing on screen before them so this is something where

02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:49.660
you're the doctor you're trying to recognize a patient that's asking for a drug who might

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:56.160
be addicted to them this sounds like la noir you're looking for those hidden cues to let

02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:01.380
you know if there's a problem or not that's kind of weird in a way but but neat i guess

02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:06.360
that you know video games are being used out there in the real world that's going to do

02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:11.020
it for twitter any other last minute stories tonight loki no that's it all right then that

02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:16.580
