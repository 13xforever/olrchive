00:00.000 --> 00:19.920
Today, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is

00:19.920 --> 00:31.680
a reality, and we talk to video game hip hop artist, Megaran.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.600 --> 00:39.600
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.600 --> 00:48.320
We are live with episode number 456, yes that's 456, of our show on this May the 6th, that's

00:48.320 --> 00:50.880
5-6, 2012.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.100
A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.280
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games

01:00.280 --> 01:03.220
and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.

01:03.220 --> 01:06.660
Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.660 --> 01:12.600
To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Man, to paraphrase I should say, but Mani isn't dead,

01:12.600 --> 01:14.240
but Mani is life.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.640
Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Man?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.760
He was the leader of the Disco Boys.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.080
That was Eddie Izzard?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.960
I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
that movie when I saw it.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
That movie was great.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.680
It was okay, but I saw it so long ago.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.260
Avengers, Avengers, Avengers.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.640
The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.280
I have also not seen the Avengers.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.320
I have not seen the Avengers, I'm like the one person in the world.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.660
You both are lame.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.660
We are lame.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.800
Well I'll explain my reasons in a minute, but first I have to plug the ever present

01:40.800 --> 01:43.720
fourth guest on our show, The Chatters.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.440
That's right, head on over to vognetwork.com, you can't miss it, we're a brand new start

01:47.440 --> 01:51.840
up network at VOG, so our chat is right there in the middle of the screen, and you can join

01:51.840 --> 01:57.800
our chat room and chat with us, and you might have heard on tonight's show, we have an interview.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.860
I'm excited, we haven't had an interview in a long time, and I was thinking about this

02:00.860 --> 02:05.500
last week, I was like, can either of you name who the last person was on the show and when?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.800
We had like a legit interview going on on the show.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.840
I don't remember.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
I could not remember.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
What about Snake360dude?

02:10.840 --> 02:11.840
No, it wasn't Snake360dude.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
It wasn't Snake360dude.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.840
No, it wasn't Snake360dude, it was the guy that was behind Technokitten Adventures.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.360
That was a year ago, it was Technokitten Adventure.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.280
Well we talked to him again, didn't we?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.960
No, I don't think so.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.200
Because he has Nyan Cat Adventures, which is the same thing.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
Anyway, he sold it off to an iPhone developer.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.400
And we had the Orange Lounge game.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
Mmhmm.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
Yeah.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.080
Well I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
And he was on the show.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.720
But I wasn't technically on the interview, because he did, you know, was he plugging

02:39.720 --> 02:41.720
the new game?

02:41.720 --> 02:45.800
Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.240
Where is the new game?

02:47.240 --> 02:48.240
Where is it?

02:48.240 --> 02:50.440
He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.440
You know what?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.920
Beggars can't be choosers.

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
Let him take his time.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.520
Alright, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.440
hey guys, who do you want us to interview on the show?

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
Like within reason.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.800
You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-Aime, okay, we're not a television

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
network or something.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.000
We're not going to get those folks.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.440
And so we kind of fielded some of the responses.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.400
And one idea that I really liked was getting Mega Ran on our show.

03:15.400 --> 03:20.060
Now if you guys don't know Mega Ran, he also goes by Random, and he does this like video

03:20.060 --> 03:22.320
game hip hop music.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.200
And I know some of you guys are probably sitting at that going, what, what?

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
Video game hip hop?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
What is that?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
It's awesome.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
This is what it sounds like.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.200
I'm only going to tease you a little bit with this.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
Check out this.

03:31.200 --> 03:44.160
That song is called Splash Woman, and you can like hear it in the background, like that

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
riff.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.200
And then he's kind of, you know, has some verses that he's laying down about Splash

03:48.200 --> 03:50.200
Woman or his Splash Woman.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
It's brilliant.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
I love it.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.360
Anyway, I can't play the whole thing.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.200
I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing

03:59.200 --> 04:00.400
there, iTunes or whatever.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.920
But that's one of his like bigger, well-known songs, Splash Woman.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.920
That was amazing.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.920
Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got, you got to do more.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.040
So he's got like a Mega Man 9, he's got a Mega Man 10, and we're going to ask him about

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
some of his other projects.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.120
He's not just a Capcom guy.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
He's got Final Fantasy.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.200
We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.320
So if you're a Mega Ran fan who saw the shout out on Twitter and all that, it was waiting

04:19.320 --> 04:24.280
for him to come on the show, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.720
But join our chat room because we are a live show.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.720
Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.840
And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.000
Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.720
But when we get going, when we get Random on the phone, you can ask those questions.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
All right.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.920
Anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right

04:46.920 --> 04:50.200
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.720
Hope you'll join us live sometime even if you missed our action-packed show tonight.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.400
Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually

04:57.400 --> 05:01.480
like to kind of have a kickoff topic and we kind of got into it a little bit already,

05:01.480 --> 05:10.200
but everybody's talking about everybody, everybody in the geek world talking about the Avengers.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.920
Dark Sakura, I know you were there.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.320
I know you went and saw the Avengers movie.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
You're a comic fan.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.320
You're a Marvel fan.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.320
Ed Joss.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
What?

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
Ed Joss.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
Oh, Ed Joss Whedon.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
You're a Joss Whedon fan.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.320
How was the Avengers movie?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.840
Oh my God.

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
It was beautiful.

05:25.840 --> 05:32.400
And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today, I've had allergies.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
I went to see it.

05:33.400 --> 05:39.320
I loaded myself up on Sudafed and Allegra and ate Ricolas and Junior Mints the entire

05:39.320 --> 05:42.760
time, which are an odd combination, but oddly work.

05:42.760 --> 05:49.920
And I was just like, oh, Hawkeye, this is the Hawkeye movie.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.360
Why is he evil?

05:52.360 --> 05:59.480
Not to spoil, but I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass, I mean, please.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.400
I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.400
Anyway.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.400
In full 3D?

06:04.400 --> 06:08.720
Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
All right.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.080
I have a new ship.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.480
I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because, oh my God.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.160
Aren't there, I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites, but I think I read something

06:21.160 --> 06:23.200
about, cause you know, I read all that trash.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.880
I think I read something, something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.540
They've been flirty.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.240
Like there's pictures of them on the red carpet, flirty.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.360
So you know what?

06:35.360 --> 06:39.340
If I get pretty, I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett

06:39.340 --> 06:40.340
Johansson.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.760
So, you know, and it's all because of him is the whole reason I want to see that Mission

06:45.760 --> 06:48.160
Impossible movie, him and Simon Peck because hello.

06:48.160 --> 06:55.760
Um, so yeah, I can say first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
death.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.760
I will not tell you who.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.920
And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.960
No, don't spoil.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.360
I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.520
Like I did with Wash.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.980
Okay.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.980
And stay during the credits.

07:11.980 --> 07:12.980
Yes.

07:12.980 --> 07:13.980
Oh my God.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
What was that?

07:14.980 --> 07:15.980
What was that?

07:15.980 --> 07:19.960
So one does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
Exactly.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.080
Cause now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the cause you know, there's that like that

07:24.080 --> 07:28.200
lovely designed a bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who

07:28.200 --> 07:30.720
is in it, who were in it, sorry.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.200
And then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil,

07:35.200 --> 07:36.880
but if nobody gets it, please ask me.

07:36.880 --> 07:42.480
I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants.

07:42.480 --> 07:48.720
And then, but the very end of the movie and really listen very carefully to the dialogue

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
right before the credits.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.120
That's all I'm having to say.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.880
Tiger claw on our chat and chat chatters.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.880
Don't spoil.

07:53.880 --> 07:54.880
Don't do it.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.560
If you spoil your getting kicked to the private messages, take your spoil into the private

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
messages.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.960
Uh, just double click on some of these names and you can private message him.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.760
Uh, and you can, you can talk a double click on dark soccer.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.960
I will gush you all.

08:05.960 --> 08:06.960
You're in the show.

08:06.960 --> 08:07.960
Okay.

08:07.960 --> 08:08.960
Talk to her.

08:08.960 --> 08:15.000
Um, I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.720
Let's go to the chat room real quick at vog network.com a tiger.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.080
Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.560
He's taken over the born movies, the Matt Damon, born conspiracy, all that stuff.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.560
Yeah.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.560
Those board movies are pretty awesome.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.560
Actually.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.560
I'm, I'm excited about that.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
How do you think so?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.400
I'm better than Matt Damon.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.400
I mean, come on.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
It's Matt Damon.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.720
I just didn't care about the board movies.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.720
SSJ 100.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.120
Matt says I give it to Joss Whedon.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.960
He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
I think there were a lot of people.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.160
Did you hear this?

08:42.160 --> 08:48.320
Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter,

08:48.320 --> 08:52.320
you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but two, 200 million

08:52.320 --> 08:55.480
plus for the weekend.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.440
And a, this is the, this is the other real telling thing.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.040
Um, hunger games beat that.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
No, no.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.040
Hunger games didn't beat it either.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.080
A, I mean, hunger games was huge, but didn't beat it.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.440
A plus cinema score that in cinema score.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.440
Those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.220
I actually pulled for them once.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.800
They were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was, but

09:14.800 --> 09:19.680
they pulled me on it and they actually take, you know, they grade it a plus rating from

09:19.680 --> 09:20.680
cinema score.

09:20.680 --> 09:25.360
That's, that's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, Hey,

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
this movie doesn't suck.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
Go see it.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.980
And, uh, going to some other chats, uh, panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right in the VOG

09:30.980 --> 09:33.920
network chat room said Avengers did something amazing.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.100
They combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it because hello.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.100
Who else could do that?

09:40.100 --> 09:42.080
But the Joss, I'm sorry.

09:42.080 --> 09:49.320
So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say everybody was characterized perfectly.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.400
The interaction was perfect.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.160
And um, for those of you who read ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.960
It really does seem like it's based a bit more off of ultimates with a good splash of

10:01.960 --> 10:04.160
six one six universe in it.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.380
So yeah, it, it, um, it's really good.

10:07.380 --> 10:12.680
And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks, although I'd pay to see that.

10:12.680 --> 10:17.200
I would pay for that Star Wars slash, you know, Avengers movie.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.600
I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is and it's not a spoiler,

10:21.600 --> 10:26.180
but it, cause they did the first half of it in the trailer is this whole scene where Iron

10:26.180 --> 10:30.000
Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
the party to you.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.880
Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on

10:34.880 --> 10:38.040
her face saying, I don't see how this is a party.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.600
That's the best line in the whole movie.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.520
All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.360
It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day and they're making

10:46.360 --> 10:47.800
an Avengers video game.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.400
So well, actually I was going to ask, where is the video game?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
It is coming.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.000
It's strike while the iron is hot.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.080
I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always rush the game out.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
Okay.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.080
Perfect.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.520
Let's have a sub plan better.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.280
It would have been out for the movie, but I'm willing to do something like ultimate

11:07.280 --> 11:10.840
Alliance honestly, cause that was both.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.680
The second one did the whole civil war thing and it was kind of crap, but the first one,

11:14.680 --> 11:16.360
I love the gameplay in both of the games.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.360
They were just fantastic.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.680
I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in ultimate Alliance style.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.680
All right, so go into our chat room.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.760
There is a hater.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.580
We do have a hater in the chat room.

11:27.580 --> 11:30.280
You know that every, every big fandom is going to have its haters.

11:30.280 --> 11:35.120
Rama's in the chat room saying, fuck Joss Whedon, James Cameron will come back strong

11:35.120 --> 11:36.360
with avatar too.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
Yeah.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.580
Cause he came out strong with avatar one.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.320
That was some cheesy piece of shit.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
Uh, okay.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
Look low key.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
Okay.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
Yeah.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.560
Cause everybody bought into, Oh my God, I have to see this in 3d.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.820
My eyes will be blown out of my head.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.440
It was just such a terrible story and just wasn't bad.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.440
It was terrible.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.840
In one of those movies, you want, I don't want to admit they like just like guys, guys,

11:59.840 --> 12:06.080
guys, man, man, please, no, don't worry about ripoffs and who's going to come out on top.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.640
There hasn't been a real original idea since the sixties.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.300
Maybe they're all going to take your money.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
Let's be real.

12:14.300 --> 12:18.960
One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative

12:18.960 --> 12:20.700
deal the fuck with it.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.720
They're going to make Titanic more 3d it's what's going to happen.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.200
Deal with it.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
Falling sunglasses.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.280
A technist in our chat room says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel

12:31.280 --> 12:34.960
or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
What do you think?

12:35.960 --> 12:36.960
Agreed.

12:36.960 --> 12:42.240
And honestly, given the big spoiler, not spoiler, I should say, but the big preview of the next

12:42.240 --> 12:44.960
movie, Joss has to do it.

12:44.960 --> 12:50.040
There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and, and please forgive me for saying

12:50.040 --> 12:53.080
this, Chris Claremont, please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers.

12:53.080 --> 12:57.600
They'll just have Treyarch do it and then they'll add zombies.

12:57.600 --> 13:04.320
I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that and yeah, he did

13:04.320 --> 13:08.040
kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont

13:08.040 --> 13:09.200
was the man.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.400
He's the one who gave us dark Phoenix.

13:11.400 --> 13:16.240
He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel

13:16.240 --> 13:19.360
bin and made it the top a player it is now.

13:19.360 --> 13:24.400
So now I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
to a lot.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
Like, you know, the Avengers.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.360
I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but you know, I'm into it.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.640
I liked the, the Iron Man movie was good and all the movies are good.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.640
I'll go see it.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
I just don't want to see it opening weekend.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.400
I don't, I knew the crowds are going to be insane.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.360
One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget Joss Whedon also wrote comics.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.120
He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.640
But there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.300
One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.240
I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
I want to see it.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.840
And I know people are like, it looks stupid.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.240
What's it?

13:55.240 --> 14:00.480
The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival, but that's what made

14:00.480 --> 14:01.640
it awesome.

14:01.640 --> 14:06.880
And like if, if they, I'm a little worried cause I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.840
but if they did it right, it's, it's going to be a fun time.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.280
So I'm looking forward to that cautiously.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.200
And Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.960
Just Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.560
Helena Bonham Carter.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.880
Also a flaw free goddess.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.920
Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
I know, right?

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
With Michelle Pfeiffer.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
Amazing.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
I'll see anything to her in it.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.200
I have that on HD DVD.

14:27.200 --> 14:33.440
I sat through an Oprah book of the month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer cause I

14:33.440 --> 14:35.240
love her that much.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.680
And hello, the best, the only Catwoman, which leads me to, I am still excited a lot about

14:40.680 --> 14:47.560
this Batman movie, really, really excited about the third Batman movie.

14:47.560 --> 14:52.800
You know, I'm kind of two thoughts about that one, but you know what preview I saw that

14:52.800 --> 14:56.400
I will be there to see because I love the original so much.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.280
Frankenweenie I'm serious.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.200
That looks adorable and I freaking love Frankenweenie so shut up.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.200
Don't judge.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.200
I see you judging.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.200
I'm judging a little bit.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
Stop judging me.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.200
All right.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.200
Video games back.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
Yeah.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
As much as we love to talk movies and all that.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.200
We got it.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.200
It's all about the Tron series starting in June.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.040
We can all agree on that.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
Tron is King.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
Yes.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
A couple of weeks away.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
Disney XD.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
I am there.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
Finally.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.040
OLR Avengers assemble.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
Tron.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Woo.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Okay.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
OLR is assemble.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
All right.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Thank God.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.040
We agree on something.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.040
As long as I get to be Hawkeye.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
All right.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
There's no Hawkeye in Tron.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.040
You fool.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.400
There should be Hawkeye in Tron.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
You know?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Oh, I have to say, I have to say.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
We got to get to games.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
We got to get to games.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
You know why?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
You know why?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
There were all these Disney trailers before.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.640
There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.480
But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
Duntron style.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
Yes.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
I saw that.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
It was amazing.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
Yeah.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.480
They were epic.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
I loved them as Marvel.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.480
But anyway.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.480
Okay.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.480
All right.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.480
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
Join us in our chat.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.480
Vognetwork.com.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.480
We're getting into.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
The Spider-Man trailer was good.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.480
What was your gaming week?

16:09.480 --> 16:10.480
What kinds of games did you play this week?

16:10.480 --> 16:14.320
I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet

16:14.320 --> 16:18.040
was just, has been crap all week and it's the last week before finals.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.640
I've also had a crap ton of design work to do.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.640
So Mass Effect came out of the box.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.640
Oh my gosh.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.640
I didn't get played, but it got opened.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.640
You tease.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.200
I know.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.960
And yes, Frankenweenie really.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
Frankenweenie's awesome.

16:32.960 --> 16:33.960
Shut up.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.960
Zombie dogs.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
Anyway.

16:35.960 --> 16:43.240
Uh, I, I actually did play through some Portal 2 and I played a little bit of WoW, but like,

16:43.240 --> 16:45.400
okay, this is what was so stupid.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.720
All right.

16:46.720 --> 16:53.160
I get in queue and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me fart angry

16:53.160 --> 16:54.160
farts.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
Okay.

16:55.160 --> 17:00.020
I was trying to play WoW and I was in queue and then while, and then I didn't realize

17:00.020 --> 17:01.260
how close I was to a level.

17:01.260 --> 17:05.080
So I did a cooking daily level got kick out of queue.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.240
Oh shoot.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.480
You know, at 13 minutes of waiting in queue.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.280
So I get kicked out, whatever.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.840
So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily.

17:13.840 --> 17:18.720
Um, so then I get back in another queue and we all get in and everything's happy.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.720
We're in there.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.720
Yay.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.720
Queue.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.800
And then, Oh, I'm going to leave.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
Log off.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.800
Fine.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.800
Offline.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
What?

17:26.800 --> 17:27.800
Everybody leaves the party.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.080
As soon as I get my quest, I'm like, all of you suck.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.000
And I just logged off for the day.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.120
Die in a hundred fires.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.920
May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals.

17:38.920 --> 17:43.540
You didn't even get, I, I was here, I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and

17:43.540 --> 17:46.720
your anger rant about children's week.

17:46.720 --> 17:52.520
And speaking of things that he's saving that for the FUs of the week, because I cannot

17:52.520 --> 17:58.040
get my Drake this year because of children's week whores.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.080
She just wanted her virtual pony.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.440
Bring your child to your virtual world.

18:02.440 --> 18:06.920
Your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little

18:06.920 --> 18:10.160
five year old wander behind you while you're in the firelands.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
She's right.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.160
That's what it is.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.440
It's like, I was telling, that seems very unsafe.

18:16.440 --> 18:20.240
I was telling Becky and Becky doesn't really, she's not really into well, she doesn't play

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
it.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
Nothing to that.

18:22.240 --> 18:26.640
I was telling her about children's week and her reply was, Oh my God, that's fucked up.

18:26.640 --> 18:30.100
And it is the best place to, when you had to do the five dailies thing, the fastest

18:30.100 --> 18:33.000
place to get it done is firelands if you're 85.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.480
So you just run them through, Oh, this thing is setting you on fire.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.800
Oh, you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.000
this is cool.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.480
And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.680
Yes you do.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.000
Called bad example.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yes you do.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
That was great.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.360
And then you give them a gun and a kite.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.080
I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.400
Actually, it's kind of disturbing.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.760
And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.800
She has to deal with you now.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
You're not my problem.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.080
So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem.

19:09.080 --> 19:13.880
Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe or is it just like, no, they just have

19:13.880 --> 19:17.600
to follow you because they're, they're lonely orphans cooped up in the orphanage all day

19:17.600 --> 19:20.880
and they want to get out and see the world and children's week is a time for them to

19:20.880 --> 19:21.880
do that.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.840
Oh, and one of the achievements is you have to hearth back while you have your orphan

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
with you.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.080
So you leave your orphan behind in another town across the world, like no child left

19:30.080 --> 19:32.840
behind or something like that.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.200
Oh my God.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.640
And of course I have the stupid human kid following me around.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.720
If I do this crap next year, cause I get, I do want the pets and I did get my pet, but

19:41.720 --> 19:45.600
if I do this next year, then I'm gonna get the drawn eye kid.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.960
You know, the only children in the game that I like is that little bloodthirsty blood elf

19:49.960 --> 19:51.960
kid that hangs out with all the orcs.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.960
You know what I'm talking about?

19:52.960 --> 19:57.920
I have to kill this guy for my daddy and I like the gem and the holograms wandering around

19:57.920 --> 19:58.920
dark wind fair.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.440
Uh, Ziba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for dark soccer.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.440
Just stop playing.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.440
Wow.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
Then shut up.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.440
Picaruna wants me to be on hard house.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.580
Rob, we can arrange that.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.840
You should come back on hard house.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
I love it.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.440
All right.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.120
Hoard house.com is the spinoff show all about work.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.160
All right.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.160
Other games.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
Loki.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.160
I know you got something else to talk about.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.560
Uh, yeah, I don't play a while.

20:19.560 --> 20:24.560
So um, I play Call of Duty, my warfare three and honestly that's, it's all I really played

20:24.560 --> 20:29.240
this week because I only played it at work and um, you know, the rest of the time I've

20:29.240 --> 20:35.200
been working on my portal to papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, I'm about 99%

20:35.200 --> 20:37.860
done with the body of the portal turret.

20:37.860 --> 20:41.240
Did you see that amazing portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a

20:41.240 --> 20:43.240
cake falling through the portal?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.240
Yeah.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.240
Oh yeah.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
You gotta see it.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.240
It's great.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.240
I'll find it and link my tumblr.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.240
Everyone should be looking at my tumblr.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.040
Uh, kurotsubasa.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.720
You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guests to

20:54.720 --> 20:58.960
make Iran and the Fugu question we're going to get into is, you know, creating art inspired

20:58.960 --> 21:00.400
by video games.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
What is it about?

21:01.400 --> 21:05.280
And you're, you're basically making art based on portal to granted it might be on a template

21:05.280 --> 21:07.320
that's already out there or whatever with your own flare.

21:07.320 --> 21:12.200
But what is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
world?

21:13.200 --> 21:14.200
Because they're funny.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.280
They're funny little things.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.000
And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.760
Um, and I don't count the, the stuffed ones cause they look stupid.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.800
But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA for example, made a full size

21:26.800 --> 21:30.840
portal turret that talked in like, you know, shut air stuff, BBs or something like that.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.040
I would probably buy two or three.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.280
Um, but I don't know.

21:35.280 --> 21:39.320
I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it cause it was a cheap project.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.540
Um, although now I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want it to look a little bit better.

21:43.540 --> 21:50.440
So now I have to use Bondo and Plex or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a

21:50.440 --> 21:53.440
load of fun except it's not.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.240
Um, so I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.240
Uh, we'll see.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.880
But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now.

22:01.880 --> 22:07.760
You know, I did a portal turret in, uh, uh, Maya as my final projects.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.760
Yeah.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.760
I remember seeing that.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.760
Um, I don't know.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.280
It was just fun.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.280
So that's what I did.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.680
I've been looking at, um, getting portal two for, well, redeeming my copy of portal two

22:20.680 --> 22:23.080
on steam that I have for my PS3.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.360
Um, I still have to do that or look at it or whatever.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.360
I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.600
I mean, it's so cheap now.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.040
I'm sure I can get it, you know, a few bucks.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.240
And then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too, because of all the like cool mods that

22:36.240 --> 22:37.240
they have.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.900
Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation three just because I'm missing out on all

22:40.900 --> 22:42.480
these darn mods.

22:42.480 --> 22:46.840
I thought Sony said they were, I, maybe I was just hallucinating, but I thought Sony

22:46.840 --> 22:49.680
said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation three.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.680
Yeah.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.680
Well, what did they ever do?

22:51.680 --> 22:54.640
This steam stuff for, you know, portal to nothing.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.360
I mean, it's, I don't know.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.100
So I may do that.

23:00.100 --> 23:05.240
And then, um, I mean, I guess I played a little bit of the perfect strangers adver game thing.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
That was kind of fun.

23:06.240 --> 23:12.080
I actually played it a few times because I liked watching the, or reading the dream board

23:12.080 --> 23:18.280
that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and, uh, you know, stuff

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
of that nature.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.280
It was kind of funny.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.040
Um, yeah, that's pretty much all I played.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.320
Um, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.480
I kind of wish I'd, I did want to play some Skyrim this week.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.120
I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I, if I dive back in, I'm going to be, that's

23:35.120 --> 23:37.560
going to be another, like three months of my life.

23:37.560 --> 23:42.840
Well, it's going to be more than three months because by the time I get to about three months,

23:42.840 --> 23:46.160
they'll release the expansion.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.160
Just over from there.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.320
That's why I was like, Oh no, Skyrim online or not.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.320
Skyrim.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.320
Well, the other scrolls online.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.320
I'm like, ah, crap.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.320
Well, I'm going to have to play this, aren't I?

23:55.320 --> 24:01.240
And then, uh, I started reading up on it and I was like, well, maybe not.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.880
All right.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.440
Um, my gaming week, um, not a lot of new stuff.

24:06.440 --> 24:07.440
I did play Mass Effect.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.440
I did.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.440
Yes.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.440
I played a lot of Mass Effect.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
Let's get that out of the way.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.640
Uh, Mass Effect three, I'm playing more, lots of side missions, working on the main missions.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.800
I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys, but

24:19.800 --> 24:23.920
it was, uh, I'll just say some, something involving the Citadel happened and it was

24:23.920 --> 24:24.920
pretty awesome.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.760
Um, and then, uh, multiplayer.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.600
That's the, that's the thing that gets me.

24:29.600 --> 24:34.720
I am really into multiplayer in this game, which you guys have to understand.

24:34.720 --> 24:40.360
I don't really play a lot of Xbox live games online, especially things that are kind of

24:40.360 --> 24:44.600
like shooters, although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter, but it's, it's,

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
it's a shooter.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.620
It's like a shooter RPG hybrid, more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG,

24:49.620 --> 24:50.620
I guess.

24:50.620 --> 24:56.200
But my point is I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox live outside of arcade games

24:56.200 --> 25:00.720
and music games like rock band that I've played online that I truly enjoyed.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.880
Like I, one of the last ones is like Halo two, you want to go that back that far with

25:04.880 --> 25:12.160
your pink guy, but I, yep, my red, but I love Mass Effect three online and I think a big

25:12.160 --> 25:14.280
part of that and the community's great.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.500
I mean, sometimes I hear random people like yelling at people across the room in their

25:18.500 --> 25:24.560
own house, but you don't hear the same stuff like, you know, F you and you know, the racial

25:24.560 --> 25:30.360
slurs and the, you know, um, sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated

25:30.360 --> 25:31.360
with Xbox live.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.600
I don't hear it in Mass Effect three.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.360
Oh, that would be kind of funny though.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.000
Like, you know, cause I'm assuming it's basically co-op against, you know, the enemy.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It'd be funny.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.240
It would be funny to have people that are racist against the enemies, you know, that's

25:43.240 --> 25:44.480
just Ashley.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.560
But anyway, if you were, if you're a Mass Effect player, you'll get that joke.

25:48.560 --> 25:53.580
But anyway, uh, yeah, the fact that it's co-op I think really leads to a different kind of

25:53.580 --> 25:55.000
community for the game.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.560
And you know, I, I'm sure it's not perfect.

25:57.560 --> 26:03.760
Every community has their, you know, dumb asses, but this game's pretty awesome so far

26:03.760 --> 26:04.760
from my experience.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.780
And I'm, I'm, uh, motivated to continue to play it online.

26:07.780 --> 26:12.460
I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits

26:12.460 --> 26:13.560
and doing all that stuff.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.040
So, uh, yeah, Mass Effect good times.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.120
So I'll Mass Effect three gets a big endorsement for me.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.120
Um, I haven't gotten to that ending yet.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.480
I still am not spoiled on the ending yet.

26:24.480 --> 26:28.880
I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it, but let me tell you what, I've been

26:28.880 --> 26:30.480
on this Mass Effect bang bandwagon.

26:30.480 --> 26:35.260
I just started back in February and I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect one, 40 hours

26:35.260 --> 26:38.660
of Mass Effect two, maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.440
And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect three.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.920
That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played.

26:43.920 --> 26:49.200
The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob

26:49.200 --> 26:51.420
what was a great experience.

26:51.420 --> 26:56.940
I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up or, you know, kind of say

26:56.940 --> 27:01.640
that was shitty, you know, or compare it to the ending of the Sopranos, which wasn't that

27:01.640 --> 27:02.720
great either.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.280
But that's, you know, I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
Mass Effect three.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.280
It's so terrible.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.120
And the ending just ruined it for me.

27:10.120 --> 27:15.240
So I'm going to our chat room at chat, excuse me, almost at the old one going to shit, vog

27:15.240 --> 27:16.240
network.com.

27:16.240 --> 27:20.160
Uh, tiger class says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kayden.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.920
Techness says Mass Effect two was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect

27:23.920 --> 27:24.920
game.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.880
But the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.120
I, however, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.320
So I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.600
Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect three, all that crap out of the

27:37.600 --> 27:40.560
way, all that crap out of the way.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
So all right.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.000
Uh, one of the game, I, uh, Mega Rants coming on in just a minute, we got to call him, but

27:45.000 --> 27:49.160
I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week, a new game Fez on Xbox

27:49.160 --> 27:53.600
live arcade, because everybody's telling me, Rob, this is like an eight bit looking game

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
with great music.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.600
It's a puzzler.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
It is right up your fucking alley.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
Go play this game.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
You play Fez now.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
Fez is cool.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Fez is cool.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
I like it.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
Sorry.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
Doctor Who reference.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
Oh, I see.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Uh, well whatever.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Doctor, Doctor Who reference or not.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
It's a pretty fun game.

28:07.600 --> 28:14.160
Uh, quickly, the concept, it's the 2d world that you're in getting turned into a 3d world.

28:14.160 --> 28:19.080
So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2d

28:19.080 --> 28:23.240
scroller is suddenly like has four different sides cause you don't really go up or down.

28:23.240 --> 28:28.760
So it's just like the four sides of a cube and you know, you kind of, you get puzzles

28:28.760 --> 28:33.400
out of that where you might have to climb up a vine on one side of the cube to get the

28:33.400 --> 28:35.840
gem that's on another side of it.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.600
The puzzles in the beginning are pretty simple, but from what I understand, there are some

28:39.600 --> 28:45.520
killer hard puzzles that they call the anti cube puzzles and they're buried in things

28:45.520 --> 28:49.160
like random QR codes that might be on the wall.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.560
I've unlocked an anti cube.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.360
I actually got the anti cube before I got a regular cube.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.360
Here's a hint.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.720
Read the achievements.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.680
How to unlock an anti cube is in one of the achievements.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.320
Minor spoiler, but whatever.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.520
It's a gamer tip.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
Take that.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.280
Um, so a lot of depth to it and I thought I saw Pete Caruno and somebody in our chat

29:06.280 --> 29:09.240
said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight cause I was trying to get one of those

29:09.240 --> 29:12.120
freaking cubes and Fez to unlock.

29:12.120 --> 29:16.120
So apparently there's, it's like Castlevania Symphony of the night where there's like a,

29:16.120 --> 29:18.600
a pretty easy game in the beginning.

29:18.600 --> 29:23.780
And then once you, just when you thought you beat it, there's that twist of, Oh crap.

29:23.780 --> 29:28.640
Now I have to do it all again, but it just got like 11 billion times harder.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.880
All right.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.800
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
And Hey, how about that?

29:32.800 --> 29:37.720
It is just about time for us to go to the phone and bring onto the program.

29:37.720 --> 29:42.360
Mega ran video game, hip hop artist, he goes by random as well.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.800
I like mega ran cause you know, mega man and all that stuff.

29:44.800 --> 29:50.400
And obviously that was a lot of what he became famous for, but airman can't be beaten.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.200
But uh, yeah, you know, we played a clip from a splash woman earlier.

29:53.200 --> 29:56.180
We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview.

29:56.180 --> 30:01.040
Just a talented guy really into the art and he, you know, he's made it like a Bobby joked

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
on his show earlier.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.160
He got on sports center with a rap about Jeremy Lin.

30:05.160 --> 30:09.080
So it's not, it's not just restricted to video games.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.520
So, and I understand even better.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.320
This guy is a teacher during the day.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.760
He's a teacher IRL as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.760
So I want to talk to him about his art and I want to open it up to you guys for your

30:21.760 --> 30:24.780
questions on vog network.com.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.840
So let's get random on the show right now.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.080
I've punched in his number and we're giving him a call.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.480
It is live radio.

30:30.480 --> 30:35.720
Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message just like the phone getting forwarded

30:35.720 --> 30:37.680
to an automatic voicemail.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.980
Let's try it one more time.

30:38.980 --> 30:43.480
Maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick.

30:43.480 --> 30:52.160
It is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail.

30:52.160 --> 30:56.520
Let's try it one more time here.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.280
Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

30:59.280 --> 31:06.240
Boy, I think, I think, uh, I think he might be on the other line or something right now.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
So all right.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.240
That's all right.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.240
These things happen in live radio.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.920
We'll try him again in about three minutes.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.880
So, uh, if you're a friend of MEGA's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to

31:15.880 --> 31:16.880
get through.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.880
All right.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.680
Uh, meanwhile, let's, uh, let's go to our first news story tonight.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.000
Uh, Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to MEGA, okay.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's fine.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.120
Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls online.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.800
It's being developed by ZeniMax online, not necessarily Bethesda, but you know, it's owned

31:32.800 --> 31:38.760
by the same company and, uh, it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series.

31:38.760 --> 31:43.320
It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with, um, some of the places being

31:43.320 --> 31:47.320
locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on.

31:47.320 --> 31:53.040
But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.880
elsewhere and that kind of stuff.

31:55.880 --> 32:01.520
Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like,

32:01.520 --> 32:05.680
the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of

32:05.680 --> 32:06.680
the game.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.240
At least some of the screenshots, uh.

32:09.240 --> 32:14.360
One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third person perspective.

32:14.360 --> 32:18.640
Now, I know that's an option in, like, the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third person

32:18.640 --> 32:24.760
perspective, but I really like the first person aspect of it and I understand that the reason

32:24.760 --> 32:28.440
that they wanted to go that route is because, you know, it'd be less of a learning curve

32:28.440 --> 32:32.080
for people that are from, you know, other MMOs.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.800
The problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to, kind of, World of Warcraft

32:35.800 --> 32:37.320
and that's kind of, ehhhh.

32:37.320 --> 32:42.360
Well, you know what they did is apparently they licensed BioWare's Star Wars The Old

32:42.360 --> 32:44.660
Republic engine to do it.

32:44.660 --> 32:45.840
That's what I'm hearing.

32:45.840 --> 32:51.140
And it's kind of, I mean, I'm not shade in the BioWare game, I mean, Star Wars was alright,

32:51.140 --> 32:55.000
but it's like, I like Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
I mean, it's weird.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Well, I have no problem with them doing, like, a third person's perspective or even, like,

33:00.000 --> 33:04.760
having all those options, but at the same time also allow people to play the same way

33:04.760 --> 33:08.400
you would play, like, a regular, you know, like, Skyrim or Oblivion or something like

33:08.400 --> 33:12.800
that, like, from a first person perspective without, you know, necessarily the hotbar

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
and that kind of stuff.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.800
Um.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
I don't know.

33:15.800 --> 33:20.220
Some of the other, uh, features that they're talking about also, they're gonna have, um,

33:20.220 --> 33:25.800
you know, PVP battles also, some 100 vs 100 instances, in fact, one of them they explained

33:25.800 --> 33:32.080
is you take over Cyrodiil's Imperial City and the winning faction, um, I guess, uh,

33:32.080 --> 33:37.620
the greatest champion of the winning faction gets installed is the Emperor.

33:37.620 --> 33:41.800
Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is, uh, 35 after right now and, you know, it is

33:41.800 --> 33:44.500
live radio and, you know, he could be anywhere right now.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.000
He could be, he could be in the basement writing his next hit and the cell signal might not

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
be catching.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.720
Let's see if maybe he's, uh, come to the surface.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.240
I'm gonna try to get through again real quick here.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.640
Your call has been-

33:55.640 --> 33:57.600
Oh, boy, that's really not good.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Alright.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.280
Let's, uh, let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.280
Alright.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.560
And then, um, let's see.

34:04.560 --> 34:10.880
They also, uh, you know, they're showing off some of the different, uh, kind of artwork

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
for the game.

34:11.880 --> 34:16.640
A lot of it's still very early, um, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game.

34:16.640 --> 34:20.920
I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing, um,

34:20.920 --> 34:25.920
but then again, I guess I got used to it with, you know, Final Fantasy XI and that kind of

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
stuff.

34:26.920 --> 34:31.880
Um, and then some other stuff, not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online, but Skyrim,

34:31.880 --> 34:37.200
um, one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard, well that's been officially

34:37.200 --> 34:43.440
announced now that Dawnguard will be the first, um, expansion to Skyrim and it'll be coming

34:43.440 --> 34:50.280
out this summer and, of course, being, um, talked about during E3, um, and, you know,

34:50.280 --> 34:57.200
the rumors, of course, um, that it's gonna feature, you know, uh, you know, crossbows

34:57.200 --> 35:02.480
and, um, some other types of characters and races and stuff in there.

35:02.480 --> 35:08.360
So, very interesting, um, might even be cool if they have, like, some of the, uh, because

35:08.360 --> 35:13.200
remember when they had, like, this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's

35:13.200 --> 35:18.120
like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit that, for Skyrim,

35:18.120 --> 35:19.120
go!

35:19.120 --> 35:24.160
And then they had, like, you know, spear throwing and, um, I wanna say that, like, the kill

35:24.160 --> 35:31.440
cameras for Magic and stuff like that came out of that and, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure

35:31.440 --> 35:36.880
crossbows probably will come out of that as well, so it would be neat to see some more

35:36.880 --> 35:37.880
of that stuff in there.

35:37.880 --> 35:43.240
I mean, they seem pretty creative, so, um, looking forward to that.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.440
Um, and of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but, uh,

35:47.440 --> 35:52.200
the Kinect update finally came out now for Skyrim for the Xbox 360 and they have 200

35:52.200 --> 35:54.360
voice commands added in there as well.

35:54.360 --> 35:59.200
Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC, but apparently there

35:59.200 --> 36:00.200
are-

36:00.200 --> 36:02.440
That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming foosurada!

36:02.440 --> 36:05.640
Uh, apparently there's already mods available that have it.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.860
And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those

36:08.860 --> 36:09.860
voice mods to work.

36:09.860 --> 36:15.360
You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange, but, you know, whatever, that's how

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
they did it.

36:16.360 --> 36:20.640
All right, I'm gonna try again here, guys.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.040
Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right

36:24.040 --> 36:25.040
now.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.280
Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.280
You know, it's live!

36:30.280 --> 36:31.900
Anything can happen live!

36:31.900 --> 36:33.320
He did know what time we were gonna-

36:33.320 --> 36:37.280
He did, and I- well, he's in Arizona, but they're on the same time as us right now.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.600
Arizona's a funky state, because sometimes during the year they're like an hour ahead

36:40.600 --> 36:41.600
and sometimes they're not.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.320
Because Arizona does things their way.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.240
That's right, their way or the highway.

36:45.240 --> 36:49.880
But yeah, I used world clock to make sure everybody was on board with 630, but you know,

36:49.880 --> 36:50.880
he's got a big project right.

36:50.880 --> 36:56.680
He just did some Kickstarter thing that, you know, made a ton of money, and there- probably

36:56.680 --> 37:02.040
I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to, you know, do some voices

37:02.040 --> 37:06.480
for his project right now, so he's just- I guess he's just a little busy right now.

37:06.480 --> 37:10.760
So we will keep trying here in just a little bit.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.520
But uh, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.920
I'm not, it's just because, you know, I had imagined, you know, okay, it's basically gonna

37:18.920 --> 37:23.220
be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're gonna have,

37:23.220 --> 37:26.900
you know, a lot of players running around and it's gonna be all time real.

37:26.900 --> 37:32.320
That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, an MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.440
And then it was like, okay, it's gonna be a third person perspective.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.440
Well, that's alright.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.760
Oh, that's gonna have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs.

37:39.760 --> 37:44.480
It's like crap, you know, so basically you're doing- you're copycatting everything that

37:44.480 --> 37:50.800
other MMOs are doing, because you wanna, you know, draw more people to it so that they're

37:50.800 --> 37:55.720
not afraid of it, instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get

37:55.720 --> 38:02.520
the people that play your games normally to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter

38:02.520 --> 38:07.440
since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot

38:07.440 --> 38:10.640
of people that play, like, you know, World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with,

38:10.640 --> 38:12.480
oh, it's first person perspective.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
That's a little bit fresh.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.040
It's a little different of an idea.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.440
Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

38:19.440 --> 38:20.440
click, click, oh, dead.

38:20.440 --> 38:24.320
Alright, go, next game, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead, okay, I

38:24.320 --> 38:25.880
mean, it just sounds really boring.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.200
That's why I don't play MMOs.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.520
Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right?

38:32.520 --> 38:35.880
That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action,

38:35.880 --> 38:38.120
it's hard to judge it, right?

38:38.120 --> 38:42.480
I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right?

38:42.480 --> 38:51.040
Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.040
Right.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.040
Okay, alright.

38:53.040 --> 38:58.800
Um, well, um, I guess let's try Mega again, it's been 10 minutes, I, I, unfortunately,

38:58.800 --> 39:03.160
it's um, deducting money from the Skype thingy every time I try, it's like, I can't afford

39:03.160 --> 39:06.640
too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything

39:06.640 --> 39:07.640
I can.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.480
I feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's

39:12.480 --> 39:13.480
try it right now.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.720
We're going to try one more time to get through here, after all it is live radio.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.720
Yeah.

39:17.720 --> 39:18.720
Oh, it's been forwarded.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.000
Oh my gosh, is the phone even on?

39:21.000 --> 39:26.800
Mega's phone may just not be on, maybe he was trying to nap, he's just so tired that

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
the darn phone isn't even on.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.840
I think I'm going to send a tweet.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.240
I actually already did, so we'll see.

39:32.240 --> 39:36.960
I tweeted him, so hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops, yeah, there's this

39:36.960 --> 39:41.380
one place in my house I was, I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal and I was standing

39:41.380 --> 39:43.960
in it, so there it is.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.320
Well, we do have more stories.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.600
That's right, we do have some more stories we can go over, so I think we'll go ahead

39:49.600 --> 39:51.560
and get to that.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.480
Dark Sakura, why don't you read one for us?

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
Sure.

39:54.480 --> 39:59.880
How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie?

39:59.880 --> 40:02.560
Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie.

40:02.560 --> 40:09.960
They had somebody lined up, they had one Carlos Fresnadio and he walked out saying that the

40:09.960 --> 40:16.960
video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating.

40:16.960 --> 40:23.160
So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it who wants to make it really scary, but the studio

40:23.160 --> 40:25.880
doesn't want to pay for it really.

40:25.880 --> 40:30.960
He wants to do a rated R version, not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.320
I mean, basically the quote was the little sisters and injections and the whole thing.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.720
I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later you're still shivering

40:38.720 --> 40:39.720
and going Jesus Christ.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.080
I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that?

40:43.080 --> 40:46.540
Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little

40:46.540 --> 40:49.840
girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.680
And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this, this might be pushing

40:53.680 --> 40:54.680
it for some people.

40:54.680 --> 40:58.760
We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
fine.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.440
I mean, I would see it.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.320
I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
it while he was playing it.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
Right, right.

41:08.320 --> 41:13.480
So yeah, of course I don't mind stuff like that.

41:13.480 --> 41:16.760
I mean, it's not the human centipede, so, so that's good.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.760
Oh my God.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.400
My friend is so excited about the third one.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.400
Oh God.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.400
They're making a third one.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.400
Yeah.

41:22.400 --> 41:27.400
I going, speaking of movies that have no hundred and 50 people, movies with no redeeming qualities

41:27.400 --> 41:33.400
whatsoever and her grandmother love the human centipede.

41:33.400 --> 41:37.520
That's like the grandma's watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
You've met my friend Carly.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.520
Yeah.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.520
Yeah.

41:40.520 --> 41:41.520
It's her.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.000
Well, I don't know her grandma, but she's sick.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
You're German.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.280
What's that have to do with anything?

41:46.280 --> 41:47.280
I don't know.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.480
You know, Germans are all sick people.

41:49.480 --> 41:53.240
No, it's just very strong stomach.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.240
Very stoic.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.240
A hundred and 50 people.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
Really?

41:56.240 --> 41:57.240
It's going to be low key.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.480
You should, you should audition for the part of one of the victims.

42:00.480 --> 42:03.400
I don't think that they're casting it's going to be CG.

42:03.400 --> 42:09.760
You know that, but anyway, I would see this.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.600
I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede

42:14.600 --> 42:15.600
movies.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.600
Just saying.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.600
Absolutely.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.840
And then seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's

42:19.840 --> 42:22.000
just a hundred person train?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.280
I mean, seriously, I think that's going to happen.

42:25.280 --> 42:29.600
I actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway, was watching bad

42:29.600 --> 42:32.640
porn with, you know, perhaps, perhaps.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.640
I don't know.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.640
I don't know.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.640
All right.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.960
Um, here's what I'm going to do guys since it's six 45 and it's 15 minutes after the

42:37.960 --> 42:42.120
time we scheduled a mega ran, I'm going to give it one more try, but this will be the

42:42.120 --> 42:43.760
sixth try.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.920
And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys, cause that's six

42:47.920 --> 42:49.920
times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through.

42:49.920 --> 42:54.120
So let's all, let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about mega ran and

42:54.120 --> 42:55.920
maybe he'll get through this time.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.680
So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network.

42:59.680 --> 43:05.560
I better, you know, I, that's killer.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.560
That's killer.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.120
I'm going to, I'm going to do that whole like panicking thing.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.040
Like am I calling the right number?

43:12.040 --> 43:17.600
Did I put the right number into Skype and it's duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

43:17.600 --> 43:18.600
duh, duh.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.600
Yep.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.600
It's the same, right?

43:20.600 --> 43:21.600
That's that.

43:21.600 --> 43:22.600
That's the number.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.600
You should leave him a message.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.600
You see, let's leave a message.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.080
I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it

43:28.080 --> 43:29.080
here.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.520
So why don't I go grab my cell phone?

43:30.520 --> 43:34.560
I'm going to give mega ran a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going

43:34.560 --> 43:36.800
to say, call it whenever you're ready.

43:36.800 --> 43:37.800
That's a great idea.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.400
That way you make a ramp fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.880
So I'm going to go do that right now.

43:42.880 --> 43:47.120
And I realized I'm, I owe you guys a story, but maybe, maybe Loki will cover it for me.

43:47.120 --> 43:51.640
I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers, Loki, maybe you could cover the story for

43:51.640 --> 43:52.640
me.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.480
And I'm going to go give mega ran a call on my personal line.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.480
All right.

43:55.480 --> 43:59.920
So you know how they have, you know, lay away and stuff like that.

43:59.920 --> 44:04.080
Um, well, Microsoft want to kind of wants to do something similar to that for their

44:04.080 --> 44:05.840
Xbox 360.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.600
They are, there is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized

44:09.600 --> 44:15.320
connect bundle available, um, starting next week.

44:15.320 --> 44:19.680
And what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying

44:19.680 --> 44:21.160
like a cell phone or a cell phone plan.

44:21.160 --> 44:25.920
You get the cell phone at an increase, you know, a very big discount.

44:25.920 --> 44:30.560
And then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly

44:30.560 --> 44:34.040
fees, you know, and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200.

44:34.040 --> 44:41.560
Or, you know, it's when they normally costs about 600 or 700 without the contract.

44:41.560 --> 44:45.100
So that's going to be something similar with this.

44:45.100 --> 44:50.500
Basically the Verge is saying that the bundle is going to be $100 upfront and you're going

44:50.500 --> 44:54.640
to pay $15 a month each month for two years.

44:54.640 --> 44:59.000
And it's also going to include, uh, the Xbox live gold service.

44:59.000 --> 45:06.200
So it would be a way to kind of get people in the door, um, to, you know, buying a system

45:06.200 --> 45:11.680
and being able to play with it for a couple of years, um, without having to drop, you

45:11.680 --> 45:14.080
know, $400 right away.

45:14.080 --> 45:19.720
Now you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you,

45:19.720 --> 45:21.020
you know, bought it outright.

45:21.020 --> 45:23.360
But I think that's more of a convenience.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.480
I mean, cause you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like

45:26.480 --> 45:28.000
that for a cell phone.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.520
So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more, um, about $460 after

45:34.520 --> 45:37.320
the end of the, um, service agreement.

45:37.320 --> 45:43.280
Um, the good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems because

45:43.280 --> 45:46.640
some of those old systems might last two years.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.780
But uh, I don't know.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.080
It's an interesting idea.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.560
I could work, um, especially if you get people to do it.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.840
I'm just going to, I don't know.

45:55.840 --> 45:59.160
It'll be interesting to see how, how that works out.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.560
You know, people paying $15 a month, but I guess that's not too much.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.860
I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches.

46:06.860 --> 46:12.080
So if you can spare a couple of lunches a month, I mean you can be playing an Xbox games

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
for a couple of years.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.440
It's an EAD I guess.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.440
Okay.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.120
I'm back from making that phone call.

46:18.120 --> 46:19.800
So I'll guys, I'll let you guys know what happens.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.280
I really apologize to the Mega Ran fans.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
These things happen.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.280
It's live radio.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.560
It legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now.

46:26.560 --> 46:27.560
Just unplanned.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.240
You know, haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll

46:30.240 --> 46:32.200
be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.920
And then suddenly, Oh, no cell signal that could be happening with me.

46:34.920 --> 46:39.000
I have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you know, you have to re reboot

46:39.000 --> 46:42.520
it every once in a while because you know, people try calling you for days and you're

46:42.520 --> 46:45.800
like, well, my cell phone's been on this entire time and no calls and he rebooted.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.920
And you're like, Hey, why do I have all these missed calls?

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
Exactly.

46:48.920 --> 46:52.240
So, uh, you know, again, Mega Ran fans who might be tuned into OLR for the first time

46:52.240 --> 46:53.240
trying to hear this interview.

46:53.240 --> 46:56.680
I just, you know, I want to say that we're not, we're not, we're not, uh, pulling a fast

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
one on you.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.480
We are legit trying to get through.

46:59.480 --> 47:00.520
We had things set up.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.920
You'll notice Mega retweeted it.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.040
So, you know, he knew about it.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.160
It's just, you know, these things sometimes happen.

47:05.160 --> 47:09.560
I'm hoping I gave him the number to call right through to the show.

47:09.560 --> 47:13.660
Uh, and, uh, so maybe he'll just pop up during the show.

47:13.660 --> 47:14.660
So we'll see.

47:14.660 --> 47:17.080
So, uh, we'll let you know.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.280
All right.

47:18.280 --> 47:23.120
Anyhow, um, back to the Xbox story and the, uh, $99 Xbox.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.760
So I just want to point something out with this.

47:25.760 --> 47:33.120
When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year, and if

47:33.120 --> 47:38.760
you forgot what that's all about, cause you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12 month

47:38.760 --> 47:44.360
agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo three for free and you get a mount

47:44.360 --> 47:47.360
and you get into the beta and all this stuff.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.360
One little thing.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.360
Yeah.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.200
Finals week is not the best week to launch this game.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.200
Okay.

47:52.200 --> 47:57.840
Um, I said back when that happened, I said, Hey, uh, you know, it's just a matter of time

47:57.840 --> 48:02.680
before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone

48:02.680 --> 48:05.760
contracts style agreements.

48:05.760 --> 48:08.740
Now granted, I didn't think about the system element.

48:08.740 --> 48:15.520
I had thought, Oh, well sign up for two years of Xbox live gold and get free halo maps or

48:15.520 --> 48:18.960
a free game or something like that giveaway and all this.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.640
Um, and here we are.

48:21.640 --> 48:25.440
We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.280
Now coming to consoles, let me take it a step further.

48:30.280 --> 48:34.240
This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further.

48:34.240 --> 48:39.960
We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out, not just the

48:39.960 --> 48:44.920
Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it in the PlayStation four, whatever they end

48:44.920 --> 48:50.600
up calling that these systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive

48:50.600 --> 48:52.260
as hell.

48:52.260 --> 48:57.400
I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation three

48:57.400 --> 48:59.280
when it first rolled out.

48:59.280 --> 49:04.120
Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price?

49:04.120 --> 49:05.120
Yes.

49:05.120 --> 49:10.480
And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation four

49:10.480 --> 49:18.880
for $199 with a two year PlayStation plus agreement.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
You know what?

49:19.880 --> 49:25.100
If the thing is, um, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this,

49:25.100 --> 49:31.400
this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know, Xbox live gold.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.640
So $15 a month.

49:32.640 --> 49:36.920
Yeah, it's more per year, but it's not that bad.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.080
$15 is not bad.

49:38.080 --> 49:42.800
Hell, I pay $15 for use in an access every month and I don't even remember.

49:42.800 --> 49:46.000
I forget that even habits and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
It got charged.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.520
So $15 a month is not a big deal.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.680
Just those little things that add up though, man, that in this economy, that's the stuff

49:52.680 --> 49:56.380
that can really get you because it's like, you know, Oh, maybe I'll pay $15 for this

49:56.380 --> 50:01.600
credit monitoring or I'll pay $20 a month for this Disneyland annual pass or a, you

50:01.600 --> 50:06.480
know, 20 bucks for my 24 of our fitness membership and all that stuff starts to add up.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.440
So, but it's an, it's an easy thing to fall for though.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.440
Think about it.

50:10.440 --> 50:14.200
If you own an iPhone and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else.

50:14.200 --> 50:18.880
If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.440
It's basically the iPhone tax.

50:20.440 --> 50:21.440
Yeah.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.440
And you know what?

50:22.440 --> 50:23.680
I don't care because my phone is sexy.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.400
Yeah, it's, it's a hell of a phone.

50:25.400 --> 50:30.200
And I have to say for everyone who's saying Diablo three and well to quote, Vogonator

50:30.200 --> 50:32.440
kiss outside in any sense of social life.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.440
Goodbye.

50:33.440 --> 50:41.880
Just saying been playing well and Diablo three beta and the wow beta and I work full time

50:41.880 --> 50:46.140
and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what?

50:46.140 --> 50:50.200
I still got for pink berry and get laid.

50:50.200 --> 50:56.580
Just saying it's possible and I'm going to Disneyland.

50:56.580 --> 51:00.240
So just saying that was a great way to cap it all off by the way.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.320
Just saying it's possible.

51:02.320 --> 51:06.400
Time management, learn those skills.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.640
And you have the show and I have the show.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.640
Yes I do.

51:09.640 --> 51:15.900
And potentially I would another little project with the lovely cell that I'll kind of don't

51:15.900 --> 51:16.900
buy the horn.

51:16.900 --> 51:18.000
You can chew, but I do love me some sill.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
All right.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.400
Go into our chat room at vog network.com.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.800
Uh, it's right.

51:21.800 --> 51:22.800
Penaxium.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.960
I am a time management pro, uh, shadow next gen says the PlayStation four will not be

51:26.960 --> 51:27.960
$699.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.880
I was just throwing it out there.

51:29.880 --> 51:30.880
What is an iPhone?

51:30.880 --> 51:31.880
A little iPhone?

51:31.880 --> 51:34.760
What does the iPhone cost unsubsidized?

51:34.760 --> 51:38.960
If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost?

51:38.960 --> 51:43.380
I'll tell you because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the

51:43.380 --> 51:46.920
unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
$699.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
Yeah.

51:48.920 --> 51:54.600
I've been a place, I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone and

51:54.600 --> 51:59.100
it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone four S, but an Android it's a, was a Samsung

51:59.100 --> 52:05.960
galaxy two or Samsung was a galaxy S two or something like that.

52:05.960 --> 52:13.320
Um, and luckily I bought my news, so I got it for about $300, but I mean it's still fucking

52:13.320 --> 52:14.320
expensive.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.320
All right.

52:15.320 --> 52:17.480
I'm looking through some more comments.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.680
Our chat room at vog network.com, uh, let's see.

52:20.680 --> 52:21.680
Ross deal.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.920
UT says, of course the PlayStation four won't be $699.

52:24.920 --> 52:26.620
Sony learned that mistake.

52:26.620 --> 52:27.620
Think about what I'm saying though.

52:27.620 --> 52:28.620
Ross deal.

52:28.620 --> 52:32.960
UT here's a way for them not to make that mistake yet still charge that price.

52:32.960 --> 52:33.960
Think about it though.

52:33.960 --> 52:37.720
And because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more

52:37.720 --> 52:41.120
than, you know, recouping like two or $300.

52:41.120 --> 52:46.280
That's recouping like double that you're talking, you know, $50 a month payments.

52:46.280 --> 52:51.360
That's a still a little bit much, uh, what up G in our chat room at, uh, vognetwork.com

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
says.

52:52.360 --> 52:56.120
Then again, they kept the Vita price at two 49, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped

52:56.120 --> 52:57.120
the three DS price.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.440
That's a good point.

52:58.440 --> 53:02.360
They released the Vita cheaper and a lot of people thought they would and it sounded great

53:02.360 --> 53:04.520
and then no, the DS is now cheaper.

53:04.520 --> 53:05.520
I don't know.

53:05.520 --> 53:09.360
It wasn't that bad cause they had, they added, they couldn't drop the price of the system

53:09.360 --> 53:13.480
anymore, but they added value to it by including a eight gig memory card.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.480
So that wasn't so bad.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.480
The Vita is still a sexy piece of hardware.

53:15.480 --> 53:19.320
I mean, I mean three DS is too, I'm not knocking it, but you know, the three DS doesn't do

53:19.320 --> 53:20.320
Skype.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
It does.

53:21.320 --> 53:23.060
The Vita does the web a little better.

53:23.060 --> 53:26.420
You know, there's some things that the Vita does have on the three DS right now.

53:26.420 --> 53:30.240
Although I will say three DS has some pretty must have games right now.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.800
I own them both.

53:33.800 --> 53:37.320
Ross deal UT in chat says sky will the rent to own crowd be big enough?

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
I don't think so.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.720
Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.800
iPhone's the biggest phone out there.

53:41.800 --> 53:47.720
Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal and I bet

53:47.720 --> 53:51.080
Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation four sold as iPhones.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.080
And what are iPhones?

53:52.080 --> 53:54.160
They're subsidized by contract.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.720
Hmm.

53:55.720 --> 53:56.720
It could happen.

53:56.720 --> 54:01.560
All right, anyhow, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release

54:01.560 --> 54:06.840
dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you.

54:06.840 --> 54:08.180
There's not much this week.

54:08.180 --> 54:09.960
It's it's really sad.

54:09.960 --> 54:12.320
This week you're basically looking at two things.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.200
You've got this really cheap ass game.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.080
Um, it's like this foreign one action pack from South peak.

54:18.080 --> 54:22.880
It's for games that were a PlayStation, never games you've probably never, ever heard of.

54:22.880 --> 54:28.240
Um, that's on PS three this week and then also another PS three game star Hawk will

54:28.240 --> 54:29.240
be out this week.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.560
That's actually a pretty decent one.

54:30.560 --> 54:34.560
Um, so that's coming out as well for PS three, nothing else.

54:34.560 --> 54:35.560
Wow.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.680
That's a pretty quick week.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.600
What's the next like big, big title coming out?

54:40.600 --> 54:43.080
Uh, would it be the week after Max Payne three?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.400
Oh yeah, that's right.

54:44.400 --> 54:48.640
Three and herp derp Diablo three, Max Payne three, the rise of Bruce Willis.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.840
I always forget because you know, with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually

54:52.840 --> 54:55.600
save the money to buy Diablo three, which is kind of nice.

54:55.600 --> 55:00.080
Well then, you know, beyond that, uh, there's another $15 a month thing I pay for.

55:00.080 --> 55:03.920
Well also was it the game of Thrones games going to be coming out, um, next week as well.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.960
The week after next as well.

55:05.960 --> 55:10.160
One does not simply pre-order the game of Thrones games.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.160
It should be good.

55:11.160 --> 55:14.400
I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.880
I mean, at least he wrote the story for it and it's got characters that aren't, it's

55:18.880 --> 55:26.800
kind of like the, um, the enter, enter the matrix of the game of Thrones series.

55:26.800 --> 55:30.760
It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they kind of, they're probably

55:30.760 --> 55:34.120
going to cross into the series.

55:34.120 --> 55:40.920
So all right, well I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but I'm like a lot

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
of things on this show tonight.

55:41.920 --> 55:42.920
It just doesn't want to work.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.400
So maybe we can go to Europe real fast.

55:44.400 --> 55:45.400
Well maybe we can.

55:45.400 --> 55:48.400
It's, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly.

55:48.400 --> 55:55.600
Um, on May 9th in the UK we have Datura, which I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes

55:55.600 --> 55:59.520
me think of all of the times I read clan of the cave bear cause that's what they called

55:59.520 --> 56:02.160
like this one urban, anyway.

56:02.160 --> 56:08.260
On the 11th we have Starhawk and Street Fighter cross Tekken for PC and then that's it for

56:08.260 --> 56:10.260
this week.

56:10.260 --> 56:15.600
I mean there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
it for this week.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
Hey, great.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.320
I've got Japanese release dates for you, but remember that whole golden week we were talking

56:21.320 --> 56:22.320
about last week?

56:22.320 --> 56:23.320
It's over.

56:23.320 --> 56:27.080
Well it's over, but you can still kind of feel its impact on the release dates and you

56:27.080 --> 56:31.120
know a lot of the whole economical things that go into why there's no games coming out

56:31.120 --> 56:37.040
in the US right now are also playing out in Japan because on the Nintendo 3DS, nothing.

56:37.040 --> 56:40.200
Going to the Vita, nothing.

56:40.200 --> 56:42.840
How about on the Playstation 3?

56:42.840 --> 56:45.280
Starhawk is a release you have to look forward to this week.

56:45.280 --> 56:49.080
Starhawk comes out on May 10th in Japan, so there is that.

56:49.080 --> 56:53.880
And lastly going to the Wii or the 360, nothing on the Wii, but of course things on the Wii

56:53.880 --> 56:54.880
are dying down.

56:54.880 --> 56:57.080
Xbox 360 doesn't have anything this week either.

56:57.080 --> 57:02.320
El Shaddai next week, but, oh that's even an Encore edition, that's just a price reduction,

57:02.320 --> 57:06.760
but yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.120
You get a chance to check that out in Japan.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.840
That's it for Japanese releases.

57:10.840 --> 57:15.520
Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.960
Alright.

57:17.960 --> 57:24.140
Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops and, you know, we talked about the

57:24.140 --> 57:27.120
rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that, apparently they were correct.

57:27.120 --> 57:32.360
I honestly thought it was called Eclipse, and actually it is technically called Eclipse.

57:32.360 --> 57:37.960
That was the internal name for the game, as I found out.

57:37.960 --> 57:40.800
So there's a little truth to that.

57:40.800 --> 57:47.280
But yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th, and of course on Playstation

57:47.280 --> 57:50.280
3, Xbox 360 PC confirmed.

57:50.280 --> 57:55.000
I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
like that.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.480
But of course all that stuff will be announced later on.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.840
It looks pretty interesting.

57:59.840 --> 58:05.780
The game itself is actually going to be taking place in the future, you know, over the course

58:05.780 --> 58:06.780
of a couple decades.

58:06.780 --> 58:12.080
It's actually going to take place partly in the 80s, and then it's going to jump all the

58:12.080 --> 58:15.240
way up through 2025.

58:15.240 --> 58:24.480
And kind of talking about some of this unmanned warfare stuff, a lot of the drones and that

58:24.480 --> 58:25.480
kind of stuff.

58:25.480 --> 58:30.040
So basically the enemy takes over that and starts attacking LA and the US, and it's up

58:30.040 --> 58:35.240
to real men, real soldiers on the ground to take out the enemies.

58:35.240 --> 58:39.120
And so a very interesting looking thing, some of the new stuff that they're going to be

58:39.120 --> 58:49.240
adding to the actual campaign of the game, including some branching missions and these

58:49.240 --> 58:57.040
new type of missions called strike force, where it's almost a little bit open world.

58:57.040 --> 59:03.160
I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff, where you kind of have a point A, point

59:03.160 --> 59:08.980
B, but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things.

59:08.980 --> 59:14.080
So that sounds kind of interesting, and then of course they're going to be adding the standard

59:14.080 --> 59:19.480
multiplayer stuff, and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as

59:19.480 --> 59:21.160
well.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.560
I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.980
After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet.

59:24.980 --> 59:27.840
So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up, and actually it kind of makes

59:27.840 --> 59:31.200
me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing

59:31.200 --> 59:32.280
that as well.

59:32.280 --> 59:36.000
So you think that there's actually going to be money made off of sales of the old copy

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
then, huh?

59:37.000 --> 59:41.120
Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game.

59:41.120 --> 59:45.240
And then of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 day 1 preorders were actually

59:45.240 --> 59:52.120
higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 preorders, so it's off to a good start.

59:52.120 --> 59:53.120
Sounds that way.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.120
Hey, guess what guys?

59:54.120 --> 59:55.280
I have some great news.

59:55.280 --> 59:57.000
Guess who just called me?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Random.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Awesome.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.120
So, he said, he apologizes.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.520
This has happened to you, right?

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.520
The phone died.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.720
So you had to go plug in, but we're going to get him on now.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.240
Thank you guys for being patient, and those of you that left, well, tough cookies.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.600
For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing, you need to hear Random or MegaRan

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.040
right now.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040
Hello?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.200
Hey, is this MegaRan?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.240
Yes, it is, how are you?

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240
What is up?

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.560
It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, here with DarkSakura and Loki.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.560
How's it going?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.960
The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.440
How you doing?

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.680
Sorry, I'm good, I had an adventurous day, sorry I'm late, sorry.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680
That is oka-

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:48.400
My flight was delayed, and the phone died, and all types of other things, but I'm here.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.400
You could file that under, you know, Fashionable Superstar.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.760
Yeah, that is A-okay, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity, is when you're

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:01.040
showing up fashionably late.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.680
These things happen, don't even worry about it, we're good, I'm just happy that you're

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680
here on the air.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.760
And hey, if you guys have a question for Random, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.640
can ask that question in chat right now, but while you guys get those questions out there,

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.720
I got some questions for Random that I want to ask.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.760
Now Random, some of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio, you know, they might

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.400
be gamers, but they might not know about you.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.560
So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:40.440
Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.480
of those things together, you know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.120
and history, and I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.520
cool music.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.920
A lot of it is video game based, what I do is I like to use the traditional sounds from

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.800
video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.000
and then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.800
sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes, and I put it all together

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.280
and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Ran.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.420
That's awesome, and if you want to check out the music, of course you can visit Random

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:30.600
or Mega Ran at his website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.760
download, and some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.360
bit, so free is awesome, thank you for providing that.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.360
So I have a question.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.360
Free is always good.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360
Questions, yeah?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360
Yeah, Dark Sakura.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360
What do you teach?

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:51.040
Oh, I taught middle school, I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing, and history,

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.160
social studies, stuff like that, to middle school kids.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.200
You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects, ever.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.600
I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600
Oh my, totally.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:10.120
Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so, up until this past

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.840
year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time, and there

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.160
I am, so far I feel good.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.200
That sounds awesome.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.900
That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love, because Random, I gotta

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.800
tell you, I'm a teacher too, I'm a different type of teacher, I'm a corporate trainer,

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.920
so I teach people in my company, and that's my day job, but I've had this podcast with

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.640
my buddies for ten years, and I'd love to be able to quit, as much as I love my day

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.560
job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time, but you're doing it, you're

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.440
living the dream, and that's awesome.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.280
Yeah, and I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.520
in teaching as well in music, so there's always lessons and things, I love history, I love

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.000
poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff with my favorite books, I will talk

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.600
about them and rap about them, so it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.440
well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it, I was already doing what I loved,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.200
it was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200
all.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.680
What was the first video game that inspired you to take it to music?

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.920
Was it Mega Man, or was there something else that maybe people don't know about?

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.000
What was the first video game that inspired you, like, this game is so awesome, I've gotta,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.840
it really takes a special kind of game to take that extra step and make that fan creation

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.680
for it, whether it be a podcast or a website or a rap song.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680
What was the first for you?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.680
That's true.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:41.320
Oh, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that I first

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:46.560
decided or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560
2.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:53.560
Now, Goonies 2 had a really cool, it was a good game, it had a really cool soundtrack,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:00.440
and I had a Casio keyboard, and that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:10.000
on my keyboard, I still remember it, but I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.320
and so not knowing, you know, when I'm, I don't know, 10, 11, 12 years old, that I was

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.280
actually making what is now considered to be fan art, but it was just me playing it

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.040
by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.280
I didn't necessarily do anything with that, but that was the first time that I ever experienced

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:35.200
a movie, not movie, but video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.080
to try to create my own version of it.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.880
Goonies 2 is an incredibly underrated 8-bit game, you know, looking back, and I am totally

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.880
with you, that game had a lot more depth than a lot of people gave it credit for, especially

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.280
for being a loose movie tie-in.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:55.000
Oh yeah, I really loved that game, I had a huge plenty of hours of fun on that game.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.560
Let's talk about other games that have really inspired you music, now I know a lot of folks

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.640
may know you through the Capcom stuff, you know, Splash Woman was huge for you, you had

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.200
the Mega Ran 9, Mega Ran 10, but it's not just Capcom games, you have this Black Materia

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.600
album that's out, you have a regular version, you have a remixed version, it's Final Fantasy

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.840
7, which is kind of a polarizing game in the fan community.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.400
Some people love Final Fantasy 7, some people are sick of hearing about it.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.320
What is it about Final Fantasy 7 that moved you to dedicate two albums to it?

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.900
Well, Final Fantasy 7 was a huge game for me, I was pretty much out of gaming when it

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:36.800
came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school, I didn't have time

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.800
for games anymore, I didn't have a system, until I watched one of my friends or suitemates

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.880
play it, and I was completely hooked, I saw some of the summons and just watched about

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:54.360
an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined roleplaying games to me, because

01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:00.840
the 3D aspect and the character development was just so awesome, so I wound up getting

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:06.760
the Playstation almost flunking out of school playing this game, I mean, it's something

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.600
that completely enveloped me, so it's a huge part of my childhood, so that's what made

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.360
me go back, because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:23.720
to me, that it changed the game to me, that was my introduction, well kind of reintroduction

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:30.040
to gaming, and so that was the game that got me back into console gaming, so I feel like

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.440
I owe a lot to it, so I decided to do a little homage to it, called Black Materia, luckily

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.440
a lot of people liked it, came out last year, and kind of took off a little bit, that might

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:46.400
be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music, it's because the demand

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:52.480
for it and for performances after that just became too much to handle with a full time

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.560
job, so it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.280
But you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.960
only one out there that has such, some memories tied to that game, I know that was a huge

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:11.040
game for me in college, I probably failed a class or two because of Final Fantasy VII,

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:18.760
but it was so worth it, which maybe I shouldn't be telling a teacher.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.760
Final Fantasy VII came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a Playstation, my

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.160
roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a Playstation, I had a SNES, I was

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:34.600
still playing Chrono Trigger, but I played the stew out of that and did time the nights

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.320
of the round with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing, did go long enough for me to make a

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320
sandwich.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320
Wow.

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.320
It's true.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.240
Alright, let me ask, let me ask, we only have so much time with Random Tonight, I want to

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.440
ask him about another game series, because this is one, this is a very recent addition

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:59.920
to your website at Mayoran.com and I was, in a way I was not surprised at all to see

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.920
this, I wasn't, I wasn't, Journey, a hip hop excursion, you were recently plugging this

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.880
on your website, oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either,

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.320
but the way you translated this into hip hop is something else, tell me more about the

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.680
process of creating Journey, a hip hop excursion.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.600
Oh man, that was a lot of fun, I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:28.680
and moved by the Journey video game, I was told and emailed constantly about playing

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.840
this game, but I just didn't have enough time, and people were like, you gotta play it, you

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.040
gotta play it, you're gonna love it, and I'm like, yeah, that's all I need is another game,

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.880
I have games here that are unopened, that I haven't been able to get to yet, but I don't

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.440
have time, and they're like, no, that's the best thing about it, it's just, it's an hour

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:50.280
long experience, you just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it, and so I did, I played

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.760
it, and I was instantly inspired, I mean, it's a great game, it's so cool how they just

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.040
created the entire scenario, I mean, there's no dialogue, you're basically creating your

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:08.160
own story and synopsis, and it's just such an experience, I don't even know any other

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.360
way to describe it except an experience, because it just kinda immerses you, so when I wound

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:20.200
up playing the game through Think Twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack, and then

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.240
I had a whole day, I think I was just, I was trying to raise funds with Kickstarter, and

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.640
we had got to a really, a certain level, I think it was maybe 10,000, and usually when

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:36.440
I get to round numbers, I try to give a, some sort of a surprise gift for the support, so

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.760
as I was playing the journey soundtrack, I said, well, why don't I work on making some

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.940
hip hop beats, so the entire day, I sat down, I use a program called Reason, so what I do

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.400
is just take the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.240
bit, stretch them out, slow them down, go through them, add some drums, take out some

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.960
things, you know, bring them back in later, and wound up creating some really cool beats

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:07.920
with the very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel, and that was really what I wanted

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.120
to create, so it came out pretty well, I really like it, I still listen to it a lot.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.720
It's great, and you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right?

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.920
I saw that tweet on your website, it's awesome.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.360
Yeah, that was pretty cool, Austin Wintory actually listened to it, and told me he liked

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.240
it, told me it was a great job, and I'm like, wow, that's pretty cool, I mean, you gotta

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.720
love Twitter for that reason, just that everything is so accessible, everybody's one click away,

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.820
and I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.720
remixes that they contacted him about it, like, hey Austin, have you heard this?

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.680
And so that's kind of what made him respond, and so that was really cool, like, props from

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.840
the man himself, you really can't beat that.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.560
And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing, because this whole interview

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.380
tonight is being brought to you by Twitter, you know, we say we are the show where every

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:05.800
gamer has a voice, and we went to Twitter, and we said, hey tweets, who do you want to

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800
see on the show?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.640
And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on, and here we are,

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640
here we are.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.120
Yes, I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120
That's right.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.520
Now, you brought up Kickstarter a minute ago, and I kind of wanted to go in that direction,

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.460
because you know, Kickstarter's been a very big thing, it's been this buzzword in our

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:32.360
community for, you know, a few months, and it's been big for you too, and I know you've

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.640
done a couple projects on there, and this most recent one you did was called Language

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.640
Arts.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.440
Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it, how did the

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.040
community help you achieve your goals with Language Arts?

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.280
Oh man, well, the community was just humongous, I don't, but we've done a Kickstarter in the

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:56.560
past, like I said, we've done one for, actually two, we've been wanting to create vinyl for

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.080
a Sam and Tom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:08.120
Then we did another later for a, to play a show with London, at the London Anime Con,

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.640
and both of those went decent, we got our goals, we didn't get necessarily way over

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.240
the goal, but we did pretty well, and I decided to go back and try it again, it was one of

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.440
those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy, everybody's doing it these

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.440
days, like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now, video game companies

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:35.080
are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now, and so I always

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.160
told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea,

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.680
so instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years,

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:49.000
almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience, so instead of just an album,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.680
it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.640
Now of course I can't do all that on my own without having artists and developers help

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.760
me out, so I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out, so that then came

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.720
Kickstarter, so I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:14.720
near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this, but I said we'll start small,

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:27.640
and lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000, so a 516% completion rate,

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.960
and just from the response has been overwhelming, I mean from Facebook, Twitter, to just the

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:41.640
guys on my email list, I went out to PAX East and performed, and it was probably right before

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.400
the Kickstarter really got underway, and I told a lot of people about it, and people

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.600
were like hey I want to support, and sure enough they did, we had over 300 backers who

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.200
are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comic,

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.960
so I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level, and that's what hopefully

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.240
this Kickstarter has allowed us to do, I think I want to do this in a whole new way, and

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.600
this could be the album that kind of defined me, you know I've done a lot of Final Fantasy

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:15.600
stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property, but

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.240
I really want to create my own legacy, and I think this Language Arts project will do

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.200
that when it's all done.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.200
I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal, and just kind of cool to have this comic

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:35.080
book and video game and album that all tie together, yet it's not some movie franchise

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.680
being turned into this, it's you, it's your story, that's awesome.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.640
That's what's cool about it, I wanted to make it based on my story, now granted the game

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.520
and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:58.980
they are interweaving a bit, the album is much more realistic, I kind of take that hero

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:05.400
and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.680
with some cool abilities, but he's for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.040
shooting beams out of his eyes, but in the game of course, you know to make things a

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.680
lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it, and the comic as well.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:27.120
So if you're taking my story, and my own original story, and original characters that myself

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:35.040
and the guys at J1 Studios created, and creating a universe around it, like almost a franchise,

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.680
so it's really exciting.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:42.640
That is so awesome, looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at MegaRan.com,

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.400
we'll have more information on that when it's out I'm sure.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.640
Random, I want to give, I know we're a little past our time here, hopefully I'm not keeping

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.760
you from everything, from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.680
and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.560
So Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.280
All right, vognetwork.com, if you want to ask some questions in chat, let me get you

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.920
an email question we got earlier in the week.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.820
This is from Will O, sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Random

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:16.380
has a style that just seems effortless, and his sincerity bleeds through each track.

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:20.720
He honestly seems to love what he's doing, and I just wanted to throw that out there

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.400
that that's coming across, but here's the question, Random.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.480
Do you think it would be possible, do you think it would be possible to be doing what

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.080
you're doing before the age of social media?

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.640
How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
music or tour?

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.160
So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.800
you do what you're doing without social media?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.400
Wow, I don't think so.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.280
No, I really don't.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.000
And this whole, the whole Mega Ran story started because of social media.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.320
I was contacted on MySpace in 2007 by Capcom, so if not for social media, I don't know

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.960
if I'd be here, you know, so I do owe a lot to it, you know, I've been, yeah, I'm

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.720
hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media, and I think it would make it to be

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.920
a little more fun going, you know, out and doing the old school method, because I do

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920
that a lot.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.360
I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:26.480
not only, you know, all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.520
two times a week, you know, I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.040
out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people, so it's not just social media, but I feel

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.760
like social media is a huge part of it, but like I said, I think my leg up comes from

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:47.720
the fact that I'm out and about in the community, physically making appearances, as well as,

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.200
you know, taking full advantage of social media.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.920
I think you're right on the money there, I think, you know, I may not be quite on the

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.920
superstar level, but I think that that's really the key is you gotta interact, you

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.400
know, not just online, but in person, the old school way, as well.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:07.120
M.C. Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, M.C. Lars, that he's always told me that

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.620
you gotta get out and play, you know, you have to get out and play.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.800
Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:20.680
apart, so getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:26.060
Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the vog, or excuse me, vognetwork.com,

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:31.600
and I'm gonna go to a question from actdeft first, and I think this is a good question.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.840
I'll take this question to the next level.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.760
Who is Mega Ran's favorite video game music composer?

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.400
Oh, man.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:49.480
I gotta say, I'm gonna go back a little bit, and I'm gonna say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:56.920
He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island, and a lot

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.940
of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.940
You're officially my hero.

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.940
He is the bomb.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.640
We know Yuzo very well.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:10.040
Mangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music, and of course, Actraiser.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.320
The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to L.A., just saying.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320
Yes.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320
Oh, my God.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.320
It's amazing.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.320
Excellent.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.320
I'll be able to listen to that tonight.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320
Excellent.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.320
Excellent.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.080
Let's go to another question from Brakeman, you know, because you're very well known for

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080
the Mega Man stuff.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:34.720
Brakeman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Man's favorite Mega Man theme?

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:40.000
Well, I could go with the easy choice.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.440
There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:48.360
So Mega Man 2, WALL-E Stage 1, everybody loves that.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.800
I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.360
I love Wood Man's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.080
The only one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.880
Bomb Man from Mega Man 1, and what else?

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880
Crash Man.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.880
I love Crash Man.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.880
Crash Man is great.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:14.520
There's so many, and if you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.920
used them, or I've never intended to remake them.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.800
Crash Man, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.720
You know, WALL-E Stage 1, same thing.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.800
Mega Man 3, Title Screen, same thing.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.200
It's just so great, as is.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.240
Proto Man's theme, another one I love.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:38.480
So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to touch those out of respect

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.280
for how I feel about them.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.840
You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do them justice based on the Mega Man 9 album,

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.480
but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.880
I think that's great.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.360
Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I think I know where this guy's

01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:02.160
going with this name, but the name is I Far Ted, what a great name in chat, wants to know,

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.360
is there any game that Mega Ran hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on?

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360
Oh.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.440
See, I'm afraid of questions like that, because I don't want to answer it, and then a couple

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.440
things could happen.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:23.480
One, someone just takes it and does it, or two, I could never get to it, and people are

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.280
like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned?

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:32.120
But I will say, I have two that my eyes are on.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:41.960
The Metal Gear Solid series, and Legend of Zelda, particularly A Link to the Past, so

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.680
those are what my eyes are on right now.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.800
But the next plan, though, for next year is, myself and K-Murdock, we're doing an all Sega

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:56.840
album called Sega State or Sega City, and it's going to be all Sega, so from Master

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:04.280
System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast, it's going to be all Sega all the time, that'll

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.280
be our next one.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.760
But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do, but story-wise, that's just such

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:16.360
a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that, you know, it would still

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.600
be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII, which is something

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.760
that took like a year to make, so.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.360
You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that, Gio Vedeo screaming, yes, Metal

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.440
Gear, do it, so there you go.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.720
Now we're way over time here, and I want to get to Megurand's song here, but quickly,

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.720
one last question from Dark Soccer.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.680
I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.520
Oh, okay, I've taken requests before.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:50.920
Well, the official game of Orange Bound Radio is the Guardian Legend.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.360
So could we hope to have you tackle that someday?

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.280
You know what, I really, you know what, I did, I did a Guardian Legend track.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280
Really?

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:05.840
Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song, okay, there's a song called

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:13.760
Comtact, C-O-N dash tact, and it's all about com etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legends.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:14.760
Awesome.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.760
Okay.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:19.520
It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to times, what you should and shouldn't

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520
do.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.520
It's very useful.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.920
Is that, the Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.520
by Fantasy Zone.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520
All right.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.280
Oh my God, those are some great games, like, I love Guardian Legends.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.160
So you were on the top of my hero list now.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.000
Well, look, we got random way past time here, and you know, we got off to a late start tonight,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.160
but Random, you know, I want to really thank you for taking the time out to come on Orange

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.120
Lounge Radio tonight and talk about your music.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.840
Again, if people want to know more about your music, they can check you out at Megaran.com,

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.440
and you can also get the music at MegaranMusic.com.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.320
Random, is there anything else you want to plug here on the show, before we get to the

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.320
song?

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.920
Well, let's see, anything I want to plug, I don't know, follow me on Twitter, at Megaran,

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.600
there's Megaran music on Facebook, I don't know, thanks for the support, keep listening.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.960
The Language Arts album will be out for everybody May 22nd, so mark that on your calendar, and

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.240
yeah, I'll see you out in the funny papers.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240
All right.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:29.720
Random, thanks again so much for taking the time out, and best of luck with everything

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.720
in the future, all right?

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.720
Oh, thank you, man.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.720
All right, take care, buddy.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:39.000
Hey, we're going to close out here with a track from Megaran, and this is actually a

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.360
really special deal here.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.920
This is actually a duet that he did with MC Frontalot, which is pretty awesome.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:54.440
You can check this out at MegaranMusic.com, it's Random and MC Frontalot with Wake Up

01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:10.760
here on Orange Lounge Radio, check this out.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:29.680
All right, I can do this, where are my glasses, come on, come on, I got to get out of here,

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680
let me get out, here we go.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:50.160
I got to get this, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:27:01.660
Here we go.

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:07.660
It's not all good, but I got my blessings, ma'am There's a lot to find a job, but a long

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.660
one you wanna do I had a daily double and came up on two

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:14.660
Three if you count, a loyal significant other This didn't seem half as hard when I lived

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.660
with my mother But I got tired of hearing it go on and get

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.660
serious Now I be flowing like regular periods

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:24.660
Growing as a theorist since my years in this And I learned so much, so I think it's time

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:27.660
to grow up Packin' my lunch Doritos and cold cuts

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.660
One more pay cut and I'm gone Time to wake up

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:35.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:40.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:45.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:50.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:54.660
No snooze, you wanted to be a rapper Now you got what you were after, wouldn't

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.660
rather Well you know you have to grab the mic

01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.660
And make noises into it You and the beat get intimate

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:03.660
Send a report to the syndicate Indicating that you'll have a trap pretty soon

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:07.660
I'm in threads, incredulous at replies Swoon, win, win, then alarm, alarm

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:10.660
Oh no, I slipped into a dream Didn't get the rhyme written

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.660
The rig is in to quip And there's sound check in an hour

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.660
You know how you sometimes meet a nerd rapper Who hasn't showered

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.660
That was probably me, beg your forgiveness It's only through your largess

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.660
I'm even about to live this dream out So when I'm cussin' about my whack boss

01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:27.660
Old man front runnin' his sweatshop Take a sad pause, share the long tear

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:31.660
Then remind, that every day I wake up There's an aid on, kindly

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:36.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:46.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:51.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, cause you gotta grind

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:56.660
Wake up, don't tell me it's time to wake up Snoring like a bulldozer, going like the brakes cut

01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:01.660
Eye boogers are starting to cake up 6.30 sharp, I gots to pick the pace up

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.660
Get my face up off of the pillow And ain't much time for a meal

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.660
So I grab the cake up French roast and get ghost and take lunch

01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:14.660
If I'm late once more, I'm gone, case shut Netflix was on, shutting the stage up

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:19.660
Last night, watch Jimmy tear the stage up Hop the train, just missed the late bus

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.660
Get a taxi, he taxed me 28 bucks Running late but maybe I can make up time

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:29.660
Stay after hours and face up to the music No excuses, straight up

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:34.660
I mean I came to work, what else did they want? Head straight up the hall to A1

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.660
My secretary always had something to say but This time what she said left me straight crushed

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:42.660
You do know it's Saturday right? Say what?

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:47.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:52.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:57.660
If you don't move, then you don't eat So you better get up on your feet

01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:19.660
It's a new day, running out of time Time to rise and shine, guess you gotta climb

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.660
Some people shower before bed, hello? You'll have that con funk that he talks about

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:40.660
Con funk, well he's already said hi on Facebook, not on Facebook, on Twitter

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:43.660
Totally follow him on Twitter, he's really cool

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:47.660
I wanna know, why did he tweet Anime Jam Session? He went on Anime Jam Session

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:51.660
Nah, it's all good, Rama was helping me screen the questions actually so he does get props

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:57.660
Listen to Anime Jam Session, this is a good show And I don't know how I missed the Guardian Legend one

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.660
He's got a lot, he's got a lot

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:06.660
That is going to be on my iPhone soon

01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:10.660
Alright well if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:13.660
That particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.660
MegaRanMusic.com, go get it, MegaRanMusic.com

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:23.660
And thanks again, right on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it, right on to the management for setting that up

01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.660
And for Random for appearing on our show tonight

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:33.660
And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan Language Arts video game and comic project Kickstarter

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:39.660
We will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.660
As well as a signed comic to a lucky listener

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.660
Look at you

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:48.660
I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes by the way

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:55.660
Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while but for those of you that are sticking around

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:59.660
I knew some people would just be here to listen to MegaRan and then hit the road

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.660
Which I understand, it's all good

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:07.660
But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.660
So just stay tuned, I'll get into that in a little bit

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:12.660
It's not as good as what Loki just talked about but it's still pretty cool

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.660
Alright, we got to get back into some news

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.660
We're running late now but that's alright, it was worth the wait

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.660
I don't remember how much of the Black Ops story we tackled

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.660
We were done with the Black Ops

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.660
We were done with the Black Ops story

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:27.660
Alright, so let's move on to one more story and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week here

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.660
This has to do with streaming service Gaikai

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:34.660
You might have heard of this, they're the ones that I believe were streaming the stuff on YouTube and some other places

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.660
They're kind of that competitor for OnLive of sorts

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:42.660
Well Gaikai is getting together with Wikipad to make a game streaming tablet

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:48.660
It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console quality gamepad controller

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.660
There's pictures of this on the internet

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:56.660
Just imagine the most giant stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.660
Where you slammed an iPad in the middle

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.660
That's what this thing looks like

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.660
Honestly it looks a lot better than the one that Razor was looking at making

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.660
Yeah, yeah, so now apparently Wikipad isn't super popular yet

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.660
They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.660
But they've already gone through some changes with it

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:17.660
It's got a 10.1 inch screen and a quad core processor now

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.660
Optional 3G for mobile

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.660
But here's the other thing, it ain't out yet

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:23.660
So it's one of those things that is coming soon

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.660
Gaikai is out there though if you want to check that out

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:29.660
And it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:31.660
That's pretty big for a portable system

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.660
But I'd say if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.660
Yeah, and people carry tablets too

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.660
And it's streaming gaming

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.660
So if you think about it, you're able to play console type games

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.660
Because the same stuff that OnLive is doing

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.660
Like Saints Row the Third or something of that quality

01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.660
Through this pad

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.660
And the controls look pretty similar to a current gen console

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660
So I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that

01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.660
I'd rather have an iCade than an iPad

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.660
Just saying

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.660
Well isn't an iCade a device for an iPad?

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.660
Yeah

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.660
I'd rather have that, I'm fine with it

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.660
Or MAME on an Android, I mean what's the difference really

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:13.660
Well look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.660
We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:21.660
No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.660
Hooked up to either a modem or your cable

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.660
A portable console

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.660
We didn't even have that over here

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:29.660
We had a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.660
And plugging your Nintendo into it

01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.660
Which some guy we knew had in his car

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.660
A Playstation in the car

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:39.660
We did that in middle school with a camp TV

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:41.660
That ran on D cells

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.660
We're going to go to a classic time

01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:45.660
When things were a lot simpler

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.660
And take a look at the classic game of the week

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.660
Dark Soccer is going to dip into the video game vault

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.660
And find a game that she thinks

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.660
Hey, you kids ought to be playing this video game

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.660
You know, Random got the jump on you though

01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.660
With the Goonies 2 nostalgia

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.660
But this one's pretty good too

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.660
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.660
A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.660
And I'm not going to spoil why

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.660
Galaga!

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.660
Yes, Galaga

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.660
Also known in Japan as Gyaraga

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.660
Which is...

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.660
Freaking intro music

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.660
Pew! Pew pew pew!

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.660
It's the game of pew pew is what it is

01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:29.660
Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.660
And published by Midway in North America in 1981

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.660
It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.660
Why I didn't do Galaxian?

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.660
I don't know, I wanted to do Galaga

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:41.660
So whatever

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:45.660
Anyway, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.660
You go back and forth

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.660
You don't get to go up or fly around

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:51.660
It's a simple, fixed shooter

01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:55.660
And the enemies fly at you in formation

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.660
And you have to pew pew them all before they pew pew you

01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.660
And once they're all vanquished

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:03.660
Then you move on to the next stage

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:05.660
Yahoo! Alright

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.660
Galaga was pretty, pretty popular

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.660
As I'm sure you all know

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:13.660
So we have many different sequels to Galaga

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.660
And many versions of Galaga

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.660
At any rate, Galaga for me was just the coolest

01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:29.660
You could let your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.660
And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.660
Which was always super cool

01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:41.660
It also had a few features that improved over Galaxian

01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.660
Like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.660
Your hit miss ratio, and the challenging stage

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:52.660
And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:57.660
And like I said, you also could get captured

01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:02.660
It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up

01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.660
You could shoot it and get it down

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:10.660
And then there are actually full on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.660
That's how a lot of people play

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:19.660
It also had a bug that was called, actually the bug would make your attackers stop firing bullets

01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.660
It was actually a coding error

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:25.660
I just want to say the double, the whole two ships tied together thing

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.660
That's like the only way I can be decent at this game

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.660
I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.660
Like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.660
Well a lot of people based their strategy around it

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:41.660
Like I said, there's also a split screen bug that was like Impact Man

01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.660
It's not quite the same thing

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:47.660
It's similar to the split screen bug in Impact Man

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.660
Where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.660
And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.660
It could cause the game to stall

01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:00.660
And it means it has to be either reset or power cycled so that you can start a new game

01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:04.660
So in the series of Galaxian

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.660
And I'm going to start with Galaxian

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:16.660
You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:23.660
Galaga Legion in 2008, Galaga Legion DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:28.660
Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave and Busters in Milpitas

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:34.660
They used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.660
Which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:39.660
With the 3 screens, now it's like some

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.660
I don't think I ever saw that, but that sounds amazing

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.660
The thing is still there

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:44.660
Wow

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:46.660
But the game is in it, they put another one

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.660
When you go back to the far back where they have the giant crane

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:54.660
And the thing that's to the left of it that you walk inside

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.660
That was the Galaxian machine

01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.660
So, just saying

01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:02.660
As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:07.660
There's been the Atari 7800, the Famicon version, Game Boy

01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.660
And also it was bundled with Galaxian

01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:14.660
There was a GameTap, MSX, the MSX version is actually really good

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.660
Of course NES because the high we had a Famicon version

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.660
The Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 color computer

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:24.660
Which I played Galagon on it

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.660
That was the game, it was a clone called Galagon

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:29.660
And I played Stu out of this

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.660
Because my friend had one of these things

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.660
It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version

01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.660
Xbox Live Arcade

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:41.660
IOS is the Galaga Remix which had the original on it

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.660
Nintendo 3DS which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.660
And Roku

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:50.660
There has also been several versions of Namco Museum

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.660
Which are really way too many

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:57.660
We have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.660
And Windows, there were two versions of each

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:04.660
PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:08.660
And the Wii, which I have most of those

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660
Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.660
Is the game with the OLR cameo

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:16.660
Which makes it double awesome

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:19.660
That is the double awesome version, of course I had to

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.660
You gotta get that one out there

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.660
Jeez Rob

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:27.660
There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.660
Of Tekken in 1995

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.660
You could play it as it loaded

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.660
In Point Blake 2 there were Galaga Challenge Stages

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:39.660
In the 20 year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:42.660
That had Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.660
There was that

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.660
The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.660
It was even available on Palm Devices and Pocket PC

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.660
So Galaga really has an amazing legacy

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.660
Hold on

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:59.660
Sorry, my allergies are flaring up everybody

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.660
You alright over there?

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.660
That's why I sound like a 12 year old boy

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.660
At any rate, there were remakes

01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:09.660
There was Galaga Arrangement

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:12.660
Which was part of the Namco Museum compilation

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.660
Galaga Destination Earth, it came out in 1998 for Windows

01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.660
PlayStation and the Game Boy Color

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:22.660
Galaga Remakes came out in 2007 for the Wii

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:26.660
And you use your Wii remote as a gun

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:30.660
And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:33.660
The video ran out so we have to hear that opening theme one more time

01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:49.660
There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, Galaga 88

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:52.660
Were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.660
Called the Galaga 30th Anniversary

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.660
That was done by Noki Bandai

01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:59.660
Basically the app had Galaxian as a free game

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:03.660
And then they had to pay for a complete set for 8 bucks

01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.660
But it had Galaga points

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.660
So you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.660
Including the original art

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.660
Their world record for Galaga

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.660
Now keep in mind, this is twin galaxy stuff

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:20.660
It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krogman of Boca Raton

01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:21.660
Florida

01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:24.660
And the rapid fire setting

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:27.660
And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:31.660
And it was also in this class of 81

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:33.660
Fast shot world record settings

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:37.660
Were both by John Krenkel of Battle Creek, Michigan

01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:42.660
And I remember actually seeing some of the people who had the earlier ones

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.660
In King Fong

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.660
They had people just playing

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.660
The high score people gathered back together

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:52.660
When what's his face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:57.660
Galaga, actually

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:01.660
There was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.660
For him to practice for war games

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:09.660
Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:15.660
And basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions

01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:21.660
There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.660
I have the Pac-Man one of those, just saying

01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:29.660
And because the place I'm reading is not updated since

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.660
Galaga made an appearance in the Avengers

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:36.660
Just saying

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:37.660
But you'll say no more

01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.660
But I'll say no more

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.660
Cause that guy over there is playing Galaga

01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:43.660
He didn't think I'd notice, but I did

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:44.660
Alright, is that it?

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:45.660
That's the quote

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.660
Classic game of the week

01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:52.660
Galaga, available everywhere, but most notably the arcade

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.660
Because shield helicarriers have joysticks, just saying

01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:01.660
But we would prefer that you play the arcade version or the Playstation Network version that has the OLR cameo

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.660
Yes

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.660
So that's important too

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.660
Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.660
A no prize, my favorite kind of prize

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.660
Alright, we're running way long for part A

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.660
I wonder why, perhaps the longer we

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.660
No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki, I'm allergic to California

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:16.660
It was worth it

01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:18.660
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:22.660
We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.660
Don't go anywhere, we got more coming up in part B

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:33.660
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:37.660
Live on the VOG Network, voice of Geeks Network on this

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.660
May the 6th of 2012

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:43.660
We are live with the 456th episode of our show

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.660
You guys missed a fun part A

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.660
Little worried there at the beginning

01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:50.660
Little worried there when things were delayed with our interview

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.660
But it was well worth the wait

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.660
Random aka Megaran telling us a lot about inspiration

01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:59.660
We just kind of geeked out with him a little bit about old games that are awesome

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.660
And that's the best kind of interview

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:02.660
I want the Sega album

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.660
I know right, sounds awesome

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.660
I've got sonic boobs today ok

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:10.660
We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:12.660
But you're wearing this shirt

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:14.660
I paid $10 for it

01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:20.660
It's a Sonic shirt and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is

01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:21.660
Yeah

01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.660
So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies but

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.660
Can't help it, triple D, hi

01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.660
Picks or it didn't happen

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.660
I put picks up

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.660
On Orange Lounge Radio.com? Oh awesome, alright there you go

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:35.660
And the other can of Vimto that I drink

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.660
This is pretty, I've never had Vimto before

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:39.660
Which our European listeners should know of

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.660
I've never had Vimto before but I'm having a Vimto light and it's really good

01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.660
I've never had Vimto light before, I like the regular soda

01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:48.660
It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.660
It's just with sugar

01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:53.660
It tastes a little bit like Hansen's black cherry, a little bit

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:56.660
It's black currant and raspberry soda

01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.660
Ok I can see that

01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:00.660
But I like the regular Vimto, I always drink it at a touch of Britain

01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:04.660
And when I went to the Iraqi Deli today to get some shawarma

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.660
Because shawarma, there's a good place two bucks down

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.660
Which you won't get yet

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:14.660
I went and got, I saw they had Vimto light

01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.660
So I bought a couple of cans of it

01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:18.660
And it is pretty delicious

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.660
Although I have to say I do prefer the regular Vimto

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.660
It's not bad, I drink that

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.660
It's good stuff, alright anyway

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:25.660
Babylon Market

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.660
By the way we do have somebody staying up late

01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:29.660
Listening to us all the way from the UK

01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.660
Pekor Uno is with us saying I don't like Vimto

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.660
I prefer Robina, I don't know that word

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:35.660
Robina is not bad

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:40.660
But I tried, it's this, I like

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.660
Tizer, I think is what it's called, T-I-Z-E-R

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:48.660
I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.660
Like a grapefruit soda, it's pretty good

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:55.660
Alrighty, you said you got that shirt at Kmart

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.660
I want to get that out too

01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.660
Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock

01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:03.660
By the Genesis ad it's coming

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.660
You know Genesis does what Nintendon't

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.660
But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.660
Is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.660
And Shermy needed stuff to pee on

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:16.660
So I got Shermy stuff to pee on

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.660
And I needed Sudafed

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.660
As you can all tell by my 12 year old boy puberty voice

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:26.660
So, just saying

01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:32.660
So Kmart have that many copies of In the Groove there, huh?

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.660
They had a Mario shirt that I wanted

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.660
Alright

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.660
But when I saw Sonic, had to get it

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.660
The Sega fangirl and you had a squee

01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:44.660
Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.660
A few quick news stories for you guys

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:51.660
So Saints Row the Third, of course they had this April Fools joke

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:55.660
Testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing

01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:00.660
Where it was Saints Row the Third enter the dominatrix

01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:03.660
And everyone's like, wow that would be pretty cool

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:05.660
And so they're like, ah we fooled you

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.660
Because it's real and it's coming out

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.660
So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:14.660
I don't know, copycat of

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:17.660
You know, Rockstar Games route

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:21.660
Where they're releasing this episode

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.660
Kind of expansion thing that's playable on its own

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:26.660
So this actual game will be coming out

01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.660
The enter the dominatrix as a standalone expansion pack

01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:34.660
It's a physical disc, it'll cost you 30 bucks

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:37.660
On PS3 and 360 and probably PC as well

01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:41.660
It's going to give you, they're going to have like

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.660
Superpowers in there and stuff

01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:46.660
Even though technically those were in the last expansion

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:49.660
But they only locked them to a certain mission on there

01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:53.660
Which everyone was like, why the fuck did you lock these onto a certain mission

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.660
Instead of just allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want

01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:00.660
Because I mean it is after Saints Row and it's not really realistic anyways

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:05.660
And apparently the whole premise of enter the dominatrix

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.660
Which is, other than being a complete ripoff of the Matrix

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.660
Because you know that's current

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:16.660
And so basically the Saints leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord

01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:20.660
Named Zinyak and his benevolent race

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:26.660
And apparently they're trying to grab up all resources or something

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:31.660
And also I guess there's some character named Paul

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.660
Who's supposed to play some role in there

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.660
Hey Paul

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:36.660
You rock Paul

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.660
And I don't know

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.660
Stay awesome Paul, it's all for you

01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:42.660
It's all about Paul

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.660
I'm a huge Paul fan

01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:47.660
Paul, I live for Paul in Saints Row the Third

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.660
Who the fuck is Paul

01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.660
I don't know who the fuck Paul is

01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.660
Honestly

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.660
That was a movie

01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.660
Well I know Paul was a movie

01:49:57.660 --> 01:49:59.660
And that was probably funny

01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:03.660
But it's just this whole Saints Row the dominatrix thing

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:09.660
It's neat and the whole thing it's supposed to be this virtual reality thing

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.660
So it's going to be similar to the Deckers missions almost

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:17.660
But at the same time I'm like, dude your DLC sucked so fucking bad

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:24.660
Do I really want to play this $30 expansion of shit that should have probably been unlocked anyways

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.660
With a DLC that I didn't buy because it was so shitty

01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:31.660
It's like at the rate it's going right now

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:38.660
$7 DLC each was about an hour and a half worth of content

01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.660
What is this game?

01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.660
It would be like two hours long, an hour and 45 minutes

01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:44.660
I mean I just

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.660
I don't know

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:51.660
I mean I kind of wish it was good but I'm just on the fence

01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.660
I don't know

01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.660
So we'll see it's coming out this fall

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:57.660
Maybe I'll pick it up because there's nothing else coming out

01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.660
But I'm going to wait for reviews

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:02.660
This is not a day one thing for me for sure

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:05.660
Burned once, that was enough

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:08.660
So Adidas, my coach

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.660
Was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:17.660
Also maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion on the Saints Row because they're in a little financial trouble

01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.660
Well apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:28.660
So now my coach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:31.660
They have taken over the publishing rights for it

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:36.660
So it'll be launching this summer apparently

01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:38.660
So I'll have to check that out

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.660
Maybe

01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.660
I'm sure you have it on pre-order

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:43.660
Oh yeah, you know me and exercise

01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:47.660
And last but not least, a game I actually took up a lot of my time this week

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.660
Perfect Strangers

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:52.660
It was an advert game

01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:58.660
I mean it says right on the bottom the guy responsible for this actually does advert games for a bunch of different things

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.660
And he's done some pretty good stuff

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:02.660
You know what, it was a well fucking done advert game

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:03.660
It was excellent

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:07.660
And I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out

01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:13.660
And of course it's advertising the release I guess of the episodes on iTunes

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.660
Which hey, it worked

01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:18.660
It was unaware that the episodes were even out there on iTunes

01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:22.660
I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.660
Oh I never forget that show

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.660
But yes, it's a pretty fun game

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.660
Definitely worth checking out

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:33.660
If you want to check out the game which is entitled Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now

01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:39.660
Which happens to be the theme song of the series and is actually what you play through

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:43.660
Just go to Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now dot com

01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:47.660
And check it out, it's a great time

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.660
Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:53.660
You know I watched some clips of him the other day

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:55.660
One kind of was asking myself the same question

01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:58.660
I know he was in Langoliers and he got mauled at some point

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.660
I don't really know

01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:04.660
The last thing I probably saw him was Beverly Hills Cop 3

01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:07.660
And Mark Lynn Baker, whatever else did he do?

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:12.660
Other than being like a dead on ringer for the critic

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:14.660
I don't know

01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:16.660
Let's just, let's just bask in the

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:18.660
Did you ever see Second Sight?

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.660
Let's bask in the awesomeness for a minute

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:31.660
Sometimes the world looks perfect

01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:34.660
Nothing to rearrange

01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:35.660
I feel inspired

01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.660
The Mustang!

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.660
I forgot he drove a Mustang

01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:43.660
Look at that, we just gave these guys a free commercial

01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:45.660
But it was pretty fucking awesome

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.660
I did see Second Sight, Rob

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.660
That movie was funny

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.660
Because he was addicted to goobers

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:53.660
Alright, let me get some stories for you guys

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.660
But first, a PSA from our chatroom at vognetwork.com

01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.660
Pete Garudo is telling us all

01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:00.660
You Don't Know Jack on Facebook is now open to all

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:03.660
I know what I'm doing after the show tonight

01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:05.660
Shane, I gotta cancel Mass Effect multiplayer

01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:07.660
You Don't Know Jack is on Facebook now

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:09.660
I don't even know if he's listening

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:12.660
Alright, let's get to some other quick news here

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.660
Family Guy

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.660
I don't know if they've done a lot of games for Family Guy

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:18.660
I can't remember if there's been any others

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:20.660
One, and it was not good

01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.660
That's right, that was the year they had Adam West at E3

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:24.660
It wasn't good

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:27.660
It wasn't good and they did an IOS game and it wasn't very good either

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.660
Well maybe this will redeem it

01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.660
But we'll see

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:34.660
September 25th, Family Guy Back to the Multiverse

01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:36.660
PlayStation 3 and 360

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:39.660
According to some Amazon stuff that leaked earlier today

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.660
And even earlier on our Twitter

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:46.660
Wink Wink, Activision is involved, I bet this will be an E3 showing

01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.660
Uh, probably

01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:50.660
And now, see I actually had to look it up

01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.660
Because I haven't watched Family Guy in a few years

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.660
Mainly because I do this show

01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.660
It happens to be on the same time

01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.660
And also because it's not being funny after a while

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:01.660
But, you know, I'll give it a chance again

01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:03.660
Don't remind the listeners that Family Guy is on

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.660
It's not funny, that's what I was trying to say

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:07.660
You're not missing anything

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.660
So, um, I had to look at what the Multiverse thing was

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.660
And I guess it was one of these episodes that they did

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.660
Where it's like, oh hey, we're in real, you know

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:15.660
Real life Family Guy

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.660
It's kind of like one of those episodes

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.660
Like, what if, blah blah blah

01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:21.660
You know, it's

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.660
So that's what that is, I don't know

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:25.660
Hopefully it'll be as good as the Simpsons game

01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.660
I mean, that was pretty good

01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:29.660
That's true, that's true

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.660
Alright, also, if Family Guy isn't your kind of cartoon

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.660
Maybe you're a little more old school

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.660
Maybe you'll be excited about this

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:37.660
The worlds of Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo

01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:39.660
Are lighting in a free to play

01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.660
Online game

01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.660
Cartoon Universe

01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.660
It's a browser based online adventure

01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:47.660
You could say it's for kids

01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.660
But you know there's going to be some adults to check this out too

01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.660
It's coming from WB Games Montreal

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.660
Cartoon Universe

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:55.660
It is kid friendly

01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:57.660
It's Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo

01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.660
You make your own toon avatar

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:01.660
You play puzzles and mini games

01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.660
Meet new friends

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.660
And experience the joy of exploring a place

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.660
So, very cool

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.660
There's supposed to be popular characters

01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.660
From both the franchises in there

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:13.660
But no playable version of this

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.660
Yet, I guess there's a beta

01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:17.660
I'm sorry, there is a beta version I guess that's out there

01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:19.660
But I think it's really bugged

01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.660
From what the early reports are saying

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.660
But it is a beta

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:25.660
But you can check that out

01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:27.660
cartoonuniverse.com

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.660
NA for North America

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:31.660
Pink Textures

01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:33.660
It looks cute, but

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:35.660
I'm going to play MMO, I'm going to play Star Trek

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.660
Or DC Universe or something

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.660
Lastly, for those of you guys

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.660
That aren't cool enough to go to E3 anymore

01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:43.660
Like, you know, us

01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.660
At least you can feel like

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.660
You're there by sitting on the couch

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:49.660
With your bon-bons and your popcorn

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.660
Which you can't even have if you actually go to the real thing

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:53.660
Because they don't allow that stuff in these

01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.660
Conference centers

01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:57.660
And watch the E3 Presser on

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.660
Xbox Live or Spike TV

01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.660
The Microsoft

01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:03.660
Press Conference will be live

01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:05.660
On Xbox Live and Spike TV

01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:07.660
I will be spending

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.660
My time doing what I normally do

01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.660
During these press conferences, which is kicking back

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.660
In the conference room at work

01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.660
Eating a bowl of popcorn while watching this stuff

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.660
Well, you know, I have E3 week

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:19.660
Off anyway, and I'm at the point where I've been

01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:21.660
At my job ten years and I get so much

01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.660
Time off a year for being there that long

01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.660
That I just take E3 week off to

01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.660
Have it off, and you know

01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:29.660
It's not a bad idea, I should do that

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.660
Another thing, I may actually

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:33.660
This year have to move

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:35.660
Our studio may be moving by the way

01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:37.660
I may be moving that week

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.660
So I may miss out on

01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.660
Some of this, we'll see

01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:43.660
But regardless, for the rest of you guys

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.660
You can watch that live as it unfolds

01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:47.660
I can't imagine it's gonna be

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.660
Any different for Sony and Nintendo

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.660
It's just, you know, maybe they'll be on G4

01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.660
Or PlayStation Home

01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:55.660
Or, you know, they'll be available

01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:57.660
As well

01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:59.660
They'll be on G4, so it's like

01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:01.660
Now Spike has more gaming cred

01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:03.660
Than G4, which, yeah, I can see that

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.660
Funny how that works

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:07.660
Funny how that works

01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:09.660
Alright, anyhow, a few more stories for you guys

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.660
Than the Frugal Question of the Week

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.660
Oh yeah, me, huh

01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:15.660
Well, there is going to be Cave Story Plus

01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.660
On the 3DS eShop soon

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.660
But it's not gonna be

01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.660
The Cave Story 3D, it's a separate one

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.660
All it is, is an update for the 3DS

01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.660
In fact, Tyrone Rodriguez

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.660
The CEO of Nicholas said

01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:29.660
That he really wanted it just to be

01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:31.660
The update, so neither game would interfere

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.660
With the other if you happened to delete one

01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:35.660
That's a little weird, isn't it?

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:37.660
That you would make a second, like, remake

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.660
Of your game? Well, Cave Story

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.660
3D is a separate game from

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:43.660
Cave Story Plus

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:45.660
They're two different games, so

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.660
Yo dawg, I heard you like Cave Story

01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:49.660
So we put some Cave Story in your Cave Story

01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:51.660
And

01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:53.660
For our listeners in the UK

01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:55.660
The UK Pride Xbox Connect bundle

01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:57.660
Will be available in May

01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:59.660
And I kinda want it

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:01.660
But, not really

01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.660
It's going to be a

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:05.660
249 pound 99 pence

01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.660
So, there you go

01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:09.660
There's also going to be

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.660
A

01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.660
A skin available

01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.660
Jella Skins is gonna make

01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:19.660
A pattern

01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.660
For 30 bucks

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:23.660
And they also, though, do have

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.660
A Stars and Stripes bundle for

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:27.660
The American audiences, or anyone who happens to want

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.660
An American flag on their

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.660
Game, or something

01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.660
Or the Confederate flag

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.660
I'm sure they have the Confederate flag too, you know

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:37.660
Oh, shush

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.660
And then Ratchet and Clank HD trilogy

01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:41.660
Has been pushed back in Europe

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.660
It will be pushed

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.660
From the 16th of May until early

01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.660
June, Insomniac has announced

01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:49.660
The end

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.660
The end

01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:53.660
Let's go to the

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.660
Fugal question of the week

01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:57.660
Except, I'm failing

01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.660
And I did this last week too, didn't I?

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:01.660
It's something about the network change

02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.660
I don't have the music

02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:05.660
Up for this segment

02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:07.660
But every week we go to our Facebook

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.660
At facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:11.660
Or our Google Plus

02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:13.660
Yes, we're on Google Plus

02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:15.660
With all the Google employees that are still there

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.660
There are some very loyal Google Plus listeners

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.660
And I get it

02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:21.660
Facebook does some real dumb shit

02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.660
Did you hear about now what they're doing?

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:25.660
I get why people want to run off to Google Plus

02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:27.660
The whole messenger thing will now

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:29.660
Have this actual Facebook

02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:31.660
Messenger app

02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:33.660
Look this up on the internet

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.660
If you don't believe me

02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:37.660
The Facebook Messenger app on the iPhone

02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:39.660
Will now send your location

02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:41.660
With the messages that you send

02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:43.660
You can turn that off

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.660
To be fair, you can't turn that off

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.660
But you know it will be on by default

02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:49.660
Because nobody at Facebook knows

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:51.660
What opt-in is all about

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:53.660
And the other thing with this is that

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.660
Return receipts

02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:57.660
You can now request a return receipt

02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:59.660
For when somebody has read your message

02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.660
You can't turn that off

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:03.660
So if you don't want someone to know you read their message

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.660
Too bad

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.660
That would be great for the stalkers that Facebook message you

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.660
Well, I'm sure you could use a third party app

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.660
For that

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.660
I don't know the specifics of how it worked

02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:15.660
But when I read that I was like grrr

02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:17.660
More importantly though, Ronma and Chad

02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:19.660
Has informed us that Bronson Pinchot

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:21.660
Actually has a reality show on DIY

02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.660
I was unaware of this

02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.660
It sounds interesting

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.660
I'm sure it's not

02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.660
And by the way, Rob

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.660
I don't use the messenger anyway

02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.660
I always have it linked me as offline

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:35.660
I'm just saying

02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:37.660
I don't know the specifics

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.660
But I look at this and I raise my eyebrow

02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:41.660
Right

02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:43.660
Anyway, let's go on to happier topics

02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.660
I make everyone get AIM

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:47.660
We're going to go on to happier topics

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:49.660
And things that don't piss me off

02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.660
And that is the FUGO Question of the Week

02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:53.660
Every week we ask you a question

02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:55.660
At our Facebook and our Google Plus

02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.660
Facebook.com, social media, radio

02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.660
I'm repeating myself

02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:01.660
So let's get to some of the answers

02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:03.660
I love this question of the week

02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.660
Not just because I thought of it

02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:07.660
But because the interview we had tonight and everything

02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:09.660
How inspired you to create something

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:11.660
Artistic in the real world

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:13.660
For example, art, music, a website

02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.660
Anything creative

02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.660
What did you create and why did the game

02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:19.660
Inspire you to do this

02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:21.660
So Shane from Warthouse started us off

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.660
Sorry I'm too busy writing my

02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:25.660
Male Shepard Caden fanfic

02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:27.660
To answer this question

02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:29.660
I've written fanfiction

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.660
Really? For what game?

02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:33.660
For a number of games

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.660
I did Metroid

02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.660
Back in the day

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:39.660
Just old stuff

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:41.660
The last thing I did was for Digimon

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.660
Of all things

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.660
Nice

02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:47.660
I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.660
And I was inspired to try to figure out

02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.660
What the song

02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.660
From DJ Hero 2 would sound like

02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:55.660
The mashup between piano

02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:57.660
And Shout

02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:59.660
So I did that

02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:01.660
And I've done fan art

02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:03.660
Remember I did my Portal

02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:05.660
To enter it for my final project

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:07.660
In 3D class

02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:09.660
Alright let's get to some more of the answers over on Facebook

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:11.660
We have an answer

02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.660
From Johnny B

02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:15.660
Johnny Cage's

02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:17.660
Ball Busta Move

02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.660
Inspired me to create an athletic cup

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.660
Attached with nails and screws

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.660
I advertise this tool of protection

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:25.660
For men, women, and everyone in between

02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:27.660
For a commercial project

02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:29.660
In film school

02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:31.660
Unfortunately this anti-hipster cup

02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:33.660
Was the class's top prize

02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:35.660
To be aired on local access

02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:37.660
But it did earn me an A in the class

02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:39.660
C, video games can help you

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:41.660
Get good grades in school

02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:43.660
I think it's funny

02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:45.660
But hey I have a tip for you

02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:47.660
This is not a well known fact

02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:49.660
About Rob Roberts

02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.660
But before there was Orange Lounge

02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:53.660
Before there was

02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:55.660
Under Sedation Live

02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:57.660
Before there was Rob on college radio

02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:59.660
There was Rob on local public access

02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:01.660
I had a TV show

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:03.660
When I was in high school

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:05.660
You will never see the tapes

02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:07.660
I'm gonna make sure those

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:09.660
Fuckers are destroyed

02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:11.660
Oh well I've seen some of it

02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:13.660
I don't even know where the tapes are

02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.660
I honestly don't

02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:17.660
It is fantastic

02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:19.660
It was fantastic

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.660
Seriously I'm being serious here

02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:23.660
If shit like

02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:25.660
Tim and Eric's awesome show

02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:27.660
Great Job can do as well as it does

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.660
That public access show could have been a hit

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:31.660
Yeah you know it's a shame

02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:33.660
I lost touch, well we're

02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:35.660
Facebook friends but my friend Shannon

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.660
Who was like my bestie in high school

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:39.660
Did a comedy show on public access

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.660
And I'll tell you what

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.660
Kids in high school are such

02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:45.660
Cock head bastard fucks

02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.660
Like you know we used to get

02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.660
Like the guys before us

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:51.660
Did this very conservative

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.660
Slanted show because they learned that

02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:55.660
From their parents called

02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:57.660
I'm gonna name names because I'm 33

02:04:57.660 --> 02:04:59.660
And I don't give a fuck anymore

02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.660
It was a show called Open Debate

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.660
And these guys

02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.660
Would just sit there, they fucking would razz

02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:07.660
Our show that was coming up

02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:09.660
Like live on their show and the callers

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:11.660
Would call in and like talk about what

02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:13.660
A fag I was on

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.660
Public access TV

02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:17.660
I got bullied on television

02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:19.660
You guys but it gets better don't worry

02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.660
All I'm saying

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:23.660
Is you need to put claws in your will

02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:25.660
That stuff gets released when you die

02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.660
Unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of

02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:29.660
Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:31.660
Probably died with her as well

02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:33.660
I'm just saying

02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.660
Alright

02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:37.660
Anyway let me get to the rest of the

02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.660
Questions here on Facebook I didn't mean to get on the

02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.660
Tangent but I just wanted to

02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:43.660
You know in the 10 years we've been doing

02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:45.660
Orange Lawn's radio I never talked about

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.660
How much I hated those fuckers on

02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.660
Open Debate and I don't know what

02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:51.660
They're doing now but if there's any justice

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:53.660
In the world janitorial work

02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:55.660
Jizz mopping I

02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:57.660
I don't want to belittle janitors

02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:59.660
Because janitors do an important

02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.660
Job

02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.660
Anyhow

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.660
Hey Port Chop

02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.660
Answered our question on Facebook

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.660
Not so much create but

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.660
Adapted the Final Fantasy soundtracks

02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:13.660
Inspired me to adapt some of their songs

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:15.660
On guitars such as Eternity Light

02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:17.660
Waves and Aerith's theme

02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:19.660
The game's music always impressed me and was very

02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:21.660
Memorable which made me want to learn these songs

02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.660
For myself as a result of this

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:25.660
Nobui Matsu is also my favorite composer

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.660
That's almost if you think about it

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.660
That's almost the same story that Random told

02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:31.660
About Goonies 2

02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.660
I have to say

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:35.660
Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major

02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:37.660
Very cool and I met him remember

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:39.660
I do remember that

02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:41.660
I love this answer

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:43.660
From Stan H on Facebook says

02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:45.660
Playing Journey as I type this

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.660
I want to knit the scarf and be crazy

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:49.660
Long

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.660
It was a Journey joke I love it

02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:53.660
Lastly from Paul W

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:55.660
Is it weird that when you first

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:57.660
Said oh yeah he did a

02:06:57.660 --> 02:06:59.660
Remix thing based on Journey that I thought

02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:01.660
Of Journey the arcade game

02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:03.660
I was worried

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.660
People would think that

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:07.660
Look

02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.660
One more answer here from Facebook

02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:11.660
And then I got one on Google

02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:13.660
Paul W says back when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade

02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.660
During the NES and Sega Master System days

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.660
I would create my own illustrations of enemies

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:19.660
Bosses when instruction manuals for game

02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:21.660
Were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent

02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:23.660
These were new creations I had

02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.660
Imagined for sequels to games such as

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.660
Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast

02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.660
I think a lot of us did that kind of crap

02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:31.660
As a kid Paul because like I can tell you

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:33.660
I'm sure you must have done this too

02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.660
And everybody that was you know

02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:37.660
Grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.660
Did the RPG on the notepad

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:41.660
Where you drew the dungeon

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:43.660
And like you'd make your friends go through the dungeon

02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.660
It was like you wrote your own video game

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:47.660
On paper so it makes sense

02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.660
I used to have a tablet of that stuff

02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.660
And I'm so sad that I lost it

02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:53.660
This is why we're friends because I knew you were that kid

02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:55.660
I didn't even have to ask

02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:57.660
We would have been playing that game when we were in the same school

02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.660
Basically I was inspired by Contra

02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.660
I used to love drawing mazes

02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:03.660
And so that's what I'd do I'd create mazes

02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:05.660
And then there were mazes with cannons in them

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:07.660
And then mazes with spikes and cannons

02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:09.660
And alien monsters and stuff like that

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:11.660
So it was kind of like that

02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.660
It was like bullet hell but on paper

02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:15.660
Alright

02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:17.660
Let's get to the one answer here on Google Plus

02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:19.660
Jim H

02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:21.660
You go Jim's the loyal Google user

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:23.660
Here it is sort of embarrassing to admit

02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:25.660
This but in my documentary class in film school

02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:27.660
I made a one minute doclet about my

02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:29.660
Holy Priest character in Warcraft

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:31.660
I actually got an A on the project

02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:33.660
And had to answer questions from my instructor

02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:35.660
Like have you ever let another player

02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:37.660
Die on purpose? Great story

02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:39.660
Love it

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:41.660
I'm sure the answer was yes

02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:43.660
Alright

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:45.660
There it is that's it for the foogle question of the week

02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:47.660
Let's get back into some news

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:49.660
Loki

02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:51.660
Alright so this is a little interesting

02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:53.660
EA is putting out an indie bundle

02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:55.660
And now of course it's getting a little bit of shade

02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:57.660
Because EA is not exactly an indie company

02:08:57.660 --> 02:08:59.660
But the titles that are being included

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:01.660
Warp, Shank, Shank 2

02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:03.660
Gatling Gears, Deathspank

02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:05.660
and Deathspank

02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:07.660
The Thong of Virtue

02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.660
And ironically enough

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:11.660
It's actually being released on Steam

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:13.660
As part of Steam Play

02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:15.660
And

02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:17.660
They're also having some other

02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:19.660
Indies that are

02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:21.660
Available as well

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.660
I guess Deathspank titles are currently

02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:25.660
$7.50 individually

02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.660
And then EA's rest, their indie titles

02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.660
Are $5 each

02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:31.660
And those are PC only

02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:33.660
Where as the Deathspank titles are PC and Mac

02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:35.660
And

02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:37.660
And

02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:39.660
Interesting enough though

02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:41.660
They've also gotten some

02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.660
Hate from

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.660
Just this guy that put out a game called

02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.660
Minecraft

02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:49.660
That's right Notch

02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:51.660
Basically saying

02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:53.660
What's a Minecraft?

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:55.660
Basically EA is releasing

02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:57.660
How do you mine fish?

02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.660
So EA is releasing an

02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.660
Indie bundle

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.660
I'm not sure

02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.660
How that works EA

02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:07.660
Stop attempting to ruin everything you bunch of cynical

02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:09.660
Bastards

02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:11.660
Oh tweet drama

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:13.660
Well it's going down on Twitter

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:15.660
Y'all

02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:17.660
You know what though it did strike me as really funny

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:19.660
That the EA Indie bundle was on Steam

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:21.660
And not on Origin

02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:23.660
Cause no one buys

02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.660
Anything on Origin

02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.660
I think it was a very interesting way for

02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:29.660
EA to like very subtly shade Steam

02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.660
The whole thing was a setup

02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:33.660
No I think it was a trap

02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:35.660
I think it was because they thought they would get more sales

02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.660
From Steam sadly enough

02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:39.660
Because there was even

02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:41.660
And it didn't make our

02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:43.660
Show roll here but there was a thing that

02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:45.660
Origin put out like a survey

02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:47.660
Saying okay

02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:49.660
What would you like to see us approve

02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:51.660
On Origin because

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:53.660
Kind of almost admitting

02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:55.660
That it hasn't been that great

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.660
So what would you guys like to see

02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:59.660
Us do

02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:01.660
To fix it

02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.660
Close it down and put the games on Steam

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:05.660
They're not going to do that

02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:07.660
Although you know what

02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.660
Competition is healthy for the industry

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.660
So you know I don't want Steam to be the one and only

02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:13.660
But you know I don't know if EA should really

02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:15.660
Be given their own store but I will say this

02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.660
You know despite the cynical bastard I am and all this

02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:19.660
I will say something nice about Origin this week

02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.660
I did play

02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:23.660
And I didn't talk about this in my gaming week but I did play

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:25.660
That Mass Effect 3 data pad game

02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:27.660
That helps you with your galactic readiness

02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:29.660
Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry

02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:31.660
Last week because I said that you have to

02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:33.660
Play multiplayer

02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:35.660
And I downloaded that thing

02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:37.660
Well it does turn out and I do stand corrected

02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:39.660
Thank you Chat Room that's the perk of doing a live show

02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:41.660
That you can download this Mass Effect data pad

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.660
And raise your galactic readiness

02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:45.660
Rating in a

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:47.660
I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.660
One of those like Facebook-y type of games that

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:51.660
You know you send your ship out and wait

02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.660
Three hours and you can check on it and what have you

02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:55.660
And it helps raise your galactic readiness

02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:57.660
And I got to say the way that all ties together

02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.660
And how you do that on your iPhone

02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.660
Yet it impacts

02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:03.660
What happens on the Xbox

02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:05.660
And you can check your multiplayer

02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:07.660
Unlocks on the PC

02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.660
That kind of synergy is neat

02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.660
It is neat

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:13.660
And it's done

02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:15.660
It's done well

02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.660
So I will tip my hat

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:19.660
Slightly to that

02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:21.660
I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs

02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:23.660
Left and right wherever they can get it

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:25.660
But as far as the free stuff that's there

02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:27.660
It's pretty cool

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.660
I will say that nice thing

02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.660
About Origin but as far as the EA&D bundle

02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:33.660
On Steam

02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:35.660
You know what

02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:37.660
I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:39.660
It would be a clever thing and

02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:41.660
Probably didn't go through all the necessary

02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:43.660
Checks and now they're paying for it in the media

02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:45.660
Just like everything else

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:47.660
Guess what else EA paid for

02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:49.660
In the media this week

02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:51.660
A big snafu in their rock band

02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:53.660
IOS game

02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.660
A big pop up

02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:57.660
Showed up when logging into rock band on the iPhone

02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:59.660
Or the iPad this week that said

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:01.660
On May 31st rock band will

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:03.660
No longer be playable on your device

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:05.660
Thanks for rocking out with us

02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:07.660
And everybody was like what

02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:09.660
The fuck

02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.660
I bought this game and I bought the DLC

02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.660
It's on my phone and EA is just gonna fucking shut it off

02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:15.660
Yank pull the plug

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:17.660
Pull it from my phone can't play it anymore

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:19.660
And while that little pop ups going on

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:21.660
It's still being currently sold on

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.660
Their on IOS's app store

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.660
Blows your fucking mind

02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:27.660
Right well before you all

02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:29.660
Yell this out in chat there was a

02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:31.660
Follow up to it not only did Harmonix

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:33.660
And John Drake you gotta love

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.660
John Drake he's a

02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:37.660
Great industry guy and he's very

02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:39.660
Active and out there in the community

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.660
And he basically washed his hands of the whole

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.660
Thing and he's like uh

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.660
We were not the

02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:47.660
You know we were not the publishers of this

02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:49.660
We're working to understand what's up

02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:51.660
ASAP

02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.660
Well came out later in the week

02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:55.660
EA came out and said that prompt

02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:57.660
Was made in error

02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:59.660
And we will give you more information

02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:01.660
Soon they said quote we apologize

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.660
For the confusion this caused we're

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:05.660
Working to clarify the issue that caused

02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.660
The error and we'll share additional

02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:09.660
Information as soon as possible

02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.660
Clarify the issue fire the employee you know

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:13.660
Yeah because

02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:15.660
They didn't like that how did this happen

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.660
The cat did not sneak

02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:19.660
In in the middle of the night and type

02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:21.660
Dear rockers on may 31st

02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:23.660
Rock me that was an intentional

02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:25.660
Message especially the thanks

02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:27.660
For rocking out with us

02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:29.660
Thanks for paying us money

02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:31.660
But your game is no longer gonna work now here's

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:33.660
My thought I have a random ass theory and this

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:35.660
Ties back into mass effect

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.660
You know they announced this mass effect free

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:39.660
DLC that's coming out in the summer but they

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:41.660
Put an expiration date on it saying you

02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.660
Can get it free until

02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.660
2013 or 2014 something like that

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.660
And BioWare said note

02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:49.660
We don't plan to ever not

02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.660
Make it free but EA's

02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:53.660
Policies require us to set an expiration

02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:55.660
Date and you know

02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:57.660
As long as they don't have to honor it

02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.660
And also speaking of mass effect

02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:01.660
When I bought mass effect 2 brand

02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:03.660
New mind you I had a coupon

02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:05.660
In the box for an online pass

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:07.660
Expires February

02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:09.660
1st 2012 and it was

02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:11.660
Like mid February by the time

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:13.660
I was ready to play it it still redeemed

02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:15.660
But that expiration date was

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:17.660
There and I was about ready to go through the fucking

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:19.660
Roof cause I bought that new

02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:21.660
Just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass

02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:23.660
I almost went through the roof it did work

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:25.660
But this makes me wonder EA

02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:27.660
Has this crackhead policy

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:29.660
Of having expiration dates

02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.660
Why do they have expiration dates?

02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:33.660
That's a great fucking question that I would like

02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:35.660
EA to answer

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:37.660
See I don't understand why they have expiration dates

02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:39.660
I don't understand like

02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.660
They'll do that you know on certain things

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.660
Like for example Ultraviolet you may notice

02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:45.660
With a lot of the you know DVD's

02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:47.660
And Blu-rays that are out there now

02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.660
Come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy

02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:51.660
That you can redeem you know

02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:53.660
By a certain date and I'm wondering

02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.660
If it's just because they don't want to keep those copies

02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:57.660
Up on their servers for you know

02:15:57.660 --> 02:15:59.660
Forever or something

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:01.660
It doesn't even make any sense because you can

02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:03.660
Once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection

02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:05.660
You can always stream it

02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:07.660
I just don't understand why on a paid

02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:09.660
App they have it that it can

02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:11.660
Expire like that and that that right there

02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:13.660
Is a perfect example of why

02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:15.660
Going digital only is a

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:17.660
Bad fucking idea

02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:19.660
Because what's gonna stop EA or

02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:21.660
Any company from going yeah we just want this game

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:23.660
To work anymore boom done and

02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.660
That's it you have no recourse

02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:27.660
And really Rockband is

02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:29.660
On your phone and you play you don't

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.660
I mean I understand if they're shutting

02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:33.660
Down the online music store

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:35.660
Or they're shutting down the multiplayer

02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:37.660
Or whatever but how can they

02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:39.660
Stop the entire app including

02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:41.660
Single player from working

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.660
How very dare you EA

02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:45.660
Or if it's a free app

02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:47.660
I can see okay maybe this is gonna

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:49.660
Expire and a new one's gonna come out

02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:51.660
There was a Disney Tron app that did that

02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:53.660
But it was free but here's the thing though

02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:55.660
And this is kind of pointed out as well

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:57.660
They did something similar with Tetris

02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:59.660
Tetris for example it expired

02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:01.660
And stopped working and guess what

02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:03.660
Oh they sold a new version of Tetris

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:05.660
You can buy it again

02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:07.660
What makes you think that they might not

02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:09.660
Try this again well yet PopCap

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:11.660
Who is now owned by EA

02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:13.660
PopCap did it a little better

02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:15.660
Because they turned Bejeweled 2

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.660
They spun off Bejeweled Blitz

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:19.660
Into it's own game but they made it free

02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:21.660
And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop

02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:23.660
Working you know you still got that

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:25.660
Even though they have Bejeweled 3 they just

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:27.660
They kind of push people to go get Bejeweled 3

02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:29.660
But they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working

02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.660
At least I don't think and I don't want to check

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:33.660
On my phone but I just I think PopCap

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.660
Didn't screw it up the way

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.660
That EA did

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:39.660
You know if they're like well we have a policy that we have to have

02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:41.660
Expiration dates why the fuck

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:43.660
Why do I care about your goddamn policies

02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.660
Where is this explained that this might

02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.660
Expire somewhere it there's no

02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.660
Terms of service as far as

02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:51.660
I'm aware

02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:53.660
Bobby wants me to remind you guys and I even

02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:55.660
Told Bobby I'd plug this and then promptly

02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:57.660
Forgot

02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.660
That we do if you are a steam

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:01.660
User and you are playing games online

02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:03.660
In the community we now have a

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:05.660
VOG network community there is no

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:07.660
L army but you know we've been trying to push things

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:09.660
To the VOG network too steam

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:11.660
Community.com slash groups slash

VOG network launches

02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.660
Soon I can't tell you when

02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:21.660
But it'll be sooner than you think

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.660
We'll have a link to that a little more directly

02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:25.660
And yes I am still able to play Bejeweled

02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:27.660
2 on my phone

02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:29.660
There it is there's the music

02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:31.660
I'm just

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:33.660
It doesn't

02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:35.660
Surprise me that they would be the ones behind this

02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:37.660
Yep

02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:39.660
Alright we're gonna go to the

02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:41.660
Mailbag dark soccer left the room

02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:43.660
She'll be back in a minute here nope here she comes

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:45.660
Every week you guys send us emails

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:47.660
I'm allergic to mail

02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:49.660
M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:51.660
Both

02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:53.660
Alright mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place

02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:55.660
To send us your emails and dark soccer

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.660
Might read them

02:18:57.660 --> 02:18:59.660
Dark soccer hopefully you have some emails

02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:01.660
For us tonight

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:03.660
Alright first one Robert M here I'll skip the silliness

02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:05.660
And irrelevance to simply state

02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:07.660
That I just picked up Bastion on Steam

02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:09.660
Now that the Mac version is on there

02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:11.660
And was $6 mid week

02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:13.660
I mid downloaded this time so I can't say if it's

02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.660
An imperfect but competent port

02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:17.660
Like Super Meat Boy say but I'm looking forward

02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:19.660
To it speaking of

02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.660
I know that content downloading from the store on PSB

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:23.660
If interrupted will have to start completely

02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:25.660
Over which seems unfortunate for a portable

02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:27.660
Even considering its age

02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:29.660
Does the Vita have this issue or can software

02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:31.660
Be loaded a little at a time

02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:33.660
I don't know

02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.660
Hey Vita people will it work

02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:37.660
Will it blend

02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:39.660
Are you even listening

02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.660
I was kind of tuning out

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:43.660
Sorry

02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:45.660
Who wants to know if you can download incrementally

02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:47.660
On the Vita or will you have to start over like on the

02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:49.660
PSP

02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:51.660
Download incrementally

02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:53.660
If you're in download or whatever

02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:55.660
Or if you like happen to turn your system off

02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:57.660
Or something like that it will restart where it's at

02:19:57.660 --> 02:19:59.660
Yeah and doesn't the Vita really encourages you

02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:01.660
To put it to sleep not to turn it off

02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:03.660
You sleep it and while it's sleeping

02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:05.660
It'll download your shit which is good

02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:07.660
Yeah in fact I keep forgetting

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:09.660
That I have mine in sleep mode like in my bag

02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:11.660
And then the battery is dead

02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:13.660
Exactly that's why I was like oh shit

02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:15.660
It charges again

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.660
It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP

02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:19.660
They sell one

02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:21.660
Oh do they of course they do

02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:23.660
But I love that 3DS dock

02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.660
It makes it so great to remember to charge it

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:27.660
And it's just a cheap piece of plastic but it works so well

02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:29.660
By the way I almost skipped

02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:31.660
This email because it said oral advertising

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:33.660
But I saw who sent it

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:35.660
Dearest members of the online

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.660
Video game radio Caspoon Didocracy

02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:39.660
You thought it was some French spam

02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:41.660
We get inundated with French spam

02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.660
I don't understand

02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:45.660
This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD

02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.660
Collection being released on Vita

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:49.660
The very possibility of a collection of games

02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:51.660
Such as this being released on the Vita

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:53.660
Brought the following questions to my mind

02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:55.660
Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3?

02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:57.660
Staycare Entertainment

02:20:57.660 --> 02:20:59.660
This message has been brought to you

02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:01.660
By oral advertising sent from my iPad

02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:03.660
Well you don't even get

02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:05.660
All three games

02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:07.660
You only get two of the three

02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:09.660
Metal Gear Acid 3

02:21:09.660 --> 02:21:11.660
Who are you going to have to blow to get that?

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:13.660
Probably Kojima

02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:15.660
And from what I understand he's not too into the blow

02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:17.660
You'd have to get his ass

02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:19.660
I would see Acid 3 more on

02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:21.660
The 3DS

02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:23.660
Because remember they had the whole

02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:25.660
Remember that really weird

02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:27.660
There was a Metal Gear

02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.660
There also is a

02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.660
Metal Gear something

02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:33.660
I can't remember if it came out or not

02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:35.660
They were demoing one a long time ago

02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:37.660
A Metal Gear something on 3DS

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:39.660
It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:41.660
Snake Eater

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:43.660
Snake Eater

02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:45.660
So

02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:47.660
Yes? That was it

02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:49.660
Hey guys this is Honey Badger

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.660
AKA Blade 3

02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:53.660
Okay I have to stop and apologize

02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:55.660
Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night

02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:57.660
While I was drunk off

02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:59.660
Cheap Sangria

02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:01.660
Off my Ghetto Sangria made from Menneshevitz

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.660
So I'm sorry

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:05.660
I was a little drunk

02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:07.660
I just wanted to say the listeners will support you

02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:09.660
No matter what changes you make

02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:11.660
Also I have a question for you all

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:13.660
But I think Loki may have the most

02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:15.660
Input. How close are we

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.660
To having essentially gaming computers

02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:19.660
And fancy cases that are just

02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:21.660
Locked down by Microsoft or Sony

02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.660
Basically where does the line between high end

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:25.660
Console and gaming PCs start

02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:27.660
Well pretty much that's

02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:29.660
What they are now anyways I mean it's just

02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:31.660
Gaming PCs but it's proprietary boards

02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:33.660
And what not

02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:35.660
And specialized chips that are made

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:37.660
Specifically for the systems

02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:39.660
I wish it was a little bit more like

02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:41.660
Gaming PCs but I understand why they have

02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:43.660
Limitations but it would be

02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:45.660
Kind of cool like if for example

02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:47.660
You can have an Xbox 360

02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:49.660
And be able to upgrade the RAM in it

02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:51.660
Like say okay all the games have to

02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:53.660
Run with this amount of RAM but if you want

02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:55.660
The games to run a little bit smoother you can add extra RAM

02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:57.660
Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space

02:22:57.660 --> 02:22:59.660
I'd be worried though about those minimum system

02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:01.660
Requirements slowly bumping up you know

02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:03.660
It's the one thing that makes people a little leery of

02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:05.660
PC gaming

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:07.660
Nowadays I mean I know but you know

02:23:07.660 --> 02:23:09.660
Then it's the video card then it's you know

02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:13.660
The operating system that your thing is running

02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:15.660
Then it's the space on your hard drive

02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:17.660
Then you know

02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:19.660
Then one thing it's another

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:21.660
So next email

02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.660
I just wanted to say real quick though since that was from Honey Badger

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:25.660
I love that name by the way because it always makes me think it is

02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:27.660
It's the Honey Badger watch it run in

02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:29.660
Slow motion

02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:31.660
It's pretty bad ass look

02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:33.660
It runs all over the place

02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:35.660
I wish

02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:37.660
Listen to Orange Dolls Radio

02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:39.660
Don't fuck your shit up

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:41.660
If you're not you're a bitch

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.660
And by the way just to clarify

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:49.660
I did not mean to insinuate

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:51.660
That Kojima is gay he has not come out

02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:53.660
But if he was it would be okay

02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:55.660
It would be fine by us

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.660
The more the merrier

02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:59.660
Two emails left

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.660
Hey guys it's Jim Sally

02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:03.660
Do I have to do the choo choo noise?

02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:05.660
I live in Canada sorry

02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:07.660
And work as a party train conductor

02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:09.660
Recently me and my wife started shopping

02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:11.660
For Robot Butler but we can't decide

02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:13.660
What features we want

02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:15.660
Wait a minute he really is a train conductor?

02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:17.660
I think he's full of shit

02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:19.660
Let me finish the email

02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:21.660
A party train conductor

02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:23.660
A party train

02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:25.660
Legit my dad for many years

02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:27.660
He recently retired

02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.660
But for about 45 years

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:31.660
He worked for the railroad

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:33.660
And he was a train conductor

02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:35.660
So when I hear that I perk up

02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:37.660
So I'm just saying

02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.660
Chichi

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.660
I empathize with the train people

02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.660
She loves data from Star Trek

02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:45.660
But I'm more of an R2D2 kind of guy

02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:47.660
Which fictional robot would you like to have

02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:49.660
In your real life?

02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:51.660
Anyway I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:53.660
On the Sally Express

02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:55.660
Love you and good night Jim Sally

02:24:55.660 --> 02:24:57.660
Edie cause she's hot

02:24:57.660 --> 02:24:59.660
Mass Effect reference that's all I have

02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:01.660
On the brain recently

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.660
I think

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.660
You know maybe the

02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:11.660
The gigalobot from

02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:13.660
Artificial intelligence

02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:15.660
Does a cylon count?

02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:17.660
As a robot because

02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.660
I don't want to

02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:21.660
I don't want to spoil but there's a certain

02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:23.660
Cylon that's really hot

02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:25.660
What? Are they full on robots

02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:27.660
Or are they cybernetic?

02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:29.660
Um

02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:31.660
Cause I could say Angelica Houston from Captain EO

02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.660
That's a great choice

02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:35.660
But she's cybernetic

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:37.660
So are the borgs, the borg don't count

02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:39.660
You know what? It's our show

02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:41.660
We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please

02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:43.660
And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO

02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:45.660
Yes

02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:47.660
I want Angelica Houston

02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:49.660
To service me

02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:51.660
And I want a certain

02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:53.660
Unsaid very hot cylon

02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:55.660
That was revealed in the third season

02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.660
Finale and we'll just leave it at that

02:25:57.660 --> 02:25:59.660
So what about you Loki?

02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:01.660
I want a portal turret, it's technically a robot

02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.660
Then I'm gonna

02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:05.660
Change mine to GLaDOS

02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:07.660
I want to be her when I grow up

02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:09.660
And die

02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:11.660
Okay the last email

02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:13.660
You know what?

02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:15.660
I'll french fry you bitch

02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:17.660
Bitch I will

02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:19.660
Come back and julienne you

02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:21.660
I will take you to In-N-Out and watch

02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:23.660
Them put you in the blender

02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:25.660
Anyway

02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:27.660
You know what Rob?

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:29.660
What?

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:31.660
Aw I'm getting applause

02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:33.660
Howdy OLR

02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:35.660
I wanted to say

02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:37.660
I wanted to call in

02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:39.660
But something came up as usual

02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:41.660
Therefore I'm writing you folks instead

02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:43.660
I was having a discussion with

02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:45.660
We're getting the manual work I see

02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:47.660
I was having a discussion with a friend

02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:49.660
About the future of Nintendo

02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:51.660
He came to a conclusion that Nintendo

02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:53.660
Might be better off if they gave up

02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:55.660
On hardware and focused entirely on making

02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:57.660
Good games. What do you think?

02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:59.660
Would Nintendo be harmed by dropping hardware

02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:01.660
Or is Mario still Mario regardless of what system

02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:03.660
It's on? It comes from Panaxium

02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:05.660
So you mean you want them to be Sega?

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:07.660
Yeah

02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.660
It's a great thing

02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:11.660
For the fanboys to fantasize

02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:13.660
About. Ain't gonna happen

02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:15.660
Ain't gonna happen

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.660
Not for a long time

02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:19.660
That will happen over Miyamoto's

02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:21.660
Dead body. Literally

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:23.660
Like

02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:25.660
It's

02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:27.660
It's a Japanese company

02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:29.660
And there's a lot of

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:31.660
I don't want to sound rude or mean

02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:33.660
But just look at the history

02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:35.660
There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that

02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:37.660
That they know what the people want

02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:39.660
And that's not the way they want to go down

02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:41.660
And if you wanted to look for another example

02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:43.660
What I'm talking about

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:45.660
The history of this show. We talked a lot about Konami

02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:47.660
And I had this conversation

02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:49.660
With a friend just the other day

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.660
Konami

02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:53.660
Konami should've had

02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:55.660
Konami had every right to be the kings

02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:57.660
Of music games in America

02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:59.660
As well as Japan

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:01.660
But they fucked it up

02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:03.660
By not taking the risks

02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:05.660
They did for a little while when there was a guy in America

02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:07.660
Influencing a lot

02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:09.660
But then that guy wasn't around anymore

02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.660
And music games and Konami fell the fuck apart

02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:13.660
Case in point. Rock Revolution

02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:15.660
I think Nintendo will die trying to stay

02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:17.660
First party

02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:19.660
Well it's easy to dismiss Nintendo

02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:21.660
But don't forget

02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:23.660
How fucking huge the Wii was

02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:25.660
Don't count it out

02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:27.660
The 3DS should've failed

02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:29.660
But it didn't

02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:31.660
Nintendo brought it back

02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:33.660
So write off the Wii U if you want

02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:35.660
I'm as skeptical as the rest of you

02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:37.660
But Nintendo kinda seems

02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:39.660
To know how to make it work

02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:41.660
Granted it could end up being a Nintendo 64

02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:43.660
Or a GameCube

02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:45.660
But neither of those systems exactly killed

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:47.660
Nintendo. It would have to take

02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:49.660
Something of Virtual Boy proportions on the Wii U

02:28:49.660 --> 02:28:51.660
To actually kill Nintendo

02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:53.660
And make them go third party

02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:55.660
So I'll sit here and fantasize with you about Mario

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.660
On the Playstation. I just think realistically

02:28:57.660 --> 02:28:59.660
It ain't gonna happen for a very

02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:01.660
Long time. Off topic

02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:03.660
Here I wanted to mention something since I was browsing

02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:05.660
Through the Playstation store

02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:07.660
I find it a bit ironic that the full game

02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:09.660
Of Ridge Racer

02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:11.660
Happens to be under the demo section

02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:13.660
What?

02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:15.660
Isn't that a little funny?

02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:17.660
Is it really? Yes it is

02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:19.660
I gotta pull that down right now. Are you sure?

02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:21.660
No, no. The paid

02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:23.660
The one you have to pay $25 for

02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:25.660
But it's filed under demo

02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:27.660
I thought you meant it's free. I was like, you screwed up again?

02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:29.660
No, no. Meaning it's filed

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:31.660
Under demo

02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:33.660
Because there's no content to it

02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:35.660
I think that's funny

02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:37.660
Alright

02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:39.660
Is that it for email? Are we done?

02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:41.660
Yes. Alright. Mailbag at

02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:43.660
OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us

02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:45.660
Emails for a future week

02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:47.660
In the meantime, it's time to get renty

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:49.660
Yeah, Fuse of the Week

02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.660
Fuck Children's Week

02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:07.660
Fuck all the Zorphins

02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:09.660
Fuck their candy

02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:11.660
Fuck their kites

02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:13.660
Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake

02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:15.660
I don't care anymore

02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:17.660
I had the three holidays left

02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:19.660
There's three

02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:21.660
Children's Week has fucked it for me

02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:23.660
Burn in hell

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:25.660
And your Matron

02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:27.660
Fuck her too

02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:29.660
Loki

02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:31.660
F you to my ceiling fan in my living room

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:33.660
For breaking

02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:35.660
My wife decided to turn the fan on high

02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:37.660
To cool off, or to dry the

02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:39.660
Floors that she had recently mopped

02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:41.660
And the switch broke

02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:43.660
So we couldn't shut it off

02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:45.660
So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan

02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:47.660
To shut it off

02:30:47.660 --> 02:30:49.660
Manually

02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:51.660
But it gets hot in here now

02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:57.660
F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland

02:30:57.660 --> 02:30:59.660
In a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go

02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:01.660
And my friend's graduating and I'll

02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:03.660
Get to miss it, but

02:31:03.660 --> 02:31:05.660
And F you to Jamie because she'll be

02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.660
Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me

02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:09.660
That's true, hooray

02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:11.660
F you to poop

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:13.660
Unless it was a really good meal

02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:15.660
She has been a little drippy lately

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.660
Oh great, can't wait

02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:19.660
You're disgusting

02:31:19.660 --> 02:31:21.660
Alright, just a few more stories

02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:23.660
For you guys

02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:25.660
And then we're going to open up the skype line

02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:27.660
Just for a little bit tonight guys

02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:29.660
We're running a little late because of the interview earlier

02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:31.660
I think it was worth it, don't you?

02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:33.660
Just a few more stories for you guys, Loki

02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:35.660
Oh wait, quickly, quickly

02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:37.660
I want to say this

02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:39.660
Because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole

02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:41.660
Nintendo and some folks brought up the iPhone

02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:43.660
And I must say

02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:45.660
Among all other things

02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:47.660
I would see Nintendo going to a place

02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:49.660
Like iOS first

02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:51.660
Before straight up Microsoft and Sony

02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:53.660
Type properties, why?

02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:55.660
Because the investors have already been pressuring them to do it

02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:57.660
And we have seen

02:31:57.660 --> 02:31:59.660
Team Pokemon put something

02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:01.660
One of those teams

02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:03.660
Put something out on the iOS

02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:05.660
Platform already

02:32:05.660 --> 02:32:07.660
I could see something like that happening

02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:09.660
Long before the

02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:11.660
Sony and Xbox thing

02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:13.660
That was something that was brought up in chat

02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.660
What was it?

02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.660
Legend of Zaku said iPhone

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:19.660
Enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that

02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:21.660
Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories

02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:23.660
Alright, let's talk about the dark side of

02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:25.660
Kickstarter

02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:27.660
So there was this Kickstarter for

02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:29.660
A game titled Mythic

02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:31.660
The Story of Gods and Men

02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:33.660
Which is an RPG from this company

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:35.660
Called Little Monster Productions

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:37.660
It was, of course

02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:39.660
This already sounds a little bit

02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.660
Outlandish, but it said

02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:43.660
To rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim

02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:45.660
Built together by a team of

02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:47.660
Former Activision Blizzard developers

02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:49.660
And the project was asking

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:51.660
For $80,000

02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.660
It raised $5,000

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:55.660
Up until a couple

02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:57.660
You know, days ago

02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.660
Basically what happened was

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.660
They actually cancelled the funding

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:03.660
Altogether

02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:05.660
And that's because

02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:07.660
Apparently all their assets that they were showing

02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:09.660
On the site were stolen

02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:11.660
Apparently

02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:13.660
All the artwork for the

02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:15.660
Game that was supposedly being made

02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:17.660
Was stolen off of different people's

02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:19.660
Deviant art sites

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.660
Also

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:23.660
Some of the

02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:25.660
I guess pretty much all of the

02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:27.660
Rewards were stolen from

02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:29.660
Another Kickstarter page

02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:31.660
The Banner Saga

02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:33.660
And

02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:35.660
Of course it made it to Reddit

02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:37.660
And people were warning them online

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.660
And of course Little Monster Productions

02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:41.660
Responded to the scam saying

02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:43.660
It seems we've been subjected to

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:45.660
False claims of ownership rights

02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:47.660
To our concepts

02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:49.660
The game itself is well in progress

02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:51.660
And it's not a scam of any kind

02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:53.660
Thank you for understanding

02:33:53.660 --> 02:33:55.660
If you have any further questions feel free to ask

02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.660
And then of course since then

02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:59.660
The Kickstarter

02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:01.660
Account's been deleted and

02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:03.660
They've kind of disappeared and vanished away

02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:05.660
With all that money

02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:07.660
Well no, technically not

02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:09.660
Because they have to hit their funding goal

02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:11.660
Of $80,000 in order to keep that money

02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:13.660
So the $5,000 that was contributed

02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:15.660
Or put down actually didn't go anywhere

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:17.660
It went back to the people that

02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:19.660
Never left the people that put it down

02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:21.660
I still think it's a wake up call

02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:23.660
I mean Kickstarter has really

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:25.660
Taken off

02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:27.660
Everybody wants a piece of it

02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:29.660
For some people it's like an ATM machine right now

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:31.660
And it's a tricky thing

02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:33.660
I still can't wrap my head around

02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:35.660
How I really feel about Kickstarter because

02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:37.660
There's some things like

02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:39.660
What Random was talking about earlier

02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:41.660
And I saw a great piece

02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:43.660
On the internet this week, an awesome piece about

02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:45.660
Amanda Palmer's

02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:47.660
Kickstarter

02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:49.660
And basically the gist of the article is

02:34:49.660 --> 02:34:51.660
This is why Amanda Palmer gets to do

02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:53.660
A Kickstarter and you don't

02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:55.660
And I thought it was kind of a really neat article

02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:57.660
It was really good

02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:59.660
I just

02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:01.660
If you're gonna get into the

02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:03.660
Kickstarter thing, that's cool

02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:05.660
But play smart

02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:07.660
And this story is a great example

02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:09.660
Of why, because it really seems like there's some people out there

02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:11.660
Just donating to everything and anything

02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:13.660
Hey it's your money, spend it on what you want

02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:15.660
It can be dangerous and this is why

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:17.660
Educate yourself

02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:19.660
Make sure that you're aware

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.660
Of who you're

02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:23.660
Donating to

02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:25.660
I also really think

02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:27.660
This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter

02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:29.660
Kickstarter needs to allow the person

02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:31.660
And maybe they do

02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:33.660
To be fair, maybe they already do this

02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:35.660
And I just never see people do it

02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:37.660
And maybe people should be encouraged to do it more

02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:39.660
To set a limit

02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:41.660
On how much money is gonna be raised

02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:43.660
Because you know

02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:45.660
When I see certain Kickstarters

02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:47.660
That ask for thirty thousand

02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:49.660
And I can't even put my head around what you do

02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:51.660
With thirty thousand dollars

02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:53.660
And get a hundred and twenty thousand dollars

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:55.660
It's like

02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:57.660
Well they keep changing

02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.660
They're allowed to I guess change their

02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:01.660
Goals I guess on their

02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:03.660
What they're gonna do

02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:05.660
I don't know

02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:07.660
As a consumer I want to know where every dollar is going

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:09.660
You know

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.660
As an investor

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:13.660
And when you invest in a company

02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.660
There's these things called investor and shareholder

02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:17.660
Meetings where you talk about the company

02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:19.660
And the progress and where the money is going

02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:21.660
But really all that you are guaranteed out of that

02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:23.660
Is basically what you

02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:25.660
Slot you fit into

02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:27.660
As far as the rewards go

02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:29.660
That's all you're guaranteed

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:31.660
And that's my problem with Kickstarter

02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:33.660
Well then don't donate the stuff that you're

02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:35.660
Unaware of

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:37.660
But I will admit there are some Kickstarters

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:39.660
And like the star control thing we talked about last week

02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:41.660
I have to admit I kind of want that cartridge

02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:43.660
That sounded pretty fucking awesome

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:45.660
And you know I hear about people like

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:47.660
Random and certainly

02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:49.660
The pink elephant in the room

02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:51.660
There's other Kickstarters that you know

02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:53.660
Obviously we're well aware of

02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:55.660
You know and I wish success for them

02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:57.660
But it's

02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.660
It's just

02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:01.660
There's just something about it

02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:03.660
Like I just feel like the other shoe is gonna

02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:05.660
Drop on Kickstarter any day now

02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:07.660
It's gonna burst

02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:09.660
I don't know if I want to be there when it does

02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:11.660
Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer

02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:13.660
Anyway

02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:15.660
Well I mean not everything gets

02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:17.660
Not everything gets you know

02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:19.660
Funded I mean there was the

02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:21.660
Kickstarter for

02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:23.660
It was a sequel to

02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:25.660
Oh god I don't remember now what it's called

02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:27.660
It was a PSP game it wasn't very popular

02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:29.660
But they were trying to get a sequel for it

02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:31.660
And that fell through

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:33.660
But there is some interesting

02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:35.660
Things on there and this is another one of those

02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.660
There's a

02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:39.660
MMO on

02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:41.660
There if you can even call it

02:37:41.660 --> 02:37:43.660
It's called Class Realm it's being developed

02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:45.660
By

02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:47.660
Some people I want to say

02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:49.660
They're in the education

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:51.660
System to

02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:53.660
Basically motivate

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:55.660
Their students to read more

02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:57.660
Participate in discussions more and study more

02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:59.660
As well as learn

02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:01.660
And you know it's called Class Realm

02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.660
And it's kind of interesting

02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:05.660
He says my kids are

02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:07.660
They're the best promoters

02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:09.660
As they're going around telling other students

02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:11.660
How great it is and in my classroom the other kids

02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:13.660
Come in from other classes from math and science

02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:15.660
And they see the Class Realm

02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:17.660
Stuff on my wall and they want to do it

02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:19.660
And other teachers

02:38:19.660 --> 02:38:21.660
Also have been hugely supportive and basically

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:23.660
What he's trying to do is he's creating this

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:25.660
Class Realm thing that's both free and paid

02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:27.660
As well you can do the free

02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:29.660
Sharing the tools with the other

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:31.660
Teachers and then the paid one

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.660
You get additional things

02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:35.660
We covered this a few weeks ago

02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:37.660
It's pretty cool

02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:39.660
It's actually launched now and he's taking

02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:41.660
Donations and stuff

02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:43.660
You can pledge towards it

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:45.660
I think it's kind of neat

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:47.660
Alright

02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:49.660
Well let's move on to another story here

02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:51.660
We talked about harmonics earlier

02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:53.660
In the show and I want to talk about them

02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:55.660
Again because everybody's kind of wondering

02:38:55.660 --> 02:38:57.660
What are they going to do next? Obviously they have

02:38:57.660 --> 02:38:59.660
The Xbox Live and Playstation Network thing

02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:01.660
That's coming but you know that can't be

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:03.660
The only thing they've been working on for the past few years

02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:05.660
Well some rumors are leaking

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:07.660
Out about what we might see very soon

02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:09.660
According to some different job listings

02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:11.660
That were spotted harmonics

02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:13.660
Is looking for a narrative content

02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:15.660
And level designers

02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:17.660
And one software engineer

02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:19.660
They're going to be doing a project that's called

02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:21.660
Quote a unique

02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:23.660
Motion gaming IP

02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:25.660
Hmmm

02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:27.660
It seeks an accomplished narrative designer

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:29.660
To incorporate creative storylines

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:31.660
Into gameplay on a unique

02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:33.660
Motion gaming IP

02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:35.660
Could it be Dance Central 3

02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:37.660
Or is this something brand brand new

02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:39.660
Dance Central 2 kind of tried

02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:41.660
To do the story thing but it was a little

02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:43.660
Silly but you don't expect much out of a music

02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:45.660
Game. Could harmonics be doing

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:47.660
Something, I mean maybe it's Dance Central 3

02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:49.660
Maybe it's something totally

02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.660
Different. They said unique

02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:53.660
Yeah they did say unique

02:39:53.660 --> 02:39:55.660
I mean harmonics

02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:57.660
Everything they put out has been pretty good

02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:59.660
Except for that free thing but

02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:01.660
Harmonics does a pretty darn good job

02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:03.660
Even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy

02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:05.660
But it was really an interesting little tool

02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:07.660
I'm really curious to see what they bring

02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:09.660
With this

02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:11.660
I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it

02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:15.660
But we'll see

02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:17.660
How about some other news

02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:19.660
Well

02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:21.660
Sega is making

02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:23.660
A kind of a console

02:40:23.660 --> 02:40:25.660
For you to pee on

02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:27.660
It's called a Dreamcast

02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:29.660
Just kidding

02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:31.660
I love the Dreamcast

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:33.660
It's a urine powered

02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:35.660
Video game system for Japanese toilets

02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:37.660
That's to be installed

02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.660
In bars and it

02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:41.660
Measures

02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:43.660
Urine speed but two different

02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:45.660
Effects

02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:47.660
And Hiroyuki Tanaka

02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:49.660
Who is a Sega spokesman

02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:51.660
It gives customers something to talk

02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:53.660
About when they come back from the bathroom

02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:55.660
It

02:40:55.660 --> 02:40:57.660
It's basically called the toilet

02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:59.660
Toilet

02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:01.660
I get it

02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.660
It gives men

02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:05.660
Incentive to pee in the urinal

02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:07.660
To play mini games

02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:09.660
Instead of on the floor

02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:11.660
And it makes cleaner restrooms

02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:13.660
And

02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:15.660
Tanaka says

02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:17.660
We live in a day and age where you have to give

02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:19.660
Incentive for grown men

02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:21.660
Please

02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:23.660
Don't go pee pee on the floor

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:25.660
And they've had good feedback

02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:27.660
From customers that says toilet cleanliness

02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:29.660
Has improved

02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:31.660
Now get the price on this one Rob

02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:33.660
There's 130 units out there

02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.660
At 150,000 yen

02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:37.660
A pop

02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:39.660
Now just to be clear we have heard

02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:41.660
About this system before

02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:43.660
Cause there was the whole toilet jokes

02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:45.660
I've watched an informative video on this before

02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:47.660
But what Jamie's talking about is that

02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:49.660
Now Sega's putting it out there where it's

02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:51.660
Really accessible where anybody can get this

02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:53.660
You can get this for your personal bathroom if you want

02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:55.660
If you're like into water sports or something weird

02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:57.660
Well to clarify

02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:59.660
There's been a trickle of information

02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:01.660
About this

02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:03.660
The hardware itself is

02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:05.660
140,000 which is about

02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:07.660
1700 bucks

02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:09.660
The mini games are

02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:11.660
10,000 yen a piece which is 125 dollars

02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:13.660
And you can get

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:15.660
A 10 yen coin box

02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:17.660
That's 25,000

02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:19.660
So that you can pay to

02:42:19.660 --> 02:42:21.660
Pee I guess

02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:23.660
312 bucks pretty much

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:25.660
For the box

02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:27.660
That's a terrible idea, pay to pee

02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.660
And they have home options

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:31.660
It'll be on Spirit Airlines

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:33.660
Next week

02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:35.660
And now they have home version options

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:37.660
Where you can pay

02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:39.660
2,000 dollars to

02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:41.660
Pay to pee in your own house

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:43.660
But you can

02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:45.660
GioVidea who is a lady is in our chat room

02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:47.660
At vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households

02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:49.660
Badly

02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:51.660
Yes and in college restrooms

02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:53.660
But this honestly

02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:55.660
What do ladies have?

02:42:55.660 --> 02:42:57.660
We can pee

02:42:57.660 --> 02:42:59.660
Maybe not directionally pee like men

02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:01.660
Cause you know it's really hard to aim when

02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:03.660
You know it's close to the hoo-ha

02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:05.660
But why take the fun out of trying?

02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:07.660
We should have like poop pressure games

02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:09.660
Ew

02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.660
Ew

02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:13.660
Ew

02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:15.660
Ew about the pee too

02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.660
At least pee is sterile

02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:19.660
Going to our chat room

02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:21.660
I really don't want to talk about this story anymore

02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:23.660
But I really need to

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:25.660
You're the one who gave it to me

02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:27.660
The show where every gamer has a voice

02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:29.660
BlackWolf in our chat room at vognetwork.com

02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:31.660
Says sign in the men's bathroom

02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:33.660
Of the LAN center I did Friday night gaming at

02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:35.660
You claim to have good aim

02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:37.660
Now's your chance to prove it

02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:39.660
Okay

02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:41.660
When I was at the University of South Alabama

02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:43.660
In the humanities building

02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:45.660
On the second floor in the ladies bathroom

02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:47.660
There was a little poem

02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:49.660
Written on the wall in the stall

02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:51.660
That I would usually use

02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:53.660
If you must pee upon the seat

02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:55.660
Wipe it off and keep it neat

02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:57.660
There was also

02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:59.660
Now get this

02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:01.660
A toilet seat cover that I saw

02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:03.660
On the top it says we aim to please

02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:05.660
You lift it up

02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:07.660
Please

02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:09.660
I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms

02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:11.660
We need to talk about this for a minute

02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:13.660
Because we don't pee all over everything

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:15.660
I was at a gas station

02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:17.660
Driving to LA and I was at the gas station at

02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:19.660
3.30 in the morning because you know nature called

02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:21.660
And I had to go but the men's restroom was closed

02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:23.660
So there was not a soul

02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:25.660
In this place so I said to my friend

02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:27.660
I said Victoria I want you to stand outside this door

02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:29.660
And if a woman comes don't let them in

02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:31.660
So I went in the women's restroom

02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:33.660
And you know I open the door and I'm like

02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:35.660
There's like flowers and shit in here

02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.660
It smells all

02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:39.660
perfume-y

02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:41.660
Like what the hell is this strange new

02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:43.660
world

02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:45.660
The only time I've seen like a nice bathroom

02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:47.660
At this is like when you go to the steak house and have a nice

02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:49.660
Dinner like those are the only men's restrooms

02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:51.660
That get decorated where maybe like the little

02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:53.660
Hand towels are in a basket

02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:55.660
But fucking flowers and shit

02:44:55.660 --> 02:44:57.660
At a gas station

02:44:57.660 --> 02:44:59.660
Check who owns the gas station

02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:01.660
I have been in some pretty

02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:03.660
Shithole gas station bathrooms

02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:05.660
For women so do not

02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:07.660
Even go there it was

02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:09.660
The chevron

02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:11.660
On the way back from Pensacola

02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:13.660
That's right when you get back into Mobile off the

02:45:13.660 --> 02:45:15.660
Causeway ugh never go there it's

02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:17.660
Awful

02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:19.660
Alright we're gonna move on

02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:21.660
To some other stories quite quickly

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:23.660
But I do want to point out cause everybody

02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:25.660
In chat was like how many listeners did you lose

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:27.660
During that segment we gained

02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:29.660
One suckas

02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:31.660
You got told

02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:33.660
When in doubt potty jokes

02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:35.660
Alright moving on

02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:37.660
We should talk more about that stuff

02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:39.660
Let's talk about Microsoft

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:41.660
Coming soon to the VoG network

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:43.660
Poo poo pee pee show

02:45:43.660 --> 02:45:45.660
I'm kidding I'm kidding

02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:47.660
Microsoft has patented

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:49.660
Some sort of arm band

02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:51.660
That has

02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:53.660
EMG sensors as well as other

02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:55.660
Electrodes in there

02:45:55.660 --> 02:45:57.660
Basically what it does is it monitors your muscle

02:45:57.660 --> 02:45:59.660
So for example

02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:01.660
You know they would have it programmed

02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:03.660
To where like if you made a fist or something like that

02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:05.660
That your character would make a fist

02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:07.660
Kind of like an extension to like

02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:09.660
The motion tracking and stuff

02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:11.660
And you know I guess it could be

02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:13.660
Applied to other

02:46:13.660 --> 02:46:15.660
Parts of your body like your leg or something like that

02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:17.660
But it is kind of interesting

02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:19.660
That they're gonna have some

02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:21.660
Potentially gonna have some sort of device

02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:23.660
That allows you to track yourself a little

02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:25.660
Better

02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:27.660
Pretty soon

02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:29.660
I'm just worried about how far those things

02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:31.660
Are gonna evolve

02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:33.660
It is a device

02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:35.660
That you wrap around an appendage

02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:37.660
So the TTP for that

02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:39.660
How soon?

02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:43.660
If you don't know what that is

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:45.660
Just move right along

02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:47.660
Alright a moment

02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:49.660
Of silence please because

02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:51.660
Like when I heard

02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:53.660
This news this week

02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:55.660
I almost wanted to call

02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:57.660
The hotline

02:46:57.660 --> 02:46:59.660
And send some help

02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:01.660
Over to one of our authors

02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:03.660
OrangeLawnTrader.com's house

02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:05.660
To make sure he was okay

02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:07.660
La Munana

02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:09.660
In North America and Europe

02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:11.660
Has been cancelled on WiiWare

02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:13.660
And Dark Tetsuya

02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:15.660
Bless his heart

02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:17.660
Was really excited about that game

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:19.660
Like really excited about that game

02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:21.660
And it was in development

02:47:21.660 --> 02:47:23.660
And in development

02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:25.660
And finally they just said

02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:27.660
Fuck it we're not releasing

02:47:27.660 --> 02:47:29.660
It on the Wii now there is some

02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:31.660
Good news it is coming out on the PC

02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:33.660
So you know maybe it'll be on Steam

02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:35.660
Or something like that but uh

02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:37.660
It was cancelled they did uh

02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:39.660
I thought that was already on PC

02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:41.660
Uh I think this is like a

02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:43.660
Plus version or like an enhanced version

02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:45.660
Of the game that's coming out

02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:47.660
You know we were waiting on it for two years and basically

02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:49.660
At the end of the day they just came out and said

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:51.660
WiiWare ain't profitable anymore

02:47:51.660 --> 02:47:53.660
That's what everyone's been saying

02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:55.660
That's something they need to fix

02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:57.660
And a lot of that is Nintendo shitty guidelines

02:47:57.660 --> 02:47:59.660
Where it's like you have to sell so many units before

02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:01.660
You even get like a check

02:48:01.660 --> 02:48:03.660
Keep that up and you won't have anybody but

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:05.660
Yourselves publishing on

02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:07.660
That service

02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:09.660
So uh

02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:11.660
You know just uh a moment

02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:13.660
Rest in peace La Munana

02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:15.660
On the Wii

02:48:15.660 --> 02:48:17.660
I mean at least it'll be coming out on the platform

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:19.660
It's a cute game I was interested in it

02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:21.660
Why can't they put that on like you know Xbox

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:23.660
Indie games or how we'll get that on like

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.660
You know Xbox Live Arcade or something like that

02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:27.660
Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it

02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:29.660
But it seems like they don't like to talk much

02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:31.660
Uh

02:48:31.660 --> 02:48:33.660
Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show

02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:35.660
Why Nintendo fails at digital distribution

02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:37.660
Sj100Matt says but then again

02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:39.660
It was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people

02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:41.660
Are not placing the blame on the makers

02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.660
Of La Mulana but they are placing the blame

02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:45.660
Squarely at Nintendo's feet

02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:47.660
And uh I can't say I disagree with

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:49.660
Shall we open up

02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:51.660
The Skype line? We shall

02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:53.660
1877 Game OLR or our

02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:55.660
Username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:48:55.660 --> 02:48:57.660
If you want to give us a call

02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:59.660
Rama just announced that he's a classy whore

02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:01.660
Thank you for that

02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:03.660
On our program

02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:05.660
Alright 1877 Game OLR or again

02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:07.660
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:09.660
If you want to give our show a call

02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:11.660
And talk about any news stories we may have missed

02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:13.660
Or your opinion on what have you

02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.660
Sadly Random is long gone now

02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:17.660
He's off to work on something else

02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:19.660
We can't let you ask him a question but uh

02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:21.660
We can talk about what he talked about

02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.660
In the meantime do we have any last minute stories here in studio

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:25.660
I'm going to fire up the Twitter and see if anyone

02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:27.660
Sent us anything to talk about on

02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:29.660
Twitter.com slash OLR

02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:31.660
But first

02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:33.660
I want my lungs to step in

02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:35.660
Oh never mind a call is coming in

02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:37.660
Look at that saved from last minute stories

02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:39.660
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

02:49:39.660 --> 02:49:41.660
It's that classy whore Rama

02:49:41.660 --> 02:49:43.660
Hi ho

02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:45.660
Who am I?

02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:47.660
Hey ho what's up?

02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:49.660
Not too much

02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:51.660
Porkchop wants to talk about poop

02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.660
I do have some things I want to cover before I get out of here

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:55.660
And start off my hellish work week

02:49:55.660 --> 02:49:57.660
Yep

02:49:57.660 --> 02:49:59.660
Alright first things first

02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:01.660
As per orders of the great mighty powerful Rob

02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:03.660
I went to Chinatown Fair

02:50:05.660 --> 02:50:07.660
Yeah I'm curious to hear what you thought about

02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:09.660
Chinatown Fair because what I read on Twitter

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:11.660
Was interesting

02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.660
Uh oh

02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:15.660
That sums it up right there

02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:17.660
I

02:50:17.660 --> 02:50:19.660
I wasn't

02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:21.660
I wasn't expecting this

02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:23.660
I really wasn't and I'm posting

02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:25.660
A link to the complete total

02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:27.660
Of eight photos I took

02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:29.660
There because all I needed was eight

02:50:29.660 --> 02:50:31.660
Photos

02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:33.660
I mean

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:35.660
It's not even trying

02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:37.660
To be a Dave and Busters

02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:39.660
Wannabe

02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:41.660
It's like

02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:43.660
The kid brother little bastard

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:45.660
Of Dave and Busters that nobody

02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.660
Talks to

02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:49.660
Chuck E. Cheese?

02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:51.660
Not even

02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:53.660
Not even

02:50:53.660 --> 02:50:55.660
There's some ski ball and the spinny wheel for tickets

02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:57.660
And a basketball thing

02:50:57.660 --> 02:50:59.660
Terminator salvation is cool

02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:01.660
Guitar Hero arcade some people like

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:03.660
If you notice over in the corner

02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:05.660
I only got one

02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:07.660
But right next to that one big screen TV

02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:09.660
There's another big screen TV

02:51:09.660 --> 02:51:11.660
That's not even on

02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:13.660
And

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:15.660
Damn you have HDMI cables hooked up

02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:17.660
For the console

02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:19.660
Hey they got a Plinko game

02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:21.660
I didn't know they made those for the prices

02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:23.660
Oh Rob you and Plinko

02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:25.660
I mean it looks like a lot of

02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:27.660
Ok it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember

02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:29.660
Got replaced with ticket spitters

02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:31.660
Welcome to every other arcade in America

02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:33.660
I mean it's sad but that's what's happened

02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:35.660
I know but I wasn't

02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:37.660
Expecting something like this

02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:39.660
Though I mean

02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:41.660
From

02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:43.660
When I spoke to one of the guys who told me

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.660
About this he flat out said

02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:47.660
The new owner has no clue as to what

02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:49.660
He's doing and he's trying to convince

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:51.660
The owner to get in some actual

02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:53.660
Good games

02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:55.660
Ok well that you know and it is

02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:57.660
New arcade so let's give

02:51:57.660 --> 02:51:59.660
I mean yes it's an old arcade

02:51:59.660 --> 02:52:01.660
But it's new owners or whatever let's give

02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:03.660
Them a chance

02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:05.660
That's what everybody was saying because at first we're all

02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:07.660
Outside sitting on the

02:52:07.660 --> 02:52:09.660
Stoop bad mouthing

02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:11.660
And cursing up a storm about

02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:13.660
This and then we're like you know

02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:15.660
We'll give them about

02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:17.660
30 days just to see

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:19.660
Yeah go back in a month and see what

02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.660
Changes if anything and if nothing changes

02:52:21.660 --> 02:52:23.660
Well then shit they didn't learn anything

02:52:23.660 --> 02:52:25.660
Um you know give it

02:52:25.660 --> 02:52:27.660
A chance

02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:29.660
We're trying and we're looking we're walking

02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:31.660
Like the first thing we started

02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:33.660
Raging about the fact that there's a pump it up machine

02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:35.660
Because nobody plays pump it up

02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:37.660
It's funny in the picture that's the

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:39.660
Only machine I see a crowd around

02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:41.660
That's the sad part

02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:43.660
It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets

02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:45.660
Well there was a

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:47.660
Terminator salvation machine I saw there too

02:52:47.660 --> 02:52:49.660
And a couple others I mean

02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:51.660
Super bikes too

02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:53.660
Hey you know what Chinatown fair looks like

02:52:53.660 --> 02:52:55.660
Right now Roseville Golfland

02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:57.660
Welcome to my world

02:52:57.660 --> 02:52:59.660
The funny thing is that's the first thing

02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:01.660
That came to mind I'm like

02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:03.660
Maybe

02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:05.660
I think this is it maybe we were on the same

02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:07.660
Wavelength at that time for that five

02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:09.660
Seconds Rob I'm so glad that the east

02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:11.660
Coast now has a place where video games go to

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:13.660
Die congratulations

02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:15.660
Yes

02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:17.660
We'll take that with a badge of honor

02:53:17.660 --> 02:53:19.660
Alright

02:53:19.660 --> 02:53:21.660
anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight

02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:23.660
I

02:53:23.660 --> 02:53:25.660
No I'm just

02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:27.660
Still in disgust from Chinatown fair

02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:29.660
I'm going to pretend I never

02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:31.660
Saw that. Alright go take a shower

02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:33.660
Alright

02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:35.660
There's not enough bleach in the world dammit

02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.660
Alright bye Rama

02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:39.660
Bye

02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:41.660
1877 game OLR or our username on skype is

02:53:41.660 --> 02:53:43.660
Orange Lounge Radio

02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:45.660
Speak here Rama

02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:47.660
He passed along a little giveaway we're going to have

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:49.660
In just a little bit here on the show

02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:51.660
I'm waiting until the very end because that's how I roll

02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:53.660
Um

02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:55.660
Let's see going to

02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:57.660
Some of our tweets that we have tonight

02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:59.660
Tiger Claw of course sent us a few tweets

02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:01.660
Here uh one of them is about

02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:03.660
Miyamoto's DS patent

02:54:03.660 --> 02:54:05.660
That will offer upgraded

02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:07.660
Tourist hunting techniques

02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:09.660
That sounds kind of interesting I hadn't

02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:11.660
Heard about this uh apparently

02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:13.660
If this

02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:15.660
Is a real deal

02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:17.660
There could be some type of advancement in GPS

02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:19.660
Technology in tourist heavy areas

02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:21.660
Like museums and haunted house type

02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:23.660
Places and I'm imagining things like Disneyland

02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:25.660
Uh this patent would have a system

02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:27.660
Where an overhead grid

02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:29.660
Of infrared positional information

02:54:29.660 --> 02:54:31.660
Transmitters reads a user's

02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:33.660
DS to light up floor patterns

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:35.660
And potential walkways

02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:37.660
The user can pick which route they'd like to take

02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:39.660
Reading tourist facts along the way

02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:41.660
That sounds kind of interesting

02:54:41.660 --> 02:54:43.660
I guess the 3DS I didn't realize this already

02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:45.660
The 3DS will give guided tours

02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.660
Of the Louvre in France

02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:49.660
And it's really a pretty good

02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:51.660
The Louvre

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:53.660
Yo no speak French-o

02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.660
Um it's doing a pretty good job I guess

02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:57.660
From what they say

02:54:57.660 --> 02:54:59.660
That's kind of interesting it's an interesting use of the technology

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:01.660
Technically

02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:03.660
There's iPhone apps and stuff

02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:05.660
That do all that but this

02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:07.660
Is a different way of implementing that technology

02:55:07.660 --> 02:55:09.660
That you know would be pretty stable

02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:11.660
So sounds

02:55:11.660 --> 02:55:13.660
Very interesting to me

02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:15.660
Let's go to the phones and take another call

02:55:15.660 --> 02:55:17.660
Hi you're on orange country who's this?

02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:19.660
What's up buddy?

02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:21.660
Nothing much just trying to reiterate what

02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:23.660
Rama has said about CF

02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:25.660
I heard it from my sources a few

02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:27.660
You know a couple of days before

02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:29.660
It opened that it was going to be radically different

02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:31.660
Like nothing

02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:33.660
It wasn't going to be anything near what

02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:35.660
The old CF was

02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:37.660
And I guess

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.660
In a way it's

02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:41.660
You know I got to give them the benefit of the doubt that

02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:43.660
Sure they may have like a

02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:45.660
Rocky and

02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:47.660
Some uneven open just for the fact that it's

02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:49.660
It's out of place for what

02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:51.660
People would normally

02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:53.660
Refer to as CF

02:55:53.660 --> 02:55:55.660
But then again if the owner doesn't like

02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:57.660
The owner doesn't make a change

02:55:57.660 --> 02:55:59.660
Quickly then he's going to lose

02:55:59.660 --> 02:56:01.660
These folks for quite a while

02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:03.660
Because they're going to go to Brooklyn to next level arcade

02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:05.660
Where the remnants of CF

02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:07.660
Who used to run the place are

02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:09.660
Pretty much alive and you know thriving there

02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:11.660
Especially the fighting community

02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:13.660
Let me play devil's advocate

02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:15.660
For a minute here because this is a question

02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:17.660
I should have asked on the last call

02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:19.660
Yeah they might lose the fans that used to go

02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:21.660
But is it possible that they'll gain fans

02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:23.660
I mean arcades do this for a reason right

02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:25.660
Yeah but it might be a demographic

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:27.660
That doesn't

02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:29.660
Doesn't like bode well

02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:31.660
For that area

02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:33.660
I mean the way I describe a CFer

02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.660
Is someone who's basically male

02:56:35.660 --> 02:56:37.660
About 20ish

02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:39.660
Into video games very competitive

02:56:39.660 --> 02:56:41.660
So that type of demographic

02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:43.660
Pretty much held that place together

02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:45.660
For the last years

02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:47.660
Of its old existence

02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:49.660
Because

02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.660
It was mostly fighting games and to an extent

02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:53.660
Our community

02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:55.660
The DDR community

02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:57.660
So to have something that barely

02:56:57.660 --> 02:56:59.660
Resembles that and

02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:01.660
Something where the old guard of CF

02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:03.660
You know are pretty much

02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:05.660
At their own place right now that caters

02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:07.660
To that demographic it's like you're not going to

02:57:07.660 --> 02:57:09.660
It's not going to do any justice right away

02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:11.660
If it's basically

02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:13.660
If that old location has

02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:15.660
Nothing more than just

02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:17.660
You know just like a mini D&B

02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:19.660
I mean that's

02:57:19.660 --> 02:57:21.660
Pretty much what I'm getting at

02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:23.660
You have so much space

02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:25.660
That they crammed with arcade machines

02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:27.660
Left and right

02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:29.660
Like just about every place

02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:31.660
Wall to wall just literally just covered in arcades

02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.660
And now they're just like

02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:35.660
There's not that many at the moment

02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:37.660
But as I said I give them the benefit of the doubt

02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:39.660
So unless this new owner

02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:41.660
Doesn't like

02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:43.660
Doesn't like

02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:45.660
Unless this owner actually does

02:57:45.660 --> 02:57:47.660
Something in terms of writing

02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:49.660
This course and trying to draw more people

02:57:49.660 --> 02:57:51.660
In there in order to stay alive

02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:53.660
Let me ask this question though

02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:55.660
Is it maybe already a lost cause?

02:57:55.660 --> 02:57:57.660
It depends

02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.660
How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money

02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:01.660
I know of another place

02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:03.660
Like out in Queens in the city

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:05.660
Peter Pan Gaines

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:07.660
Is similar but it's more

02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:09.660
Lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere

02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:11.660
It's like the only

02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:13.660
In other words New York's only 2DX machine

02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:15.660
Is out there as well as like

02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:17.660
An unlocked X2

02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:19.660
But it has redemption games

02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:21.660
But the thing is that these redemption aren't just like

02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:23.660
Some Mickey Mouse prizes

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:25.660
They're like real big ticket items like iPads

02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:27.660
And coupled with the fact that

02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:29.660
It's on a strip mall

02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:31.660
Which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood

02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:33.660
So it's partly

02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:35.660
What CF is but it's like

02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:37.660
What CF is right now is at an infancy of what

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:39.660
Peter Pan Gaines is already at

02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:41.660
So it's at a point where

02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:43.660
Unless they start drawing in something

02:58:43.660 --> 02:58:45.660
That will keep whales

02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:47.660
Like myself

02:58:47.660 --> 02:58:49.660
They'll draw them in there

02:58:49.660 --> 02:58:51.660
In other words you'll have a clientele

02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:53.660
That will constantly spend money there

02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:55.660
And will keep your place alive

02:58:55.660 --> 02:58:57.660
They're just doomed to failure

02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:59.660
They're gonna need that type of customer

02:58:59.660 --> 02:59:01.660
Or else they're just gonna succumb to whatever

02:59:01.660 --> 02:59:03.660
They get if any

02:59:03.660 --> 02:59:05.660
Alright

02:59:05.660 --> 02:59:07.660
Well Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:59:07.660 --> 02:59:09.660
But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:11.660
Other than

02:59:11.660 --> 02:59:13.660
Cheating in MLB 2K12

02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:15.660
I'm not a baseball fan but

02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:17.660
The fact that people could game a

02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:19.660
Could actually exploit a game just to make money

02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:21.660
And 2K basically denying

02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:23.660
Let them get away with it

02:59:23.660 --> 02:59:25.660
That the exploit was illegal

02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:27.660
Even though they originally said it was

02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:29.660
I guess

02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:31.660
They have egg in their face right now

02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:33.660
It's like tainted that whole competition

02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:35.660
They're gonna have a shitty finale

02:59:35.660 --> 02:59:37.660
And they only have themselves to blame

02:59:37.660 --> 02:59:39.660
Exactly

02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:41.660
And they basically fell on their own sword

02:59:41.660 --> 02:59:43.660
For basically denying

02:59:43.660 --> 02:59:45.660
That said cheat

02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:47.660
Was illegal even though it's technically

02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:49.660
Allowed

02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:51.660
Zaku I gotta let you go buddy

02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:53.660
Have a good one

02:59:53.660 --> 02:59:55.660
Alright that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:57.660
I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through

02:59:57.660 --> 02:59:59.660
The live listeners, podcasters I'm so

02:59:59.660 --> 03:00:01.660
Sorry but I only have one of these to give

03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:03.660
Away and I do want to give it to somebody

03:00:03.660 --> 03:00:05.660
Tonight that's stayed up with us

03:00:05.660 --> 03:00:07.660
This late, don't worry Loki's competition

03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:09.660
He talked about that'll be open to everybody

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.660
But we're gonna open this one up to just the live

03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:13.660
Listeners for right now, here's what it is

03:00:13.660 --> 03:00:15.660
I've got a code courtesy of

03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:17.660
Ranma for an

03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:19.660
Xbox 360 avatar

03:00:19.660 --> 03:00:21.660
Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4

03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:23.660
Hoodie so if you want your avatar on

03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:25.660
Xbox to be wearing a hoodie

03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:27.660
We're gonna give one of these away and the good news is

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:29.660
You can actually use this with male or female

03:00:29.660 --> 03:00:31.660
There's a male code and a female code

03:00:31.660 --> 03:00:33.660
So technically you get two codes

03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:35.660
So I'm gonna give it to one person so maybe one for you

03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:37.660
And one for your SO or what have you

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:39.660
All you have to do is send me a private

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:41.660

Love vog and we're gonna pick a

03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:01.660
Random person

To receive a Sonic 4

03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:05.660
Hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks

Network tonight, so there you go

03:01:07.660 --> 03:01:09.660
And Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought

03:01:09.660 --> 03:01:11.660
To you by Anime Jam Session, yes fair enough

03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:13.660
Fair enough, check out Anime Jam Session

03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:15.660
At

03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:17.660
AnimeJamSession.com

03:01:17.660 --> 03:01:19.660
Alright send those private messages into Skye right now

03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:21.660
And while I collect those messages you have

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:23.660
About three minutes to do that

03:01:23.660 --> 03:01:25.660
Loki

03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:27.660
So yeah

03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:29.660
I have to

03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:31.660
I guess the last minute story

03:01:31.660 --> 03:01:33.660
Taito put out a game for Akira

03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:35.660
About 25 years ago

03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:37.660
On the Famicom and it's finally been

03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.660
Fan translated, so you can check that

03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:41.660
There's a patch available for that

03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:43.660
Yeah

03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:45.660
So it's out there

03:01:45.660 --> 03:01:47.660
Just Google it

03:01:47.660 --> 03:01:49.660
Yeah

03:01:49.660 --> 03:01:51.660
Yeah I was just gonna

03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:53.660
I was gonna talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing

03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:55.660
This kinda sucks

03:01:55.660 --> 03:01:57.660
Basically the exploit they used is they

03:01:57.660 --> 03:01:59.660
Adjusted the lineup of batters

03:01:59.660 --> 03:02:01.660
On the opposing team

03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:03.660
And removed the best players

03:02:03.660 --> 03:02:05.660
And so it made it a little bit easier to

03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:07.660
Pitch a perfect game with

03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:09.660
People that can't hit a ball

03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:11.660
Or can't hit a ball as well as some of the other people

03:02:11.660 --> 03:02:13.660
Apparently

03:02:13.660 --> 03:02:15.660
Some people didn't do that

03:02:15.660 --> 03:02:17.660
But

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.660
I guess a portion of the top

03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:21.660
8 did

03:02:21.660 --> 03:02:23.660
And that kinda sucks

03:02:23.660 --> 03:02:25.660
Including one actually

03:02:25.660 --> 03:02:27.660
Completely admitted to doing that and

03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:29.660
They have evidence of that

03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:31.660
2k came out and

03:02:31.660 --> 03:02:33.660
Originally they were like oh well that's against the rules

03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:35.660
And then they're like well

03:02:35.660 --> 03:02:37.660
No it's not or well we

03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:39.660
Stand by you know

03:02:39.660 --> 03:02:41.660
The people that we chose as the top 8

03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:45.660
So they're just kinda rolling with it

03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:47.660
And I mean if you think about it

03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:49.660
They fucked up and they didn't program

03:02:49.660 --> 03:02:51.660
This exclusive mode

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:53.660
For this the perfect pitch mode or whatever

03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:55.660
Perfect game challenge

03:02:55.660 --> 03:02:57.660
They fucked it up

03:02:57.660 --> 03:02:59.660
And unfortunately

03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:01.660
I guess they'll just next year

03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:03.660
Patch that out but

03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:05.660
It is unfortunate that they don't just

03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:07.660
Start the whole thing over again

03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:09.660
But that's the way that is

03:03:11.660 --> 03:03:13.660
Alright

03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:15.660
Any last minute stories? Sorry I'm not totally paying

03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:17.660
I'm trying to collect the vog stuff

03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:19.660
Alright guys we're gonna close it up

03:03:19.660 --> 03:03:21.660
The contest here we go

03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:23.660
I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read DarkSakura

03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:25.660
And Loki these answers here you tell me which ones your favorite

03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:27.660
I'm not gonna tell you who said it okay so here it is

03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:29.660
And we'll pick a winner from this so reasons you love

03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:31.660
VOG here we go I love

03:03:31.660 --> 03:03:33.660
VOG because it supports and promotes the

03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:35.660
Indie side of gaming music and geekdom

03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:37.660
Because listening to

03:03:37.660 --> 03:03:39.660
VOG at work makes my day enjoyable

03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:41.660
Because we can chant VOG at

03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.660
Wrestling events V-O-G

03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:45.660
V-O-G

03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:47.660
I love VOG because it's got a host who asks Jiggly

03:03:47.660 --> 03:03:49.660
Kayente a question on the reunion of Drag Race

03:03:49.660 --> 03:03:51.660
I love VOG because

03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:53.660
I want that stupid Sonic hoodie for

03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:55.660
Name Redacted because he would be so excited

03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:57.660
And that would keep him quiet for the whole night

03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.660
I love VOG because

03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:01.660
Every gamer has a voice

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:03.660
OLR is a great reason I love VOG

03:04:03.660 --> 03:04:05.660
Reason I love VOG

03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:07.660
OLR is on it duh

03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:09.660
I love VOG because I can make the initials mean

03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:11.660
Dumb stuff

03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:13.660
VOG is the only live podcast network I listen

03:04:13.660 --> 03:04:15.660
To often and look forward to the

03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:17.660
Bobby Blackwell Show and Orange Lounge Radio every week

03:04:19.660 --> 03:04:21.660
It's a tough one

03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:23.660
What do you guys think? You like the very first one?

03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:25.660
I love VOG because it

03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:27.660
Supports and promotes the Indie side of gaming music

03:04:27.660 --> 03:04:29.660
And geekdom

03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:31.660
I could go with that alright congratulations

03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:33.660
SSJ100 Matt the code's yours

03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:35.660
Good job

03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:37.660
A winner is you

03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:39.660
SSJ100 Matt I'll email that to you later

03:04:39.660 --> 03:04:41.660
Alright good answers though

03:04:41.660 --> 03:04:43.660
Thank you for playing

03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:45.660
I bet one of those was Shane

03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:47.660
Yes the Shane was the one with the Name Redacted

03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:49.660
Because this sounded like

03:04:49.660 --> 03:04:51.660
Something you would say

03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:53.660
I would have picked the Jiggly Kayente one personally

03:04:53.660 --> 03:04:55.660
But sorry I should have stated you'd have to woo the other host over too

03:04:55.660 --> 03:04:57.660
Alright

03:04:57.660 --> 03:04:59.660
Alright

03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:01.660
So congratulations again SSJ100

03:05:01.660 --> 03:05:03.660
Matt the code is yours

03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:05.660
And honestly if I had not been aware of

03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:07.660
RuPaul's Drag Race Jiggly

03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:09.660
Kayante sounds like a flavor of a Jello

03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:11.660
Jiggler

03:05:11.660 --> 03:05:13.660
Alright

03:05:13.660 --> 03:05:15.660
