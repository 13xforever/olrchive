{"text": " Today, May 6, 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is revealed, The Elder Scrolls Online is a reality, and we talk to video game hip hop artist, Megaran. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 456, yes that's 456, of our show on this May the 6th, that's 5-6, 2012. A lot of you numerology skeptic people have a lot to look forward to in tonight's show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about numbers and video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. To quote Eddie Izzard from Mystery Man, to paraphrase I should say, but Mani isn't dead, but Mani is life. Eddie Izzard was in Mystery Man? He was the leader of the Disco Boys. That was Eddie Izzard? I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the popular opinion, I didn't really care for that movie when I saw it. That movie was great. It was okay, but I saw it so long ago. Avengers, Avengers, Avengers. The other cynic voice you hear over there is the one and only tech master, Loki. I have also not seen the Avengers. I have not seen the Avengers, I'm like the one person in the world. You both are lame. We are lame. Well I'll explain my reasons in a minute, but first I have to plug the ever present fourth guest on our show, The Chatters. That's right, head on over to vognetwork.com, you can't miss it, we're a brand new start up network at VOG, so our chat is right there in the middle of the screen, and you can join our chat room and chat with us, and you might have heard on tonight's show, we have an interview. I'm excited, we haven't had an interview in a long time, and I was thinking about this last week, I was like, can either of you name who the last person was on the show and when? We had like a legit interview going on on the show. I don't remember. I could not remember. What about Snake360dude? No, it wasn't Snake360dude. It wasn't Snake360dude. No, it wasn't Snake360dude, it was the guy that was behind Technokitten Adventures. That was a year ago, it was Technokitten Adventure. Well we talked to him again, didn't we? No, I don't think so. Because he has Nyan Cat Adventures, which is the same thing. Anyway, he sold it off to an iPhone developer. And we had the Orange Lounge game. Mmhmm. Yeah. Well I think we did have YYRs, who you're thinking of. And he was on the show. But I wasn't technically on the interview, because he did, you know, was he plugging the new game? Yeah, he's kind of a listener of the show anyway, so it's weird to call that an interview. Where is the new game? Where is it? He said it's being worked on, but I think he had some other stuff going on. You know what? Beggars can't be choosers. Let him take his time. Alright, but anyway, tonight, we posted to Twitter earlier in the week, and we were like, hey guys, who do you want us to interview on the show? Like within reason. You know, we're not going to be able to get Reggie Fils-Aime, okay, we're not a television network or something. We're not going to get those folks. And so we kind of fielded some of the responses. And one idea that I really liked was getting Mega Ran on our show. Now if you guys don't know Mega Ran, he also goes by Random, and he does this like video game hip hop music. And I know some of you guys are probably sitting at that going, what, what? Video game hip hop? What is that? It's awesome. This is what it sounds like. I'm only going to tease you a little bit with this. Check out this. That song is called Splash Woman, and you can like hear it in the background, like that riff. And then he's kind of, you know, has some verses that he's laying down about Splash Woman or his Splash Woman. It's brilliant. I love it. Anyway, I can't play the whole thing. I can't give that away because you got to go to his website if you want the whole thing there, iTunes or whatever. But that's one of his like bigger, well-known songs, Splash Woman. That was amazing. Capcom loved it, grabbed him, said, you got, you got to do more. So he's got like a Mega Man 9, he's got a Mega Man 10, and we're going to ask him about some of his other projects. He's not just a Capcom guy. He's got Final Fantasy. We're going to talk to him a little later on in the show, 6.30 to be exact. So if you're a Mega Ran fan who saw the shout out on Twitter and all that, it was waiting for him to come on the show, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern is when he's going to be here. But join our chat room because we are a live show. Random was awesome enough to agree to do a live interview. And so you can actually ask your questions live in our chat room, vognetwork.com. Don't ask them yet because I'll lose them before the interview starts. But when we get going, when we get Random on the phone, you can ask those questions. All right. Anyhow, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern. Hope you'll join us live sometime even if you missed our action-packed show tonight. Before we get into our gaming weeks, the type of video games we've been playing, we usually like to kind of have a kickoff topic and we kind of got into it a little bit already, but everybody's talking about everybody, everybody in the geek world talking about the Avengers. Dark Sakura, I know you were there. I know you went and saw the Avengers movie. You're a comic fan. You're a Marvel fan. Ed Joss. What? Ed Joss. Oh, Ed Joss Whedon. You're a Joss Whedon fan. How was the Avengers movie? Oh my God. It was beautiful. And I'm sorry everybody if I sound kind of like a 12-year-old boy today, I've had allergies. I went to see it. I loaded myself up on Sudafed and Allegra and ate Ricolas and Junior Mints the entire time, which are an odd combination, but oddly work. And I was just like, oh, Hawkeye, this is the Hawkeye movie. Why is he evil? Not to spoil, but I mean, Jeremy Renner's ass, I mean, please. I wanted to reach out and touch it, but Dan was next to me. Anyway. In full 3D? Anyway, I have to tell you about what was running through my head the entire movie. All right. I have a new ship. I am totally sailing on the Hawkeye Black Widow ship because, oh my God. Aren't there, I know a lot of you don't read gossip websites, but I think I read something about, cause you know, I read all that trash. I think I read something, something about Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson. They've been flirty. Like there's pictures of them on the red carpet, flirty. So you know what? If I get pretty, I bet there's a lot of men out there that would like a shot at Scarlett Johansson. So, you know, and it's all because of him is the whole reason I want to see that Mission Impossible movie, him and Simon Peck because hello. Um, so yeah, I can say first of all, because it's a Joss production, there is the Joss death. I will not tell you who. And Dan's like, it's going to be Hawkeye. No, don't spoil. I'm not spoiling, but it did make me go, damn you man. Like I did with Wash. Okay. And stay during the credits. Yes. Oh my God. What was that? What was that? So one does not simply go to a Marvel movie and not stay through the credits. Exactly. Cause now keep in mind, I'm not just meaning the cause you know, there's that like that lovely designed a bit of credits where they give you the big stuff and the main guys who is in it, who were in it, sorry. And then they give you a preview for whatever the next one is, which I'm not going to spoil, but if nobody gets it, please ask me. I will be more than happy to explain to you what it is and why you should pee your pants. And then, but the very end of the movie and really listen very carefully to the dialogue right before the credits. That's all I'm having to say. Tiger claw on our chat and chat chatters. Don't spoil. Don't do it. If you spoil your getting kicked to the private messages, take your spoil into the private messages. Uh, just double click on some of these names and you can private message him. Uh, and you can, you can talk a double click on dark soccer. I will gush you all. You're in the show. Okay. Talk to her. Um, I have to tell you, everybody in that movie was cast perfectly. Let's go to the chat room real quick at vog network.com a tiger. Claw says you're going to see a lot more of Jeremy Renner. He's taken over the born movies, the Matt Damon, born conspiracy, all that stuff. Yeah. Those board movies are pretty awesome. Actually. I'm, I'm excited about that. How do you think so? I'm better than Matt Damon. I mean, come on. It's Matt Damon. I just didn't care about the board movies. SSJ 100. Matt says I give it to Joss Whedon. He didn't mess it up because I had my doubts. I think there were a lot of people. Did you hear this? Over the weekend, not only the biggest opening weekend ever, which nobody thought Harry Potter, you know, part two or part eight or whatever could ever be topped, but two, 200 million plus for the weekend. And a, this is the, this is the other real telling thing. Um, hunger games beat that. No, no. Hunger games didn't beat it either. A, I mean, hunger games was huge, but didn't beat it. A plus cinema score that in cinema score. Those are the pollsters that go out and talk to the people right after the movie. I actually pulled for them once. They were out in Roseville one time and I don't even remember what the movie was, but they pulled me on it and they actually take, you know, they grade it a plus rating from cinema score. That's, that's huge because that means word of mouth is going to get out there that, Hey, this movie doesn't suck. Go see it. And, uh, going to some other chats, uh, panaxium, I hope I pronounced that right in the VOG network chat room said Avengers did something amazing. They combined multiple heroes in a single movie without breaking it because hello. Who else could do that? But the Joss, I'm sorry. So I have to say, I have to say, I have to say everybody was characterized perfectly. The interaction was perfect. And um, for those of you who read ultimates, yeah, it does take a little bit from the first. It really does seem like it's based a bit more off of ultimates with a good splash of six one six universe in it. So yeah, it, it, um, it's really good. And no, the Hulk doesn't smash Jar Jar Binks, although I'd pay to see that. I would pay for that Star Wars slash, you know, Avengers movie. I have to tell everybody what my favorite line in the movie is and it's not a spoiler, but it, cause they did the first half of it in the trailer is this whole scene where Iron Man's flying back and the huge thing is flying behind him and he says, guys, I'm bringing the party to you. Well, the next scene is Black Widow standing there with this completely confused look on her face saying, I don't see how this is a party. That's the best line in the whole movie. All right, let me go to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on. It is a video game show, but look, we're all geeks at the end of the day and they're making an Avengers video game. So well, actually I was going to ask, where is the video game? It is coming. It's strike while the iron is hot. I mean, well, I guess the Avengers is something that's kind of always rush the game out. Okay. Perfect. Let's have a sub plan better. It would have been out for the movie, but I'm willing to do something like ultimate Alliance honestly, cause that was both. The second one did the whole civil war thing and it was kind of crap, but the first one, I love the gameplay in both of the games. They were just fantastic. I would totally dig an Avengers movie done in ultimate Alliance style. All right, so go into our chat room. There is a hater. We do have a hater in the chat room. You know that every, every big fandom is going to have its haters. Rama's in the chat room saying, fuck Joss Whedon, James Cameron will come back strong with avatar too. Yeah. Cause he came out strong with avatar one. That was some cheesy piece of shit. Uh, okay. Look low key. Okay. Yeah. Cause everybody bought into, Oh my God, I have to see this in 3d. My eyes will be blown out of my head. It was just such a terrible story and just wasn't bad. It was terrible. In one of those movies, you want, I don't want to admit they like just like guys, guys, guys, man, man, please, no, don't worry about ripoffs and who's going to come out on top. There hasn't been a real original idea since the sixties. Maybe they're all going to take your money. Let's be real. One day we hit the day where all of the ideas have been used up and everything is derivative deal the fuck with it. They're going to make Titanic more 3d it's what's going to happen. Deal with it. Falling sunglasses. A technist in our chat room says, this does mean that if they ever do an Avengers sequel or another Marvel movie without Joss Whedon, it will never be as good. What do you think? Agreed. And honestly, given the big spoiler, not spoiler, I should say, but the big preview of the next movie, Joss has to do it. There's nobody who can handle that except maybe, and, and please forgive me for saying this, Chris Claremont, please tell me it's Buffy and the Avengers. They'll just have Treyarch do it and then they'll add zombies. I mean, the only other person who I've seen handle characters like that and yeah, he did kind of fuck up most of the modern Marvel stuff, but back in the day, Chris Claremont was the man. He's the one who gave us dark Phoenix. He's the one who took X-Men from being, you know, just the crap of the bottom of the Marvel bin and made it the top a player it is now. So now I don't mean to start a nerd war, but there are two movies I am looking forward to a lot. Like, you know, the Avengers. I was like, okay, I don't really read a lot of Marvel, but you know, I'm into it. I liked the, the Iron Man movie was good and all the movies are good. I'll go see it. I just don't want to see it opening weekend. I don't, I knew the crowds are going to be insane. One thing Tiger Claw also did say, and let's not forget Joss Whedon also wrote comics. He did write Astonishing X-Men when it came out. But there are two movies coming out that I'm really looking forward to. One of them I'm going to get smack talked for and I don't even care. I want to see the Dark Shadows movie next week. I want to see it. And I know people are like, it looks stupid. What's it? The original soap opera was stupid and so was the 90s revival, but that's what made it awesome. And like if, if they, I'm a little worried cause I hated that Alice in Wonderland reboot, but if they did it right, it's, it's going to be a fun time. So I'm looking forward to that cautiously. And Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess. Just Michelle Pfeiffer is a flaw free goddess. Helena Bonham Carter. Also a flaw free goddess. Go see Stardust to know what I'm talking about. I know, right? With Michelle Pfeiffer. Amazing. I'll see anything to her in it. I have that on HD DVD. I sat through an Oprah book of the month turned into a movie for Michelle Pfeiffer cause I love her that much. And hello, the best, the only Catwoman, which leads me to, I am still excited a lot about this Batman movie, really, really excited about the third Batman movie. You know, I'm kind of two thoughts about that one, but you know what preview I saw that I will be there to see because I love the original so much. Frankenweenie I'm serious. That looks adorable and I freaking love Frankenweenie so shut up. Don't judge. I see you judging. I'm judging a little bit. Stop judging me. All right. Video games back. Yeah. As much as we love to talk movies and all that. We got it. It's all about the Tron series starting in June. We can all agree on that. Tron is King. Yes. A couple of weeks away. Disney XD. I am there. Finally. OLR Avengers assemble. Tron. Woo. Okay. OLR is assemble. All right. Thank God. We agree on something. As long as I get to be Hawkeye. All right. There's no Hawkeye in Tron. You fool. There should be Hawkeye in Tron. You know? Oh, I have to say, I have to say. We got to get to games. We got to get to games. You know why? You know why? There were all these Disney trailers before. There were a bunch of Disney trailers before the Avengers movie because Disney bought Marvel. But they also did a whole series of superhero comic book covers. Duntron style. Yes. I saw that. It was amazing. Yeah. They were epic. I loved them as Marvel. But anyway. Okay. All right. We are the show where every gamer has a voice. Join us in our chat. Vognetwork.com. We're getting into. The Spider-Man trailer was good. What was your gaming week? What kinds of games did you play this week? I played Portal 2 because that's the only thing I could get to run because my internet was just, has been crap all week and it's the last week before finals. I've also had a crap ton of design work to do. So Mass Effect came out of the box. Oh my gosh. I didn't get played, but it got opened. You tease. I know. And yes, Frankenweenie really. Frankenweenie's awesome. Shut up. Zombie dogs. Anyway. Uh, I, I actually did play through some Portal 2 and I played a little bit of WoW, but like, okay, this is what was so stupid. All right. I get in queue and I'm sorry for going off on WoW stuff, but this just made me fart angry farts. Okay. I was trying to play WoW and I was in queue and then while, and then I didn't realize how close I was to a level. So I did a cooking daily level got kick out of queue. Oh shoot. You know, at 13 minutes of waiting in queue. So I get kicked out, whatever. So anyway, yeah, it did take me 13 minutes to do a cooking daily. Um, so then I get back in another queue and we all get in and everything's happy. We're in there. Yay. Queue. And then, Oh, I'm going to leave. Log off. Fine. Offline. What? Everybody leaves the party. As soon as I get my quest, I'm like, all of you suck. And I just logged off for the day. Die in a hundred fires. May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals. You didn't even get, I, I was here, I was waiting for you to talk about Warcraft and your anger rant about children's week. And speaking of things that he's saving that for the FUs of the week, because I cannot get my Drake this year because of children's week whores. She just wanted her virtual pony. Bring your child to your virtual world. Your orphans into bloody battlegrounds and slay things in front of them and have a little five year old wander behind you while you're in the firelands. She's right. That's what it is. It's like, I was telling, that seems very unsafe. I was telling Becky and Becky doesn't really, she's not really into well, she doesn't play it. Nothing to that. I was telling her about children's week and her reply was, Oh my God, that's fucked up. And it is the best place to, when you had to do the five dailies thing, the fastest place to get it done is firelands if you're 85. So you just run them through, Oh, this thing is setting you on fire. Oh, you're stabbing fire dogs in the face and little kids wandering behind you going, this is cool. And then you eat ice cream in front of them for an achievement. Yes you do. Called bad example. Yes you do. That was great. And then you give them a gun and a kite. I never really thought about how messed up Blizzard is with this holiday. Actually, it's kind of disturbing. And then you give all of the children toy swords and say, go back to the matron. She has to deal with you now. You're not my problem. So I'm not really understanding why this is a problem. Is it because you have to make sure that they're safe or is it just like, no, they just have to follow you because they're, they're lonely orphans cooped up in the orphanage all day and they want to get out and see the world and children's week is a time for them to do that. Oh, and one of the achievements is you have to hearth back while you have your orphan with you. So you leave your orphan behind in another town across the world, like no child left behind or something like that. Oh my God. And of course I have the stupid human kid following me around. If I do this crap next year, cause I get, I do want the pets and I did get my pet, but if I do this next year, then I'm gonna get the drawn eye kid. You know, the only children in the game that I like is that little bloodthirsty blood elf kid that hangs out with all the orcs. You know what I'm talking about? I have to kill this guy for my daddy and I like the gem and the holograms wandering around dark wind fair. Uh, Ziba in our chat room makes a great suggestion for dark soccer. Just stop playing. Wow. Then shut up. Picaruna wants me to be on hard house. Rob, we can arrange that. You should come back on hard house. I love it. All right. Hoard house.com is the spinoff show all about work. All right. Other games. Loki. I know you got something else to talk about. Uh, yeah, I don't play a while. So um, I play Call of Duty, my warfare three and honestly that's, it's all I really played this week because I only played it at work and um, you know, the rest of the time I've been working on my portal to papercraft thing, which I'm almost completely, I'm about 99% done with the body of the portal turret. Did you see that amazing portal cake that was out there on the internet with like a cake falling through the portal? Yeah. Oh yeah. You gotta see it. It's great. I'll find it and link my tumblr. Everyone should be looking at my tumblr. Uh, kurotsubasa. You know, kind of a running theme throughout tonight with the, you know, our guests to make Iran and the Fugu question we're going to get into is, you know, creating art inspired by video games. What is it about? And you're, you're basically making art based on portal to granted it might be on a template that's already out there or whatever with your own flare. But what is it about this game that makes you want to have a piece of it in the real world? Because they're funny. They're funny little things. And if they sold those, I'd probably buy some. Um, and I don't count the, the stuffed ones cause they look stupid. But I'm talking about like an actual, you know, if NECA for example, made a full size portal turret that talked in like, you know, shut air stuff, BBs or something like that. I would probably buy two or three. Um, but I don't know. I just kind of wanted to put it together just to try it cause it was a cheap project. Um, although now I'm looking at, you know, okay, I want it to look a little bit better. So now I have to use Bondo and Plex or not Plex, uh, fiberglass, which sounds like a load of fun except it's not. Um, so I don't know if I'm going to do that or not. Uh, we'll see. But, um, yeah, that's just fun right now. You know, I did a portal turret in, uh, uh, Maya as my final projects. Yeah. I remember seeing that. Um, I don't know. It was just fun. So that's what I did. I've been looking at, um, getting portal two for, well, redeeming my copy of portal two on steam that I have for my PS3. Um, I still have to do that or look at it or whatever. I mean, if it doesn't work, whatever. I mean, it's so cheap now. I'm sure I can get it, you know, a few bucks. And then I also want to get Skyrim on PC now too, because of all the like cool mods that they have. Oh, I regret buying Skyrim on PlayStation three just because I'm missing out on all these darn mods. I thought Sony said they were, I, maybe I was just hallucinating, but I thought Sony said they were going to bring some of the best ones to PlayStation three. Yeah. Well, what did they ever do? This steam stuff for, you know, portal to nothing. I mean, it's, I don't know. So I may do that. And then, um, I mean, I guess I played a little bit of the perfect strangers adver game thing. That was kind of fun. I actually played it a few times because I liked watching the, or reading the dream board that had a lot of references to having sex with very large women and, uh, you know, stuff of that nature. It was kind of funny. Um, yeah, that's pretty much all I played. Um, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it. I kind of wish I'd, I did want to play some Skyrim this week. I'm going to go back, but I'm afraid if I, if I dive back in, I'm going to be, that's going to be another, like three months of my life. Well, it's going to be more than three months because by the time I get to about three months, they'll release the expansion. Just over from there. That's why I was like, Oh no, Skyrim online or not. Skyrim. Well, the other scrolls online. I'm like, ah, crap. Well, I'm going to have to play this, aren't I? And then, uh, I started reading up on it and I was like, well, maybe not. All right. Um, my gaming week, um, not a lot of new stuff. I did play Mass Effect. I did. Yes. I played a lot of Mass Effect. Let's get that out of the way. Uh, Mass Effect three, I'm playing more, lots of side missions, working on the main missions. I got to a really awesome part in the story that I don't want to spoil for you guys, but it was, uh, I'll just say some, something involving the Citadel happened and it was pretty awesome. Um, and then, uh, multiplayer. That's the, that's the thing that gets me. I am really into multiplayer in this game, which you guys have to understand. I don't really play a lot of Xbox live games online, especially things that are kind of like shooters, although I don't know if I'd call Mass Effect a shooter, but it's, it's, it's a shooter. It's like a shooter RPG hybrid, more of a third person shooter now than it is an RPG, I guess. But my point is I can't think of a lot of games on Xbox live outside of arcade games and music games like rock band that I've played online that I truly enjoyed. Like I, one of the last ones is like Halo two, you want to go that back that far with your pink guy, but I, yep, my red, but I love Mass Effect three online and I think a big part of that and the community's great. I mean, sometimes I hear random people like yelling at people across the room in their own house, but you don't hear the same stuff like, you know, F you and you know, the racial slurs and the, you know, um, sexuality slurs and things like that that typically are associated with Xbox live. I don't hear it in Mass Effect three. Oh, that would be kind of funny though. Like, you know, cause I'm assuming it's basically co-op against, you know, the enemy. It'd be funny. It would be funny to have people that are racist against the enemies, you know, that's just Ashley. But anyway, if you were, if you're a Mass Effect player, you'll get that joke. But anyway, uh, yeah, the fact that it's co-op I think really leads to a different kind of community for the game. And you know, I, I'm sure it's not perfect. Every community has their, you know, dumb asses, but this game's pretty awesome so far from my experience. And I'm, I'm, uh, motivated to continue to play it online. I'm still not motivated to spend money on those boxes, but I have been saving up credits and doing all that stuff. So, uh, yeah, Mass Effect good times. So I'll Mass Effect three gets a big endorsement for me. Um, I haven't gotten to that ending yet. I still am not spoiled on the ending yet. I've heard, you know, obviously all the complaints about it, but let me tell you what, I've been on this Mass Effect bang bandwagon. I just started back in February and I sunk like 30 hours of Mass Effect one, 40 hours of Mass Effect two, maybe like 45 or 50 after all the DLC. And so far I'm up to about 21 hours of Mass Effect three. That doesn't even count the hours of multiplayer I played. The endings could be monkeys flinging poo at each other, and that's not going to rob what was a great experience. I mean, I might kind of go, wow, they really screwed that up or, you know, kind of say that was shitty, you know, or compare it to the ending of the Sopranos, which wasn't that great either. But that's, you know, I'm not going to suddenly think, oh, I need to go return my copy of Mass Effect three. It's so terrible. And the ending just ruined it for me. So I'm going to our chat room at chat, excuse me, almost at the old one going to shit, vog network.com. Uh, tiger class says, Rob, I believe you have a crush on Kayden. Techness says Mass Effect two was a completely different departure from the first Mass Effect game. But the more I played it, I like how more faster paced it is. I, however, I'm thinking about finding a way to cheat. So I don't have to do the stupid mining on the side. Hey, here's the great news without spoiling Mass Effect three, all that crap out of the way, all that crap out of the way. So all right. Uh, one of the game, I, uh, Mega Rants coming on in just a minute, we got to call him, but I do want to mention quickly another game I played this week, a new game Fez on Xbox live arcade, because everybody's telling me, Rob, this is like an eight bit looking game with great music. It's a puzzler. It is right up your fucking alley. Go play this game. You play Fez now. Fez is cool. Fez is cool. I like it. Sorry. Doctor Who reference. Oh, I see. Uh, well whatever. Doctor, Doctor Who reference or not. It's a pretty fun game. Uh, quickly, the concept, it's the 2d world that you're in getting turned into a 3d world. So you basically rotate the screen like it's a cube and everything you thought was a 2d scroller is suddenly like has four different sides cause you don't really go up or down. So it's just like the four sides of a cube and you know, you kind of, you get puzzles out of that where you might have to climb up a vine on one side of the cube to get the gem that's on another side of it. The puzzles in the beginning are pretty simple, but from what I understand, there are some killer hard puzzles that they call the anti cube puzzles and they're buried in things like random QR codes that might be on the wall. I've unlocked an anti cube. I actually got the anti cube before I got a regular cube. Here's a hint. Read the achievements. How to unlock an anti cube is in one of the achievements. Minor spoiler, but whatever. It's a gamer tip. Take that. Um, so a lot of depth to it and I thought I saw Pete Caruno and somebody in our chat said, yeah, I'm a little late to the show tonight cause I was trying to get one of those freaking cubes and Fez to unlock. So apparently there's, it's like Castlevania Symphony of the night where there's like a, a pretty easy game in the beginning. And then once you, just when you thought you beat it, there's that twist of, Oh crap. Now I have to do it all again, but it just got like 11 billion times harder. All right. Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week. And Hey, how about that? It is just about time for us to go to the phone and bring onto the program. Mega ran video game, hip hop artist, he goes by random as well. I like mega ran cause you know, mega man and all that stuff. And obviously that was a lot of what he became famous for, but airman can't be beaten. But uh, yeah, you know, we played a clip from a splash woman earlier. We're going to play another song of his a little later here after the interview. Just a talented guy really into the art and he, you know, he's made it like a Bobby joked on his show earlier. He got on sports center with a rap about Jeremy Lin. So it's not, it's not just restricted to video games. So, and I understand even better. This guy is a teacher during the day. He's a teacher IRL as we say, and he's this video game remixer on the side. So I want to talk to him about his art and I want to open it up to you guys for your questions on vog network.com. So let's get random on the show right now. I've punched in his number and we're giving him a call. It is live radio. Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message just like the phone getting forwarded to an automatic voicemail. Let's try it one more time. Maybe he was on the line and we're going to try that again real quick. It is live and anything can happen on live radio and sometimes it might go to a voicemail. Let's try it one more time here. Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Boy, I think, I think, uh, I think he might be on the other line or something right now. So all right. That's all right. These things happen in live radio. We'll try him again in about three minutes. So, uh, if you're a friend of MEGA's listening, you might want to tell him we're trying to get through. All right. Uh, meanwhile, let's, uh, let's go to our first news story tonight. Uh, Loki, I may cut you off if we can get through to MEGA, okay. That's fine. Well, I just mentioned the Elder Scrolls online. It's being developed by ZeniMax online, not necessarily Bethesda, but you know, it's owned by the same company and, uh, it will be an MMO based on the Elder Scrolls series. It's going to take place on the entire land of Tamriel with, um, some of the places being locked out initially because they're going to add them in expansions later on. But, um, you know, definitely a lot of worlds including, you know, Skyrim, um, and, uh, elsewhere and that kind of stuff. Um, it's interesting though because actually this was from an article coming out of, like, the latest issue of Game Informer and they had kind of shown off a little bit, um, of the game. At least some of the screenshots, uh. One thing I don't really care for about it is that it's a third person perspective. Now, I know that's an option in, like, the Elder Scrolls games to play as a third person perspective, but I really like the first person aspect of it and I understand that the reason that they wanted to go that route is because, you know, it'd be less of a learning curve for people that are from, you know, other MMOs. The problem is, though, they've made the game very similar to, kind of, World of Warcraft and that's kind of, ehhhh. Well, you know what they did is apparently they licensed BioWare's Star Wars The Old Republic engine to do it. That's what I'm hearing. And it's kind of, I mean, I'm not shade in the BioWare game, I mean, Star Wars was alright, but it's like, I like Elder Scrolls because of the Elder Scrolls engine. I mean, it's weird. Yeah. Well, I have no problem with them doing, like, a third person's perspective or even, like, having all those options, but at the same time also allow people to play the same way you would play, like, a regular, you know, like, Skyrim or Oblivion or something like that, like, from a first person perspective without, you know, necessarily the hotbar and that kind of stuff. Um. I don't know. Some of the other, uh, features that they're talking about also, they're gonna have, um, you know, PVP battles also, some 100 vs 100 instances, in fact, one of them they explained is you take over Cyrodiil's Imperial City and the winning faction, um, I guess, uh, the greatest champion of the winning faction gets installed is the Emperor. Let's try to go to Mega again, since it is, uh, 35 after right now and, you know, it is live radio and, you know, he could be anywhere right now. He could be, he could be in the basement writing his next hit and the cell signal might not be catching. Let's see if maybe he's, uh, come to the surface. I'm gonna try to get through again real quick here. Your call has been- Oh, boy, that's really not good. Alright. Let's, uh, let's talk more about Elder Scrolls Online while we try to fix that. Alright. And then, um, let's see. They also, uh, you know, they're showing off some of the different, uh, kind of artwork for the game. A lot of it's still very early, um, but, I don't know, it looks like a pretty cool game. I'm just a little disappointed with the, you know, third person perspective thing, um, but then again, I guess I got used to it with, you know, Final Fantasy XI and that kind of stuff. Um, and then some other stuff, not necessarily related to the Elder Scrolls Online, but Skyrim, um, one of the rumored DLCs for it was supposed to be called Dawnguard, well that's been officially announced now that Dawnguard will be the first, um, expansion to Skyrim and it'll be coming out this summer and, of course, being, um, talked about during E3, um, and, you know, the rumors, of course, um, that it's gonna feature, you know, uh, you know, crossbows and, um, some other types of characters and races and stuff in there. So, very interesting, um, might even be cool if they have, like, some of the, uh, because remember when they had, like, this kind of a developer thing with Bethesda where it's like, okay, we're giving you a week to come up with this really cool shit that, for Skyrim, go! And then they had, like, you know, spear throwing and, um, I wanna say that, like, the kill cameras for Magic and stuff like that came out of that and, um, yeah, I'm pretty sure crossbows probably will come out of that as well, so it would be neat to see some more of that stuff in there. I mean, they seem pretty creative, so, um, looking forward to that. Um, and of course, also, we talked about this, I think, a little bit last week, but, uh, the Kinect update finally came out now for Skyrim for the Xbox 360 and they have 200 voice commands added in there as well. Ironically enough, not on the PC, even though there is Kinect on PC, but apparently there are- That won't stop people from hooking up their microphones and streaming foosurada! Uh, apparently there's already mods available that have it. And here's the other weird thing, too, is you have to have Kinect in order for those voice mods to work. You can't just use a headset, which is a little strange, but, you know, whatever, that's how they did it. All right, I'm gonna try again here, guys. Let's cross our fingers and our toes that he's out of the bunker, wherever he's at right now. Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing, but these things happen. You know, it's live! Anything can happen live! He did know what time we were gonna- He did, and I- well, he's in Arizona, but they're on the same time as us right now. Arizona's a funky state, because sometimes during the year they're like an hour ahead and sometimes they're not. Because Arizona does things their way. That's right, their way or the highway. But yeah, I used world clock to make sure everybody was on board with 630, but you know, he's got a big project right. He just did some Kickstarter thing that, you know, made a ton of money, and there- probably I saw something on his Twitter about getting a voice actor to, you know, do some voices for his project right now, so he's just- I guess he's just a little busy right now. So we will keep trying here in just a little bit. But uh, Loki, you mentioned you're not too interested in this Elder Scrolls MMO. I'm not, it's just because, you know, I had imagined, you know, okay, it's basically gonna be like Skyrim, but instead of just being in the world of Skyrim, you're gonna have, you know, a lot of players running around and it's gonna be all time real. That's kind of what I envisioned as, like, an MMO for the Elder Scrolls being like. And then it was like, okay, it's gonna be a third person perspective. Well, that's alright. Oh, that's gonna have the hot bar, just like all the other MMOs. It's like crap, you know, so basically you're doing- you're copycatting everything that other MMOs are doing, because you wanna, you know, draw more people to it so that they're not afraid of it, instead of taking a risk and actually doing some stuff that would get the people that play your games normally to try the MMO, which I think that would be smarter since there's a lot of people that buy the Elder Scrolls games, and I think that a lot of people that play, like, you know, World of Warcraft and stuff would be fine with, oh, it's first person perspective. That's a little bit fresh. It's a little different of an idea. Instead of like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, oh, dead. Alright, go, next game, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, dead, okay, I mean, it just sounds really boring. That's why I don't play MMOs. Of course, it's hard to say without seeing the game in action, right? That's an important part of it, is that without really being able to see the game in action, it's hard to judge it, right? I mean, we are judging this off a few screenshots and what we do know about the engine, right? Yeah, I guess, but I'm very unlikely to probably play this game now. Right. Okay, alright. Um, well, um, I guess let's try Mega again, it's been 10 minutes, I, I, unfortunately, it's um, deducting money from the Skype thingy every time I try, it's like, I can't afford too many more tries, but I promised you guys an interview, so I'm going to do everything I can. I feel real bad if you MegaRan fans tuned in and we got to reschedule it, but let's try it right now. We're going to try one more time to get through here, after all it is live radio. Yeah. Oh, it's been forwarded. Oh my gosh, is the phone even on? Mega's phone may just not be on, maybe he was trying to nap, he's just so tired that the darn phone isn't even on. I think I'm going to send a tweet. I actually already did, so we'll see. I tweeted him, so hopefully he's going to see that and say, whoops, yeah, there's this one place in my house I was, I can't stand or I'll lose cell signal and I was standing in it, so there it is. Well, we do have more stories. That's right, we do have some more stories we can go over, so I think we'll go ahead and get to that. Dark Sakura, why don't you read one for us? Sure. How about Irrational and their desire for a Bioshock movie? Well, they wanted to do a Bioshock movie. They had somebody lined up, they had one Carlos Fresnadio and he walked out saying that the video game company and the studio had to reach an agreement about the budget and the rating. So now we have Gore Verbinski behind it who wants to make it really scary, but the studio doesn't want to pay for it really. He wants to do a rated R version, not at all interested in PG-13 or anything less. I mean, basically the quote was the little sisters and injections and the whole thing. I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where four days later you're still shivering and going Jesus Christ. I was going to say though, is Hollywood really ready for something like that? Because let's be real, some of the themes in Bioshock and especially with the little girls and the killer robots might be a bit much for some people. And I realize there's a lot of sick films out there, but this, this might be pushing it for some people. We can have some kids out there killing each other with bows and arrows, but I guess it's fine. I mean, I would see it. I watched Dan play through Bioshock because he was busy playing it and I couldn't play it while he was playing it. Right, right. So yeah, of course I don't mind stuff like that. I mean, it's not the human centipede, so, so that's good. Oh my God. My friend is so excited about the third one. Oh God. They're making a third one. Yeah. I going, speaking of movies that have no hundred and 50 people, movies with no redeeming qualities whatsoever and her grandmother love the human centipede. That's like the grandma's watching the Kim Kardashian sex tape. You've met my friend Carly. Yeah. Yeah. It's her. Well, I don't know her grandma, but she's sick. You're German. What's that have to do with anything? I don't know. You know, Germans are all sick people. No, it's just very strong stomach. Very stoic. A hundred and 50 people. Really? It's going to be low key. You should, you should audition for the part of one of the victims. I don't think that they're casting it's going to be CG. You know that, but anyway, I would see this. I would see a Bioshock movie tying it back in before I would see any of the human centipede movies. Just saying. Absolutely. And then seriously, how long is it going to be before we get the porn version where it's just a hundred person train? I mean, seriously, I think that's going to happen. I actually, isn't that what inspired the dude to make the movie anyway, was watching bad porn with, you know, perhaps, perhaps. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Um, here's what I'm going to do guys since it's six 45 and it's 15 minutes after the time we scheduled a mega ran, I'm going to give it one more try, but this will be the sixth try. And if we don't get through this time, I don't know what to tell you guys, cause that's six times in 15 minutes and we're still not getting through. So let's all, let's all cross our fingers and think happy thoughts about mega ran and maybe he'll get through this time. So let's go ahead and give it one more go here on the network. I better, you know, I, that's killer. That's killer. I'm going to, I'm going to do that whole like panicking thing. Like am I calling the right number? Did I put the right number into Skype and it's duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. Yep. It's the same, right? That's that. That's the number. You should leave him a message. You see, let's leave a message. I will go do that on my regular cell phone because the number will go out if I do it here. So why don't I go grab my cell phone? I'm going to give mega ran a call and I'm going to give him the OLR number and I'm going to say, call it whenever you're ready. That's a great idea. That way you make a ramp fans hopefully don't have to leave home disappointed tonight. So I'm going to go do that right now. And I realized I'm, I owe you guys a story, but maybe, maybe Loki will cover it for me. I will forgive him if he's watching Avengers, Loki, maybe you could cover the story for me. And I'm going to go give mega ran a call on my personal line. All right. So you know how they have, you know, lay away and stuff like that. Um, well, Microsoft want to kind of wants to do something similar to that for their Xbox 360. They are, there is a rumor now that there's going to be some sort of contract subsidized connect bundle available, um, starting next week. And what this is basically going to be is it's going to be like going in and buying like a cell phone or a cell phone plan. You get the cell phone at an increase, you know, a very big discount. And then of course you are locked into a contract for two years and you have to pay your monthly fees, you know, and that's how you're able to get like an iPhone for $200. Or, you know, it's when they normally costs about 600 or 700 without the contract. So that's going to be something similar with this. Basically the Verge is saying that the bundle is going to be $100 upfront and you're going to pay $15 a month each month for two years. And it's also going to include, uh, the Xbox live gold service. So it would be a way to kind of get people in the door, um, to, you know, buying a system and being able to play with it for a couple of years, um, without having to drop, you know, $400 right away. Now you will be paying a little bit more for the system than you would normally if you, you know, bought it outright. But I think that's more of a convenience. I mean, cause you kind of figure that you're going to have service fees and stuff like that for a cell phone. So it kind of makes sense that it's going to be slightly more, um, about $460 after the end of the, um, service agreement. Um, the good thing is that at least it's the slim systems now and not the old systems because some of those old systems might last two years. But uh, I don't know. It's an interesting idea. I could work, um, especially if you get people to do it. I'm just going to, I don't know. It'll be interesting to see how, how that works out. You know, people paying $15 a month, but I guess that's not too much. I mean, $15 is like a lunch, two lunches. So if you can spare a couple of lunches a month, I mean you can be playing an Xbox games for a couple of years. It's an EAD I guess. Okay. I'm back from making that phone call. So I'll guys, I'll let you guys know what happens. I really apologize to the Mega Ran fans. These things happen. It's live radio. It legit could be somewhere with no cell service right now. Just unplanned. You know, haven't you ever been with your phone somewhere and you thought, oh, I'll be able to make a call or whatever, wherever I'm at. And then suddenly, Oh, no cell signal that could be happening with me. I have a cell phone like mine that just for some reason, you know, you have to re reboot it every once in a while because you know, people try calling you for days and you're like, well, my cell phone's been on this entire time and no calls and he rebooted. And you're like, Hey, why do I have all these missed calls? Exactly. So, uh, you know, again, Mega Ran fans who might be tuned into OLR for the first time trying to hear this interview. I just, you know, I want to say that we're not, we're not, we're not, uh, pulling a fast one on you. We are legit trying to get through. We had things set up. You'll notice Mega retweeted it. So, you know, he knew about it. It's just, you know, these things sometimes happen. I'm hoping I gave him the number to call right through to the show. Uh, and, uh, so maybe he'll just pop up during the show. So we'll see. So, uh, we'll let you know. All right. Anyhow, um, back to the Xbox story and the, uh, $99 Xbox. So I just want to point something out with this. When the Diablo World of Warcraft annual pass went live in October of last year, and if you forgot what that's all about, cause you're not a WoW player, you sign up for a 12 month agreement of World of Warcraft and you get Diablo three for free and you get a mount and you get into the beta and all this stuff. One little thing. Yeah. Finals week is not the best week to launch this game. Okay. Um, I said back when that happened, I said, Hey, uh, you know, it's just a matter of time before other folks in gaming jump in on this bandwagon of tying you to these cell phone contracts style agreements. Now granted, I didn't think about the system element. I had thought, Oh, well sign up for two years of Xbox live gold and get free halo maps or a free game or something like that giveaway and all this. Um, and here we are. We're seeing the first kind of cell phone deal arrangement type thing. Now coming to consoles, let me take it a step further. This might be some people's nightmares here, but let me take it a step further. We're about a year away from a whole nother round of consoles coming out, not just the Wii U, but the Xbox, whatever they call it in the PlayStation four, whatever they end up calling that these systems will have cutting edge technology are probably going to be expensive as hell. I mean, a lot of people balked at the $599 price that was set for the PlayStation three when it first rolled out. Well, what if PlayStation now has a way that they could lower that price? Yes. And they could come out at E3 and they could say, we're releasing the PlayStation four for $199 with a two year PlayStation plus agreement. You know what? If the thing is, um, say if I didn't have a system and I was looking at doing this, this is not a bad deal because I'm already buying, you know, Xbox live gold. So $15 a month. Yeah, it's more per year, but it's not that bad. $15 is not bad. Hell, I pay $15 for use in an access every month and I don't even remember. I forget that even habits and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right. It got charged. So $15 a month is not a big deal. Just those little things that add up though, man, that in this economy, that's the stuff that can really get you because it's like, you know, Oh, maybe I'll pay $15 for this credit monitoring or I'll pay $20 a month for this Disneyland annual pass or a, you know, 20 bucks for my 24 of our fitness membership and all that stuff starts to add up. So, but it's an, it's an easy thing to fall for though. Think about it. If you own an iPhone and I'm one of them, I'm just as much of a sucker as anyone else. If you own an iPhone, then you're paying like a $10 a month premium on your bill. It's basically the iPhone tax. Yeah. And you know what? I don't care because my phone is sexy. Yeah, it's, it's a hell of a phone. And I have to say for everyone who's saying Diablo three and well to quote, Vogonator kiss outside in any sense of social life. Goodbye. Just saying been playing well and Diablo three beta and the wow beta and I work full time and I go to school and I do design work on the side and guess what? I still got for pink berry and get laid. Just saying it's possible and I'm going to Disneyland. So just saying that was a great way to cap it all off by the way. Just saying it's possible. Time management, learn those skills. And you have the show and I have the show. Yes I do. And potentially I would another little project with the lovely cell that I'll kind of don't buy the horn. You can chew, but I do love me some sill. All right. Go into our chat room at vog network.com. Uh, it's right. Penaxium. I am a time management pro, uh, shadow next gen says the PlayStation four will not be $699. I was just throwing it out there. What is an iPhone? A little iPhone? What does the iPhone cost unsubsidized? If you get an iPhone direct through AT&T, how much does this sucker cost? I'll tell you because in California and one other state, you have to pay the tax on the unsubsidized amount because that's the way our laws are set up. $699. Yeah. I've been a place, I just bought a new Android phone to replace my crappy Android phone and it's basically the equivalent of the iPhone four S, but an Android it's a, was a Samsung galaxy two or Samsung was a galaxy S two or something like that. Um, and luckily I bought my news, so I got it for about $300, but I mean it's still fucking expensive. All right. I'm looking through some more comments. Our chat room at vog network.com, uh, let's see. Ross deal. UT says, of course the PlayStation four won't be $699. Sony learned that mistake. Think about what I'm saying though. Ross deal. UT here's a way for them not to make that mistake yet still charge that price. Think about it though. And because if they're trying to recoup that cost in two years, that's a little bit more than, you know, recouping like two or $300. That's recouping like double that you're talking, you know, $50 a month payments. That's a still a little bit much, uh, what up G in our chat room at, uh, vognetwork.com says. Then again, they kept the Vita price at two 49, but that sounded good until Nintendo dropped the three DS price. That's a good point. They released the Vita cheaper and a lot of people thought they would and it sounded great and then no, the DS is now cheaper. I don't know. It wasn't that bad cause they had, they added, they couldn't drop the price of the system anymore, but they added value to it by including a eight gig memory card. So that wasn't so bad. The Vita is still a sexy piece of hardware. I mean, I mean three DS is too, I'm not knocking it, but you know, the three DS doesn't do Skype. It does. The Vita does the web a little better. You know, there's some things that the Vita does have on the three DS right now. Although I will say three DS has some pretty must have games right now. I own them both. Ross deal UT in chat says sky will the rent to own crowd be big enough? I don't think so. Again, I'm going to point to the iPhone. iPhone's the biggest phone out there. Whether you hate Apple or love Apple, you can't deny iPhone is a huge deal and I bet Sony would be very happy to have as many PlayStation four sold as iPhones. And what are iPhones? They're subsidized by contract. Hmm. It could happen. All right, anyhow, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a gaming store near you. There's not much this week. It's it's really sad. This week you're basically looking at two things. You've got this really cheap ass game. Um, it's like this foreign one action pack from South peak. It's for games that were a PlayStation, never games you've probably never, ever heard of. Um, that's on PS three this week and then also another PS three game star Hawk will be out this week. That's actually a pretty decent one. Um, so that's coming out as well for PS three, nothing else. Wow. That's a pretty quick week. What's the next like big, big title coming out? Uh, would it be the week after Max Payne three? Oh yeah, that's right. Three and herp derp Diablo three, Max Payne three, the rise of Bruce Willis. I always forget because you know, with the whole annual pass thing, I don't have to actually save the money to buy Diablo three, which is kind of nice. Well then, you know, beyond that, uh, there's another $15 a month thing I pay for. Well also was it the game of Thrones games going to be coming out, um, next week as well. The week after next as well. One does not simply pre-order the game of Thrones games. It should be good. I mean, it's by the guy that did, you know, the actual books. I mean, at least he wrote the story for it and it's got characters that aren't, it's kind of like the, um, the enter, enter the matrix of the game of Thrones series. It's two characters that aren't really in there, but then they kind of, they're probably going to cross into the series. So all right, well I'm trying to load up the Japanese release dates, but I'm like a lot of things on this show tonight. It just doesn't want to work. So maybe we can go to Europe real fast. Well maybe we can. It's, although it's only a few, so you better hope it loads quickly. Um, on May 9th in the UK we have Datura, which I'm sorry, looking at that name, it makes me think of all of the times I read clan of the cave bear cause that's what they called like this one urban, anyway. On the 11th we have Starhawk and Street Fighter cross Tekken for PC and then that's it for this week. I mean there's some pretty decent stuff coming out, but that's about, you know, that's really it for this week. Hey, great. I've got Japanese release dates for you, but remember that whole golden week we were talking about last week? It's over. Well it's over, but you can still kind of feel its impact on the release dates and you know a lot of the whole economical things that go into why there's no games coming out in the US right now are also playing out in Japan because on the Nintendo 3DS, nothing. Going to the Vita, nothing. How about on the Playstation 3? Starhawk is a release you have to look forward to this week. Starhawk comes out on May 10th in Japan, so there is that. And lastly going to the Wii or the 360, nothing on the Wii, but of course things on the Wii are dying down. Xbox 360 doesn't have anything this week either. El Shaddai next week, but, oh that's even an Encore edition, that's just a price reduction, but yep, nothing this week unless you're into Starhawk, which some of you are. You get a chance to check that out in Japan. That's it for Japanese releases. Just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. Alright. Let's talk a little bit about Call of Duty Black Ops and, you know, we talked about the rumors and the leaked dates and stuff like that, apparently they were correct. I honestly thought it was called Eclipse, and actually it is technically called Eclipse. That was the internal name for the game, as I found out. So there's a little truth to that. But yes, Black Ops 2 will be coming out this year on November 13th, and of course on Playstation 3, Xbox 360 PC confirmed. I'm guessing there's probably going to be a Vita and maybe a Wii U version or something like that. But of course all that stuff will be announced later on. It looks pretty interesting. The game itself is actually going to be taking place in the future, you know, over the course of a couple decades. It's actually going to take place partly in the 80s, and then it's going to jump all the way up through 2025. And kind of talking about some of this unmanned warfare stuff, a lot of the drones and that kind of stuff. So basically the enemy takes over that and starts attacking LA and the US, and it's up to real men, real soldiers on the ground to take out the enemies. And so a very interesting looking thing, some of the new stuff that they're going to be adding to the actual campaign of the game, including some branching missions and these new type of missions called strike force, where it's almost a little bit open world. I kind of imagine a little bit like the crisis stuff, where you kind of have a point A, point B, but there's kind of all these different ways you can approach things. So that sounds kind of interesting, and then of course they're going to be adding the standard multiplayer stuff, and there's supposed to be some other branching storyline stuff as well. I don't know, I'm pretty excited about it. After seeing the trailer for it, it looks pretty sweet. So definitely this is something I'm going to pick up, and actually it kind of makes me want to go back and play the first Black Ops, so I'm probably going to end up doing that as well. So you think that there's actually going to be money made off of sales of the old copy then, huh? Probably, because the storyline does tie into the first game. And then of course, it should be mentioned that Black Ops 2 day 1 preorders were actually higher than Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3 preorders, so it's off to a good start. Sounds that way. Hey, guess what guys? I have some great news. Guess who just called me? Random. Awesome. So, he said, he apologizes. This has happened to you, right? The phone died. So you had to go plug in, but we're going to get him on now. Thank you guys for being patient, and those of you that left, well, tough cookies. For those of you loyal OLR listeners, look, it's ringing, you need to hear Random or MegaRan right now. Hello? Hey, is this MegaRan? Yes, it is, how are you? What is up? It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, here with DarkSakura and Loki. How's it going? The artist Random, also MegaRan, joining us live. How you doing? Sorry, I'm good, I had an adventurous day, sorry I'm late, sorry. That is oka- My flight was delayed, and the phone died, and all types of other things, but I'm here. You could file that under, you know, Fashionable Superstar. Yeah, that is A-okay, because that's how you know you're a real celebrity, is when you're showing up fashionably late. These things happen, don't even worry about it, we're good, I'm just happy that you're here on the air. And hey, if you guys have a question for Random, join our chatroom at vognetwork.com and you can ask that question in chat right now, but while you guys get those questions out there, I got some questions for Random that I want to ask. Now Random, some of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio, you know, they might be gamers, but they might not know about you. So how do you describe yourself to the uninitiated? Well, I'm pretty much a gamer, teacher, and musician who makes hip-hop that combines all of those things together, you know, just my love for games and my love for music and culture and history, and I put it all together and make, I think, what I believe to be some pretty cool music. A lot of it is video game based, what I do is I like to use the traditional sounds from video games, some of my favorites like Mega Man or Final Fantasy or something like that, and then create all new creations and add lyrics on top of them, usually about the game, sometimes about my own life and interesting stories and anecdotes, and I put it all together and wrap it up and put a nice little bow on it, and that is Mega Ran. That's awesome, and if you want to check out the music, of course you can visit Random or Mega Ran at his website, www.megaran.com, where some of his tunes are available for download, and some of them are free, like the one we're going to play here in a little bit, so free is awesome, thank you for providing that. So I have a question. Free is always good. Questions, yeah? Yeah, Dark Sakura. What do you teach? Oh, I taught middle school, I taught language arts, so basically reading, writing, and history, social studies, stuff like that, to middle school kids. You've actually picked like two of my favorite subjects, ever. I'm a big history nerd and a grammar fiend. Oh my, totally. Yeah, I've done that for probably the past like seven years or so, up until this past year when I finally decided to take the leap of faith and make music full time, and there I am, so far I feel good. That sounds awesome. That's really inspiring to be able to do that and do what you love, because Random, I gotta tell you, I'm a teacher too, I'm a different type of teacher, I'm a corporate trainer, so I teach people in my company, and that's my day job, but I've had this podcast with my buddies for ten years, and I'd love to be able to quit, as much as I love my day job, I'd love to be able to quit and do this gig full time, but you're doing it, you're living the dream, and that's awesome. Yeah, and I think I try to always apply a lot of the stuff that I learn and that I do in teaching as well in music, so there's always lessons and things, I love history, I love poetry, so I try to combine a lot of that stuff with my favorite books, I will talk about them and rap about them, so it's important to try to use, because I love teaching as well, so I don't want to make it like I didn't love it, I was already doing what I loved, it was just a matter of something else that I loved, kind of taking precedence, that's all. What was the first video game that inspired you to take it to music? Was it Mega Man, or was there something else that maybe people don't know about? What was the first video game that inspired you, like, this game is so awesome, I've gotta, it really takes a special kind of game to take that extra step and make that fan creation for it, whether it be a podcast or a website or a rap song. What was the first for you? That's true. Oh, I gotta say, and this is something no one probably knows, the game that I first decided or the music that moved me to try to create my own music was actually Goonies 2. Now, Goonies 2 had a really cool, it was a good game, it had a really cool soundtrack, and I had a Casio keyboard, and that was the first theme music that I used to try to replay on my keyboard, I still remember it, but I used to try to recreate that on my keyboard, and so not knowing, you know, when I'm, I don't know, 10, 11, 12 years old, that I was actually making what is now considered to be fan art, but it was just me playing it by ear and having that music stuck in my head and making me want to create. I didn't necessarily do anything with that, but that was the first time that I ever experienced a movie, not movie, but video game music that actually touched me enough to make me want to try to create my own version of it. Goonies 2 is an incredibly underrated 8-bit game, you know, looking back, and I am totally with you, that game had a lot more depth than a lot of people gave it credit for, especially for being a loose movie tie-in. Oh yeah, I really loved that game, I had a huge plenty of hours of fun on that game. Let's talk about other games that have really inspired you music, now I know a lot of folks may know you through the Capcom stuff, you know, Splash Woman was huge for you, you had the Mega Ran 9, Mega Ran 10, but it's not just Capcom games, you have this Black Materia album that's out, you have a regular version, you have a remixed version, it's Final Fantasy 7, which is kind of a polarizing game in the fan community. Some people love Final Fantasy 7, some people are sick of hearing about it. What is it about Final Fantasy 7 that moved you to dedicate two albums to it? Well, Final Fantasy 7 was a huge game for me, I was pretty much out of gaming when it came out, I was in college, and I was totally concentrating on school, I didn't have time for games anymore, I didn't have a system, until I watched one of my friends or suitemates play it, and I was completely hooked, I saw some of the summons and just watched about an hour of the gameplay, and it completely redefined roleplaying games to me, because the 3D aspect and the character development was just so awesome, so I wound up getting the Playstation almost flunking out of school playing this game, I mean, it's something that completely enveloped me, so it's a huge part of my childhood, so that's what made me go back, because the music, the story, the gameplay, everything is just so memorable to me, that it changed the game to me, that was my introduction, well kind of reintroduction to gaming, and so that was the game that got me back into console gaming, so I feel like I owe a lot to it, so I decided to do a little homage to it, called Black Materia, luckily a lot of people liked it, came out last year, and kind of took off a little bit, that might be part of the reason why I wound up quitting my job and doing music, it's because the demand for it and for performances after that just became too much to handle with a full time job, so it was just my way of giving back to something that was a big part of my childhood. But you know, I think a big part of why that took off for you is you probably aren't the only one out there that has such, some memories tied to that game, I know that was a huge game for me in college, I probably failed a class or two because of Final Fantasy VII, but it was so worth it, which maybe I shouldn't be telling a teacher. Final Fantasy VII came out when I was super broke and couldn't afford a Playstation, my roommate had one and I bought the game not owning a Playstation, I had a SNES, I was still playing Chrono Trigger, but I played the stew out of that and did time the nights of the round with Quadra Magic and the repeater thing, did go long enough for me to make a sandwich. Wow. It's true. Alright, let me ask, let me ask, we only have so much time with Random Tonight, I want to ask him about another game series, because this is one, this is a very recent addition to your website at Mayoran.com and I was, in a way I was not surprised at all to see this, I wasn't, I wasn't, Journey, a hip hop excursion, you were recently plugging this on your website, oh my god, you're not the only one to be inspired by Journey either, but the way you translated this into hip hop is something else, tell me more about the process of creating Journey, a hip hop excursion. Oh man, that was a lot of fun, I mean, as you said, a lot of people were really touched and moved by the Journey video game, I was told and emailed constantly about playing this game, but I just didn't have enough time, and people were like, you gotta play it, you gotta play it, you're gonna love it, and I'm like, yeah, that's all I need is another game, I have games here that are unopened, that I haven't been able to get to yet, but I don't have time, and they're like, no, that's the best thing about it, it's just, it's an hour long experience, you just sit down, you play it, and you'll love it, and so I did, I played it, and I was instantly inspired, I mean, it's a great game, it's so cool how they just created the entire scenario, I mean, there's no dialogue, you're basically creating your own story and synopsis, and it's just such an experience, I don't even know any other way to describe it except an experience, because it just kinda immerses you, so when I wound up playing the game through Think Twice, then I went and bought the soundtrack, and then I had a whole day, I think I was just, I was trying to raise funds with Kickstarter, and we had got to a really, a certain level, I think it was maybe 10,000, and usually when I get to round numbers, I try to give a, some sort of a surprise gift for the support, so as I was playing the journey soundtrack, I said, well, why don't I work on making some hip hop beats, so the entire day, I sat down, I use a program called Reason, so what I do is just take the sounds, record them into the program, try to modulate them a little bit, stretch them out, slow them down, go through them, add some drums, take out some things, you know, bring them back in later, and wound up creating some really cool beats with the very ambient kind of contemplative kind of feel, and that was really what I wanted to create, so it came out pretty well, I really like it, I still listen to it a lot. It's great, and you got props from the original musician who did the music for Journey, right? I saw that tweet on your website, it's awesome. Yeah, that was pretty cool, Austin Wintory actually listened to it, and told me he liked it, told me it was a great job, and I'm like, wow, that's pretty cool, I mean, you gotta love Twitter for that reason, just that everything is so accessible, everybody's one click away, and I guess it just got to the point where so many people were talking about my Journey remixes that they contacted him about it, like, hey Austin, have you heard this? And so that's kind of what made him respond, and so that was really cool, like, props from the man himself, you really can't beat that. And I gotta say, don't we know that about the Twitter thing, because this whole interview tonight is being brought to you by Twitter, you know, we say we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we went to Twitter, and we said, hey tweets, who do you want to see on the show? And Wilco, gotta give him props, tweeted us and said, get Mega Ran on, and here we are, here we are. Yes, I gotta thank Wilco, he made this whole thing happen. That's right. Now, you brought up Kickstarter a minute ago, and I kind of wanted to go in that direction, because you know, Kickstarter's been a very big thing, it's been this buzzword in our community for, you know, a few months, and it's been big for you too, and I know you've done a couple projects on there, and this most recent one you did was called Language Arts. Tell me a little bit about what this Kickstarter was all about, and you made it, how did the community help you achieve your goals with Language Arts? Oh man, well, the community was just humongous, I don't, but we've done a Kickstarter in the past, like I said, we've done one for, actually two, we've been wanting to create vinyl for a Sam and Tom album, which is our Nintendo tribute album. Then we did another later for a, to play a show with London, at the London Anime Con, and both of those went decent, we got our goals, we didn't get necessarily way over the goal, but we did pretty well, and I decided to go back and try it again, it was one of those things where Kickstarter's kind of becoming pretty trendy, everybody's doing it these days, like you said, it's a big buzzword in the industry right now, video game companies are making thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on it right now, and so I always told myself I wouldn't go back to Kickstarter unless I had a really great project idea, so instead of it just being an album, which I've been working on for the past two years, almost three years now, I wanted to make it a full experience, so instead of just an album, it would be an album, a video game, and a comic book. Now of course I can't do all that on my own without having artists and developers help me out, so I want to be able to compensate those guys for helping out, so that then came Kickstarter, so I decided to try to raise $3,000, which actually would have been nowhere near the amount that I really wanted to gain to get this, but I said we'll start small, and lo and behold, the campaign just ended Friday at $15,000, so a 516% completion rate, and just from the response has been overwhelming, I mean from Facebook, Twitter, to just the guys on my email list, I went out to PAX East and performed, and it was probably right before the Kickstarter really got underway, and I told a lot of people about it, and people were like hey I want to support, and sure enough they did, we had over 300 backers who are really excited to hear the music as well as to play the game and to read the comic, so I think I want to take what I do and just take it to a new level, and that's what hopefully this Kickstarter has allowed us to do, I think I want to do this in a whole new way, and this could be the album that kind of defined me, you know I've done a lot of Final Fantasy stuff, I've done a lot of Mega Man stuff with other people's intellectual property, but I really want to create my own legacy, and I think this Language Arts project will do that when it's all done. I think that's an amazing and really lofty goal, and just kind of cool to have this comic book and video game and album that all tie together, yet it's not some movie franchise being turned into this, it's you, it's your story, that's awesome. That's what's cool about it, I wanted to make it based on my story, now granted the game and the comic, they get a little unrealistic, but it's basically based on my story, and they are interweaving a bit, the album is much more realistic, I kind of take that hero and liken him to kind of more of a daredevil, Matt Murdock, where he's just a regular guy with some cool abilities, but he's for the most part a regular guy, he's not flying around shooting beams out of his eyes, but in the game of course, you know to make things a lot more interesting, there's a lot more powers that come into it, and the comic as well. So if you're taking my story, and my own original story, and original characters that myself and the guys at J1 Studios created, and creating a universe around it, like almost a franchise, so it's really exciting. That is so awesome, looking forward to seeing that in the coming months at MegaRan.com, we'll have more information on that when it's out I'm sure. Random, I want to give, I know we're a little past our time here, hopefully I'm not keeping you from everything, from anything, but we are the show where every gamer has a voice, and we wanted to open it up to our listeners to ask Random some questions tonight. So Random, you have a minute for just a couple questions here from our listeners. All right, vognetwork.com, if you want to ask some questions in chat, let me get you an email question we got earlier in the week. This is from Will O, sent us an email that says, and he mentioned in his email that Random has a style that just seems effortless, and his sincerity bleeds through each track. He honestly seems to love what he's doing, and I just wanted to throw that out there that that's coming across, but here's the question, Random. Do you think it would be possible, do you think it would be possible to be doing what you're doing before the age of social media? How have tools such as Twitter and Kickstarter changed the way you work on projects and create music or tour? So I know you've touched on the Kickstarter a little bit, but back to the question, could you do what you're doing without social media? Wow, I don't think so. No, I really don't. And this whole, the whole Mega Ran story started because of social media. I was contacted on MySpace in 2007 by Capcom, so if not for social media, I don't know if I'd be here, you know, so I do owe a lot to it, you know, I've been, yeah, I'm hugely, hugely grateful to the advent of social media, and I think it would make it to be a little more fun going, you know, out and doing the old school method, because I do that a lot. I think that's kind of what sets me apart and has enabled a lot of success is that I'm not only, you know, all over social media, but I perform live probably at least one or two times a week, you know, I'm out at live events, I'm out passing out flyers, I'm out shaking hands, I'm out meeting people, so it's not just social media, but I feel like social media is a huge part of it, but like I said, I think my leg up comes from the fact that I'm out and about in the community, physically making appearances, as well as, you know, taking full advantage of social media. I think you're right on the money there, I think, you know, I may not be quite on the superstar level, but I think that that's really the key is you gotta interact, you know, not just online, but in person, the old school way, as well. M.C. Lars, I've learned so much from a guy, M.C. Lars, that he's always told me that you gotta get out and play, you know, you have to get out and play. Everybody's got the internet at this point, so you gotta have something that sets you apart, so getting out and playing as much as possible is a huge, huge part of that. Alright, let me get to some questions from our chat room at the vog, or excuse me, vognetwork.com, and I'm gonna go to a question from actdeft first, and I think this is a good question. I'll take this question to the next level. Who is Mega Ran's favorite video game music composer? Oh, man. I gotta say, I'm gonna go back a little bit, and I'm gonna say my favorite is Yuzo Koshiro. He's done from Streets of Rage to the Actraiser stuff to Super Adventure Island, and a lot of those great 16-bit titles, Yuzo Koshiro is my favorite. You're officially my hero. He is the bomb. We know Yuzo very well. Mangan Midnight Maximum Tune is amazing music, and of course, Actraiser. The Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack is my chosen soundtrack for all trips to L.A., just saying. Yes. Oh, my God. It's amazing. Excellent. I'll be able to listen to that tonight. Excellent. Excellent. Let's go to another question from Brakeman, you know, because you're very well known for the Mega Man stuff. Brakeman wants to know, I want to know what is Mega Man's favorite Mega Man theme? Well, I could go with the easy choice. There's a couple that, you know, everybody loves. So Mega Man 2, WALL-E Stage 1, everybody loves that. I love it too, but it's not necessarily one of my favorites. I love Wood Man's theme, honestly, from Mega Man 2. The only one that tends to come up a lot in my subconscious that I wind up humming is Bomb Man from Mega Man 1, and what else? Crash Man. I love Crash Man. Crash Man is great. There's so many, and if you notice, the majority of those that are my favorites, I've never used them, or I've never intended to remake them. Crash Man, I just think it's so awesome that I wouldn't want to touch it. You know, WALL-E Stage 1, same thing. Mega Man 3, Title Screen, same thing. It's just so great, as is. Proto Man's theme, another one I love. So yeah, there's so many great ones, but I would try not to touch those out of respect for how I feel about them. You know, Random, I gotta say, I think you'd do them justice based on the Mega Man 9 album, but I totally understand and respect where you're coming from. I think that's great. Let me get one more question from chat that I got, and I think I know where this guy's going with this name, but the name is I Far Ted, what a great name in chat, wants to know, is there any game that Mega Ran hasn't tackled yet that he more or less has an eye on? Oh. See, I'm afraid of questions like that, because I don't want to answer it, and then a couple things could happen. One, someone just takes it and does it, or two, I could never get to it, and people are like, hey, what happened to that thing you mentioned? But I will say, I have two that my eyes are on. The Metal Gear Solid series, and Legend of Zelda, particularly A Link to the Past, so those are what my eyes are on right now. But the next plan, though, for next year is, myself and K-Murdock, we're doing an all Sega album called Sega State or Sega City, and it's going to be all Sega, so from Master System to Genesis to Saturn to Dreamcast, it's going to be all Sega all the time, that'll be our next one. But Metal Gear Solid is one that I really want to do, but story-wise, that's just such a thick story that I don't really know if I could do that, you know, it would still be something I'd have to really go knee-deep into, like Final Fantasy VII, which is something that took like a year to make, so. You got some people in chat that are supporting you on that, Gio Vedeo screaming, yes, Metal Gear, do it, so there you go. Now we're way over time here, and I want to get to Megurand's song here, but quickly, one last question from Dark Soccer. I had a question if you would ever take a request for Down the Line. Oh, okay, I've taken requests before. Well, the official game of Orange Bound Radio is the Guardian Legend. So could we hope to have you tackle that someday? You know what, I really, you know what, I did, I did a Guardian Legend track. Really? Okay, you guys gotta, you gotta look for, what is the song, okay, there's a song called Comtact, C-O-N dash tact, and it's all about com etiquette, and it uses the Guardian Legends. Awesome. Okay. It's all about rules and regulations for when you go to times, what you should and shouldn't do. It's very useful. Is that, the Guardian Legend, I have to say, is my favorite game of all time, only followed by Fantasy Zone. All right. Oh my God, those are some great games, like, I love Guardian Legends. So you were on the top of my hero list now. Well, look, we got random way past time here, and you know, we got off to a late start tonight, but Random, you know, I want to really thank you for taking the time out to come on Orange Lounge Radio tonight and talk about your music. Again, if people want to know more about your music, they can check you out at Megaran.com, and you can also get the music at MegaranMusic.com. Random, is there anything else you want to plug here on the show, before we get to the song? Well, let's see, anything I want to plug, I don't know, follow me on Twitter, at Megaran, there's Megaran music on Facebook, I don't know, thanks for the support, keep listening. The Language Arts album will be out for everybody May 22nd, so mark that on your calendar, and yeah, I'll see you out in the funny papers. All right. Random, thanks again so much for taking the time out, and best of luck with everything in the future, all right? Oh, thank you, man. All right, take care, buddy. Hey, we're going to close out here with a track from Megaran, and this is actually a really special deal here. This is actually a duet that he did with MC Frontalot, which is pretty awesome. You can check this out at MegaranMusic.com, it's Random and MC Frontalot with Wake Up here on Orange Lounge Radio, check this out. All right, I can do this, where are my glasses, come on, come on, I got to get out of here, let me get out, here we go. I got to get this, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Here we go.

He went on Anime Jam Session Nah, it's all good, Rama was helping me screen the questions actually so he does get props Listen to Anime Jam Session, this is a good show And I don't know how I missed the Guardian Legend one He's got a lot, he's got a lot That is going to be on my iPhone soon Alright well if you want that song on your iPhone or wherever it is that you listen to music That particular song we just played there, Wake Up, that's free MegaRanMusic.com, go get it, MegaRanMusic.com And thanks again, right on from Wilco on Twitter for suggesting it, right on to the management for setting that up And for Random for appearing on our show tonight And since I decided I was going to back the MegaRan Language Arts video game and comic project Kickstarter We will also be probably later on giving out a physical signed copy of Language Arts Volume 1 on CD As well as a signed comic to a lucky listener Look at you I'm looking at the whole album on iTunes by the way Speaking of giveaways, I was going to wait a little while but for those of you that are sticking around I knew some people would just be here to listen to MegaRan and then hit the road Which I understand, it's all good But for those of you loyal folks that stick around, I might have a little present for you coming up in Part B So just stay tuned, I'll get into that in a little bit It's not as good as what Loki just talked about but it's still pretty cool Alright, we got to get back into some news We're running late now but that's alright, it was worth the wait I don't remember how much of the Black Ops story we tackled We were done with the Black Ops We were done with the Black Ops story Alright, so let's move on to one more story and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week here This has to do with streaming service Gaikai You might have heard of this, they're the ones that I believe were streaming the stuff on YouTube and some other places They're kind of that competitor for OnLive of sorts Well Gaikai is getting together with Wikipad to make a game streaming tablet It is going to be what they call the first tablet to offer an attachable console quality gamepad controller There's pictures of this on the internet Just imagine the most giant stretched Xbox controller you ever saw in your life Where you slammed an iPad in the middle That's what this thing looks like Honestly it looks a lot better than the one that Razor was looking at making Yeah, yeah, so now apparently Wikipad isn't super popular yet They showed it at Consumer Electronics Show But they've already gone through some changes with it It's got a 10.1 inch screen and a quad core processor now Optional 3G for mobile But here's the other thing, it ain't out yet So it's one of those things that is coming soon Gaikai is out there though if you want to check that out And it will be interesting to see what happens when these worlds collide with it That's pretty big for a portable system But I'd say if you can take a laptop somewhere, you can take that somewhere Yeah, and people carry tablets too And it's streaming gaming So if you think about it, you're able to play console type games Because the same stuff that OnLive is doing Like Saints Row the Third or something of that quality Through this pad And the controls look pretty similar to a current gen console So I wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able to do that I'd rather have an iCade than an iPad Just saying Well isn't an iCade a device for an iPad? Yeah I'd rather have that, I'm fine with it Or MAME on an Android, I mean what's the difference really Well look, let's go to a time when gaming was a whole lot simpler We didn't have streaming video games in our laptop bags No, we had streaming video games as part of cartridges Hooked up to either a modem or your cable A portable console We didn't even have that over here We had a mini television hooked up to a cigarette light adapter And plugging your Nintendo into it Which some guy we knew had in his car A Playstation in the car We did that in middle school with a camp TV That ran on D cells We're going to go to a classic time When things were a lot simpler And take a look at the classic game of the week Dark Soccer is going to dip into the video game vault And find a game that she thinks Hey, you kids ought to be playing this video game You know, Random got the jump on you though With the Goonies 2 nostalgia But this one's pretty good too Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week? A game inspired by my recently seen Avengers And I'm not going to spoil why Galaga! Yes, Galaga Also known in Japan as Gyaraga Which is... Freaking intro music Pew! Pew pew pew! It's the game of pew pew is what it is Anyway, it was developed and published by Namco in Japan And published by Midway in North America in 1981 It was the sequel to Galaxian from 1979 Why I didn't do Galaxian? I don't know, I wanted to do Galaga So whatever Anyway, your player is fixed to the bottom of the screen You go back and forth You don't get to go up or fly around It's a simple, fixed shooter And the enemies fly at you in formation And you have to pew pew them all before they pew pew you And once they're all vanquished Then you move on to the next stage Yahoo! Alright Galaga was pretty, pretty popular As I'm sure you all know So we have many different sequels to Galaga And many versions of Galaga At any rate, Galaga for me was just the coolest You could let your ship get taken up by the little dude who put out the tractor beam thing And then if you shot him, you got your ship back and had double ship mode Which was always super cool It also had a few features that improved over Galaxian Like the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time Your hit miss ratio, and the challenging stage And if you destroyed every enemy in the challenging stage, you got a 10,000 point bonus And like I said, you also could get captured It was a boss Galaga that would just absorb you up You could shoot it and get it down And then there are actually full on strategies that are based around getting your dude captured That's how a lot of people play It also had a bug that was called, actually the bug would make your attackers stop firing bullets It was actually a coding error I just want to say the double, the whole two ships tied together thing That's like the only way I can be decent at this game I have to get that in the first stage and then go as far as I can Like that's the only way to play this game in my opinion Well a lot of people based their strategy around it Like I said, there's also a split screen bug that was like Impact Man It's not quite the same thing It's similar to the split screen bug in Impact Man Where your game will roll over from level 255 to level 0 And depending on the difficulty setting in the machine It could cause the game to stall And it means it has to be either reset or power cycled so that you can start a new game So in the series of Galaxian And I'm going to start with Galaxian You had Galaxian in 1979, Galaga in 1981, Galaga 3 in 1984, Galaga 88 in 1987, go fig Galaga Legion in 2008, Galaga Legion DX in 2011, and Galaga 3D Impact in 2011 Do you remember, Rob, at the Dave and Busters in Milpitas They used to have the Galaxian, I think it was the Galaxian 3 set Which was a full room that you would play Galaxian in With the 3 screens, now it's like some I don't think I ever saw that, but that sounds amazing The thing is still there Wow But the game is in it, they put another one When you go back to the far back where they have the giant crane And the thing that's to the left of it that you walk inside That was the Galaxian machine So, just saying As far as other versions of Galaga that's come out There's been the Atari 7800, the Famicon version, Game Boy And also it was bundled with Galaxian There was a GameTap, MSX, the MSX version is actually really good Of course NES because the high we had a Famicon version The Sega SG-1000, the Tandy TRS-80 color computer Which I played Galagon on it That was the game, it was a clone called Galagon And I played Stu out of this Because my friend had one of these things It's been put out on the Virtual Console, the NES version Xbox Live Arcade IOS is the Galaga Remix which had the original on it Nintendo 3DS which was part of Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions And Roku There has also been several versions of Namco Museum Which are really way too many We have 64DS, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance And Windows, there were two versions of each PSP, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 And the Wii, which I have most of those Don't forget though, the Namco collection on the PlayStation 3 Is the game with the OLR cameo Which makes it double awesome That is the double awesome version, of course I had to You gotta get that one out there Jeez Rob There was also, it was a side game in the PlayStation version Of Tekken in 1995 You could play it as it loaded In Point Blake 2 there were Galaga Challenge Stages In the 20 year reunion class of 1981 arcade unit That had Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga There was that The Pac-Man's arcade party, it actually was part of that too It was even available on Palm Devices and Pocket PC So Galaga really has an amazing legacy Hold on Sorry, my allergies are flaring up everybody You alright over there? That's why I sound like a 12 year old boy At any rate, there were remakes There was Galaga Arrangement Which was part of the Namco Museum compilation Galaga Destination Earth, it came out in 1998 for Windows PlayStation and the Game Boy Color Galaga Remakes came out in 2007 for the Wii And you use your Wii remote as a gun And you have to protect Pac-Man as he rolled through space The video ran out so we have to hear that opening theme one more time There was actually Galaga, Galaxian, Galplus, Galaga 88 Were redesigned and modernized for an iPhone app Called the Galaga 30th Anniversary That was done by Noki Bandai Basically the app had Galaxian as a free game And then they had to pay for a complete set for 8 bucks But it had Galaga points So you could unlock power-ups and special arcade cabinet designs Including the original art Their world record for Galaga Now keep in mind, this is twin galaxy stuff It was set in June 1989 by Steven Krogman of Boca Raton Florida And the rapid fire setting And they say nothing awesome happens in Florida And it was also in this class of 81 Fast shot world record settings Were both by John Krenkel of Battle Creek, Michigan And I remember actually seeing some of the people who had the earlier ones In King Fong They had people just playing The high score people gathered back together When what's his face was trying to beat Billy Mitchell's score Galaga, actually There was a Galaga machine that was sent to Matthew Broderick by MGM For him to practice for war games Lost had a submarine called Galaga in honor of the game And basically the writers of the series would play Galaga in between writing sessions There was a Christmas tree ornament shaped like a Galaga arcade machine that had sound clips from the game I have the Pac-Man one of those, just saying And because the place I'm reading is not updated since Galaga made an appearance in the Avengers Just saying But you'll say no more But I'll say no more Cause that guy over there is playing Galaga He didn't think I'd notice, but I did Alright, is that it? That's the quote Classic game of the week Galaga, available everywhere, but most notably the arcade Because shield helicarriers have joysticks, just saying But we would prefer that you play the arcade version or the Playstation Network version that has the OLR cameo Yes So that's important too Send us your screen captures on Twitter and we'll send you a no prize A no prize, my favorite kind of prize Alright, we're running way long for part A I wonder why, perhaps the longer we No, I'm not allergic to Sky and Loki, I'm allergic to California It was worth it Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this Don't go anywhere, we got more coming up in part B Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live on the VOG Network, voice of Geeks Network on this May the 6th of 2012 We are live with the 456th episode of our show You guys missed a fun part A Little worried there at the beginning Little worried there when things were delayed with our interview But it was well worth the wait Random aka Megaran telling us a lot about inspiration We just kind of geeked out with him a little bit about old games that are awesome And that's the best kind of interview I want the Sega album I know right, sounds awesome I've got sonic boobs today ok We didn't talk a lot about this shirt at the beginning of the show But you're wearing this shirt I paid $10 for it It's a Sonic shirt and it's so funny because your boobies are right where Sonic's head is Yeah So Sonic's got a big head because of big boobies but Can't help it, triple D, hi Picks or it didn't happen I put picks up On Orange Lounge Radio.com? Oh awesome, alright there you go And the other can of Vimto that I drink This is pretty, I've never had Vimto before Which our European listeners should know of I've never had Vimto before but I'm having a Vimto light and it's really good I've never had Vimto light before, I like the regular soda It's not made with high fructose corn syrup, the regular one It's just with sugar It tastes a little bit like Hansen's black cherry, a little bit It's black currant and raspberry soda Ok I can see that But I like the regular Vimto, I always drink it at a touch of Britain And when I went to the Iraqi Deli today to get some shawarma Because shawarma, there's a good place two bucks down Which you won't get yet I went and got, I saw they had Vimto light So I bought a couple of cans of it And it is pretty delicious Although I have to say I do prefer the regular Vimto It's not bad, I drink that It's good stuff, alright anyway Babylon Market By the way we do have somebody staying up late Listening to us all the way from the UK Pekor Uno is with us saying I don't like Vimto I prefer Robina, I don't know that word Robina is not bad But I tried, it's this, I like Tizer, I think is what it's called, T-I-Z-E-R I just had that really recently and it's pretty darn good Like a grapefruit soda, it's pretty good Alrighty, you said you got that shirt at Kmart I want to get that out too Right next to the Master System games that are still in stock By the Genesis ad it's coming You know Genesis does what Nintendon't But the reason why I go to that particular Kmart Is because it is literally right around the corner from my neighborhood And Shermy needed stuff to pee on So I got Shermy stuff to pee on And I needed Sudafed As you can all tell by my 12 year old boy puberty voice So, just saying So Kmart have that many copies of In the Groove there, huh? They had a Mario shirt that I wanted Alright But when I saw Sonic, had to get it The Sega fangirl and you had a squee Alright, let's move on with some rapid fire news A few quick news stories for you guys So Saints Row the Third, of course they had this April Fools joke Testing the waters bit, I guess they were doing Where it was Saints Row the Third enter the dominatrix And everyone's like, wow that would be pretty cool And so they're like, ah we fooled you Because it's real and it's coming out So what they're doing is they're kind of going the whole I don't know, copycat of You know, Rockstar Games route Where they're releasing this episode Kind of expansion thing that's playable on its own So this actual game will be coming out The enter the dominatrix as a standalone expansion pack It's a physical disc, it'll cost you 30 bucks On PS3 and 360 and probably PC as well It's going to give you, they're going to have like Superpowers in there and stuff Even though technically those were in the last expansion But they only locked them to a certain mission on there Which everyone was like, why the fuck did you lock these onto a certain mission Instead of just allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want Because I mean it is after Saints Row and it's not really realistic anyways And apparently the whole premise of enter the dominatrix Which is, other than being a complete ripoff of the Matrix Because you know that's current And so basically the Saints leader is kidnapped by an alien warlord Named Zinyak and his benevolent race And apparently they're trying to grab up all resources or something And also I guess there's some character named Paul Who's supposed to play some role in there Hey Paul You rock Paul And I don't know Stay awesome Paul, it's all for you It's all about Paul I'm a huge Paul fan Paul, I live for Paul in Saints Row the Third Who the fuck is Paul I don't know who the fuck Paul is Honestly That was a movie Well I know Paul was a movie And that was probably funny But it's just this whole Saints Row the dominatrix thing It's neat and the whole thing it's supposed to be this virtual reality thing So it's going to be similar to the Deckers missions almost But at the same time I'm like, dude your DLC sucked so fucking bad Do I really want to play this $30 expansion of shit that should have probably been unlocked anyways With a DLC that I didn't buy because it was so shitty It's like at the rate it's going right now $7 DLC each was about an hour and a half worth of content What is this game? It would be like two hours long, an hour and 45 minutes I mean I just I don't know I mean I kind of wish it was good but I'm just on the fence I don't know So we'll see it's coming out this fall Maybe I'll pick it up because there's nothing else coming out But I'm going to wait for reviews This is not a day one thing for me for sure Burned once, that was enough So Adidas, my coach Was something that was supposed to be coming out from THQ Also maybe a reason why they're putting out this expansion on the Saints Row because they're in a little financial trouble Well apparently this whole deal fell through because they didn't make it out in time So now my coach 24-7 is supposed to be coming out from 505 Games They have taken over the publishing rights for it So it'll be launching this summer apparently So I'll have to check that out Maybe I'm sure you have it on pre-order Oh yeah, you know me and exercise And last but not least, a game I actually took up a lot of my time this week Perfect Strangers It was an advert game I mean it says right on the bottom the guy responsible for this actually does advert games for a bunch of different things And he's done some pretty good stuff You know what, it was a well fucking done advert game It was excellent And I mean it's a very short game but you definitely should check it out And of course it's advertising the release I guess of the episodes on iTunes Which hey, it worked It was unaware that the episodes were even out there on iTunes I forgot about that show period to be honest until I played the game Oh I never forget that show But yes, it's a pretty fun game Definitely worth checking out If you want to check out the game which is entitled Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now Which happens to be the theme song of the series and is actually what you play through Just go to Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now dot com And check it out, it's a great time Whatever happened to Bronson Pinchot?

For what game? For a number of games I did Metroid Back in the day Just old stuff The last thing I did was for Digimon Of all things Nice I still put together Mad Mods for Grand Theft Auto And I was inspired to try to figure out What the song From DJ Hero 2 would sound like The mashup between piano And Shout So I did that And I've done fan art Remember I did my Portal To enter it for my final project In 3D class Alright let's get to some more of the answers over on Facebook We have an answer From Johnny B Johnny Cage's Ball Busta Move Inspired me to create an athletic cup Attached with nails and screws I advertise this tool of protection For men, women, and everyone in between For a commercial project In film school Unfortunately this anti-hipster cup Was the class's top prize To be aired on local access But it did earn me an A in the class C, video games can help you Get good grades in school I think it's funny But hey I have a tip for you This is not a well known fact About Rob Roberts But before there was Orange Lounge Before there was Under Sedation Live Before there was Rob on college radio There was Rob on local public access I had a TV show When I was in high school You will never see the tapes I'm gonna make sure those Fuckers are destroyed Oh well I've seen some of it I don't even know where the tapes are I honestly don't It is fantastic It was fantastic Seriously I'm being serious here If shit like Tim and Eric's awesome show Great Job can do as well as it does That public access show could have been a hit Yeah you know it's a shame I lost touch, well we're Facebook friends but my friend Shannon Who was like my bestie in high school Did a comedy show on public access And I'll tell you what Kids in high school are such Cock head bastard fucks Like you know we used to get Like the guys before us Did this very conservative Slanted show because they learned that From their parents called I'm gonna name names because I'm 33 And I don't give a fuck anymore It was a show called Open Debate And these guys Would just sit there, they fucking would razz Our show that was coming up Like live on their show and the callers Would call in and like talk about what A fag I was on Public access TV I got bullied on television You guys but it gets better don't worry All I'm saying Is you need to put claws in your will That stuff gets released when you die Unlike Whitney Houston and the episodes of Being Bobby Brown which unfortunately Probably died with her as well I'm just saying Alright Anyway let me get to the rest of the Questions here on Facebook I didn't mean to get on the Tangent but I just wanted to You know in the 10 years we've been doing Orange Lawn's radio I never talked about How much I hated those fuckers on Open Debate and I don't know what They're doing now but if there's any justice In the world janitorial work Jizz mopping I I don't want to belittle janitors Because janitors do an important Job Anyhow Hey Port Chop Answered our question on Facebook Not so much create but Adapted the Final Fantasy soundtracks Inspired me to adapt some of their songs On guitars such as Eternity Light Waves and Aerith's theme The game's music always impressed me and was very Memorable which made me want to learn these songs For myself as a result of this Nobui Matsu is also my favorite composer That's almost if you think about it That's almost the same story that Random told About Goonies 2 I have to say Koji Kondo inspired me to start off as a music major Very cool and I met him remember I do remember that I love this answer From Stan H on Facebook says Playing Journey as I type this I want to knit the scarf and be crazy Long It was a Journey joke I love it Lastly from Paul W Is it weird that when you first Said oh yeah he did a Remix thing based on Journey that I thought Of Journey the arcade game I was worried People would think that Look One more answer here from Facebook And then I got one on Google Paul W says back when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade During the NES and Sega Master System days I would create my own illustrations of enemies Bosses when instruction manuals for game Were more than just a sheet of paper or non-existent These were new creations I had Imagined for sequels to games such as Fantasy Zone or Altered Beast I think a lot of us did that kind of crap As a kid Paul because like I can tell you I'm sure you must have done this too And everybody that was you know Grew up in a certain time I'm sure did this Did the RPG on the notepad Where you drew the dungeon And like you'd make your friends go through the dungeon It was like you wrote your own video game On paper so it makes sense I used to have a tablet of that stuff And I'm so sad that I lost it This is why we're friends because I knew you were that kid I didn't even have to ask We would have been playing that game when we were in the same school Basically I was inspired by Contra I used to love drawing mazes And so that's what I'd do I'd create mazes And then there were mazes with cannons in them And then mazes with spikes and cannons And alien monsters and stuff like that So it was kind of like that It was like bullet hell but on paper Alright Let's get to the one answer here on Google Plus Jim H You go Jim's the loyal Google user Here it is sort of embarrassing to admit This but in my documentary class in film school I made a one minute doclet about my Holy Priest character in Warcraft I actually got an A on the project And had to answer questions from my instructor Like have you ever let another player Die on purpose? Great story Love it I'm sure the answer was yes Alright There it is that's it for the foogle question of the week Let's get back into some news Loki Alright so this is a little interesting EA is putting out an indie bundle And now of course it's getting a little bit of shade Because EA is not exactly an indie company But the titles that are being included Warp, Shank, Shank 2 Gatling Gears, Deathspank and Deathspank The Thong of Virtue And ironically enough It's actually being released on Steam As part of Steam Play And They're also having some other Indies that are Available as well I guess Deathspank titles are currently $7.50 individually And then EA's rest, their indie titles Are $5 each And those are PC only Where as the Deathspank titles are PC and Mac And And Interesting enough though They've also gotten some Hate from Just this guy that put out a game called Minecraft That's right Notch Basically saying What's a Minecraft? Basically EA is releasing How do you mine fish? So EA is releasing an Indie bundle I'm not sure How that works EA Stop attempting to ruin everything you bunch of cynical Bastards Oh tweet drama Well it's going down on Twitter Y'all You know what though it did strike me as really funny That the EA Indie bundle was on Steam And not on Origin Cause no one buys Anything on Origin I think it was a very interesting way for EA to like very subtly shade Steam The whole thing was a setup No I think it was a trap I think it was because they thought they would get more sales From Steam sadly enough Because there was even And it didn't make our Show roll here but there was a thing that Origin put out like a survey Saying okay What would you like to see us approve On Origin because Kind of almost admitting That it hasn't been that great So what would you guys like to see Us do To fix it Close it down and put the games on Steam They're not going to do that Although you know what Competition is healthy for the industry So you know I don't want Steam to be the one and only But you know I don't know if EA should really Be given their own store but I will say this You know despite the cynical bastard I am and all this I will say something nice about Origin this week I did play And I didn't talk about this in my gaming week but I did play That Mass Effect 3 data pad game That helps you with your galactic readiness Remember that whole thing where we were getting really angry Last week because I said that you have to Play multiplayer And I downloaded that thing Well it does turn out and I do stand corrected Thank you Chat Room that's the perk of doing a live show That you can download this Mass Effect data pad And raise your galactic readiness Rating in a I don't want to call it a Farmville type game but it's very much One of those like Facebook-y type of games that You know you send your ship out and wait Three hours and you can check on it and what have you And it helps raise your galactic readiness And I got to say the way that all ties together And how you do that on your iPhone Yet it impacts What happens on the Xbox And you can check your multiplayer Unlocks on the PC That kind of synergy is neat It is neat And it's done It's done well So I will tip my hat Slightly to that I know this is being done just because it's cash grabs Left and right wherever they can get it But as far as the free stuff that's there It's pretty cool I will say that nice thing About Origin but as far as the EA&D bundle On Steam You know what I'm sure it was some marketing dude that thought It would be a clever thing and Probably didn't go through all the necessary Checks and now they're paying for it in the media Just like everything else Guess what else EA paid for In the media this week A big snafu in their rock band IOS game A big pop up Showed up when logging into rock band on the iPhone Or the iPad this week that said On May 31st rock band will No longer be playable on your device Thanks for rocking out with us And everybody was like what The fuck I bought this game and I bought the DLC It's on my phone and EA is just gonna fucking shut it off Yank pull the plug Pull it from my phone can't play it anymore And while that little pop ups going on It's still being currently sold on Their on IOS's app store Blows your fucking mind Right well before you all Yell this out in chat there was a Follow up to it not only did Harmonix And John Drake you gotta love John Drake he's a Great industry guy and he's very Active and out there in the community And he basically washed his hands of the whole Thing and he's like uh We were not the You know we were not the publishers of this We're working to understand what's up ASAP Well came out later in the week EA came out and said that prompt Was made in error And we will give you more information Soon they said quote we apologize For the confusion this caused we're Working to clarify the issue that caused The error and we'll share additional Information as soon as possible Clarify the issue fire the employee you know Yeah because They didn't like that how did this happen The cat did not sneak In in the middle of the night and type Dear rockers on may 31st Rock me that was an intentional Message especially the thanks For rocking out with us Thanks for paying us money But your game is no longer gonna work now here's My thought I have a random ass theory and this Ties back into mass effect You know they announced this mass effect free DLC that's coming out in the summer but they Put an expiration date on it saying you Can get it free until 2013 or 2014 something like that And BioWare said note We don't plan to ever not Make it free but EA's Policies require us to set an expiration Date and you know As long as they don't have to honor it And also speaking of mass effect When I bought mass effect 2 brand New mind you I had a coupon In the box for an online pass Expires February 1st 2012 and it was Like mid February by the time I was ready to play it it still redeemed But that expiration date was There and I was about ready to go through the fucking Roof cause I bought that new Just so I don't have to buy the damn online pass I almost went through the roof it did work But this makes me wonder EA Has this crackhead policy Of having expiration dates Why do they have expiration dates? That's a great fucking question that I would like EA to answer See I don't understand why they have expiration dates I don't understand like They'll do that you know on certain things Like for example Ultraviolet you may notice With a lot of the you know DVD's And Blu-rays that are out there now Come with a free Ultraviolet digital copy That you can redeem you know By a certain date and I'm wondering If it's just because they don't want to keep those copies Up on their servers for you know Forever or something It doesn't even make any sense because you can Once you've streamed it or you have it in your collection You can always stream it I just don't understand why on a paid App they have it that it can Expire like that and that that right there Is a perfect example of why Going digital only is a Bad fucking idea Because what's gonna stop EA or Any company from going yeah we just want this game To work anymore boom done and That's it you have no recourse And really Rockband is On your phone and you play you don't I mean I understand if they're shutting Down the online music store Or they're shutting down the multiplayer Or whatever but how can they Stop the entire app including Single player from working How very dare you EA Or if it's a free app I can see okay maybe this is gonna Expire and a new one's gonna come out There was a Disney Tron app that did that But it was free but here's the thing though And this is kind of pointed out as well They did something similar with Tetris Tetris for example it expired And stopped working and guess what Oh they sold a new version of Tetris You can buy it again What makes you think that they might not Try this again well yet PopCap Who is now owned by EA PopCap did it a little better Because they turned Bejeweled 2 They spun off Bejeweled Blitz Into it's own game but they made it free And Bejeweled 2 didn't really stop Working you know you still got that Even though they have Bejeweled 3 they just They kind of push people to go get Bejeweled 3 But they didn't make Bejeweled 2 stop working At least I don't think and I don't want to check On my phone but I just I think PopCap Didn't screw it up the way That EA did You know if they're like well we have a policy that we have to have Expiration dates why the fuck Why do I care about your goddamn policies Where is this explained that this might Expire somewhere it there's no Terms of service as far as I'm aware Bobby wants me to remind you guys and I even Told Bobby I'd plug this and then promptly Forgot That we do if you are a steam User and you are playing games online In the community we now have a VOG network community there is no L army but you know we've been trying to push things To the VOG network too steam Community.com slash groups slash VOG network if you want to join us there And when the full I joined when the full VOG network launches Soon I can't tell you when But it'll be sooner than you think We'll have a link to that a little more directly And yes I am still able to play Bejeweled 2 on my phone There it is there's the music I'm just It doesn't Surprise me that they would be the ones behind this Yep Alright we're gonna go to the Mailbag dark soccer left the room She'll be back in a minute here nope here she comes Every week you guys send us emails I'm allergic to mail M-A-L-E or M-A-I-L Both Alright mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place To send us your emails and dark soccer Might read them Dark soccer hopefully you have some emails For us tonight Alright first one Robert M here I'll skip the silliness And irrelevance to simply state That I just picked up Bastion on Steam Now that the Mac version is on there And was $6 mid week I mid downloaded this time so I can't say if it's An imperfect but competent port Like Super Meat Boy say but I'm looking forward To it speaking of I know that content downloading from the store on PSB If interrupted will have to start completely Over which seems unfortunate for a portable Even considering its age Does the Vita have this issue or can software Be loaded a little at a time I don't know Hey Vita people will it work Will it blend Are you even listening I was kind of tuning out Sorry Who wants to know if you can download incrementally On the Vita or will you have to start over like on the PSP Download incrementally If you're in download or whatever Or if you like happen to turn your system off Or something like that it will restart where it's at Yeah and doesn't the Vita really encourages you To put it to sleep not to turn it off You sleep it and while it's sleeping It'll download your shit which is good Yeah in fact I keep forgetting That I have mine in sleep mode like in my bag And then the battery is dead Exactly that's why I was like oh shit It charges again It's a bummer they didn't include a dock for the PSP They sell one Oh do they of course they do But I love that 3DS dock It makes it so great to remember to charge it And it's just a cheap piece of plastic but it works so well By the way I almost skipped This email because it said oral advertising But I saw who sent it Dearest members of the online Video game radio Caspoon Didocracy You thought it was some French spam We get inundated with French spam I don't understand This week I caught wind of the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection being released on Vita The very possibility of a collection of games Such as this being released on the Vita Brought the following questions to my mind Who do I have to blow to get Metal Gear Acid 3? Staycare Entertainment This message has been brought to you By oral advertising sent from my iPad Well you don't even get All three games You only get two of the three Metal Gear Acid 3 Who are you going to have to blow to get that? Probably Kojima And from what I understand he's not too into the blow You'd have to get his ass I would see Acid 3 more on The 3DS Because remember they had the whole Remember that really weird There was a Metal Gear There also is a Metal Gear something I can't remember if it came out or not They were demoing one a long time ago A Metal Gear something on 3DS It was the Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater Snake Eater So Yes? That was it Hey guys this is Honey Badger AKA Blade 3 Okay I have to stop and apologize Honey Badger messaged me on Steam last night While I was drunk off Cheap Sangria Off my Ghetto Sangria made from Menneshevitz So I'm sorry I was a little drunk I just wanted to say the listeners will support you No matter what changes you make Also I have a question for you all But I think Loki may have the most Input. How close are we To having essentially gaming computers And fancy cases that are just Locked down by Microsoft or Sony Basically where does the line between high end Console and gaming PCs start Well pretty much that's What they are now anyways I mean it's just Gaming PCs but it's proprietary boards And what not And specialized chips that are made Specifically for the systems I wish it was a little bit more like Gaming PCs but I understand why they have Limitations but it would be Kind of cool like if for example You can have an Xbox 360 And be able to upgrade the RAM in it Like say okay all the games have to Run with this amount of RAM but if you want The games to run a little bit smoother you can add extra RAM Kind of like how you can increase the hard drive space I'd be worried though about those minimum system Requirements slowly bumping up you know It's the one thing that makes people a little leery of PC gaming Nowadays I mean I know but you know Then it's the video card then it's you know The operating system that your thing is running Then it's the space on your hard drive Then you know Then one thing it's another So next email I just wanted to say real quick though since that was from Honey Badger I love that name by the way because it always makes me think it is It's the Honey Badger watch it run in Slow motion It's pretty bad ass look It runs all over the place I wish Listen to Orange Dolls Radio Don't fuck your shit up If you're not you're a bitch And by the way just to clarify I did not mean to insinuate That Kojima is gay he has not come out But if he was it would be okay It would be fine by us The more the merrier Two emails left Hey guys it's Jim Sally Do I have to do the choo choo noise? I live in Canada sorry And work as a party train conductor Recently me and my wife started shopping For Robot Butler but we can't decide What features we want Wait a minute he really is a train conductor? I think he's full of shit Let me finish the email A party train conductor A party train Legit my dad for many years He recently retired But for about 45 years He worked for the railroad And he was a train conductor So when I hear that I perk up So I'm just saying Chichi I empathize with the train people She loves data from Star Trek But I'm more of an R2D2 kind of guy Which fictional robot would you like to have In your real life? Anyway I'm off to go look for hobo stealing rides On the Sally Express Love you and good night Jim Sally Edie cause she's hot Mass Effect reference that's all I have On the brain recently I think You know maybe the The gigalobot from Artificial intelligence Does a cylon count? As a robot because I don't want to I don't want to spoil but there's a certain Cylon that's really hot What? Are they full on robots Or are they cybernetic? Um Cause I could say Angelica Houston from Captain EO That's a great choice But she's cybernetic So are the borgs, the borg don't count You know what? It's our show We'll answer the questions the way we damn well please And your answer is Angelica Houston from Captain EO Yes I want Angelica Houston To service me And I want a certain Unsaid very hot cylon That was revealed in the third season Finale and we'll just leave it at that So what about you Loki? I want a portal turret, it's technically a robot Then I'm gonna Change mine to GLaDOS I want to be her when I grow up And die Okay the last email You know what? I'll french fry you bitch Bitch I will Come back and julienne you I will take you to In-N-Out and watch Them put you in the blender Anyway You know what Rob? What? Aw I'm getting applause Howdy OLR I wanted to say I wanted to call in But something came up as usual Therefore I'm writing you folks instead I was having a discussion with We're getting the manual work I see I was having a discussion with a friend About the future of Nintendo He came to a conclusion that Nintendo Might be better off if they gave up On hardware and focused entirely on making Good games. What do you think? Would Nintendo be harmed by dropping hardware Or is Mario still Mario regardless of what system It's on? It comes from Panaxium So you mean you want them to be Sega? Yeah It's a great thing For the fanboys to fantasize About. Ain't gonna happen Ain't gonna happen Not for a long time That will happen over Miyamoto's Dead body. Literally Like It's It's a Japanese company And there's a lot of I don't want to sound rude or mean But just look at the history There's a lot of stubbornness that comes with that That they know what the people want And that's not the way they want to go down And if you wanted to look for another example What I'm talking about The history of this show. We talked a lot about Konami And I had this conversation With a friend just the other day Konami Konami should've had Konami had every right to be the kings Of music games in America As well as Japan But they fucked it up By not taking the risks They did for a little while when there was a guy in America Influencing a lot But then that guy wasn't around anymore And music games and Konami fell the fuck apart Case in point. Rock Revolution I think Nintendo will die trying to stay First party Well it's easy to dismiss Nintendo But don't forget How fucking huge the Wii was Don't count it out The 3DS should've failed But it didn't Nintendo brought it back So write off the Wii U if you want I'm as skeptical as the rest of you But Nintendo kinda seems To know how to make it work Granted it could end up being a Nintendo 64 Or a GameCube But neither of those systems exactly killed Nintendo. It would have to take Something of Virtual Boy proportions on the Wii U To actually kill Nintendo And make them go third party So I'll sit here and fantasize with you about Mario On the Playstation. I just think realistically It ain't gonna happen for a very Long time. Off topic Here I wanted to mention something since I was browsing Through the Playstation store I find it a bit ironic that the full game Of Ridge Racer Happens to be under the demo section What? Isn't that a little funny? Is it really? Yes it is I gotta pull that down right now. Are you sure? No, no. The paid The one you have to pay $25 for But it's filed under demo I thought you meant it's free. I was like, you screwed up again? No, no. Meaning it's filed Under demo Because there's no content to it I think that's funny Alright Is that it for email? Are we done? Yes. Alright. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us Emails for a future week In the meantime, it's time to get renty Yeah, Fuse of the Week Fuck Children's Week Fuck all the Zorphins Fuck their candy Fuck their kites Fuck the Violet Proto-Drake I don't care anymore I had the three holidays left There's three Children's Week has fucked it for me Burn in hell And your Matron Fuck her too Loki F you to my ceiling fan in my living room For breaking My wife decided to turn the fan on high To cool off, or to dry the Floors that she had recently mopped And the switch broke So we couldn't shut it off So I had to flip the breaker in the house and take apart the fan To shut it off Manually But it gets hot in here now F you to the fact that I'm not going to be able to go to Disneyland In a couple weeks because I kind of wanted to go And my friend's graduating and I'll Get to miss it, but And F you to Jamie because she'll be Rob, you get to clean up Shermie's poop for me That's true, hooray F you to poop Unless it was a really good meal She has been a little drippy lately Oh great, can't wait You're disgusting Alright, just a few more stories For you guys And then we're going to open up the skype line Just for a little bit tonight guys We're running a little late because of the interview earlier I think it was worth it, don't you? Just a few more stories for you guys, Loki Oh wait, quickly, quickly I want to say this Because some folks in our chat room were talking about the whole Nintendo and some folks brought up the iPhone And I must say Among all other things I would see Nintendo going to a place Like iOS first Before straight up Microsoft and Sony Type properties, why? Because the investors have already been pressuring them to do it And we have seen Team Pokemon put something One of those teams Put something out on the iOS Platform already I could see something like that happening Long before the Sony and Xbox thing That was something that was brought up in chat What was it? Legend of Zaku said iPhone Enough said and it had me kind of thinking about that Alright, anyway, now we can get to some stories Alright, let's talk about the dark side of Kickstarter So there was this Kickstarter for A game titled Mythic The Story of Gods and Men Which is an RPG from this company Called Little Monster Productions It was, of course This already sounds a little bit Outlandish, but it said To rival World of Warcraft and Skyrim Built together by a team of Former Activision Blizzard developers And the project was asking For $80,000 It raised $5,000 Up until a couple You know, days ago Basically what happened was They actually cancelled the funding Altogether And that's because Apparently all their assets that they were showing On the site were stolen Apparently All the artwork for the Game that was supposedly being made Was stolen off of different people's Deviant art sites Also Some of the I guess pretty much all of the Rewards were stolen from Another Kickstarter page The Banner Saga And Of course it made it to Reddit And people were warning them online And of course Little Monster Productions Responded to the scam saying It seems we've been subjected to False claims of ownership rights To our concepts The game itself is well in progress And it's not a scam of any kind Thank you for understanding If you have any further questions feel free to ask And then of course since then The Kickstarter Account's been deleted and They've kind of disappeared and vanished away With all that money Well no, technically not Because they have to hit their funding goal Of $80,000 in order to keep that money So the $5,000 that was contributed Or put down actually didn't go anywhere It went back to the people that Never left the people that put it down I still think it's a wake up call I mean Kickstarter has really Taken off Everybody wants a piece of it For some people it's like an ATM machine right now And it's a tricky thing I still can't wrap my head around How I really feel about Kickstarter because There's some things like What Random was talking about earlier And I saw a great piece On the internet this week, an awesome piece about Amanda Palmer's Kickstarter And basically the gist of the article is This is why Amanda Palmer gets to do A Kickstarter and you don't And I thought it was kind of a really neat article It was really good I just If you're gonna get into the Kickstarter thing, that's cool But play smart And this story is a great example Of why, because it really seems like there's some people out there Just donating to everything and anything Hey it's your money, spend it on what you want It can be dangerous and this is why Educate yourself Make sure that you're aware Of who you're Donating to I also really think This would make me feel a lot better about Kickstarter Kickstarter needs to allow the person And maybe they do To be fair, maybe they already do this And I just never see people do it And maybe people should be encouraged to do it more To set a limit On how much money is gonna be raised Because you know When I see certain Kickstarters That ask for thirty thousand And I can't even put my head around what you do With thirty thousand dollars And get a hundred and twenty thousand dollars It's like Well they keep changing They're allowed to I guess change their Goals I guess on their What they're gonna do I don't know As a consumer I want to know where every dollar is going You know As an investor And when you invest in a company There's these things called investor and shareholder Meetings where you talk about the company And the progress and where the money is going But really all that you are guaranteed out of that Is basically what you Slot you fit into As far as the rewards go That's all you're guaranteed And that's my problem with Kickstarter Well then don't donate the stuff that you're Unaware of But I will admit there are some Kickstarters And like the star control thing we talked about last week I have to admit I kind of want that cartridge That sounded pretty fucking awesome And you know I hear about people like Random and certainly The pink elephant in the room There's other Kickstarters that you know Obviously we're well aware of You know and I wish success for them But it's It's just There's just something about it Like I just feel like the other shoe is gonna Drop on Kickstarter any day now It's gonna burst I don't know if I want to be there when it does Maybe I'm just being Debbie Downer Anyway Well I mean not everything gets Not everything gets you know Funded I mean there was the Kickstarter for It was a sequel to Oh god I don't remember now what it's called It was a PSP game it wasn't very popular But they were trying to get a sequel for it And that fell through But there is some interesting Things on there and this is another one of those There's a MMO on There if you can even call it It's called Class Realm it's being developed By Some people I want to say They're in the education System to Basically motivate Their students to read more Participate in discussions more and study more As well as learn And you know it's called Class Realm And it's kind of interesting He says my kids are They're the best promoters As they're going around telling other students How great it is and in my classroom the other kids Come in from other classes from math and science And they see the Class Realm Stuff on my wall and they want to do it And other teachers Also have been hugely supportive and basically What he's trying to do is he's creating this Class Realm thing that's both free and paid As well you can do the free Sharing the tools with the other Teachers and then the paid one You get additional things We covered this a few weeks ago It's pretty cool It's actually launched now and he's taking Donations and stuff You can pledge towards it I think it's kind of neat Alright Well let's move on to another story here We talked about harmonics earlier In the show and I want to talk about them Again because everybody's kind of wondering What are they going to do next? Obviously they have The Xbox Live and Playstation Network thing That's coming but you know that can't be The only thing they've been working on for the past few years Well some rumors are leaking Out about what we might see very soon According to some different job listings That were spotted harmonics Is looking for a narrative content And level designers And one software engineer They're going to be doing a project that's called Quote a unique Motion gaming IP Hmmm It seeks an accomplished narrative designer To incorporate creative storylines Into gameplay on a unique Motion gaming IP Could it be Dance Central 3 Or is this something brand brand new Dance Central 2 kind of tried To do the story thing but it was a little Silly but you don't expect much out of a music Game. Could harmonics be doing Something, I mean maybe it's Dance Central 3 Maybe it's something totally Different. They said unique Yeah they did say unique I mean harmonics Everything they put out has been pretty good Except for that free thing but Harmonics does a pretty darn good job Even vid rhythm may not have taken off like crazy But it was really an interesting little tool I'm really curious to see what they bring With this I hope E3 is when we get to hear more about it But we'll see How about some other news Well Sega is making A kind of a console For you to pee on It's called a Dreamcast Just kidding I love the Dreamcast It's a urine powered Video game system for Japanese toilets That's to be installed In bars and it Measures Urine speed but two different Effects And Hiroyuki Tanaka Who is a Sega spokesman It gives customers something to talk About when they come back from the bathroom It It's basically called the toilet Toilet I get it It gives men Incentive to pee in the urinal To play mini games Instead of on the floor And it makes cleaner restrooms And Tanaka says We live in a day and age where you have to give Incentive for grown men Please Don't go pee pee on the floor And they've had good feedback From customers that says toilet cleanliness Has improved Now get the price on this one Rob There's 130 units out there At 150,000 yen A pop Now just to be clear we have heard About this system before Cause there was the whole toilet jokes I've watched an informative video on this before But what Jamie's talking about is that Now Sega's putting it out there where it's Really accessible where anybody can get this You can get this for your personal bathroom if you want If you're like into water sports or something weird Well to clarify There's been a trickle of information About this The hardware itself is 140,000 which is about 1700 bucks The mini games are 10,000 yen a piece which is 125 dollars And you can get A 10 yen coin box That's 25,000 So that you can pay to Pee I guess 312 bucks pretty much For the box That's a terrible idea, pay to pee And they have home options It'll be on Spirit Airlines Next week And now they have home version options Where you can pay 2,000 dollars to Pay to pee in your own house But you can GioVidea who is a lady is in our chat room At vognetwork.com saying it's needed in American households Badly Yes and in college restrooms But this honestly What do ladies have?

We should have like poop pressure games Ew Ew Ew Ew about the pee too At least pee is sterile Going to our chat room I really don't want to talk about this story anymore But I really need to You're the one who gave it to me The show where every gamer has a voice BlackWolf in our chat room at vognetwork.com Says sign in the men's bathroom Of the LAN center I did Friday night gaming at You claim to have good aim Now's your chance to prove it Okay When I was at the University of South Alabama In the humanities building On the second floor in the ladies bathroom There was a little poem Written on the wall in the stall That I would usually use If you must pee upon the seat Wipe it off and keep it neat There was also Now get this A toilet seat cover that I saw On the top it says we aim to please You lift it up Please I want to understand why women get the better bathrooms We need to talk about this for a minute Because we don't pee all over everything I was at a gas station Driving to LA and I was at the gas station at 3.30 in the morning because you know nature called And I had to go but the men's restroom was closed So there was not a soul In this place so I said to my friend I said Victoria I want you to stand outside this door And if a woman comes don't let them in So I went in the women's restroom And you know I open the door and I'm like There's like flowers and shit in here It smells all perfume-y Like what the hell is this strange new world The only time I've seen like a nice bathroom At this is like when you go to the steak house and have a nice Dinner like those are the only men's restrooms That get decorated where maybe like the little Hand towels are in a basket But fucking flowers and shit At a gas station Check who owns the gas station I have been in some pretty Shithole gas station bathrooms For women so do not Even go there it was The chevron On the way back from Pensacola That's right when you get back into Mobile off the Causeway ugh never go there it's Awful Alright we're gonna move on To some other stories quite quickly But I do want to point out cause everybody In chat was like how many listeners did you lose During that segment we gained One suckas You got told When in doubt potty jokes Alright moving on We should talk more about that stuff Let's talk about Microsoft Coming soon to the VoG network Poo poo pee pee show I'm kidding I'm kidding Microsoft has patented Some sort of arm band That has EMG sensors as well as other Electrodes in there Basically what it does is it monitors your muscle So for example You know they would have it programmed To where like if you made a fist or something like that That your character would make a fist Kind of like an extension to like The motion tracking and stuff And you know I guess it could be Applied to other Parts of your body like your leg or something like that But it is kind of interesting That they're gonna have some Potentially gonna have some sort of device That allows you to track yourself a little Better Pretty soon I'm just worried about how far those things Are gonna evolve It is a device That you wrap around an appendage So the TTP for that How soon? If you don't know what that is Just move right along Alright a moment Of silence please because Like when I heard This news this week I almost wanted to call The hotline And send some help Over to one of our authors OrangeLawnTrader.com's house To make sure he was okay La Munana In North America and Europe Has been cancelled on WiiWare And Dark Tetsuya Bless his heart Was really excited about that game Like really excited about that game And it was in development And in development And finally they just said Fuck it we're not releasing It on the Wii now there is some Good news it is coming out on the PC So you know maybe it'll be on Steam Or something like that but uh It was cancelled they did uh I thought that was already on PC Uh I think this is like a Plus version or like an enhanced version Of the game that's coming out You know we were waiting on it for two years and basically At the end of the day they just came out and said WiiWare ain't profitable anymore That's what everyone's been saying That's something they need to fix And a lot of that is Nintendo shitty guidelines Where it's like you have to sell so many units before You even get like a check Keep that up and you won't have anybody but Yourselves publishing on That service So uh You know just uh a moment Rest in peace La Munana On the Wii I mean at least it'll be coming out on the platform It's a cute game I was interested in it Why can't they put that on like you know Xbox Indie games or how we'll get that on like You know Xbox Live Arcade or something like that Maybe we need to get them on the show to talk about it But it seems like they don't like to talk much Uh Legend of Zaku in our chat says goes to show Why Nintendo fails at digital distribution Sj100Matt says but then again It was Nintendo's fault really so it seems like people Are not placing the blame on the makers Of La Mulana but they are placing the blame Squarely at Nintendo's feet And uh I can't say I disagree with Shall we open up The Skype line?

Cheese? Not even Not even There's some ski ball and the spinny wheel for tickets And a basketball thing Terminator salvation is cool Guitar Hero arcade some people like If you notice over in the corner I only got one But right next to that one big screen TV There's another big screen TV That's not even on And Damn you have HDMI cables hooked up For the console Hey they got a Plinko game I didn't know they made those for the prices Oh Rob you and Plinko I mean it looks like a lot of Ok it looks like a lot of the shit you guys remember Got replaced with ticket spitters Welcome to every other arcade in America I mean it's sad but that's what's happened I know but I wasn't Expecting something like this Though I mean From When I spoke to one of the guys who told me About this he flat out said The new owner has no clue as to what He's doing and he's trying to convince The owner to get in some actual Good games Ok well that you know and it is New arcade so let's give I mean yes it's an old arcade But it's new owners or whatever let's give Them a chance That's what everybody was saying because at first we're all Outside sitting on the Stoop bad mouthing And cursing up a storm about This and then we're like you know We'll give them about 30 days just to see Yeah go back in a month and see what Changes if anything and if nothing changes Well then shit they didn't learn anything Um you know give it A chance We're trying and we're looking we're walking Like the first thing we started Raging about the fact that there's a pump it up machine Because nobody plays pump it up It's funny in the picture that's the Only machine I see a crowd around That's the sad part It's probably the only machine that doesn't spit tickets Well there was a Terminator salvation machine I saw there too And a couple others I mean Super bikes too Hey you know what Chinatown fair looks like Right now Roseville Golfland Welcome to my world The funny thing is that's the first thing That came to mind I'm like Maybe I think this is it maybe we were on the same Wavelength at that time for that five Seconds Rob I'm so glad that the east Coast now has a place where video games go to Die congratulations Yes We'll take that with a badge of honor Alright anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight I No I'm just Still in disgust from Chinatown fair I'm going to pretend I never Saw that. Alright go take a shower Alright There's not enough bleach in the world dammit Alright bye Rama Bye 1877 game OLR or our username on skype is Orange Lounge Radio Speak here Rama He passed along a little giveaway we're going to have In just a little bit here on the show I'm waiting until the very end because that's how I roll Um Let's see going to Some of our tweets that we have tonight Tiger Claw of course sent us a few tweets Here uh one of them is about Miyamoto's DS patent That will offer upgraded Tourist hunting techniques That sounds kind of interesting I hadn't Heard about this uh apparently If this Is a real deal There could be some type of advancement in GPS Technology in tourist heavy areas Like museums and haunted house type Places and I'm imagining things like Disneyland Uh this patent would have a system Where an overhead grid Of infrared positional information Transmitters reads a user's DS to light up floor patterns And potential walkways The user can pick which route they'd like to take Reading tourist facts along the way That sounds kind of interesting I guess the 3DS I didn't realize this already The 3DS will give guided tours Of the Louvre in France And it's really a pretty good The Louvre Yo no speak French-o Um it's doing a pretty good job I guess From what they say That's kind of interesting it's an interesting use of the technology Technically There's iPhone apps and stuff That do all that but this Is a different way of implementing that technology That you know would be pretty stable So sounds Very interesting to me Let's go to the phones and take another call Hi you're on orange country who's this? What's up buddy? Nothing much just trying to reiterate what Rama has said about CF I heard it from my sources a few You know a couple of days before It opened that it was going to be radically different Like nothing It wasn't going to be anything near what The old CF was And I guess In a way it's You know I got to give them the benefit of the doubt that Sure they may have like a Rocky and Some uneven open just for the fact that it's It's out of place for what People would normally Refer to as CF But then again if the owner doesn't like The owner doesn't make a change Quickly then he's going to lose These folks for quite a while Because they're going to go to Brooklyn to next level arcade Where the remnants of CF Who used to run the place are Pretty much alive and you know thriving there Especially the fighting community Let me play devil's advocate For a minute here because this is a question I should have asked on the last call Yeah they might lose the fans that used to go But is it possible that they'll gain fans I mean arcades do this for a reason right Yeah but it might be a demographic That doesn't Doesn't like bode well For that area I mean the way I describe a CFer Is someone who's basically male About 20ish Into video games very competitive So that type of demographic Pretty much held that place together For the last years Of its old existence Because It was mostly fighting games and to an extent Our community The DDR community So to have something that barely Resembles that and Something where the old guard of CF You know are pretty much At their own place right now that caters To that demographic it's like you're not going to It's not going to do any justice right away If it's basically If that old location has Nothing more than just You know just like a mini D&B I mean that's Pretty much what I'm getting at You have so much space That they crammed with arcade machines Left and right Like just about every place Wall to wall just literally just covered in arcades And now they're just like There's not that many at the moment But as I said I give them the benefit of the doubt So unless this new owner Doesn't like Doesn't like Unless this owner actually does Something in terms of writing This course and trying to draw more people In there in order to stay alive Let me ask this question though Is it maybe already a lost cause? It depends How can you just turn it right around when you've invested the money I know of another place Like out in Queens in the city Peter Pan Gaines Is similar but it's more Lopsided towards stuff that you can't find anywhere It's like the only In other words New York's only 2DX machine Is out there as well as like An unlocked X2 But it has redemption games But the thing is that these redemption aren't just like Some Mickey Mouse prizes They're like real big ticket items like iPads And coupled with the fact that It's on a strip mall Which gets a lot of foot traffic from the neighborhood So it's partly What CF is but it's like What CF is right now is at an infancy of what Peter Pan Gaines is already at So it's at a point where Unless they start drawing in something That will keep whales Like myself They'll draw them in there In other words you'll have a clientele That will constantly spend money there And will keep your place alive They're just doomed to failure They're gonna need that type of customer Or else they're just gonna succumb to whatever They get if any Alright Well Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners? Other than Cheating in MLB 2K12 I'm not a baseball fan but The fact that people could game a Could actually exploit a game just to make money And 2K basically denying Let them get away with it That the exploit was illegal Even though they originally said it was I guess They have egg in their face right now It's like tainted that whole competition They're gonna have a shitty finale And they only have themselves to blame Exactly And they basically fell on their own sword For basically denying That said cheat Was illegal even though it's technically Allowed Zaku I gotta let you go buddy Have a good one Alright that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight I'm really sorry to those of you that didn't get through The live listeners, podcasters I'm so Sorry but I only have one of these to give Away and I do want to give it to somebody Tonight that's stayed up with us This late, don't worry Loki's competition He talked about that'll be open to everybody But we're gonna open this one up to just the live Listeners for right now, here's what it is I've got a code courtesy of Ranma for an Xbox 360 avatar Sonic hoodie, a Sonic 4 Hoodie so if you want your avatar on Xbox to be wearing a hoodie We're gonna give one of these away and the good news is You can actually use this with male or female There's a male code and a female code So technically you get two codes So I'm gonna give it to one person so maybe one for you And one for your SO or what have you All you have to do is send me a private Message in our chat room at vognetwork.com Right now with One reason you Love vog One reason you love vog, make it up I don't care, tell me one reason You love vog, it can be as silly or as serious As you want, send Skye Just double click on my name and send me one reason you Love vog and we're gonna pick a Random person To receive a Sonic 4 Hoodie here on the Voice of Geeks Network tonight, so there you go And Ranma wants me to say this giveaway is brought To you by Anime Jam Session, yes fair enough Fair enough, check out Anime Jam Session At AnimeJamSession.com Alright send those private messages into Skye right now And while I collect those messages you have About three minutes to do that Loki So yeah I have to I guess the last minute story Taito put out a game for Akira About 25 years ago On the Famicom and it's finally been Fan translated, so you can check that There's a patch available for that Yeah So it's out there Just Google it Yeah Yeah I was just gonna I was gonna talk a little bit about the whole MLB thing This kinda sucks Basically the exploit they used is they Adjusted the lineup of batters On the opposing team And removed the best players And so it made it a little bit easier to Pitch a perfect game with People that can't hit a ball Or can't hit a ball as well as some of the other people Apparently Some people didn't do that But I guess a portion of the top 8 did And that kinda sucks Including one actually Completely admitted to doing that and They have evidence of that 2k came out and Originally they were like oh well that's against the rules And then they're like well No it's not or well we Stand by you know The people that we chose as the top 8 So they're just kinda rolling with it And I mean if you think about it They fucked up and they didn't program This exclusive mode For this the perfect pitch mode or whatever Perfect game challenge They fucked it up And unfortunately I guess they'll just next year Patch that out but It is unfortunate that they don't just Start the whole thing over again But that's the way that is Alright Any last minute stories?
