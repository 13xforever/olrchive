0	19780	Tonight, May 27th, 2012, a new Star Wars game is set to be unveiled.
19780	25340	After weeks of speculation, 38 Studios shuts its doors, and a major game publisher is sued
25340	31680	for fraud.
31680	35240	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35240	40280	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
40280	43280	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about
43280	48040	video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, with my co-host here in studio.
48040	50040	Welcome back tonight, the one and only Dark Sakura.
50040	51040	Hi.
51040	52800	Boy, you missed a fun show last week.
52800	55800	No, I didn't because I was eating at Bucket of Meat.
55800	58480	I guess that is a little better, but we'll talk more about that in a minute.
58480	59680	Yeah, I was very sad though.
59680	62320	I sent you my support from afar as I was eating barbecue chicken.
62320	65680	Now, for those that don't know what Bucket of Meat is, dot, dot, dot.
65680	69720	It is the Big Thunder barbecue restaurant at Disneyland.
69720	70720	Of course.
70720	77680	Where it's like 30 bucks a head and you get all you can eat meat, like beef ribs, sausages,
77680	85240	chicken, cornbread, coleslaw, beans, and they all come in these big shiny, well not kind
85240	90320	of shiny, but big iron buckets, which a couple of people ran off with one.
90320	92560	Are you a fan of finding big sausages at Disneyland?
92560	93560	Oh yes.
93560	94560	Oh yes, Rob.
94560	99900	All right, also say hello, joining us tonight, to Tech Master Loki.
99900	103720	That sounds like a Southern Brazilian barbecue.
103720	107160	It kind of does a little bit, but Brazilian barbecue is amazing.
107160	108680	Oh, I don't know though.
108680	109680	Cornbread could make it better.
109680	110680	You know what?
110680	114640	Well, they did, they did have cornbread, but they also, the people there on the stage performing
114640	117000	did You Got a Friend in Me, all kind of blue grassy.
117000	118000	Oh, how fun.
118000	119000	It was great.
119000	120000	All right.
120000	124080	Um, we're going to go around and talk about how our weeks were in video games, but first
124080	127900	I want to start off tonight talking about what happened last week because the podcasties
127900	130800	are sitting here going, wait a minute, Dark Soccer was on the last show.
130800	132880	There just, there wasn't a show on the feed last week.
132880	135320	I also have to say one thing for GOVDA.
135320	137240	The place did have vegetarian options.
137240	141800	They had a skewer with peppers and vegetables and tofu.
141800	144200	Well, isn't that special?
144200	145200	It was delicious.
145200	146200	All right.
146200	147200	Anyhow, off food on show.
147200	150760	I'm just saying it's cool that they have vegetarian options, but I mean it's bucket of meat.
150760	153640	If it was bucket of salad, I wouldn't be touching the place.
153640	156840	Same if I was a vegetarian and I went to a place that's called bucket of meat, probably
156840	157840	wouldn't be my thing.
157840	158840	All right.
158840	159840	Look, last week's show.
159840	164800	So live, we were here last week live and no, this is not a case of me being lazy and not
164800	166000	updating the podcast feed.
166000	167000	Here's what happened.
167000	171960	We were live, we were doing a show and while we were in the middle of the classic game
171960	175740	of the week segment, which as you know, is always at the end of the first half, the power
175740	176980	went out completely.
176980	179000	The power shut off in the apartment.
179000	180120	It wasn't just my place.
180120	181120	It was the whole unit.
181120	183080	It was the whole stretch.
183080	186920	We still don't know to this tonight what caused the issue.
186920	190440	But unfortunately what happened is that it caused the live listeners got to hear at least
190440	196480	half a show, but because we were unable to retrieve the MP3 from backup, which, you know,
196480	198720	if you want to get technical, it's not really an MP3.
198720	202500	It's a raw Adobe audition file, but it was all wrong.
202500	207200	Like it's just, it was, it was too much to be able to fix and props to Travis from other
207200	208200	station life.
208200	209200	He tried to fix it.
209200	212920	He tried to go in and move the little packets that were out of order, but he said after
212920	216280	about 10 minutes worth of show, he gave up and I don't, I don't blame him.
216280	218060	I don't have the patience for that either.
218060	220080	So that's like trying to like knit something.
220080	223560	So unfortunately last week's show is gone.
223560	227240	So we want to catch you up a little bit on what you missed last week.
227240	231920	So last week we were joined here in studio by Flaco Jones, who you might know if you
231920	236080	listen to Hoard House, he's the number one fan of Hoard House, my Warcraft show, but
236080	238760	I don't think he'd been on OLR.
238760	240520	He certainly had not never gone on as a host before.
240520	243500	I don't think he'd even been on as a guest in a very long time.
243500	246880	He talked a lot about his days working at Konami and some of the stuff he got to beta
246880	251320	test who has a league tester on the winks games, which I'm really sad.
251320	254560	That's that was, that was the part of the show you have that raw file.
254560	255560	I do.
255560	259160	And it's like, that's the part of the show I might have to stream together and put on
259160	260160	Twitter.
260160	263340	So you guys can hear, you should just send it to me and maybe I'll, yeah, we'll see.
263340	267040	But that's a, Oh man, that's the part of the show you really have to hear if anything else.
267040	272880	But there's a couple important revelations that came up last week too, that for the OLR
272880	276720	continuity, cause believe it or not, this show has a storyline over the past 10 years.
276720	277720	It's very important.
277720	281040	You understand one of the discussions we had last week, so we're going to rehab it a little
281040	282340	bit here tonight.
282340	288400	So Loki, how was your gaming week last week that no doubt spills into this week?
288400	293300	I play a lot of Minecraft.
293300	294500	A lot of Minecraft.
294500	295560	As did I.
295560	298080	A lot of Minecraft.
298080	303160	As in every night I signed onto Xbox, Loki, OLR is playing Minecraft.
303160	306080	And I'm very sad when I see you sign on and you're not playing Minecraft.
306080	309920	Because I'm playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer usually.
309920	314640	But here's the deal, as you guys know, a few months ago on the show, we talked about, you
314640	317520	know what, we tried Minecraft.
317520	318520	We don't get it.
318520	319720	I don't, you know, it's cool.
319720	321440	For those of you that are into Minecraft, it's cool.
321440	323460	But for us, we don't understand.
323460	325740	All hell broke loose when the 360 version came out.
325740	333000	Because for me, it was about, Oh, there's a tutorial mode that is explaining the point.
333000	335760	This game now has a point.
335760	340200	And I just, once I kind of was able to get the basic parts down, and plus it's important
340200	345280	to note that the 360 version really simplifies crafting and da da da da da, once I understood
345280	347880	all that, I was like, okay, I'm into this.
347880	349720	And Loki, I'm imagining it's a similar thing for you.
349720	350720	Yeah, pretty much.
350720	354680	It's just, you know, I went through part of the tutorial, not even the whole tutorial,
354680	358680	just like the very basic stuff and then once I figured out, okay, this is how I craft stuff,
358680	364480	this is how you do this, this is what this is for, okay, I'm just gonna start my own
364480	365480	world.
365480	366480	Yeah.
366480	367480	But you know what?
367480	368480	What?
368480	369480	Tacos.
369480	370480	Yeah.
370480	373800	Dark Sakura is yet to try Minecraft on the 360 and she has not been turned yet, but we're
373800	374800	working on her.
374800	377360	You know what, if I have to pay for it, probably not.
377360	380560	Well, there's a free one on PC, technically, but anyway, we won't go there.
380560	381560	We won't go there.
381560	382560	I played the PC one.
382560	383560	There's the trial.
383560	384560	But anyway, anyway.
384560	388960	Um, so what you need to know, Loki and I are both now really, I mean, Loki more so than
388960	391120	me, both really into Minecraft.
391120	392920	Bobby Blackwell's a part of this too.
392920	397160	He's, I mean, I visited his world, he visited mine, we're both in Loki's world.
397160	398160	Which is...
398160	401040	By the way, you really do need to visit the southern part of the map.
401040	405520	See, we're playing on the same seed, so, you know, but you need to visit, the southern
405520	407720	part of the map is friggin' awesome.
407720	411420	Now here's another important comparison I brought up last week that the podcast-y folks
411420	415920	didn't get to hear, because we realize there's been a lot of slammin' on the 360 by the PC
415920	418600	fans because it's not as advanced.
418600	420600	It's based on an earlier version of the game.
420600	425080	And the other big, big, big one I hear is the finite size of the map.
425080	429920	Is only, what, 1024 by 1024, which for me is big enough, I got enough to work with,
429920	433880	but I understand where the PC fans, especially if you're playing a bunch of people on one
433880	439700	of those servers, really feel a little constricted by the map size, although they say they might
439700	440700	change it on Xbox.
440700	445640	But the comparison I made is I said, well, you've got Civilization IV, Civilization
445640	448160	V on the PC, it's kind of a complicated game.
448160	452440	It's a hard game to jump into and just learn and kind of figure out all the facets of it.
452440	456560	But on the consoles a few years ago, they made a console version of it called Civilization
456560	461040	Revolution, which really kind of, for lack of a better term, dumbed it down.
461040	462760	And they didn't make it a bad game.
462760	464240	It actually is a really fun game.
464240	468640	It's a good way to get a Civ fix really quick when you don't have hours and hours and hours
468640	474660	to play Civ V, because Civ V can go for hours and hours and hours.
474660	477200	But Civ Rev is a really good way to kind of get a quick fix.
477200	481660	So I enjoyed both games, and I think that's where I'm at with Minecraft now.
481660	486040	Because of me getting into the 360 version, Alan has been obsessed with the PC version
486040	487040	lately.
487040	490920	I mean, well, I see, just as like kind of getting ideas, one of the first things I did
490920	497520	after I built a few things was, okay, what are cool things I could build on the 360 version?
497520	502160	So a bunch of internet searches on YouTube, well, just YouTube searches and stuff.
502160	507120	And it just kind of bookmarked a bunch of things that I want to make.
507120	508120	And so I did that.
508120	510880	But there's a lot of cool mods, like industry craft and stuff like that, that you could
510880	516460	build machines that'll do mining for you, and like ridiculous stuff like power drills
516460	521000	and like batteries and piping and all sorts of crazy stuff.
521000	525420	But I mean, it's really cool, and I hope they implement.
525420	529080	Within the next week, I want to go back and give another game a try that I originally
529080	532480	kind of, I didn't really diss it on the show, but I just kind of gave it a review of I Don't
532480	534120	Get It, LOL.
534120	536000	And that's the game Terraria.
536000	538760	Because supposedly that's the 2D Minecraft.
538760	542840	So now that I get Minecraft, I'm going to try Terraria again and I'll let you guys know
542840	545920	next week how that goes, because that's something else I want to explore.
545920	552440	By the way, since we did Bring It Up, Civ 5 is on sale on Steam today for $7.49.
552440	553440	Thank you.
553440	555920	And I was going to actually call that out from our chat room, which I have yet to mention.
555920	556920	Sorry, guys.
556920	557920	Vognetwork.com.
557920	559760	I just want to get you caught up on last week.
559760	564080	Vognetwork.com, it's right there on the page, is the chat room.
564080	566640	And we have Act Deft giving the FYI on that as well.
566640	569320	And Civ 5 for $7.49, that's a steal.
569320	570480	That's an absolute steal.
570480	575200	They're pushing that expansion pack coming out in a month, I bet, but I love Civ 5.
575200	576200	It's totally worth it.
576200	578040	Well, my friend's been playing it on Xbox.
578040	579120	Becky's husband.
579120	580440	There is no Civ 5 on Xbox.
580440	584160	You must be thinking Civilization Revolution, which is the game I mentioned a minute ago.
584160	587160	But I've been watching that and it actually was pretty cool, except you know, that's totally
587160	588160	not my thing.
588160	591320	Just like Minecraft 360, it's a good way to get your feet wet with the series.
591320	592320	All right.
592320	593820	Other things you might have missed last week.
593820	596900	We had an exclusive story, but we're going to repeat that at the top of tonight's show,
596900	599040	so we'll come back to that in a minute.
599040	600560	You guys missed a lot last week.
600560	605800	And there was also the Classic Game of the Week, just for housekeeping purposes.
605800	611420	We decided because Jim was not able to finish his Classic Game of the Week, we're not going
611420	614520	to have that officially be the Classic Game of the Week.
614520	618280	We are going to invite him back on the show, whenever he wants to come back as a fourth
618280	620880	host even, and let him finish what he started.
620880	624240	Jamie said she would kindly give over the Classic Game of the Week segment, whatever
624240	627600	week he comes back, so he can finish what he started that night.
627600	631160	So just, and if you didn't, if you don't know what the Classic Game is, well I have to leave
631160	632160	some suspense.
632160	636120	So you'll just have to figure it out in a later week.
636120	637480	I think that was about it.
637480	641520	I think that was all the stuff that came up last week that was important and worth mentioning.
641520	647800	So let's get into, how was your gaming, oh, VOG Network, I want to say really quickly
647800	650320	about VOG Network.
650320	656720	Friday night, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern, the next phase of VOG will be revealed.
656720	663440	Yes, I'm teasing a teaser, but I think if you guys are really interested in what we're
663440	667280	up to and what the full vision is here, and I know there's a lot of people out there that
667280	672560	still have questions like, why did you leave where you were at before just to do yet another
672560	673840	radio network?
673840	678520	There's more to it than a radio network and some of that is going to be unveiled on Friday,
678520	679740	so I'm really excited about that.
679740	685240	So again, Friday, 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern right here at vognetwork.com.
685240	688920	We're supposed to have an interview at 6.30 tonight and I teased that on the Twitter a
688920	689920	little bit.
689920	695300	Her name is Susan, she's with the website hackedonxbox.com and we're going to talk a
695300	700160	little bit about what, she's basically the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week
700160	706200	and I say that with love, I love Nancy Drew, but she really got down to the bottom of what
706200	713720	is really going on on Xbox 360 with what they're not calling Xbox hackings, but Xbox jackings
713720	716680	and we'll talk a little bit about the difference and why that is.
716680	721320	Hopefully we get her on the show here in 10 minutes, unfortunately just, we don't see
721320	725480	her, it's kind of like that interview we had two weeks ago where the dude disappeared for
725480	726480	a little bit.
726480	731500	I haven't heard from her on Twitter or Skype today, these things happen, especially because
731500	734920	her piece got picked up by a lot of the big gaming blogs.
734920	739040	She might just be very popular and in demand right now, so we're going to see if we can't
739040	740040	get her on.
740040	743640	If we can't, we'll just roll it over to a later week when she can come on, but we'll
743640	745320	check in with you guys in 10 minutes.
745320	747640	Alright, for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
747640	749780	DarkSakura, you've been out for a week, how was your gaming weeks?
749780	752320	I've actually played stuff.
752320	758040	Played lots of things, although I still haven't played Mass Effect, I'm very sorry.
758040	762240	I played a lot of Portal 2 while I was out.
762240	766000	I've been playing Words with Friends because I figured since I already paid for it, Zynga
766000	768360	already got my damn money.
768360	773240	And honestly, while I'm at work, it's kind of something I can keep up with Dan, so I've
773240	775760	been keeping up with that.
775760	778680	I did try to play Draw Something, but I'm using the free version just because I want
778680	780360	to see what all the fuss is about.
780360	783800	It's cute, I like it.
783800	788360	I am playing, I started playing a lot more fractal.
788360	797160	In fact, if you look on my Facebook fan page for Jamie Summers, I posted a screencap of
797160	799120	what fractal looks like.
799120	803160	And I'm going to be actually showcasing a different game on Steam that I'm playing so
803160	805320	that everyone can see what it is.
805320	809080	I'm going to be starting Fallout New Vegas again, just starting over from scratch.
809080	813260	I've been playing Droplets, I got Droplets on iPhone, which is kind of weird and not
813260	815560	as fun as playing it on Steam.
815560	819400	And I've played some WoW, but I've really been playing Diablo 3.
819400	822320	I played a crap ton of it last night.
822320	825680	And I was like, you know what, this is like playing Ragnarok online without people.
825680	827560	This is great.
827560	830560	So I've really been getting into Diablo.
830560	833520	Because it was free, because I signed over the blood pact.
833520	836120	It was free with a big footnote.
836120	837120	Yeah.
837120	842440	Well, as you saw, when I told my friend on Facebook that it was free, he said, great
842440	845440	Hal, Dan said she signed her life away.
845440	846440	For a year.
846440	847440	For a year.
847440	849880	Which, you know, was what, a third over?
849880	851680	So it's not bad.
851680	859760	But yeah, I think everyone's playing Diablo, because I'll log on to WoW and say, hey, where's
859760	860760	all my peeps at?
860760	866160	And they're all on Diablo, and whatever.
866160	870600	And then I've been playing some more Puzzle Bobble again, best move.
870600	874400	Because I really love that game, and it's really great to play when...
874400	876400	I don't know what it is, but when I'm sick.
876400	880280	And I'm over my cold, guys, I just sound like I'm on the tail of it.
880280	881560	But I slept for two days.
881560	883140	It was glorious.
883140	886320	I was really sick two weeks ago, you might remember, and I'm still coughing.
886320	887320	I'm still having coughing.
887320	888320	People at my work.
888320	890280	And see, I had that sinus attack.
890280	891900	And then I had it bad at Disneyland.
891900	893800	And then I came back to a full blown cold.
893800	894800	I ran a fever.
894800	895800	You know what I just remembered?
895800	897920	I have coffee brewing in the kitchen.
897920	898920	Bye.
898920	900920	Yes, you do.
900920	907880	Anyway, so when I'm sick, it's like I don't really have this mental focus.
907880	913640	However, I think when my brain shuts down, I become really fantastic at puzzle games.
913640	918360	And that was like clearing out levels on Fractal that I had never been able to pass before.
918360	921000	And for anyone, it's not an easy game.
921000	925880	It really is not very easy, because you've got so much to keep in mind with the direction
925880	927520	of how your little things move.
927520	931200	But I still tell everyone, get Fractal, it is worth the money.
931200	933640	It is such a fun game.
933640	937040	Again, it's called Fractal, make blooms, not war.
937040	943080	And I hope that they pay me for my sponsorship, because I am doing that for free.
943080	951400	And then I'm also supposed to be sitting down, because our friend loaned us the Street Fighter
951400	952880	cross Tekken.
952880	958320	And I'm kind of afraid to try it, because I do not want to play against the Mega Man.
958320	961800	But I'm thinking about it, so meh.
961800	964640	Did you play anything other than Minecraft?
964640	968720	I play Minecraft, lots of Minecraft.
968720	971120	Let's see, what did I do this week in Minecraft?
971120	973280	I think I finished my rail system.
973280	976080	Now we mentioned it on Bobby's show, but I don't think we mentioned it here.
976080	978420	Your Minecraft level is intricate.
978420	982120	You built a tunnel underneath the ocean, I don't even know how the hell you did that,
982120	983240	or underneath a lake.
983240	987640	You built a tunnel under the lake, and you have a glass ceiling on said tunnel, so that
987640	989660	you can look up and see the water.
989660	992440	And you built this entire tram system.
992440	994600	He built the deep run tram.
994600	995600	He did.
995600	1002800	So when we are talking that Loki started playing Minecraft, we're not fucking around.
1002800	1004960	He is really into Minecraft.
1004960	1009600	And what's great is when I go into Loki's world, I can hear Nellie laughing in the background
1009600	1011860	whenever something stupid happens.
1011860	1013760	So she's got to be into this a little bit too, right?
1013760	1015260	She's not into it at all.
1015260	1018600	She keeps asking me, aren't you sick of this game yet?
1018600	1021420	What's the point of this game?
1021420	1023420	And I'm just like, there is no point.
1023420	1024920	It's just like Legos.
1024920	1025920	But yeah.
1025920	1026920	It's Legos.
1026920	1027920	For men!
1027920	1028920	And girls.
1028920	1031000	I have been playing Minecraft more than Call of Duty this week.
1031000	1032980	I did play Call of Duty though.
1032980	1039140	We finally got to check out the new, well they're maps technically for the new game
1039140	1042800	type face off, however you can use them for anything.
1042800	1047200	So we've been playing on them for just our deathmatch maps since we only have like two
1047200	1050040	to four people usually playing at a time.
1050040	1051440	Well three to four people.
1051440	1055500	But you know, it's perfect for what we use it for.
1055500	1059800	So we've been actually enjoying those quite a bit.
1059800	1067140	However one of the new maps, Ground, it's quite apparent that the spawn points in there
1067140	1069160	aren't that random.
1069160	1072900	And like there was one time I literally, I killed somebody and they spawned again right
1072900	1073900	in front of me.
1073900	1077500	So I knifed them to death and then they spawned again right in the next room.
1077500	1082720	It's like wow, that's pretty close.
1082720	1085160	See other things, well let's go back to Minecraft.
1085160	1088840	So the first thing I did in Minecraft this week is I explored the whole map, or as much
1088840	1093800	of the map as I could because I was looking for a spot to dig with dynamite.
1093800	1094800	And that's what I did.
1094800	1097240	Because I duped a bunch of dynamite and that kind of stuff.
1097240	1103120	We also made a portal to the Nether and went there and I got my glowstone and my, I don't
1103120	1104120	remember what it's called.
1104120	1108940	It's the dirt that's all in the ender that you can set on fire and that will burn forever.
1108940	1110400	So that's kind of cool.
1110400	1113960	And there's some other like sand, soul sand or something that makes people walk slow.
1113960	1118140	I don't really know what the point would that be for.
1118140	1119440	So I have that.
1119440	1126180	And then, oh so I started digging with dynamite and I did that and unfortunately I did make
1126180	1130800	it all the way down to the bedrock but I got killed by lava many, many, many times.
1130800	1137200	So I decided to go ahead and build a roof over the top of the giant hole that I made.
1137200	1141280	So I did that and now it's a glass top roof so you can walk over it and see this giant
1141280	1143840	hole all the way down to the bedrock.
1143840	1147520	And I'm slowly hollowing it out for I don't know what purpose.
1147520	1148520	I'm just doing it right now.
1148520	1149520	You should fill it with candy.
1149520	1150520	They don't have candy.
1150520	1153040	I can't fill it with candy yet.
1153040	1154400	That's why Minecraft isn't a 10.
1154400	1155400	It's only about a nine.
1155400	1158360	You should fill it with whatever those things that try to kill you are.
1158360	1163720	There's no, there's no, um, there's no coffee and there's no candy, but there are, well
1163720	1164720	see you're Jewish.
1164720	1168040	I was going to say there are pork chops, which is pretty exciting, but, oh yes, there is
1168040	1169040	cake.
1169040	1173160	Fill it, fill it with cake, fill it with cake and sheep.
1173160	1174320	Like throw sheep down the hole.
1174320	1179400	You apparently can, however, I don't know if you've noticed, if you pick up an egg,
1179400	1181560	have you tried throwing an egg?
1181560	1182840	It'll create a chicken.
1182840	1183840	Does it really?
1183840	1184840	No, I didn't try that.
1184840	1186760	You throw an egg, it creates a chicken.
1186760	1192840	So I've seen an actual video where someone took eggs, well see they probably didn't dupe
1192840	1195960	them like I would, but okay, let's say I duplicate all of them.
1195960	1202080	So I have stacks of 64 eggs and you put that in one of the dispensers, you maybe put those
1202080	1206520	in like say 10 dispensers or whatever, and you turn them all on and then all of a sudden
1206520	1211920	you have hundreds of chickens, which then I can automate a system to kill all of those
1211920	1212920	chickens.
1212920	1216040	Wait, are you talking about an automated death machine for chickens?
1216040	1219460	Yes, I've actually thought of that.
1219460	1220460	Nothing is safe.
1220460	1225360	I've thought of that for the pigs, but, and I actually built a trap to catch the pigs,
1225360	1231280	but it doesn't seem to work too well because they, when you sleep or whatever, the animals
1231280	1237400	respawn and they don't get, they don't stay in the pen that I made, which is kind of lame.
1237400	1240920	But yeah, then Bobby helped me dig out.
1240920	1246400	See basically I dug down in that initial cave system that I found until I got to the furthest
1246400	1251520	point away, and then I dug straight up into, he's all, you know you're digging into the
1251520	1252520	ocean dude.
1252520	1257440	I'm like, eh, we'll worry about that when we get to it, and so we did.
1257440	1261240	And ended up, it was kind of cool, I started by digging a hole up through the top.
1261240	1268000	Swam to the top, and then basically built a barrier around where my staircase was, and
1268000	1272100	you know, if you fill it in with anything, dirt or whatever, and then you dig it back
1272100	1273720	out again, the water's gone.
1273720	1274720	So that's how I did it.
1274720	1279840	I just dug to this, I basically created a stack, boxed it all in and filled it in and
1279840	1280840	dug it back out again.
1280840	1283760	And that's how I got a thing through the ocean.
1283760	1284760	Tacos.
1284760	1288600	And then I tried putting a glass top ceiling in one of the caves, you know, under the ocean.
1288600	1292240	And I kept drowning myself, though, when I did that, so I said, eh, fuck that, I'm not
1292240	1293240	doing that.
1293240	1294240	Now, at least.
1294240	1296240	So that's what I did.
1296240	1300600	I also played Pocket Edition, Pocket Edition's pretty fun.
1300600	1301600	More Minecraft.
1301600	1302600	My gaming week.
1302600	1307480	I didn't play a lot of new stuff, mostly because I've been content playing Diablo 3.
1307480	1310660	Mass Effect 3's got a big multiplayer thing going on this weekend, and I don't know what
1310660	1316080	made me think I would even remotely possibly hit that goal of promoting three people during
1316080	1319960	the weekend, but, you know, I thought I'd try.
1319960	1324840	And yeah, I don't think I've really played a lot else other than that in Minecraft.
1324840	1327000	A little bit of Minecraft, too, not as much as Matt.
1327000	1332080	And the stuff I build isn't nearly as intricate, but I'm just lucky if I can kind of get down
1332080	1334360	to finding lava without getting killed.
1334360	1337400	I think I'm going to try playing a little more often in peaceful mode.
1337400	1338400	All right.
1338400	1341800	So here's the part where I'm going to get judged by some people, and I'm going to get
1341800	1344400	congratulated by others.
1344400	1345400	I bought an iPad.
1345400	1350000	Yeah, I bought one of the new iPads, and, you know, I wanted one.
1350000	1352240	I'm really not going to give you any better reason than that.
1352240	1353240	I wanted one.
1353240	1358720	I'm in a slightly different position at work now where I might be doing some more travel-oriented
1358720	1362840	things again, and I thought the iPad would come in very handy for that because my laptop
1362840	1366880	is kind of getting a little bit old, and there is some stuff you can do with an iPad, and
1366880	1369960	some of that does include remote taping and broadcasting a podcast.
1369960	1371400	I've thought of that, too.
1371400	1374840	But in the meantime, before I get to all that busy, busy work stuff, I'm doing fun stuff
1374840	1376920	on the iPad, like playing games.
1376920	1383440	And one of the games that I got addicted to is Temple Run, and it's one of those games
1383440	1385440	that's really stupidly simple in design.
1385440	1390400	It's like one of the, the game itself could have been on the Atari 2600 for all I know.
1390400	1394640	It's like you swipe up to jump, you swipe down to slide, left and right to go left and
1394640	1399120	right, and the whole kitchen of the game is you're running fast to escape these monkeys
1399120	1403040	that if they catch you, they're going to eat you because I guess you took their treasure
1403040	1404200	or whatever.
1404200	1409080	And it's so, so, so simple and so stupid, yet it is so addicting, I can't stop playing
1409080	1410160	it.
1410160	1413260	So yeah, Temple Run's what I've been playing a lot on my iPad.
1413260	1414920	That's like the iPad go-to game right now.
1414920	1417680	And the screen's really pretty, you guys.
1417680	1418680	We were watching Archer.
1418680	1422160	I'm like, it's pretty for a cartoon.
1422160	1423160	Don't shake your head at me.
1423160	1424160	That's you judging me.
1424160	1425160	I can hear you.
1425160	1426160	I am.
1426160	1428600	So that was pretty much my week.
1428600	1429880	All right.
1429880	1434000	So a little bit of housekeeping, and then we're going to get into some news and so forth.
1434000	1435000	Housekeeping.
1435000	1441760	I want to mention, this got a little bit derailed in my eyes and in the eyes here in studio
1441760	1446880	because this whole VOG network thing happened in the past month and we were not able to
1446880	1451000	give our full attention to The Hunt going on on orangelandtrady.com.
1451000	1456120	Dark Tetsuya really put a ton of effort to make this like pseudo-game going on based
1456120	1462900	on, you know, Ready Player One, that book series, and he ran this whole virtual contest
1462900	1469160	where people had to like play and joust and find the hidden Easter egg screen in adventure
1469160	1472120	and just, you know, cute fun stuff.
1472120	1477340	You know, there was no point, no seriousness, just let's have fun on the internet.
1477340	1478660	And that's really what it was.
1478660	1479660	And it has a winner.
1479660	1482600	So I want to congratulate Orange Right won The Hunt this week.
1482600	1488000	So yay Orange Right, you win something.
1488000	1491100	We're going to send Orange Right something from OLR Studios.
1491100	1494440	I will find out if I get his address later.
1494440	1496520	I know he, do you mean that?
1496520	1497520	Cause I'll go.
1497520	1501880	All right, we're going to send Orange Right a lock of Dark Soccer's hair and something
1501880	1504400	else actually useful from OLR Studios.
1504400	1505840	I think I know what we can send him.
1505840	1506840	Some cat litter.
1506840	1507840	All right.
1507840	1508840	We're not sending him cat litter.
1508840	1509840	It's useful.
1509840	1513160	You can use cat litter for a whole bunch of stuff, Rob.
1513160	1514160	All right.
1514160	1517320	You know, if you spill oil, if oil drips from your car, you can put cat litter on it.
1517320	1519040	I think we have posters over there.
1519040	1520040	Just stop.
1520040	1521040	All right.
1521040	1522040	I'll send him a post.
1522040	1523120	Well, posters are kind of a bitch to mail.
1523120	1526040	I was thinking we have, we have a bunch of these little guys here, so I'll send him one
1526040	1527040	of these.
1527040	1528040	All right.
1528040	1529040	All right.
1529040	1534400	Um, I also, I know he's a Bamani fan and in the other room I have literally stacks and
1534400	1537420	stacks of promo CDs we were going to give away at live events.
1537420	1538420	We never did.
1538420	1541720	So I'm just going to put a bunch of those in a box and be all like, LOL, have fun.
1541720	1543560	And I think he'll get a kick out of that.
1543560	1544960	All right.
1544960	1546720	Um, let's see.
1546720	1547720	Second place.
1547720	1548720	You get nothing.
1548720	1549720	Sorry.
1549720	1551200	That's a tough life lesson learned.
1551200	1552200	All right.
1552200	1553200	Uh, let's see.
1553200	1557680	The other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention was that we will not be here live next week.
1557680	1562000	Sorry to say I am going to be at bucket of meat or Disneyland.
1562000	1566240	Um, so I have to make the most out of my past because the prices just went up and I, there's
1566240	1568440	no way I'm renewing at the end of the year.
1568440	1570960	So, uh, I am going this next week.
1570960	1573120	Um, so there will be no live show.
1573120	1575640	We are going to try to pre tape a show earlier in the week.
1575640	1579680	We just have to find something that, uh, blends with all of our schedules.
1579680	1584480	So I'm sorry, uh, live listeners, you won't have anything here, but think of, think of
1584480	1588780	it as fair because last week you got a show that the podcasters never heard.
1588780	1592640	So next week you're going to have to get the podcast show just like a lot of other people
1592640	1593640	do.
1593640	1595240	So that's next week's show.
1595240	1597000	I think that's it I have for housekeeping.
1597000	1598000	All right.
1598000	1601800	The other thing I have for housekeeping, um, we were supposed to be having an interview
1601800	1605720	right now with Susan from hacked on xbox.com.
1605720	1610000	Uh, unfortunately she's not online.
1610000	1613040	This is almost exactly what happened with mega ran a couple of weeks ago.
1613040	1614320	What is it about our show?
1614320	1615320	Are we, are we scary?
1615320	1616320	I don't know.
1616320	1617320	No, I don't.
1617320	1618320	You know what?
1618320	1620440	I was looking at her personal Twitter and it said something about, I got two hours of
1620440	1621440	sleep last night.
1621440	1622440	That was yesterday.
1622440	1623440	Oh, was it?
1623440	1624440	Oh, I thought it was today.
1624440	1626180	Well, you know, it is a busy weekend here in the States.
1626180	1627240	I don't know what's up.
1627240	1628760	You know, I don't take it personally.
1628760	1631520	You know, we did talk about it on Friday and I'm always the kind of person that's like,
1631520	1634180	if I don't write it down five times, I'm going to forget.
1634180	1636220	So for whatever reason, she's unfortunately not online.
1636220	1641100	If she shows up later, as we did with mega ran, we'll bring her on the show later.
1641100	1644660	I was going to use this interview to talk about something that's been going on in the
1644660	1645920	news this week.
1645920	1651760	Loki, hopefully you can talk about it instead since Susan's not here, but apparently there
1651760	1657040	was some stuff going on with the whole, we think we know how some accounts are getting
1657040	1658040	stolen.
1658040	1659040	Yeah.
1659040	1665440	So basically, um, Susan had actually put together, um, an article on her website talking about
1665440	1668760	how she kind of figured out, um, how some of this is going down.
1668760	1670720	Now I'm not sure how she came about the website.
1670720	1675280	I'm assuming just web searches because, you know, doing the same similar type of web search
1675280	1678580	was able to pull up, uh, the same information.
1678580	1683440	So basically what it was is she found out that it's not necessarily account hacking
1683440	1684440	that's going on.
1684440	1690340	It's basically jacking or, uh, the so-called hackers are social engineering, Microsoft
1690340	1696320	and other companies to get information, to recover your account on their system.
1696320	1703440	And it doesn't matter what sort of safe, um, you know, any sort of passwords, uh, questions,
1703440	1704440	whatever.
1704440	1709400	It doesn't matter cause they find a way to get that information from Microsoft or the
1709400	1713400	third party companies representing Microsoft customer service or whatever it is.
1713400	1720240	So they basically, there is this, um, it was on, uh, I'm trying to remember which website
1720240	1721240	it was now.
1721240	1725560	Um, picked it up and then it was originally on hacked on xbox.com and then Kotaku picked
1725560	1726560	it up.
1726560	1727560	Right.
1727560	1728560	And that's where it really kind of blew up.
1728560	1729560	Yeah.
1729560	1735000	Um, but basically the, the one of the websites, I can't remember what the original website,
1735000	1740720	um, that had this step by step information, uh, cause they actually had this like a tutorial
1740720	1743440	on how to do it cause this guy's like, Oh, I'm quitting hacking.
1743440	1747700	Well, yeah, it didn't now, now I had joked at the beginning of the show, Susan was kind
1747700	1751120	of the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week because she kind of got down to the bottom
1751120	1753500	of what exactly was going on.
1753500	1759720	But part of the way she did that was that I guess turned remorseful Jackers, game tag
1759720	1760720	Jackers.
1760720	1762200	I shouldn't just say remorseful Jackers.
1762200	1763640	I could be talking about other stuff.
1763640	1768400	Game tag Jackers actually contacted her and I don't know, I told her how it was.
1768400	1769800	I don't even think they contact her.
1769800	1775760	I think it was just a post that happened that she happened to run across on this website.
1775760	1781820	And um, cause I actually, I remember reading it, I couldn't view it because it was basically
1781820	1787160	one of those underground forums, whatever that you have to be, you have to be invited
1787160	1788160	to.
1788160	1793480	But however, one of those people that normally are entities that gets invited to any website
1793480	1799720	would be a Google, you know, bot that happened to cash the page and that pops up in the preview
1799720	1802800	and you can read information from there.
1802800	1808800	Um, so basically, you know, the, you know, they talk about what, you know, the strategy
1808800	1809800	to do it.
1809800	1813720	First you go to xbox.com, you click support and basically at the bottom of the page there's
1813720	1815480	a contact us stuff.
1815480	1822800	Um, on that page you click the email us link and then xbox live and then you basically
1822800	1829380	at that point they, um, impersonate an employee of Microsoft.
1829380	1834840	So they put, you know, an email address at Microsoft.com, they put the agent's name,
1834840	1838360	somebody that they, I guess, talk to, they could, you know, call up customer service
1838360	1841400	and hi, blah, blah, blah, my name is blah, blah, blah.
1841400	1845000	They write it down, you know, and they go through this web form.
1845000	1851200	Um, you put the customer and basically they, you fill out like a little note to them, you
1851200	1857920	know, customer and you put the name, you know, verified the 16 digit, um, credit card number.
1857920	1862020	He has made an inquiry and about how he has forgotten his accounts information.
1862020	1866960	Since I am tier, I am a tier one agent, I am unable to view the customer's gamertag.
1866960	1872080	He has requested to have an answer change to, and then, you know, you put some realistic
1872080	1877080	answer I guess for the question, uh, the xbox slave gamertag is, and you put the gamertag
1877080	1883000	down, um, you know, and then the person's name is supposedly contacting them that you're
1883000	1884000	spoofing.
1884000	1890760	So basically they're working it by because Microsoft is so big and there's so many departments
1890760	1895400	that don't talk to each other, essentially they're impersonating department to department.
1895400	1900860	They're impersonating the many branches of Microsoft in order to get your gamertag and
1900860	1904640	there ain't shit you can do about it except don't put a credit card on xbox.
1904640	1907840	Yeah, there's really nothing you could do about it because they're literally going and
1907840	1911320	finding the answers to your, you know, the questions that you put down.
1911320	1915960	Even if you put down, you know, which city were you born in and you put down Abraham
1915960	1919080	Lincoln or something like that, they can still get the answer to it and they're basically
1919080	1921000	changing it to whatever they want.
1921000	1925140	Um, now unfortunately, you know, one of the things I want to ask Susan tonight from hacked
1925140	1929160	on xbox.com and I got to hand it to the chatters at a vog network.com.
1929160	1933520	SGA 100 Matt says, even the best show hosts get canceled on Carson Letterman have been
1933520	1934820	canceled on too.
1934820	1935820	And what up?
1935820	1937680	G says, when the interview comes on, it should be good even late.
1937680	1938680	And I agree.
1938680	1940640	And hopefully maybe she forgot it was Memorial day weekend.
1940640	1941640	I don't know.
1941640	1943640	But anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hopefully get her on next week.
1943640	1944640	Yeah.
1944640	1945640	There's always another time.
1945640	1946640	Yeah.
1946640	1947640	Yeah.
1947640	1948640	We'll figure something out.
1948640	1952240	But anyway, one thing I want to ask her about was that apparently Microsoft responded via
1952240	1954120	Kotaku to her, to her report.
1954120	1955120	Did you see that?
1955120	1956120	Yes.
1956120	1959720	They basically said, um, well, you can't do this anymore.
1959720	1960720	Well, okay.
1960720	1963480	I don't really see.
1963480	1969680	They're basically, you know, um, yeah, I thought it was irritating because they really tried
1969680	1976480	to poopoo her story and it, it kind of pissed me off because it's kind of like, well, you
1976480	1981120	never Microsoft, you never acknowledged that this was happening.
1981120	1984960	And now you're trying to poopoo it like, well, you can't do it anymore.
1984960	1988160	And I understand that Microsoft certainly to save their image, doesn't want to admit
1988160	1992480	that they had a problem, but at the same time being that they are, I mean, they are on the
1992480	1993480	stock market.
1993480	1994480	Yes.
1994480	1995480	They're a publicly traded company, right?
1995480	1996480	Yeah.
1996480	1999320	Isn't there some sort of responsibility that they should be reporting this shit's happening?
1999320	2000320	Yeah.
2000320	2005320	And they basically said, okay, here's what their Microsoft or Kotaku asked for comment
2005320	2006320	from them.
2006320	2009800	And they're all, their response was, there are several or there are several different
2009800	2014600	methods malicious users employed to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
2014600	2016260	Social engineering is one of them.
2016260	2020440	We are aware of vulnerabilities that social engineering pose and continue to address these
2020440	2026760	through tools and training to help our members, um, uh, keep our members safe and secure.
2026760	2030880	Well, right there, that sounds like tools and train their members.
2030880	2032480	It sounds like us.
2032480	2038680	They're teaching us how to not be social engineered, which cool, but that doesn't really seem to,
2038680	2042720	you know, apply to us because we're not the ones being contacted by these people.
2042720	2045800	It's your customer service reps.
2045800	2049560	Here's another thing I really wanted to get into as much as I respect what Susan's done
2049560	2053360	this week and what she's been able to find out and put out what needed to be out there
2053360	2054640	on the internet.
2054640	2059200	She put out what people needed to hear this week and I so respect her for that.
2059200	2063080	I don't think it is the sole reason this stuff is happening.
2063080	2065760	Now I'm having a hard time remembering when I was hacked.
2065760	2068740	I think it was about six months ago at this point.
2068740	2074280	I seem to recall my password was never changed, which would tell me that this didn't happen
2074280	2078100	to me because they're resetting your password in this, right?
2078100	2080680	I don't think that they're resetting your password actually.
2080680	2081680	Really?
2081680	2082680	Yeah.
2082680	2086040	Cause I took away from it that they're trying to get into your security questions that they
2086040	2087560	can reset your password.
2087560	2088560	Not necessarily.
2088560	2090080	So here, here's what it is.
2090080	2091080	Okay.
2091080	2096160	So, so it starts off, they send the inquiry about the security question via email and
2096160	2100320	then, um, obviously they're not going to your response because you know, they're not at
2100320	2105280	that email that you call up Xbox, um, 30 minutes later.
2105280	2108840	And uh, after the ants, after the answer, you say that you got disconnected from a tier
2108840	2111200	two agent and asked to be transferred back.
2111200	2113000	So they transfer you to a tier two agent.
2113000	2117200	You give them the number, the one that you wrote, um, the one that you, I guess your
2117200	2120440	customer, so they act like they have, what was it?
2120440	2127680	Um, once they pull it up, say, um, they'll say it'll take a little while to change it.
2127680	2131920	Uh, call back, say you forgot your email, but you know what the security question or
2131920	2137420	the secret question answer is and they will ask for your gamer tag and um, answer them
2137420	2139720	and they will give you the email.
2139720	2148520	So now, um, so I guess, uh, let's see here.
2148520	2153360	So basically now you have their email and I guess their security question, I'm not really
2153360	2155960	sure how, I guess I don't know if that allows you to change it immediately.
2155960	2160880	I thought they would send you a, maybe I just want to deny, deny, deny.
2160880	2164800	Just like I want to deny that I couldn't have been phished either.
2164800	2167640	You know, I just, maybe I'm just being a little hard headed, but I kind of think like, why
2167640	2169680	would someone want my account?
2169680	2175160	I mean, granted, maybe I, although I don't think I have much of a public face, I have
2175160	2177960	a public face thanks to this podcast nonetheless.
2177960	2180200	So maybe some a-hole out there wanted it.
2180200	2182720	I don't know why they used it to play FIFA 13 though.
2182720	2186280	I don't, I don't think it's necessarily that they're, they're saying there's a few reasons
2186280	2188880	why they have our accounts get hacked.
2188880	2193440	One is the original gamer tag, which means, um, you know, you have a gamer tag that's
2193440	2199280	like, you know, awesome or, you know, which I don't, I don't think I have a name people
2199280	2200280	want.
2200280	2201280	Yeah.
2201280	2202280	So it's not necessarily that.
2202280	2206160	Or, um, sometimes accounts get hacked because you're, you know, you're a member of live
2206160	2208280	for X number of years.
2208280	2210480	That could be that I would agree.
2210480	2214200	I don't know why zone one account for that, but, but I, okay, but the other, sorry, but
2214200	2219200	the other thing I have friends who were hacked that hadn't touched their Xbox in years and
2219200	2220720	it's just, it's not clicking for me.
2220720	2223800	They can just, they can just probably find random people.
2223800	2227080	Maybe there's try it on one or another.
2227080	2231420	Perhaps it's a given the amount of time has gone since it's been used.
2231420	2234360	It makes it an easy target because it's someone less likely to check.
2234360	2240680	I feel like this story has blown a hole in it, but it hasn't still yet shown us everything
2240680	2241680	that's going on.
2241680	2244200	Let me quickly go to the chat room because there's some good comments here from the chat
2244200	2245200	room.
2245200	2249840	Uh, DJ Morpheus from under station live Saturday nights here on VOG says, has anyone considered
2249840	2255400	the possibility if there is inside help within the Xbox call centers for the Jackers?
2255400	2257120	That's a scary thought, isn't it?
2257120	2258560	But it's not unheard of.
2258560	2259960	It is not unheard of.
2259960	2261600	Well, here's an example.
2261600	2267520	When I worked for, um, the, uh, mortgage service or I used to work for one of our clients had
2267520	2273400	a bunch of information stolen by one of their employees stealing a laptop.
2273400	2274400	Wow.
2274400	2283480	And it had something like, um, I want to say, uh, 3000, uh, bank account information, new
2283480	2284480	bank accounts.
2284480	2287520	So just saying it happens within companies.
2287520	2288520	It does.
2288520	2289520	It does.
2289520	2292520	You know, I work in the insurance industry and there's laws set in place to prosecute
2292520	2296640	people who use the information that they find in malicious ways because, you know, imagine
2296640	2301680	if you could access a celebrity's medical records, the things that might happen there,
2301680	2304720	you know, but there's, there's laws in place to protect everybody.
2304720	2309160	Like with my job now, I have, I run into the same thing, you know, with inspections.
2309160	2310160	Yeah.
2310160	2313400	Let me, uh, let me read this comment from ACDEF in our chat room as well, cause I like
2313400	2316840	this too at vognetwork.com ACDEF says, let me put it this way.
2316840	2321280	PlayStation network handled their hacking issue horribly, but they handled it nonetheless.
2321280	2325200	Steam handled their forums being hacked really well and keep, kept the users informed of
2325200	2327480	and users of what was happening.
2327480	2332600	Microsoft handling the Xbox live jackings is non-existent, which is worse of what Sony
2332600	2333600	did.
2333600	2337140	And, uh, DJ Morpheus added to that, remember this is Microsoft.
2337140	2339120	They never admit issues until necessary.
2339120	2343160	Look at Vista and how it was a disaster and ACDEF said, yeah, pretty much what I'm saying.
2343160	2346560	Microsoft denying the whole issue is worse than what Sony did.
2346560	2350480	And we're talking that Sony didn't handle the problem that well to begin with.
2350480	2355780	And I've said this for months now, as much as we give Sony shit and yes, they do deserve
2355780	2358980	quite a bit of shit over what happened and you know, kind of how they made themselves
2358980	2360560	a target and everything.
2360560	2365360	Although we give them shit, at least they said what was going on and they did take their
2365360	2367320	network down when it was a problem.
2367320	2376840	And you know, most of all, they never had money actually stolen.
2376840	2382080	Yet here we are on Xbox this much later and we're still hearing stories about how it's
2382080	2383080	done.
2383080	2384960	And you go to that website hacked on xbox.com.
2384960	2387460	It is still happening.
2387460	2394240	If you have not changed your password on Xbox live in the past six months, you are a fool
2394240	2395240	to not do it.
2395240	2399140	Now, if you do not change your password on Xbox live, you have sat through all of these
2399140	2402820	stories and it's still not changed your Xbox live password.
2402820	2412840	You are a fool and I wish you the best of luck.
2412840	2416560	Now that I paraded everybody, hopefully that wasn't anybody actually listening and let
2416560	2419080	you know, I should go change my password right now.
2419080	2422520	I forgive you if it's the first time you've ever heard me ranting, maybe you didn't think
2422520	2425440	to change it before, but if you've been sitting here for the past six months and you still
2425440	2428960	haven't changed it, you're, you're, you're just asking for it.
2428960	2433080	I've done mine twice since then cause I routinely change my passwords every three months.
2433080	2436640	Well, here's the weird thing too, and this actually just came up in the past week and
2436640	2437640	a half.
2437640	2442800	I got an email or I tried to log into xbox.com or something and it made me change my password.
2442800	2446120	But it wasn't a reset or something.
2446120	2450240	It was some type of somebody's been trying to log into your account too many times.
2450240	2451820	You better change your password.
2451820	2456320	And so that made me, you know, the first thing I went to my bank account to make sure no
2456320	2459520	more money had been stolen or any of that crap is going on.
2459520	2462280	But they, you know, I looked in the game history of they've been in there, been able to play
2462280	2463280	anything.
2463280	2468320	Thankfully, no, um, no one actually got in there, but it made me go, they're still fucking
2468320	2473720	trying.
2473720	2474720	All right.
2474720	2475720	Anyhow.
2475720	2480160	Anyways, there was hackforms.net is where this stuff originated from.
2480160	2484160	They have the whole priv7 how to jack any xbox account.
2484160	2486880	That's where all that information was from on her website.
2486880	2487880	All right.
2487880	2491200	Well, I'm hoping, um, you know, we can get her on here to tell us more about the story
2491200	2494960	about how she found it and you know, kind of her opinions really having heard so many
2494960	2498300	of these stories on what Microsoft should do.
2498300	2500080	But we'll have to get that in a later week.
2500080	2501080	All right.
2501080	2504400	For now, let's get into the rest of the week's news.
2504400	2508000	We're going to start off with a repeat from last week because this, this still hasn't
2508000	2509000	really broken, right?
2509000	2510000	No, it hasn't broken yet.
2510000	2511000	All right.
2511000	2512880	So sorry, live listeners, you're going to be hearing this for the second time, but for
2512880	2515480	the podcasters, let's, let's take it away.
2515480	2521320	So this is a kind of neat, um, we figured out, uh, who the lead character is going to
2521320	2525240	be for dead rising three, or at least who will be voicing said lead character for dead
2525240	2526240	rising three.
2526240	2530160	Um, that individual is actor, uh, George Diaz.
2530160	2535120	George Diaz, in case you're not familiar with that name is, uh, done quite a few things.
2535120	2541000	Um, one of being, uh, the brothers Garcia, which was a TV series, um, back in early two
2541000	2542000	thousands.
2542000	2547400	Uh, also recently was in, um, was it Love Concord, um, which is kind of like a video
2547400	2553360	game-ish movie, but, um, this is directly actually from him, um, kind of long story
2553360	2556320	short how we kind of came about that.
2556320	2561200	I had a coworker who was actually talking to him about Love Concord, um, you know, cause
2561200	2568120	he's kind of big in the indie stuff and actually, um, saw, you know, the friends of my coworker,
2568120	2571280	um, had, you know, friend of his Facebook or whatever.
2571280	2576960	Say, Hey, um, so by the way, man, uh, tell your friend, um, who liked this post that
2576960	2579480	I'm the new face of dead rising three lol.
2579480	2584500	I saw he works for, um, for video games, the trailer should be coming out soon in the next
2584500	2585560	month or two.
2585560	2586560	It's crazy.
2586560	2590480	They sent me to this place called Mova in San Francisco, insane technology.
2590480	2591960	They did Benjamin Button.
2591960	2592960	Looks so real.
2592960	2594960	I'll post it on here when they give it to me.
2594960	2595960	Um, just real quick.
2595960	2597280	Are you sure the name's not Jorge?
2597280	2598280	Who starts with the T?
2598280	2599280	I'm sorry.
2599280	2600280	Yeah, it's Jorge.
2600280	2601280	But okay.
2601280	2602280	Just making sure.
2602280	2603280	Jorge Diaz.
2603280	2604280	Jorge Diaz.
2604280	2605840	Um, and he'll get a kick out of it.
2605840	2608400	So, um, kind of neat.
2608400	2612960	It's actually, I mean, if you go go look up Jorge Diaz on Facebook, you can actually see
2612960	2613960	said post.
2613960	2620360	Um, but yeah, uh, I guess we'll see that in, um, uh, well, when they talk a little bit
2620360	2626040	about during E3 and also kind of goes back to the rumor about the plot for dead rising
2626040	2629760	three where it's supposed to be this, uh, auto mechanic and there was supposed to be,
2629760	2636340	um, you know, an LA and sort of this, you know, illegal immigrant spin thing on there
2636340	2641360	where they have these aliens, um, that they're trying to smuggle across borders.
2641360	2646080	But the aliens are actually a little controversy to, uh, let's, let's use something, uh, politically
2646080	2648180	buzz worthy to try and sell more copies.
2648180	2649180	That's taste.
2649180	2650180	Yeah.
2650180	2654040	And the aliens would be these, uh, or illegals they call them, um, would be a group of infected
2654040	2655040	people that aren't ready.
2655040	2659040	They're literally illegal aliens because they're silly.
2659040	2661040	All right.
2661040	2662040	Anyway, whatever.
2662040	2667280	Um, but it also confirms dead rising three basically because every Capcom has not confirmed
2667280	2668280	dead rising three.
2668280	2669280	Everything out there is speculation.
2669280	2670280	Yes.
2670280	2674480	So they will be announcing dead rising three at E3 for sure.
2674480	2678600	That'll probably be one of like Xbox or playstations things.
2678600	2679600	Sure.
2679600	2680600	Sure.
2680600	2681600	So there you go.
2681600	2683480	No Frank West or the other guy.
2683480	2685000	No, of course not.
2685000	2686000	Okay.
2686000	2687000	Yet.
2687000	2688000	Until DL.
2688000	2689000	No man.
2689000	2690000	Like Frank West.
2690000	2692120	Yeah, dead rising two off the record bond.
2692120	2697720	So well, because I think a lot of people will kind of saw it as a, I think a lot of people
2697720	2699600	saw it for what it was.
2699600	2704040	It was a cheap attempt to try and get dead rising two more popularity when it just should
2704040	2705040	have been there to begin with.
2705040	2706240	You know what I mean?
2706240	2710200	I think people are starting to call Capcom out on a lot of this shit and it's kind of
2710200	2715800	fun to watch like watching a soap opera a little bit and it's just, Hey, just like,
2715800	2723120	you know, all the on disc DLC for street fighter cross Tekken and dragon dog, dragon's dog.
2723120	2724840	Let's talk Minecraft.
2724840	2726840	I bet Loki will be excited about this.
2726840	2730960	I bet you never thought this would be something happening on OLR Minecraft segment.
2730960	2731960	All right.
2731960	2733800	We used to talk about Minecraft updates all the time.
2733800	2735680	I will have, you know, okay, here, here we go.
2735680	2737680	No, this is some serious Minecraft news.
2737680	2740700	Um, Xbox live arcade.
2740700	2744280	What game is being played the most online?
2744280	2749160	Well it's still modern warfare three, but Minecraft has now edged out call of duty black
2749160	2753400	ops for the number two spot.
2753400	2758940	This is a game that's been out a month, not even, not even.
2758940	2761500	That's pretty and online completely.
2761500	2763000	Can't buy it in stores.
2763000	2766480	That's pretty impressive.
2766480	2773840	There is supposedly an adventure update thing coming to Minecraft, Xbox live arcade eventually.
2773840	2779680	Now I guess the next update for Minecraft is going to be 1.7.3, which will add pistons
2779680	2781280	into the game, which is awesome.
2781280	2786440	That's the next thing that Xbox is slated to get, but at some point 1.8, which was the
2786440	2792140	adventure update on the PC that will be coming to Xbox live arcade, uh, the quote from four
2792140	2793140	J studios.
2793140	2795440	They're the ones who ported the game for Xbox live arcade.
2795440	2800420	There are no big architecture changes with the move to 1.7.3 so it's been quite straightforward.
2800420	2803760	The move to 1.8.2 is much more challenging.
2803760	2808480	We are working with Daniel Kaplan at Mojang to define what is going in the Xbox version,
2808480	2813360	but the aim is to include as many of the PC features that make sense on the Xbox as possible.
2813360	2815360	The game isn't Minecraft on the Xbox.
2815360	2818080	It's Minecraft Xbox 360 edition.
2818080	2820720	So it isn't really a direct port of the PC game.
2820720	2826000	That's kind of them as I'm trying to weave these tangled words of, we didn't promise
2826000	2830880	you everything, but I got to say it's still, you know, especially for somebody who's new
2830880	2834040	to the whole damn thing like me, it's still pretty impressive and I'll be looking forward
2834040	2835480	to these updates.
2835480	2837120	So there you go.
2837120	2841200	This update, by the way, the endermen, those are the ones that you can't make direct eye
2841200	2842200	contact with.
2842200	2843200	Right?
2843200	2846720	Oh, Alan was showing me one of those guys and I thought creepers were scary.
2846720	2847720	Good Lord.
2847720	2852720	Uh, new kinds of building materials, a new mode called creative mode and some changes
2852720	2854160	to combat mechanics.
2854160	2857460	And that'll be the patch where you're going to have to eat food to survive.
2857460	2863960	Although I imagine there'll still be a casual mode that won't have that element in it.
2863960	2872320	So Minecraft sales figures, 6 million sold on the PC, 9 million across all platforms
2872320	2877640	when you factor in Xbox, Android, and iOS, maybe 9.2 million.
2877640	2882240	That's according to Daniel Kaplan with, uh, Mojang has a lot.
2882240	2886720	That's a lot, especially considering I don't think the iOS and I can't imagine those sold
2886720	2887720	a lot.
2887720	2890320	I mean, I don't think in the millions, maybe a million a pop.
2890320	2894440	I mean, the Xbox ones probably sold at least a million and a half at this point.
2894440	2898040	So I, well, they said they were profitable within 10 hours.
2898040	2902500	That's that is, this is, this is the type of thing that they're going to look back on
2902500	2909640	in 10 years and be all like, Hey, remember in the 2010s when people played Minecraft,
2909640	2915880	just like we kind of look back and go, Hey, remember the pet rock, you know, I think it'll
2915880	2921080	be that whole thing where it's still, um, I just have a feeling that like Lego is just
2921080	2923560	kicking themselves going, damn it.
2923560	2925160	We could have done something like this.
2925160	2928200	Like we could have so done something like this.
2928200	2931080	You're going to see this on VH1 in 10 years.
2931080	2936360	Michael Ian Black commenting on VH1's I love the 10s anymore.
2936360	2938120	I love the 10s.
2938120	2939120	Remember Minecraft?
2939120	2948960	Remember when we used to have this show, do countdowns of decades and stuff and just stopped.
2948960	2952200	All right, so there you go.
2952200	2954640	That's, that's what's going on in Minecraft world.
2954640	2957400	So dark soccer, if you want to talk about a different game, now would be a good chance.
2957400	2963680	Well, I said, if people want me to play the damn game, they need to buy it for me on PC.
2963680	2964680	That's cute.
2964680	2967280	You live in a world, you think you live in a world where that will happen.
2967280	2969240	That means I don't have to play it.
2969240	2972760	No, no, don't even try to get out of it like that.
2972760	2978520	You can download the classic version completely free on their website, but I don't want the
2978520	2979520	classic version.
2979520	2980520	Yeah.
2980520	2981520	Yeah.
2981520	2982520	And I've tried it.
2982520	2983520	The terms have changed.
2983520	2987080	I've tried it because I want to see what all this, you know, neat crap is, but it's not
2987080	2991600	worth it to me unless I'm playing for free because you know, I'm cheap that way.
2991600	2993800	So how about some Star Wars?
2993800	2997640	There's going to be a new Star Wars franchise unveiled next week.
2997640	2998640	Ooh.
2998640	2999640	And it's a bold vision.
2999640	3000640	Ooh.
3000640	3004540	And we don't know what the crap it is, but it's going to be on GTTV.
3004540	3006120	So good.
3006120	3008760	That's on Thursday.
3008760	3014160	What it was said though is that it actually had a pretty high caliber team on it and it's
3014160	3018160	going to be very bold, very bold, but we don't know what it is.
3018160	3023760	So I mean, hopefully it's going to be better than the MMO because the MMO is losing people
3023760	3026880	and it really wasn't all that great that I saw.
3026880	3032080	I'm not impressed by it except I do kind of like the alignment change thing, but that's
3032080	3033080	about it.
3033080	3034080	That's really about it.
3034080	3035080	Yay.
3035080	3037680	It's going to be a new Battlefront series and that sounds awesome.
3037680	3038680	You think?
3038680	3039680	I think so.
3039680	3040680	That would be worth it.
3040680	3041680	They're just going to call it something different.
3041680	3045680	How about, you know, how about a return to like the, um, uh, super Nintendo style side
3045680	3046680	scroller games?
3046680	3047680	That would be rad.
3047680	3049400	Yeah, that'd be cool.
3049400	3052640	But, and of course a lot of times when I think about Lucas art, I think about the point and
3052640	3056560	click adventure games from back in the day, like loom and Indiana Jones and shit.
3056560	3062120	So how about a fucking like, you know, Hey, tell tales kind of, you know, made that industry
3062120	3065160	like cool again with the whole walking deads doing very well.
3065160	3066160	Right.
3066160	3069280	Since they're already on a star Wars game like that, since they're already, you know,
3069280	3073760	stealing from Blizzard, why don't they just keep doing it and do like a Diablo style,
3073760	3079960	you know, play like that since they're already, I'm sorry, borrowing from Blizzard.
3079960	3084840	I am with dark Tetsuya in our chat room at vognetwork.com as long as it's not Han Solo's
3084840	3088560	dance party for the connect.
3088560	3091240	You know what Han Solo's dance party would be?
3091240	3092500	Him shooting people.
3092500	3093500	The end.
3093500	3100800	Uh, God, I just, I hope they don't make a sequel to that game cause it was terrible.
3100800	3106000	It probably sold okay, but man, it was a terrible game.
3106000	3111640	Speaking of terrible, there's been some terrible things going on at 38 studios and big, huge
3111640	3112640	games.
3112640	3113640	They've laid off their entire staff.
3113640	3120440	Apparently, uh, kingdoms of Amalur wasn't doing very well and, um, they owed a lot of
3120440	3125840	money to Rhode Island, you know, they had a, basically they were supposed to be paying
3125840	3133960	back $50 million and, uh, of the $75 million loan that they got from Rhode Island.
3133960	3137720	And you know, their franchise wasn't worth very much.
3137720	3141440	Um, kingdoms of Amalur reckoning didn't sell like they had hoped it would.
3141440	3146920	They needed to sell 3 million units to break even and they only sold about 700,000.
3146920	3149060	So, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3149060	3154420	Wasn't there a tweet that something like they had sold 1.2 million or something or was that
3154420	3158800	like shipped versus sold and that whole clever math that we see in the gaming industry?
3158800	3164680	Honestly, I don't know when that update was, but it sold well under 3 million units, that's
3164680	3165680	for sure.
3165680	3171600	Um, I mean, that stuff takes time, but not enough time to repay their debts.
3171600	3178120	And it's just, there was a whole bunch of, uh, just terrible stuff going on there.
3178120	3184480	I was reading things, uh, oh yeah, 1.22 million units in the first 90 days is what they said.
3184480	3191200	Um, but also like I heard stuff where some of the employees that were relocated to work
3191200	3198440	for this company, oh, by the way, you know, that house that we bought for you, um, yeah,
3198440	3200520	we never paid for it.
3200520	3204160	So you've got, we took a second mortgage out on your home to see, you know, yeah, I heard
3204160	3206160	about that mortgage now.
3206160	3209240	Yeah, that sucks.
3209240	3211480	And that kind of stuff can really fuck your credit.
3211480	3217260	I mean, that's, that's the really sad thing about this, you know, but hooray to the gaming
3217260	3220600	industry for at least trying to, you know, cause usually you think of the gaming industry
3220600	3224480	and it's, you know, you think of the people on Xbox live, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck,
3224480	3225840	fag, fag, fag, you know.
3225840	3232360	And also, I mean, considering that there was almost 380 employees at 38 studios, um, so
3232360	3237080	they, you know, people on Twitter have been kind of rallying, um, to, you know, with 38,
3237080	3242440	the hashtag, uh, 38 jobs, also Facebook group, um, 38 jobs.
3242440	3247760	And they've got, you know, people including like Alex Rubens, um, you know, game journalist
3247760	3252760	and he's been, you know, collecting like a stuff into a Google doc with all these different
3252760	3254720	studios with openings and stuff.
3254720	3258440	And there's also job fairs going on in their area and they're kind of letting these people
3258440	3259440	know.
3259440	3261840	Uh, he might be a listener of the show because him and I have followed each other on Twitter
3261840	3262840	for a while.
3262840	3266000	And so I actually kind of saw his tweets about that when he was putting it together, his
3266000	3267000	whole Google docs thing.
3267000	3268160	And I thought that was a really cool idea.
3268160	3269160	So props to him.
3269160	3271840	I'm glad you're getting your, especially cause I know he's an aspiring game journalist.
3271840	3273140	This is a good thing.
3273140	3276140	You know, good begets good.
3276140	3277200	You know what I mean?
3277200	3278680	So good for him.
3278680	3279680	Yeah.
3279680	3285120	Um, so yeah, it's, it's a terrible situation, uh, thankfully though they're a talented group
3285120	3289200	of people and so they should hopefully be able to find work pretty quick.
3289200	3292880	And God, I mean, that's just, I don't know.
3292880	3293880	Now that's not good.
3293880	3297600	SSJ 100, Matt has taken the cheap shot in our chat room at vog network.com that a lot
3297600	3301920	of people have been taking Kurt Schilling always been a douche.
3301920	3304640	So I had a clever retort.
3304640	3305640	Okay.
3305640	3306640	What is your retort young lady?
3306640	3312680	The douches keep girl bits clean, so how's that bad?
3312680	3317440	Well look, whatever he is, um, uh, he's apparently not the best businessman in the world.
3317440	3319000	Uh, we can certainly say that.
3319000	3325280	So I mean, what about the repercussions that are being felt for, you know, the fact that
3325280	3332120	his name basically got a state to believe in his company enough to give them this huge
3332120	3334320	loan that now they're going to have to eat.
3334320	3337520	I mean, what's the longterm repercussion of this?
3337520	3339880	You think, well, taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.
3339880	3343600	And I think they estimated it was like a over a hundred million dollars that the taxpayers
3343600	3344600	would be accountable for.
3344600	3352400	I want to say it was like 112 in chains or something like that, but, um, yeah, it sucks.
3352400	3354880	Rhode Island's not a big state.
3354880	3356280	That's that's a lot of money.
3356280	3360760	A dungeon buster in our chat room says Amalur wasn't that bad of a game, but the timing
3360760	3365760	for its release couldn't get out from Skyrim shadow, which I mean, I don't know what a
3365760	3368040	lot of people are going to do Skyrim by the time they come out.
3368040	3371200	I wouldn't blame Skyrim because it was a few months after Skyrim.
3371200	3375300	I would blame Mass Effect 3 because it came out literally like three weeks before Mass
3375300	3376300	Effect 3.
3376300	3380880	Well, not even that, but maybe it's just me and the fact that I don't watch a lot of TV
3380880	3383560	or when I do, I watch it without commercials.
3383560	3387840	I hadn't really heard a lot about this game, which, you know, considering I do this show,
3387840	3388840	you'd think be honest.
3388840	3389840	It's the first I've ever heard of it.
3389840	3390840	Right.
3390840	3391840	Maybe that's a problem.
3391840	3395860	Well, it is a problem considering it's EA, the one publishing it and they usually pimp
3395860	3397040	the shit out of their games.
3397040	3401120	Um, I mean, I heard about it and stuff and they, I saw, you know, they had a demo and
3401120	3403960	I didn't really see any TV advertisement for it.
3403960	3407840	But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so I mean, it's possible that they had stuff
3407840	3409120	for it.
3409120	3413760	Um, but it's not like, you know, Madden or something that you'd spend a lot of money
3413760	3414760	on it.
3414760	3419440	Uh, Phantasm, our chairman says reckoning had a bad release window with Skyrim and Mass
3419440	3420440	Effect 3.
3420440	3423280	Is it possible that the game just released at a bad time?
3423280	3426120	I, once again, I'm not going to blame Skyrim.
3426120	3430560	Skyrim was two months before it, but what about could contribute, but I think there
3430560	3431560	might be other factors.
3431560	3435760	What about just the fact that maybe the month it released usually isn't a big month for
3435760	3439200	games, especially maybe they should have held it off till summer because those first few
3439200	3440920	weeks really do make or break your game.
3440920	3441920	You know what I'm going to blame?
3441920	3445900	I'm going to blame the fucking online pass because it was a game that had an online,
3445900	3450360	they literally called it an online pass for a game that had no online component.
3450360	3452600	Oh, that's right.
3452600	3453600	That was this.
3453600	3458400	They had no online component, but the online pass, they literally called an online pass
3458400	3460720	was just, you know, bonus DLC.
3460720	3462760	Yeah, that didn't help.
3462760	3469000	So I mean, just call it bonus DLC, you know, then if you don't buy it at launch, you don't
3469000	3473680	get the bonus DLC and all you can do is go, well, damn, I should have bought the game
3473680	3474680	at launch.
3474680	3476440	I mean, I don't see how that's a bad thing at all.
3476440	3480640	And instead of calling it an online pass, oh, you got to pay this extra money to get
3480640	3482960	online and download this extra DLC.
3482960	3487320	I don't really know what the spin was on that, but all right, well, continuing with things
3487320	3492320	that might, um, drive the gaming industry further into a hole, um, you've got to hear
3492320	3494640	about this patent that was discovered this week.
3494640	3499440	Sony Computer Entertainment America or SCA filed for this patent in 2011.
3499440	3502040	It usually takes a little time for these patents to be found.
3502040	3504720	So yes, it's an older patent, but it's just being found now.
3504720	3510200	Um, the patent was for an advertising system where a game will be suspended during play
3510200	3512420	for an advertisement to come up.
3512420	3513960	Then the game will continue.
3513960	3519000	Think of it, excuse me, think of it like how TV commercials interrupt your show, Hulu,
3519000	3526780	or Hulu ads would be proceeded by a warning and a slow down of gameplay with another warning
3526780	3529820	displayed when gameplay is about to resume.
3529820	3533280	So it's kind of like ad incoming.
3533280	3534280	Everything's low.
3534280	3535280	Bye Pepsi.
3535280	3536280	Oh, okay.
3536280	3539280	Let's get back into the game.
3539280	3544960	Yeah, seriously, that, that reminds me of Mr. Sensei with 2000 movie sign.
3544960	3549800	Um, now just because they filed the patent doesn't mean it will be implemented.
3549800	3552760	It's just, you know, again, patents are to kind of protect ideas or what have you, which
3552760	3556920	is weird because I thought I, I thought IOS games did this shit already.
3556920	3560360	Doesn't word with friends kind of do something like this where you play and then you get
3560360	3561360	mad.
3561360	3566120	If you have the free version, yeah, if you, I have the paid version of words with friends
3566120	3567600	that never does that crap to me.
3567600	3573280	I don't know, would this be terrible if it was to support like free full console games?
3573280	3576920	Like for example, ad supported stuff like for, you know, say I want to get a little
3576920	3580920	big planet too and it, I can add supported version that stops gameplay once in a while
3580920	3583320	to pimp me Pepsi or something.
3583320	3587120	I would probably, I'd probably just want to buy the regular game, which is what they want
3587120	3590040	you to do in the first place, but they can make more ad revenue.
3590040	3594200	If this shit pops up in a fucking retail game, I'm not fucking buying that.
3594200	3596840	This was in wipeout as well, wasn't it sorta, sorta.
3596840	3599880	I mean, it didn't really pause gameplay, but it doesn't like the loading screens.
3599880	3606080	Well, that's one thing if they have it as a, as something that's not gonna be obtrusive,
3606080	3611720	you know, if it's not gonna interrupt your gameplay, I don't so much have a problem with
3611720	3612880	it.
3612880	3618540	I'm cool with the billboards and racing games, but I think that if they're doing this as
3618540	3622720	a way to bring in more revenue, they need to decrease the price of the game.
3622720	3623720	Absolutely.
3623720	3627520	Now, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room and says, don't effing get me started
3627520	3628720	on patents.
3628720	3632480	Had my phone delayed in customs a week or so ago because of a BS Apple patent.
3632480	3636840	Well, you know, a lot of folks are saying the patent industry in this country is really
3636840	3638680	screwed up right now.
3638680	3641640	And it's a lot of just offensive and defensive maneuvers.
3641640	3645240	Remember when Twitter came out and said, we have all of these patents, they actually put
3645240	3648580	out a press release that said, we have acquired all these patents and we only plan to use
3648580	3649680	them defensively.
3649680	3653040	Like, it's a fucking game of chess.
3653040	3655240	That's what the patent industry in this country has become.
3655240	3657920	So, yeah, maybe Sony is not even going to do anything with this.
3657920	3662160	It's just, we just want to, you know, defend ourselves against when somebody tries to call
3662160	3666200	us on it or something weird to throw my political two cents into it.
3666200	3671600	This is what happens when you allow certain businesses to go deregulated DJ Morpheus is
3671600	3675200	in our chat room and gives us an example of what could come to a PlayStation game near
3675200	3676200	you.
3676200	3680600	We'll return you to your blood carnage marathon game after this message from some feminine
3680600	3684720	yeast infection product.
3684720	3689240	Could be that would be freaking hilarious actually that I could support just for the
3689240	3693840	comic value alone, because I'd want to see a reaction videos to that on the interwebs
3693840	3695120	be hilarious.
3695120	3701800	Now maybe this is related news, but Sony online entertainment or SOE has announced a free
3701800	3704520	to play game called bullet run.
3704520	3711400	It's a revamped game from Acony games or this head head head one or head in was the game
3711400	3712400	with a new title.
3712400	3713400	H-E-D-O-N-E.
3713400	3714400	Head one.
3714400	3715400	Yeah.
3715400	3716400	Had one.
3716400	3717400	Could be heading.
3717400	3718400	I don't know.
3718400	3720920	But this is the bullet run is now kind of the new version of this.
3720920	3723400	And you can see this at bullet run the game.com.
3723400	3725200	It's a free to play shooter.
3725200	3727760	It has a reality show premise to it.
3727760	3732480	So, you know, reality show killing sprees are all the rage right now, thanks to hunger
3732480	3733480	games.
3733480	3737800	So I guess this is kind of like the hunger games, but with like commandos and stuff like
3737800	3738800	that.
3738800	3740140	So, uh, there you go.
3740140	3745040	The developers known for such games as APB and battle forge, meaning they haven't had
3745040	3748100	a lot of luck so far, but maybe this will be it.
3748100	3752920	And maybe this will make Sony money because, Oh, I'm about to score a headshot on my opponent
3752920	3759480	and have you tried summers Eve?
3759480	3760480	Speaking of douches.
3760480	3763720	It'd be funnier.
3763720	3765920	It's just relative to the conversation.
3765920	3766920	Yes.
3766920	3774600	It'd be funnier if it was in max pain three bullet time advertisement, bullet time over
3774600	3776440	advertisement gone.
3776440	3777760	Interesting.
3777760	3780640	Tiger call on our chat room says, and you know, those ads that appear in billboards
3780640	3784680	and games and such, they actually find ways to block those ads from loading in games.
3784680	3787720	You know, that ad that pops up on the Xbox live dashboard, there's a little tweak you
3787720	3788760	can make the blocks it.
3788760	3789760	So it doesn't load.
3789760	3793280	I seem to remember reading something about that once where it's like on your router,
3793280	3795600	you block a certain domain or something.
3795600	3797180	It's never have to see that shit.
3797180	3804000	You basically, you redirect, um, certain IPs to your local domain so that it doesn't pop.
3804000	3805720	Doesn't load those things up.
3805720	3809520	Um, but yeah, I mean you could do that.
3809520	3813760	It would be, it depends, but you would all, you would be, you'd be interrupted with a
3813760	3815860	blank screen instead.
3815860	3818640	You know what my favorite way of getting rid of ads is?
3818640	3821120	I'm not giving a fuck.
3821120	3822520	Ignore it.
3822520	3823520	How about that?
3823520	3825280	Don't give a fuck.
3825280	3826280	Or just don't.
3826280	3828360	I mean, this is the day, age of the internet.
3828360	3831280	You're going to know when there's going to be some source software out there that has
3831280	3832280	ads in it.
3832280	3833280	It's getting me out of fucking blocks.
3833280	3838560	Hey, can you imagine this next, uh, God of War game has fucking ads for like, you know,
3838560	3840960	subway in the middle, middle of the damn game.
3840960	3842800	Are you out of fucks to give?
3842800	3844600	Try new Folgers instant coffee.
3844600	3846400	It will perk you right back up.
3846400	3848400	You'll have plenty of fucks.
3848400	3849400	This is my thing.
3849400	3855760	If it's free or a very inexpensive service, I don't really care about if there's ads.
3855760	3860440	You know, if it keeps the costs low or free, fine.
3860440	3861440	That's great.
3861440	3867040	You know, if, and then offer, you know, a paid option if you don't want to see the ads.
3867040	3869920	That's, you know, that I think is fair.
3869920	3874600	But when you've already paid the money for the game, that's, I think, and then you have
3874600	3876880	your game interrupted, that's a little too far.
3876880	3877880	I'm with you.
3877880	3884800	If that and the micro transaction stuff, the Facebook style game in your $60 game, that
3884800	3886160	shit pisses me the fuck off.
3886160	3889040	They're going to keep doing it because they can charge $60 for a game and someone's going
3889040	3890400	to pay for it and then they'll just watch the game.
3890400	3891960	If they charge 20 bucks for the game.
3891960	3894320	That's why there's going to be another video game industry crash.
3894320	3895320	Wait.
3895320	3900040	If they pay, now if they charge $20 for a game and then had, I refuse to use the word,
3900040	3904320	had individual transactions within the game, that I could understand a little bit more
3904320	3908080	because then you're paying for the cost of development.
3908080	3911960	You're paying for the cost of advertising and you're paying for the shipping.
3911960	3916920	So you're a supporter of Ridge Racer for the Vita, which was basically a $30 game that
3916920	3918080	came with nothing.
3918080	3922360	It was basically a six, six, no, I'm sorry, six cars, three tracks.
3922360	3925240	That game can ask my D. You know what?
3925240	3930880	I paid two bucks for Bust Move and I paid for all the maps, all the puzzles.
3930880	3932680	I ended up spending six bucks on that game.
3932680	3937200	You have a two versus 30 is a huge difference, but I'm saying as an example, all right, going
3937200	3940080	to our, a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on shadow next gen in our
3940080	3943920	chat room at vog network.com says too much effort for something that really doesn't mean
3943920	3944920	anything.
3944920	3946600	And I believe that's in regards to blocking the ads.
3946600	3951800	A Sep when says, I don't have a problem with ads when they fit like ads in a sports game
3951800	3954160	that look like the ads you see at a real game.
3954160	3957120	Yeah, believe it or not, I don't, I don't give a shit about those at all.
3957120	3959120	It kind of adds to the experience really.
3959120	3960560	It makes it more realistic.
3960560	3962760	I mean, it really does.
3962760	3968280	Um, YouTube ads, however, Infinel says stupid ads like on X-Box dashboard make me want to
3968280	3970520	avoid that product or service.
3970520	3971520	Here's what you do.
3971520	3972520	I don't know if I go that far with it.
3972520	3973520	Here's what you do.
3973520	3976360	Add people, and this is pure ad genius right here.
3976360	3982840	You make a fighting game, Allah smash brothers or you know, Sony mascot battle rail where
3982840	3983960	they're calling it.
3983960	3989260	Um, and you just make it with the mascots from those advertisements and there you go.
3989260	3991680	It's one big ad that actually fits within the game.
3991680	3994600	There were a whole games around mascots.
3994600	4000840	Remember like the yonoid and cool spot and exactly and I'm saying make kids, but you
4000840	4004760	know what people and how about like Burger King did with their little sneak king and
4004760	4005760	all of that.
4005760	4009040	I saw a copy of sneak king at the flea market yesterday and I almost bought it.
4009040	4012160	Where the fuck is my goddamn connect games Burger King.
4012160	4013160	I've been waiting.
4013160	4015040	It's so may connect.
4015040	4016320	That's good advertising.
4016320	4018280	I think that is clever.
4018280	4021920	Those Burger King games were one of the best things I've seen actually.
4021920	4025520	I mean, although the games were stupid, I mean just the fact that they even made them
4025520	4026520	is quite astounding.
4026520	4029920	All right, quickly, I want to read this comment from chat and then we need to move on for
4029920	4030920	time.
4030920	4035500	Blender in our chat room says I bought a subway sandwich for the uncharted three freebies.
4035500	4037280	I got to say that was a really good promotion too.
4037280	4038280	It really was.
4038280	4039280	Yeah.
4039280	4042040	I bought a subway sandwich for those uncharted three freebies as well and they didn't give
4042040	4043040	up to me.
4043040	4046520	Yeah, but that's, that's your individual subways fault.
4046520	4048880	I've been like multiple subways for the stew.
4048880	4052760	I've been getting like the large, you know, they're all, yeah, by a large drink and you
4052760	4054600	get code for some battleship thing.
4054600	4059700	I have yet to get a fucking code and like five different subways, a battleship thing.
4059700	4060700	It's like for money.
4060700	4064960	I don't know, but it's, it's tying it with the movie, but not one of them.
4064960	4065960	I get it.
4065960	4070040	I get it because, because they're sub sandwiches.
4070040	4071040	Congratulations.
4071040	4075040	You figured it out.
4075040	4078680	That movie is gonna be such a sink.
4078680	4083200	I saw the best article on, oh no, they didn't, which is one of my favorite websites on the
4083200	4084320	entire internet.
4084320	4090120	It was an article that was just, here is the complete bits of dialogue that Rihanna had
4090120	4096000	in the movie battleship.
4096000	4097000	Oh my God.
4097000	4098680	It was just, it was great.
4098680	4099800	Anyway, let's move on.
4099800	4100800	Video game news.
4100800	4102000	How about something that's actually cool?
4102000	4103000	Less battleship.
4103000	4104000	Yes.
4104000	4105480	Let's move on to the Jima news.
4105480	4110560	There's been some artwork revealed for a particular game that I know a lot of people are super
4110560	4111560	excited about.
4111560	4112560	You know what that is?
4112560	4113560	No.
4113560	4115720	A new zone of the Enders.
4115720	4122400	It's the Enders project is in an experimental phase and he's trying to develop the game
4122400	4124720	using the Fox engine.
4124720	4129040	So hopefully we can see this out before too long.
4129040	4136280	Right now though, it's supposed to be a fully fledged sequel to Zone of the Enders, the
4136280	4137840	second runner.
4137840	4142440	And so hopefully we can see that out before too long.
4142440	4147960	And there's also been plenty of artwork tweeted by people who were at the press event.
4147960	4149240	I'd like to see a new zone of the Enders game.
4149240	4150240	That would be fun.
4150240	4151240	Yep.
4151240	4154520	And this event actually was specific for the Zone of the Enders HD collection.
4154520	4157040	What's up with all these HD collections?
4157040	4158040	People are buying them.
4158040	4159320	That's what's up with them.
4159320	4162720	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some games that are going to be coming
4162720	4167160	out a whole lot sooner, as in this week as we travel the world with release dates.
4167160	4168280	Loki, US.
4168280	4170200	There's not a whole lot coming out this week.
4170200	4174360	I mean, some re-releases I guess, or I don't know.
4174360	4180200	We've got Batman Arkham City Game of the Year edition, which is coming out this week, on
4180200	4188200	PS3 and Xbox 360, with that wonderful Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC and crap thrown in.
4188200	4189200	Hey!
4189200	4190200	I like how they talk about...
4190200	4194160	I know people genuinely excited about that, and I gotta say, it sounds pretty robust.
4194160	4195800	I'm into it.
4195800	4196800	Robust.
4196800	4197800	Like Catwoman.
4197800	4198800	It's robust.
4198800	4199800	Bust.
4199800	4200800	Whatever.
4200800	4201800	Whatever.
4201800	4209640	Let's see, other fun things this week, Dear Drive, Legends on the 3DS.
4209640	4213040	Get your deer hunting on in 3D.
4213040	4217640	Atelier Maruru, The Apprentice of Arland on PlayStation 3 this week.
4217640	4221440	Resistance, Burning Skies on the Vita.
4221440	4222440	Might have to check that out.
4222440	4226640	That looks pretty neat.
4226640	4227760	There's not a whole lot this week.
4227760	4231280	A lot of it getting cancelled.
4231280	4234480	Max Payne 3.
4234480	4235480	That's right.
4235480	4236480	The first is this Friday.
4236480	4242960	Max Payne 3, Special Edition and the Regular Edition on PC coming out as well.
4242960	4243960	And that's it.
4243960	4245800	Alright, let's travel to Japan.
4245800	4249800	Check out the games that are coming out over there in Japan on the Nintendo 3DS.
4249800	4254040	I don't think there's a Disney game this week, but for some reason a bunch of character cases
4254040	4255040	are coming out.
4255040	4258320	So if you've ever wanted to stitch character case, import one from Japan, because there's
4258320	4261400	a bunch of those coming out there from Hori.
4261400	4264440	Must tie in to Dream Drop Distance somehow, it must.
4264440	4268640	But what is coming out on the 3DS, this is kind of a big deal.
4268640	4272200	Dragon Quest Monsters, Terry No Wonderland 3D.
4272200	4276520	So it's not in the main series of Dragon Quest games, but still it carries the name.
4276520	4279760	It is from Square Enix, so it will be a little bit of a deal there.
4279760	4282660	Guild 01 from level 5 comes out as well.
4282660	4286000	That's all again on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
4286000	4289880	Taking a look at the other handheld real quick, the Vita, nothing this week.
4289880	4294740	The next big game is Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny on June the 7th.
4294740	4300200	Taking a look at the consoles real quick on the Playstation 3, Atelier Meru Alchemist
4300200	4304400	of Arland 3 gets a price drop into the best collection.
4304400	4307920	That's also Atelier Rorona gets that same price drop.
4307920	4314360	Coming out from Sega this week, Jisen Pachi Slot Hishihoho Hokuto no Ken F Sekimatsu Kaishu
4314360	4319960	Seisu Densetsu, it's basically another Pachino game, Pachinko, Pachinko game.
4319960	4320960	Not like Al Pachinko.
4320960	4321960	I heard legend in there somewhere.
4321960	4324040	Yeah, it's a Sega Pachinko game.
4324040	4325720	That's what you get.
4325720	4331200	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13, but that is in English, but it's getting a Japanese release.
4331200	4334240	And hey, Portal 2 gets a price reduction, so if you want to hear what GLaDOS sounds
4334240	4337280	like in Japanese, there you go.
4337280	4341920	Lastly in the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Portal 2 gets that same price reduction, and
4341920	4343440	that's really it.
4343440	4344760	How about the UK, Darkstalker?
4344760	4347160	Three things.
4347160	4354040	Mad Riders for Xbox 360 and Resistance Burning Skies for Vita on the 30th, and then we have
4354040	4358000	on June 1st, Max Payne 3 for PC.
4358000	4359000	That's about it.
4359000	4362760	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the
4362760	4363760	week.
4363760	4364760	But first, Loki.
4364760	4365760	Ah, yes.
4365760	4371420	Um, so let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of funny, uh, Kinect.
4371420	4377160	They have new technology now, new technology, where they can detect you sitting down.
4377160	4383880	That's right, Kinect Software Development Kit Update 1.5 now features the ability to
4383880	4388480	Kinect with you sitting on the couch.
4388480	4389480	And uh...
4389480	4392480	Now, it can't tell if I'm wearing pants or not, right?
4392480	4396400	Because you know I have this legit fear about the Kinect, that if I, you know, it's my house,
4396400	4400200	I'll do what I want, and if I'm sitting in front of the Xbox 360 not wearing pants and
4400200	4404280	playing Minecraft, I don't want that image broadcast to the internet, and I have this
4404280	4405280	fear in the back of my mind.
4405280	4411440	I put a little box in front of the Kinect when I don't want to be seen by the internet.
4411440	4415600	Um, yeah, they don't have that ability in here.
4415600	4420440	It's not one of the listed features, but uh, other fun stuff, they've got a development
4420440	4426440	kit for face tracking, um, also some human interface guidelines and other improvements.
4426440	4434200	Um, also, they're saying that, um, you know, they have full seated skeletal tracking mode,
4434200	4441000	which is, you know, to track people sitting down, and uh, they said also that um, I think
4441000	4446720	this is more, obviously this is only on, you know, PC, but I think a little bit, since
4446720	4451560	most people on PC are probably sitting down to interface with stuff, I would hate to have
4451560	4457160	to stand up to, I don't know, read an email or something like that with Kinect.
4457160	4463360	Well it'll be nice too that now you can play Kinect without actually having to move.
4463360	4465840	It's kind of the nice, you know, antithesis.
4465840	4472000	I'm pretty sure, I mean, the Kinect does detect you sitting down, um, like for some things,
4472000	4476880	like you can browse menus and stuff like that on the Xbox Kinect, just, uh, I think sitting
4476880	4477880	down.
4477880	4484520	I can stand up to browse video menus and stuff like that, um, then again, I'm not, you know,
4484520	4490080	stupid enough to hook up Kinect to do that when I can go, huh, controller is faster,
4490080	4495960	you know, seriously, why would I need, I never understood why I need to browse those menus
4495960	4503720	with my arm when I can just put the controller in my hand and just do that, I mean, I, it's
4503720	4506240	faster, it really is faster.
4506240	4512520	Voice searches, that's kinda cool, but, you know, moving my hand around to select things,
4512520	4515600	that is slower.
4515600	4519600	Well we will see what this brings into games later on, although couldn't you play Joyride
4519600	4520600	sitting down?
4520600	4523120	Was it supposed to be able to see your hands driving the car?
4523120	4524840	Um, I didn't play that long.
4524840	4527160	Maybe it's because it was only looking at your hands, it wasn't looking at the rest
4527160	4528800	of your body, I don't know.
4528800	4532880	Well there's somewhat of an in-joke amongst the, uh, community of Konami fans that have
4532880	4537200	been following them for some time and it's called Konami Will Sue, but maybe this week
4537200	4542120	the joke should be changed to Konami Will Be Sued, because Konami was sued this week
4542120	4546920	and, uh, you'd be pretty impressed what it's for, it's pretty crazy.
4546920	4552560	City National Bank is the one that's filed the suit against Konami and Autumn Games,
4552560	4557480	and it's over fraud, and the reason why is because the bank hasn't received any return
4557480	4563080	on a 15 million dollar line of credit that it approved to both Konami and Autumn Games,
4563080	4570080	and the court documents claim that the financial state of Autumn and Konami were faults at
4570080	4574520	the time that they were made and that defendants never had any intention of repaying the loan
4574520	4576120	as promised.
4576120	4580840	That's all a quote from the court documents and so is this, rather than paying game-related
4580840	4586980	proceeds directly to CNB or City National Bank as agreed, defendant have kept all game-related
4586980	4592520	proceeds for themselves and have refused to remit any such proceeds to City National Bank.
4592520	4594720	Here's what I think, here's what I think the problem is.
4594720	4598960	I think that they think that those games, or, you know, Def Jam Rapstar was going to
4598960	4604060	be successful, and they're like, where's our percentage of, you know, of the profits?
4604060	4605960	Why are we only getting, like, ten dollars?
4605960	4609880	Well, that is your percentage, actually.
4609880	4612560	You can't divide by zero, stupid!
4612560	4616560	Sorry, uh, that's how much, that's how many copies we sold.
4616560	4618640	You get a big fat check for twenty dollars.
4618640	4622540	By the way, that's not the first time there's been a lawsuit over this game, because what
4622540	4629160	happened in March, EMI Music Group actually also filed a suit over the game's licensed
4629160	4635720	tracks were not supposed to be there, apparently, so this game has caused a lot more headache,
4635720	4639720	probably, for these companies than it was worth, although I do still stand by it, even
4639720	4644800	though not everybody's into rap music, it really wasn't a bad music game.
4644800	4648800	It was really kind of too bad that all this shit has fallen out because of it, because
4648800	4652800	it really wasn't a bad music game, if, you know, especially if you actually like rap,
4652800	4653800	so.
4653800	4658660	Alright, let's travel back to a time when we didn't have to read about all these lawsuits
4658660	4662760	going on, because there was no internet, or I guess in the particular case of this game,
4662760	4666520	there was a little internet, but there were no lawsuits.
4666520	4667680	There were no laws.
4667680	4672160	There were no, yes, right, there were no laws in this game, actually, I think this is a
4672160	4673160	perfect thing.
4673160	4674160	It was lawless land.
4674160	4679360	Let's travel back in time and visit the classic game of the week.
4679360	4685280	Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks,
4685280	4691280	hey, you ungrateful little brat, so you're newfangled crap, go back and play something
4691280	4693720	old school, like this.
4693720	4695360	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4695360	4701840	There was a game that used to eat up all of my time in early 2000, and I would sit and
4701840	4706720	point and click and click and click and click and click, and my husband was so pissed off
4706720	4708680	because I was deaf all night playing this damn game.
4708680	4709680	Diablo 2?
4709680	4710680	No.
4710680	4713720	Keep in mind, I didn't play the first two Diablo games.
4713720	4719800	This is Ragnarok Online, which was my crack, and I have, from time to time, been known
4719800	4721760	to go back on a free server.
4721760	4727400	I am also one of the people who basically has a permanent account on IRO, the International
4727400	4730440	Ragnarok Online, because I played in the beta.
4730440	4734640	I played in the Korean beta, I played in the Japanese beta, and I played in the US beta.
4734640	4737360	Yeah, I've played a lot of Ragnarok.
4737360	4738760	And my last, I think-
4738760	4741920	Fuck, even I remember this music.
4741920	4745160	I remember when I gave you the hair bow, Rob, when you were playing with me.
4745160	4747160	I was very pretty with that little hair bow.
4747160	4748160	You were lovely.
4748160	4749160	And you had the red hair.
4749160	4750160	The red boy hair.
4750160	4751640	Back when my hair actually looked like that.
4751640	4752640	Yeah.
4752640	4757760	But I played the ton of this, and I think the last server I played on was EssenceRO.
4757760	4760480	Good server if anyone's looking for a private server.
4760480	4761480	Great people.
4761480	4764320	Anyway, it's made by Gravity.
4764320	4771680	It is based off of the manhwa, which is called Ragnarok, and there was a Ragnarok 3 animation
4771680	4772680	based off of it.
4772680	4776320	It was actually a pretty, pretty good little anime.
4776320	4779320	It really captured the game very well.
4779320	4785940	You've got different types of gameplay that are in that you have PvE, you have guild versus
4785940	4788400	guild, and PvP.
4788400	4793040	So you can initiate PvP anywhere.
4793040	4797480	Guild versus guild, I really, really, really liked that function.
4797480	4800880	Because it was a big capture the flag kind of thing.
4800880	4804280	And I think that's something that-
4804280	4811240	And now while I'm not a PvP fan, that is kind of the only reason why I like Battlegrounds
4811240	4812240	at all in WoW.
4812240	4815960	It's because it kind of reminds me of this, even though I didn't do it that often.
4815960	4818040	Because honestly, I was a PvE person.
4818040	4820760	I'm always a PvE person.
4820760	4830860	It's sprite based, it is with different 3D environments, and you basically travel all
4830860	4836280	over this little world in the game getting different creatures.
4836280	4842040	And as long as I played this damn game, Rob, I have not been everywhere in it.
4842040	4843040	It is big.
4843040	4849120	I mean, yeah, I've been to every needed thing on the main map, but there's all the little
4849120	4854640	caves and the dungeons and the special areas, and I haven't been everywhere in the game.
4854640	4860480	Although I have been to certain areas of the game many times, like the freaking toy factory.
4860480	4861480	Or pronterra.
4861480	4862480	Pronterra.
4862480	4864120	Warp to pront, please.
4864120	4865640	Warp to pront, please.
4865640	4871240	I'm glad that they took out that warping thing, because that was such a pain.
4871240	4876520	Usually priests could teleport, and they could open warp portals, and they did something
4876520	4878560	because that's not there anymore.
4878560	4888160	But yeah, you also, it really was based heavily off of Norse mythology, and you have different
4888160	4889800	classes.
4889800	4895620	They also offered transcendent classes that keep going forward.
4895620	4899560	So yeah, with the different versions, you have your jobs.
4899560	4903800	Swordsman starts off as a novice, and then you actually can become a super novice, where
4903800	4906960	you get different aspects of other classes.
4906960	4912140	Then you have a swordman who can become a knight or a crusader, and then rebirth classes
4912140	4916280	where you start over and rebuild them with more goodies.
4916280	4922260	So basically, your first job class is swordsman, mage, archer, merchant, thief, acolyte.
4922260	4926800	And then you can expand to guns, you also have expanded classes such as gunslinger,
4926800	4930600	or taequan, which, playing a taequan was actually really fun.
4930600	4934600	The chat room was getting upset with the music, because it's the only music you ever heard
4934600	4938160	in the game, so I switched it, because there was more than one song in Ragnarok Online.
4938160	4942960	Oh I love that music, that's Juno, isn't it?
4942960	4943960	I love that area.
4943960	4944960	Anyway.
4944960	4946640	I thought you might approve.
4946640	4950480	After the 2-1, you can actually become a knight, wizard, hunter, blacksmith, assassin, or priest.
4950480	4953840	I played a blacksmith for a while named Tony Stark, just saying.
4953840	4957040	Because you can get mecha later on, too.
4957040	4961320	Moving forward, you also have the 2-2 classes, which is crusader, sage, bard dancer, alchemist,
4961320	4963200	rogue, and monk.
4963200	4967200	And then the further go, once they rebirth, you have the 2-1 job, which is lord knight,
4967200	4972360	high wizard, sniper, master smith, who gets a mecha, that's awesome, assassin, cross,
4972360	4973600	and high priest.
4973600	4978440	Or the 2-2 job classes, which are paladin, scholar, minstrel, gypsy, biochemist, stalker,
4978440	4979440	and champion.
4979440	4983760	I actually have to say that minstrels are pretty fun.
4983760	4989720	For female ones, you had a dancer, who basically looks like a harem chick.
4989720	4991320	There's a soundtrack come out.
4991320	4993840	There's all kinds of stuff for this.
4993840	5000640	There are pay-to-play servers, and then there's tons of freemium stuff that goes on with it,
5000640	5001640	too.
5001640	5004220	Like the caffer shop, you can buy different stuff.
5004220	5010880	With free-to-play servers, basically, you can play for free, but to support the servers,
5010880	5015280	they usually have special freebie goods, or special goods that you can pay for.
5015280	5018880	Like for one server I played on, there used to be these little dolls you could get that
5018880	5019880	sit on top of your head.
5019880	5020880	They were selling doll hats.
5020880	5023560	They had a sprite artist who would make doll hats.
5023560	5027100	And you paid like 20 bucks, and you got a doll hat.
5027100	5031080	And it was good because it kept the server paid for, because it does cost money to keep
5031080	5032080	these going off.
5032080	5040560	There's also Ragnarok Mobile, that you can use to focus on your characters.
5040560	5043720	And then there was the Ragnarok RPG that I've been playing.
5043720	5050040	And there's a version on Game Boy that I, um, you got me the Japanese version of it,
5050040	5051040	didn't you?
5051040	5052040	Yeah.
5052040	5053040	I played the crap out of that.
5053040	5059140	Because I could read Prontera, and I knew where I was on the damn map.
5059140	5062800	And I think an English version of that since came out, too.
5062800	5065080	But it is really fun.
5065080	5070000	I would say that if you're looking for just like a little freebie RPG to get into, Ragnarok
5070000	5071320	Online is really fun.
5071320	5075960	And like my favorite class still to this day is Assassin, because it's like pow pow pow
5075960	5076960	pow.
5076960	5077960	It's just all speed.
5077960	5078960	It was awesome.
5078960	5079960	So yeah, my game is Ragnarok Online.
5079960	5086080	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Ragnarok Online for the PC.
5086080	5089000	And various spinoffs on other devices that Darsak are named.
5089000	5090000	Yes.
5090000	5091320	A game I haven't played in about 10 years.
5091320	5094880	I have, I've been playing the one on the iPhone lately, and it's pretty fun.
5094880	5095880	That's cool.
5095880	5096880	Yeah.
5096880	5097880	I might have to check that out.
5097880	5099480	You play a total- On my shiny new iPad.
5099480	5100880	You play a total asshole, though.
5100880	5101880	He's so fun.
5101880	5102880	Good times.
5102880	5105760	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5105760	5112240	We're going to take a break here live as we are taping our episode number 458B here live
5112240	5113880	on May the 27th of 2012.
5113880	5115400	We're going to take a quick break here.
5115400	5116400	But don't go anywhere, guys.
5116400	5118120	We've got plenty more show to come.
5118120	5119760	We've got some rapid fire news.
5119760	5125480	We have the mailbag FUs of the week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio
5125480	5127640	on Skype are all coming up in a little while.
5127640	5128640	So stay tuned.
5128640	5129640	Don't go anywhere.
5129640	5138040	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5138040	5140520	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5140520	5145600	We are live on this Memorial Day weekend, May the 27th of 2012, with episode number
5145600	5148340	458B of our podcast.
5148340	5150160	Why is it episode 458B?
5150160	5153600	Well, go back and listen to the first part of the show if you want to know why it is
5153600	5154600	458B.
5154600	5159800	Anyhow, we're going to get back in with some rapid fire news here.
5159800	5167360	Again, I just want to really plug the VOG conference on Friday at 7 Pacific 10 Eastern
5167360	5169120	live at vognetwork.com.
5169120	5173040	And I'm getting some people that are just sending me their ideas for VOG stuff, and
5173040	5174040	I love it.
5174040	5175360	And I know Bobby wants to hear it.
5175360	5176760	Dark Soccer would like to hear it.
5176760	5181920	Shit, anybody you can talk to that's one of the hosts on VOG somewhere, Loki, Travis,
5181920	5184200	whoever, we love hearing the ideas.
5184200	5187600	And I'm talking to somebody about one idea right now, I'm like, well, that is a good
5187600	5189940	idea actually, yes, we should do that.
5189940	5194000	And so I love it because it's, you know, just like Orange Lounge Radio, where every gamer
5194000	5198840	has a voice was never really just about us, VOG network isn't really just about us either.
5198840	5202880	So it's about me, everybody know me and my fabulousness.
5202880	5203880	Stop hating, Rob.
5203880	5204880	Stop being a parody.
5204880	5205880	All right.
5205880	5206880	Stop hating.
5206880	5207880	Let's move on.
5207880	5208880	It's about the gaming news.
5208880	5212980	Now we're going to travel around and check out some quick stories in a segment we call
5212980	5214400	Rapid Fire News.
5214400	5215400	Loki.
5215400	5216600	All right.
5216600	5220000	Let's talk a little bit about some upcoming games.
5220000	5225160	XCOM Enemy Unknown actually has been announced to be coming out on October 9th.
5225160	5230800	Now I thought, you know, when I first saw this that this means, ah, damn, I guess, you
5230800	5237640	know, I guess we're not going to have any Grand Theft Auto 5 game announcement for October.
5237640	5242640	I'm not so sure if that's going to be the case anymore because actually there was an
5242640	5249520	announcement for, was it Take-Two put out their estimates for their fiscal years and
5249520	5260280	for 2013, which would cover up through now through, was it March of, March 31st, 2013,
5260280	5263660	and then we'll play some awesome music.
5263660	5270800	They have about $700 million or, you know, unaccounted revenue in there and even if like
5270800	5274000	some of these games do really well, I don't think they're going to hit that spot.
5274000	5282000	So people are thinking, maybe that's Grand Theft Auto 5 in there somewhere, which honestly
5282000	5287600	if it were to come out in October, it would, it probably wouldn't compete very well.
5287600	5290400	You know, they wouldn't, wouldn't cannibalize stuff.
5290400	5293280	So God, I hope it's October.
5293280	5301880	Anyways, so yes, XCOM Enemy Unknown, October 9th and I guess 13th internationally as well.
5301880	5304000	So pretty cool.
5304000	5312360	And then of course, there's rumors, spoiler, I don't know, that EA's next Need for Speed
5312360	5316720	game is actually going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted.
5316720	5318200	Perhaps a reboot of that franchise.
5318200	5319720	Wait, they already had a Most Wanted.
5319720	5320720	Yes, they did.
5320720	5323560	They also had a Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but that didn't stop them from having that
5323560	5325320	last year.
5325320	5331800	So perhaps Most Wanted could be, you know, put out again.
5331800	5334460	You know, a new title with the same, I hope it's not the same thing.
5334460	5335920	It's like Apple's methodology.
5335920	5337600	It's the new Most Wanted.
5337600	5338600	Yeah.
5338600	5339600	So.
5339600	5340600	More Wanted-er.
5340600	5343840	Maybe Most Wanted 2, I don't know.
5343840	5349280	Apparently there's, you know, a schedule going around showing, you know, that the game's
5349280	5356880	going to be shown on like EA's booth and also apparently it was, there was a Twitch TV feed
5356880	5360960	or something like that for E3 that also has that listed on there as well amongst some
5360960	5363640	other TVA titles from Ubisoft.
5363640	5368120	So yeah, we'll probably see something from, you know, EA for Need for Speed Most Wanted
5368120	5372200	whether it be, I hope it's not the same damn title because that's going to be confusing
5372200	5373680	because it didn't come out that long ago.
5373680	5376300	That was only like five years ago.
5376300	5379440	That's not, that's not that long in game time.
5379440	5385160	And last but not least, Carmageddon Reincarnation has hit their goal with ten days left to go
5385160	5393200	and of course, you know, I guess that means we're going to be getting a remade Carmageddon
5393200	5394200	game.
5394200	5397840	Also they're saying that they're going to be adding some DLC to it now and probably
5397840	5402540	going to be setting some different stretch goals for that as well and, you know, funding
5402540	5406600	will be done in a few more days.
5406600	5409640	All right, let's move on with some other news.
5409640	5412760	You ever been to a website where you have to punch in CAPTCHA?
5412760	5416120	You know, like if you want to like download something or if you want to register for an
5416120	5418280	account, you have to put in CAPTCHA.
5418280	5420560	And sometimes the words are very like nonsense.
5420560	5424320	I love this mock up where somebody put kill me in the CAPTCHA.
5424320	5425320	Well I love this.
5425320	5428200	Apparently there is- I had destroy enemies once.
5428200	5429200	Did you really?
5429200	5430200	Yes I did.
5430200	5431200	That's awesome.
5431200	5436000	I guess there is a new Detroit based startup company and they're called Are You a Human?
5436000	5441880	And what they aim to do, they want to replace the CAPTCHA box that people use with mini
5441880	5443340	games.
5443340	5444340	Why not?
5444340	5445340	It accomplishes the same thing.
5445340	5447880	You wouldn't be able to beat the game if you weren't actually a human.
5447880	5452600	The tool they're developing is called PlayThrough and it's going to allow a website owner to
5452600	5456000	fight bots and spammers by using simple mini games.
5456000	5460960	For example, there could be a level where you put tools in a toolbox or you put toppings
5460960	5462880	on a pizza.
5462880	5467200	Some websites that are already using this, Quicken Loans and Fathead.
5467200	5468960	I don't know what Fathead does, but-
5468960	5472080	Fathead makes giant posters on the wall of sports figures.
5472080	5473080	Oh.
5473080	5474160	That's why I had no idea who they were.
5474160	5475160	I don't own any of those.
5475160	5476680	But I do have a sweet Tron poster.
5476680	5480720	I don't own any of those either, but the reason I know they do that is because they also have
5480720	5484920	that option for your Xbox Live avatar and I'm like why the fuck would I want a six foot
5484920	5486520	tall picture of my avatar on the wall.
5486520	5488920	I really have a big problem with your Tron poster.
5488920	5489920	What?
5489920	5495120	Because it looks like all those little teleporting effects are just really bad use of the blur
5495120	5496120	tool.
5496120	5497120	Well, I'm sorry.
5497120	5501880	Speaking of Tron, I did happen to see that that episode of Tron Uprising was on Disney
5501880	5505760	last night and I was like, ooh, that's right, we're only a couple of weeks away from actual
5505760	5506760	new episodes.
5506760	5510280	Well, you know what I found out is that funny enough, a week from tonight, they are going
5510280	5513600	to be doing some type of kickoff event at Downtown Disney.
5513600	5515300	Guess where I'm going to be, yo?
5515300	5517160	So I plan to bring you a vlog-
5517160	5518760	Better bring me Tron stuff.
5518760	5519760	I'm going to-
5519760	5521680	We're going to have a neon blue carpet.
5521680	5528560	I am so going, and there will be a full report on vlog for sure, so I'm not expecting much
5528560	5529560	though.
5529560	5532200	For all I know, they're just going to have a giant screen out in the middle of Downtown
5532200	5533200	Disney that's playing it.
5533200	5534200	So we'll see.
5534200	5535200	Elijah wouldn't be there.
5535200	5536200	You're going to get kidnapped by a recognizer.
5536200	5537200	I'd be alright with that.
5537200	5538200	Paul Rubins was there.
5538200	5539620	Oh my gosh, it'd be awesome.
5539620	5540620	So we'll see.
5540620	5541620	We'll see.
5541620	5542620	I'm not going to hold my breath.
5542620	5543620	He needs to record a bumper.
5543620	5545480	You know who was at Disneyland, by the way, last weekend when we were there?
5545480	5547800	Lady Gaga.
5547800	5548800	Shut the front door.
5548800	5550600	She was posted on Facebook.
5550600	5551600	Isn't she like touring?
5551600	5556560	Like she was supposed to go to Indonesia and there's the whole hub-a-loo going on there?
5556560	5559400	There was a post on her Facebook thing that was at Disneyland.
5559400	5561280	Well maybe she was at like Hong Kong Disney.
5561280	5562600	I don't know, but-
5562600	5563920	I don't think Hong Kong Disney exists anymore.
5563920	5564920	We looked for her.
5564920	5565920	Yeah, they have.
5565920	5567600	It used to be an airport years ago.
5567600	5570000	Anyhow, don't ask me how I know that.
5570000	5571000	That's Shanghai Disney.
5571000	5572000	Alright, moving on.
5572000	5575760	Uh, rumors about a new Castlevania game on the 3DS.
5575760	5580280	Apparently the name has leaked out, Castlevania Mirror of Faith.
5580280	5582800	Supposedly this is a game that's going to be shown at E3.
5582800	5583800	Makes sense to me.
5583800	5586480	It's about time there's a new Castlevania game out on a handheld.
5586480	5588480	I have no reason to disbelieve this.
5588480	5589480	Yeah.
5589480	5593920	Especially because, it's funny because this particular site is a site Nintendo Netherlands
5593920	5595000	or whatever.
5595000	5599140	You might remember, OLR blew the story on that about six years ago.
5599140	5601560	One of the DS games we had the exclusive on.
5601560	5603340	So I have no reason to doubt them.
5603340	5604340	They're sloppy.
5604340	5607040	Let's get out.
5607040	5610240	It would be interesting if this information that got out is also true.
5610240	5612980	It has to do with Wii U details.
5612980	5619880	These are very specific details from Ubisoft Milan apparently leaked these details.
5619880	5621400	It's Wii U related information.
5621400	5623920	It was found on an Italian message board.
5623920	5625240	Some very specific details.
5625240	5628640	Now granted this could all be fanboy wank, but I don't know.
5628640	5632480	They're claiming it's directly from Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft would know some of this
5632480	5634860	shit because they are doing some of the launch games.
5634860	5641000	Which include for Ubisoft Rayman Legends, The Avengers, Assassin's Creed 3 and Just
5641000	5642120	Dance 4.
5642120	5646280	A game called Killer Freaks from Outer Space, supposed to arrive a few weeks after launch.
5646280	5650360	Those are some pretty specific, I mean granted about three of those are a duh, but Killer
5650360	5651360	Freaks from Outer Space.
5651360	5652360	You can't guess that.
5652360	5653360	That was announced at E3 last year.
5653360	5654360	Oh was it?
5654360	5655360	I don't remember that one.
5655360	5656520	Yeah they even had video of it.
5656520	5659920	Alright, so maybe it's just somebody using logic, but we'll see.
5659920	5662880	It looks like a cross between the Rabbids and Critters.
5662880	5665720	Like the Rabbids were like evil alien things.
5665720	5667560	Wii U does DirectX 11.
5667560	5669720	It's already running Unreal Engine 4.
5669720	5671280	Two gigs of RAM.
5671280	5674200	560 megs of that dedicated to the OS.
5674200	5678680	November 23rd, the launch date, but remember that's coming out of Milan so could be a little
5678680	5680840	bit around there for other regions.
5680840	5687400	Launch price hasn't yet been decided, but they're saying 350 to 450 which tells me 399.
5687400	5690040	Multiple versions of the console out there with developers.
5690040	5693920	Graphics being powered by a Radeon HD 6770 chipset.
5693920	5697120	Assassin's Creed 3 is 60 frames a second at 1080p.
5697120	5701240	It is only running 720p on the other consoles right now.
5701240	5704320	November 23rd would be a Friday, I don't know if they'd launch it.
5704320	5706240	But that's, again, that's Milan.
5706240	5707820	That's not America.
5707820	5710080	So there's some time is some shift with the days.
5710080	5711080	And you know the other thing.
5711080	5712080	Add those Italians.
5712080	5717080	Well here's the problem I have with Ubisoft, this information coming from Ubisoft Milan,
5717080	5723360	because Ubisoft Milan would be a, it's basically a portion of the company that does development
5723360	5724360	for certain games.
5724360	5728240	So which game are they working on that they would be privy to this information?
5728240	5734840	Because, you know, Ubisoft Milan, let's see, let's, I'm sorry, I can't hear Ubisoft Milan
5734840	5742480	without hearing in the back of my head RuPaul saying, London, Paris, Milan.
5742480	5745320	I fully expect nobody listening to this show will get that joke.
5745320	5748000	But maybe one, maybe one person.
5748000	5749280	Alright.
5749280	5753560	The Wii U comes with pre-installed software, which really wouldn't be a stretch for Nintendo.
5753560	5757280	You know, they have some basic shit on all their platforms, like the Mii Plaza, for example
5757280	5759320	on 3DS.
5759320	5765160	Most interesting about this, Valve working on a digital distribution platform and portal
5765160	5766160	ports.
5766160	5769840	That could be very interesting if Valve is involved with the Wii.
5769840	5775400	That's going to bring a heck of a lot of, you know, like, core gamer quote unquote oomph
5775400	5776400	to the Wii U.
5776400	5777400	That would be amazing.
5777400	5780840	One other thing I'll say here, the new button supposedly has some link to the Wii Vitality
5780840	5781840	sensor.
5781840	5783720	So maybe a new form of it or something like that.
5783720	5787840	Well I figured it would be a biometric button.
5787840	5793960	Alright so, that's it for the Wii U rumors, so let's move on with some more rapid fire
5793960	5794960	news.
5794960	5802520	Okay, Rob, well, how about some stuff having to do with touch screen graffiti controls
5802520	5804400	for Jet Set Radio.
5804400	5806360	This is for the Vita release.
5806360	5810760	Basically, well, and there's still not a date on it yet, but they're saying that they're
5810760	5818400	bringing in touch screen controls and camera integration so that I guess you can, for customizing
5818400	5820860	your tags in the game.
5820860	5822780	So that should be pretty cool.
5822780	5829480	And then this is the thing that I lusted over yesterday, and, oh my god I want this so bad,
5829480	5842200	it like seriously makes me moist, the Street Fighter 25th anniversary collector set that
5842200	5854040	comes in a big black box has a Ryu figure, 15 discs that includes on it, Super Street
5854040	5858480	Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, Super Street
5858480	5863320	Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, and the DLC, and Street Fighter Cross Tekken, and the DLC with
5863320	5868040	a documentary, two anime movies, the full Street Fighter animated series, and 11 discs
5868040	5869040	of music.
5869040	5871880	And it has a light up Ryu statue and Ryu's belt.
5871880	5873360	That is too much Street Fighter.
5873360	5875120	For 150 bucks.
5875120	5876120	You know what?
5876120	5877120	I want it.
5877120	5880440	Of course you do, because you are a consumer whore.
5880440	5881440	And how.
5881440	5884720	But really, I don't care because I freaking love Street Fighter.
5884720	5890600	I'm looking at this set and oh my dear god, it just, I'm literally moist right now, I
5890600	5893240	can't help it.
5893240	5894760	So how about Harry Potter stuff?
5894760	5895760	How about it?
5895760	5899760	Um, apparently there's going to be a Harry Potter for Kinect and there's a trailer out.
5899760	5904160	It's got a really creepy face capture thing on it.
5904160	5907600	It does, but it actually looks pretty good.
5907600	5914880	As long, I, it looks good in the trailer, but then I'm like, the games are never really
5914880	5916220	like that.
5916220	5918360	Just make the damn MMO already.
5918360	5920160	You know what?
5920160	5927280	Screw Harry Potter because fucking Ryu, no he's underage, statue, not anymore, statues,
5927280	5934720	statue of Ryu that lights up with, it even has a certificate of authen-fucking-ticity.
5934720	5935720	How can you pass that off?
5935720	5937840	So you know it's authen-fucking-tistic.
5937840	5941400	It'll go on my wall and I will stare at Ryu for hours because that, you know, that was
5941400	5946080	my first video game crush was Ryu when I was a little kid.
5946080	5948000	Aww, that's kind of adorable.
5948000	5949000	Yep.
5949000	5950000	Okay.
5950000	5951000	I'm done.
5951000	5952000	I'm spent.
5952000	5953000	I'm really spent.
5953000	5954000	Alright.
5954000	5964440	Let's move on to the foogle question of the week.
5964440	5968720	The foogle question of the week is a segment of our show where we ask a question on Facebook
5968720	5973880	and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.
5973880	5974880	We didn't ask one tonight.
5974880	5978300	Some of you might have said, hey, I didn't see a new question on Facebook or Google this
5978300	5979300	week.
5979300	5981920	That's because, you know, we never got to read last week's answers because of the crash
5981920	5983880	and it was a pretty timely question.
5983880	5986080	So I want to go through some of those right now.
5986080	5989680	So we're going to start on our Google Plus page.
5989680	5991080	Shit.
5991080	5994680	I just dropped that brand new iPad of mine.
5994680	5997040	How convenient.
5997040	5998040	That's why I have a case on it.
5998040	5999040	Well, here's the weird thing.
5999040	6000760	I can't access Facebook right now.
6000760	6002360	Can you access Facebook, Logan?
6002360	6003640	Can I access Facebook?
6003640	6004640	Oh, there it went.
6004640	6005640	It just went.
6005640	6006640	Okay, good.
6006640	6008520	Because I was getting worried that I was going to miss the questions here.
6008520	6009520	Alright, anyhow.
6009520	6014520	The question of the week, more and more games are incorporating multiplayer into their games.
6014520	6016560	For example, Mass Effect 3.
6016560	6019920	Some in the industry have been quoted as saying that multiplayer is essential in this day
6019920	6022120	and age to having a successful game.
6022120	6026080	How important do you feel that multiplayer is to the games you purchase?
6026080	6029040	Have you ever been swayed on a game purchase because of the fact that it did or did not
6029040	6031240	have multiplayer?
6031240	6035080	Reddertainment answers the question and says, multiplayer is irrelevant to me due to my
6035080	6041040	ISP being fucking incompetent, PSN being incompetent, and me canceling Xbox Live Gold as part of
6041040	6042040	my effort to buy a house.
6042040	6047080	So in other words, the world is out to get him.
6047080	6052280	Vilagas responds and says, these are all from Google Plus again, Uncharted, Gears, Halo,
6052280	6053280	etc.
6053280	6056000	All have some form of competitive multiplayer that I've never tried.
6056000	6060920	I only buy games for the single player component due to the rampant negativity on the online
6060920	6061920	services.
6061920	6065000	I do love co-op multiplayer with my family or friends.
6065000	6067840	Tell Jamie I apologize for my bad grammar and punctuation.
6067840	6071960	Well, you apologize to the wrong person.
6071960	6072960	And I'm mad.
6072960	6073960	No, I'm just kidding.
6073960	6074960	You actually didn't do a bad job.
6074960	6078040	I'm, I'm, I have pretty bad grammar myself, so I'm usually pretty forgiving.
6078040	6079040	All right.
6079040	6083760	And lastly, Jim from who he was supposed to be here last week to answer this in person,
6083760	6086440	but he decided to go on Google Plus and answer instead.
6086440	6090920	Flaco Jones, I don't care much for multiplayer modes in games because I'm all about the story
6090920	6094260	and it doesn't make much sense story wise when there are seven Nathan Drakes running
6094260	6096600	around shooting other players at the same time.
6096600	6104360	Plus, I rent or buy used, so I don't get even get to play multiplayer thanks to online passes.
6104360	6108120	Let's go to the Facebook community now that Facebook is working for me at facebook.com
6108120	6113180	slash orange lounge radio and read some of the answers that you guys sent us over there.
6113180	6120260	And we're going to start off with a reply from DDR dollar bill who says never as in
6120260	6125120	has you ever been swayed, never multiplayer, never made or break a purchase for me.
6125120	6127400	It was nice, but it wasn't life or death either.
6127400	6132840	And it wouldn't change a game grade by one point if it was included nor excluded JV Mon
6132840	6135520	says I almost never play multiplayer online.
6135520	6139720	And if I do, it's only with friends who usually don't buy the same games as me.
6139720	6143900	Even then cross game chat fixes that problem and we can hang out while playing.
6143900	6145220	So would it sway me?
6145220	6147040	Not at all.
6147040	6152240	So we have a lot of people that are like no, no, no, never, never, never.
6152240	6154240	Let's go to an answer from Red the Haze.
6154240	6159100	I've no problems with added multiplayer as long as it's good, builds on the single player
6159100	6164880	game and adds to the experience but has no negative consequences to the single player.
6164880	6169360	Just like when I bought Mass Effect 3 when it was on sale for 30 bucks just for multiplayer
6169360	6174420	even though I haven't played Mass Effect 2, but I plan to play 3 once I get to.
6174420	6177640	So that's somebody who kind of went and bought a game that's more known as a single player
6177640	6180940	experience for the multiplayer component.
6180940	6182400	Kind of interesting.
6182400	6187160	Panaxium responded and said I do enjoy multiplayer as an option but only when the production
6187160	6188420	quality is high.
6188420	6190600	An example is Metroid Prime 2.
6190600	6194360	It included multiplayer but it was half-assed and got boring very quickly.
6194360	6199480	However Prime Hunters was a lot more fun except for the cramping controls but I digress.
6199480	6206520	In the end I would rather have an amazing single experience than half-baked multiplayer.
6206520	6211680	Mike B. responded saying I think it's great as long as it has a co-op story mode.
6211680	6214000	It is fun playing through the story with friends.
6214000	6220240	I kind of like that whole co-op versus versus too because I think the type of multiplayer
6220240	6222360	can really change a lot too.
6222360	6223960	I think that's really important to state too.
6223960	6228580	I think a game like LittleBigPlanet really is enhanced by the multiplayer and that's
6228580	6232000	one game I didn't really see get brought up here but a game like LittleBigPlanet really
6232000	6236560	gets enhanced because it's more of a co-op.
6236560	6241080	And of course I'm into Mass Effect 3 right now and a lot of that is because it's co-op.
6241080	6246320	Acidic Vampire brings up Mass Effect and says it isn't necessary especially for established
6246320	6249900	single player franchises but sometimes it can be a welcome addition that doesn't take
6249900	6251440	away from its campaign.
6251440	6255680	Portal 2, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 are just a few examples.
6255680	6258340	Those are all really good examples.
6258340	6267800	Let me read one more from John K. I've never bought a game because multiplayer was included.
6267800	6272760	In fact, sometimes attempts to shove multiplayer into a great single player franchise can take
6272760	6274620	a lot away from the experience.
6274620	6277320	For example, the most recent Ratchet and Clank game.
6277320	6281680	All for One was designed to be four player co-op and the changes to the camera and controls
6281680	6285720	to allow for all that but made the game unplayable.
6285720	6289880	Even playing as a single player, it was more frustrating than fun.
6289880	6294200	So again those are all answers from our Facebook account, facebook.com slash orange lounge
6294200	6295200	radio.
6295200	6298700	Come thumbs up us over there and you can answer a question in a future week.
6298700	6300320	How about you guys here in studio?
6300320	6302880	How important is multiplayer to you?
6302880	6303880	Not at all.
6303880	6305280	I don't really give a crap about it.
6305280	6307280	You really go out of your way to avoid it.
6307280	6309400	But yet you play an MMO.
6309400	6311640	Yeah but you notice what do I do most of the time?
6311640	6315560	I quest, I play by myself and just chat with people.
6315560	6318260	It's the having to play with other people.
6318260	6321720	Like I like raiding okay because I'm with my guild mates.
6321720	6324640	I'm with people that I pretty much know.
6324640	6327200	PvP I hate.
6327200	6332100	I mean I don't really mind doing like the most fun that I have in dungeons is when basically
6332100	6336480	I've just tagged along with you know with the ones that you've done for like what was
6336480	6342560	that one that was really fun that you drug me around in your motorcycle for?
6342560	6343560	The Isle of Conquest?
6343560	6345280	Yeah, Isle of Conquest.
6345280	6347560	That was fun because I was playing with you and Alan.
6347560	6348560	Yeah.
6348560	6349560	That was fun.
6349560	6352600	But I I just have this thing about the random stranger thing.
6352600	6357520	I'm all you know appearances to the contrary I am a bit of an introvert.
6357520	6364980	You know I I've taught myself how to be outwardly extroverted but really I kind of like to do
6364980	6367440	my own thing and stick with the folks I know.
6367440	6373140	You know so I lost my train of thought.
6373140	6374140	That's all right.
6374140	6378240	I'll go ahead and just say I really agree with the answer that said it's best when it
6378240	6382760	more enhances a single-player game that's already there especially the the examples
6382760	6387880	of Portal 2 and Mass Effect 3 I think are two great examples of where multiplayer really
6387880	6392760	just sweetened the pot for a game that would have already been worth the asking price.
6392760	6396720	See I would play Portal 2 multiplayer as long as I played with someone I know.
6396720	6399720	Right which I think you I don't think you can play Portal 2 with strangers can you?
6399720	6409720	But it's like now when I used to do PSO fantasy star online you know you could run into people
6409720	6413460	just wait looking for groups in random but for the most part I played with my friends
6413460	6417680	we would lock the room and put stupid passwords on them like butt cheese.
6417680	6420840	That was one of our passwords.
6420840	6421840	You're so mature.
6421840	6425880	All right before I get to Loki's answer let me get to our chat room.
6425880	6429240	Some folks talking about Skyrim because you know obviously Skyrim gets brought up as a
6429240	6431800	game that didn't need multiplayer to be successful.
6431800	6436120	Jim Sally says Skyrim is awesome but it would be twice as good if a co-op mode was added
6436120	6437920	and a lot of people have been asking for something like that.
6437920	6442360	But Shadow Next Gen says I don't know if Skyrim would be good with co-op that game is really
6442360	6444360	all about your personal choices.
6444360	6445840	Very true.
6445840	6448640	Loki lastly with you what how important is multiplayer to you?
6448640	6453760	It all depends on the game I mean some games I don't really care other games kind of want
6453760	6460320	it in there like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty or Minecraft I don't know it just
6460320	6468840	it depends like I don't necessarily need multiplayer for Final Fantasy or something like that.
6468840	6473080	Blender brings up a great point in our chat room what about Journey Orange Lounge Radio
6473080	6475960	and he's not talking about the one from the 80s about the band he's talking about that
6475960	6480440	new one on PlayStation Network and I gotta say no one's bought it for me yet well I have
6480440	6484440	it and I've played through it and I gotta say Journey is like on a whole nother level
6484440	6488840	with the multiplayer it's like a new type of multiplayer experience you can't even really
6488840	6493520	define don't have to talk to them do you know you never do perfect you that's the beautiful
6493520	6497620	thing about Journey they're there and they're with you they can only talk to you through
6497620	6502360	song through one button that kind of hums a little tune and it's your choice you can
6502360	6506740	follow this person you can try to work with it and try to develop your own communication
6506740	6512640	style it which it's it's so crazy like the simplicity of the game and kind of what it's
6512640	6516640	done for multiplayer games Journey again if you haven't played it on PlayStation 3 and
6516640	6522440	you own a PlayStation 3 you really gotta check it out it just it's amazing it was better
6522440	6527260	when people didn't tell you there was a multiplayer component and I did not even know there was
6527260	6533280	gonna be multiplayer in it and I was just blown away amazing anyhow that's gonna do
6533280	6536520	it for the frugal question of the week thank you to everybody who responded we had a ton
6536520	6540520	of answers on Facebook I'm so sorry I didn't have time to read all of them but answer us
6540520	6543840	in a future week and we'll try to get some in you can always get your thoughts through
6543840	6550080	to our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we'll read those in a future week for
6550080	6554420	now we don't have any yeah sadly we didn't get any mail this week so we don't have anything
6554420	6560480	to read but maybe in a future week for now though let's get to some news Loki all right
6560480	6567040	so let's talk a little bit about I don't know Activision you may remember that Bungie has
6567040	6573600	entered into an agreement with them to create this next big franchise and they are they're
6573600	6578620	actually right now according to the leaked documents that you know kind of show this
6578620	6586560	agreement it's for a project called destiny and also you know they're talking about like
6586560	6592080	some of the expected you know bonuses and stuff based on you know performance and also
6592080	6596320	saying that you know they're gonna have you know a version of the game is gonna come out
6596320	6604760	on the Xbox 360 you know also in the fall 2013 and that there's gonna be follow-ups
6604760	6609720	in multiple years and it's supposed to be a four-part you know four game deal and also
6609720	6617320	at the end of that they're gonna have the option to fund a new marathon game so that's
6617320	6625280	kind of neat I mean that's definitely a lot of corporate mumbo-jumbo at least in the leaked
6625280	6630240	document but it'd be cool to see what this new destiny game supposed to be like a code
6630240	6635360	name it'll probably be like Halo I'm thinking it will be I was hoping it would be Pimps
6635360	6642480	at sea but you know unfortunately we can dream but that's not gonna happen but yeah it'll
6642480	6649200	be pretty cool all right let's go to a story about Diablo 3 because unfortunately Diablo
6649200	6658160	3 allegedly hacking going on in Diablo 3 right now and a lot of people coming into Diablo
6658160	6665120	3 remembering Diablo 1 and 2 as a single-player game have no part of this whole authenticator
6665120	6670520	and ways to protect their account so you know Blizzard's coming in and saying well people
6670520	6676080	need to be more careful with their account information but apparently and I apparently
6676080	6681480	it has come through in recent days that there are a small number of accounts that are being
6681480	6686720	hacked with authenticators on them but it's coming through malware on the user system
6686720	6690560	and the blue posts that are on the forums are very adamant that yeah we're looking at
6690560	6693660	the msinfo files of people that are saying they're getting hacked with an authenticator
6693660	6699740	and they've got all sorts of malware on the system and that's where it's coming from so
6699740	6703940	this whole single-player always connected experience is really starting to rub people
6703940	6708600	the wrong way and this is just the latest feather in that hat like really I did not
6708600	6712320	want to fucking deal with this and now people are getting hacked and all this shit because
6712320	6716880	they don't have an authenticator on their account I mean Blizzard or Diablo 3 had amazing
6716880	6721800	sales in their first week but what is the long-term damage this shit is causing we talked
6721800	6726160	a little more about this on Hoard House this week at www.hoardhouse.com my World of Warcraft
6726160	6731240	themed spin-off show but to kind of ask here a little bit Loki I think you're a good one
6731240	6736640	to ask because you're not as sucked into this Warcraft phenomenon as Dark Soccer and I are
6736640	6742400	what are your thoughts about Diablo 3 being always connected and have they screwed PC
6742400	6748320	games that might want to explore this in the future with this consistent botched thing
6748320	6752480	after another well I never like any always connected games there you know especially
6752480	6756440	if it's not required if it's not an MMO then what's the point of me having to be always
6756440	6761000	required you know a connection for this to happen I mean because you know say if I want
6761000	6767040	to game my laptop doesn't mean I'm gonna have Wi-Fi anywhere you know everywhere I go and
6767040	6771440	you know that kind of sucks if I can't play my game that I purchased because I don't have
6771440	6778720	an internet connection at the time I mean I don't know it yeah it's another reason why
6778720	6784480	I wouldn't get the game I guess other than you know just don't really want to buy the
6784480	6789720	game burn our chat room asks so it's malware the rumor was it was joining public games
6789720	6796160	that opens you up to it you know Blizzard is passionately denying those claims as we've
6796160	6799340	learned though throughout other parts of the game industry that doesn't necessarily always
6799340	6805880	mean anything though I would like to think that that they've tested that and it's true
6805880	6809260	but and just because you have more where I mean because there's a lot of malware out
6809260	6815560	there but I mean just saying up well we can see that yeah malware on your system is it
6815560	6820080	the same malware for each thing I mean is it I mean what kind of what exactly is this
6820080	6825040	malware do is it's like because there's malware that just I go search something on Google
6825040	6828560	and also I get transferred to another page that has nothing to do with what I just search
6828560	6832480	for it's like another search engine or is it something that's like I'm specifically
6832480	6838760	putting this malware on your system to steal your information also why can't Blizzard just
6838760	6843700	to give extra protection to the accounts very similar to what Star Wars the Old Republic
6843700	6848440	did you have these personal questions that only you would know the answer to and whenever
6848440	6853280	Star Wars suspects that you're making a major change or you're doing something weird where
6853280	6858000	it might not really be you it asks you to answer three of those questions at random
6858000	6865160	you know why couldn't they gee you usually play Diablo 3 in Sacramento California all
6865160	6870000	of a sudden you're trying to log in from China maybe I should ask you a private question
6870000	6874000	that only you would know the answer to because the odds that you were playing in California
6874000	6881460	and now you're suddenly playing in China are very very low or here's a thought since we've
6881460	6888600	you know we've gotten these MS you know these little readouts of what processes you have
6888600	6894160	running and stuff and we've noticed that there's specific malware you know programs or whatever
6894160	6901020	running hey you know you have some sort of device that runs before the program launches
6901020	6905760	to detect for people using cheat devices and stuff maybe I don't know add these programs
6905760	6911880	in there so that you know hey you try to launch Diablo and you get this you know pop-up saying
6911880	6916360	hey there's more and your system is gonna steal your Diablo identity if you play Diablo
6916360	6921440	maybe you should I don't know clear that off or something why don't they have that since
6921440	6925960	they could do that very easily oh it's because probably none of that has any information
6925960	6931560	it's like saying oh well you know you you've got some sort of virus on your computer so
6931560	6935920	there must be how that must be how they're hacking your system and seriously most malware
6935920	6940760	that you'll find are usually like site trackers that type of thing nothing that's really going
6940760	6949040	to have anything it's for advertising that's all it is so all right let's hope Blizzard
6949040	6953080	can patch this shit up I I seriously think they're doing some long-term damage here I
6953080	6957240	did find a new patch applied last night oh yeah yeah I didn't see what it was for but
6957240	6961880	they did patch my game last night I think they've been doing as a variety of fixes they
6961880	6965040	keep pushing back that real money auction house that's the other thing that tells you
6965040	6970280	there's a problem that was supposed to be Diablo's bread and butter and hasn't happened
6970280	6975880	so anyhow we were going to move on to the mailbag at this point but I believe when you
6975880	6981680	check before the show started it was empty right to quote a line from a masterpiece of
6981680	6989960	a movie which is called Spaceballs we ain't found shit if you I guess some people in chat
6989960	6993880	are saying they emailed within the past hour or so well check it again you want to check
6993880	6998480	it again we'll do that we'll do the FUs of the week first so usually the time we do that
6998480	7001840	oh I was looking was to jump in well I was just gonna jump in with some random stuff
7001840	7008340	so I figured I'd already logged in we have one I was doing Google searches for information
7008340	7012500	regarding you know this Xbox jacking stuff it's actually a whole bunch of information
7012500	7019240	about doxing which is finding up finding out the information on people like their name
7019240	7024520	city state all the personal information based on some of their stuff and that's how they
7024520	7031760	steal accounts it's by knowing all your personal information tons of ebooks on it too be careful
7031760	7036920	who you add on your social networks that's for sure so we have one all right yay we do
7036920	7042960	have an email after all of course question for the staff what has to be the single most
7042960	7048440	expensive gaming accessory you have purchased for your gaming console and to read the disclaimer
7048440	7052640	this email was brought to you by anime jam session the podcast about anime cosplay convention
7052640	7055800	roasting pop culture and everything in between podcast guaranteed to derail in ten minutes
7055800	7060740	your money back check us out at www.animajamsession.com that was the cheapest fucking plug I have
7060740	7065040	ever seen in the history of this show I'm gonna ask a really generic question and then
7065040	7071040	plug I read it out of my mic mic machines that's all right you know what because we
7071040	7077360	love anime jam session john machina was great we're gonna allow it yes all right I did buy
7077360	7085520	my husband steel battalion oh yeah yeah I paid 300 bucks and bought him steel battalion
7085520	7091980	of course he in return has bought me thousands of dollars of beymani equipment you know we
7091980	7098800	bought my uh both my dance pads for uh together for 160 for my dreamcast ddr which I think
7098800	7105400	the game was also about 70 bucks so um but keep in mind if you look at my beymani collection
7105400	7111280	I've got a pop music controller I have four 2dx controllers now I have two guitar freaks
7111280	7116940	controllers a key I have a keyboard for keyboard mania I have a drum controller for um drum
7116940	7121840	mania and then we have all this crap we have for guitar hero so it's really hard to say
7121840	7125680	when you look at the whole thing but I think the single most expensive has to be the steel
7125680	7132240	battalion controller because that was 300 bucks um I would say the most expensive I
7132240	7137040	know this probably doesn't count for the original question but I fucking bought a Japanese PlayStation
7137040	7141060	2 just so I could play all those beymani games back in the day so I think I think I get that
7141060	7145880	one especially you know I bought the controller I bought the ddr mats all to work with the
7145880	7152120	Japanese we bought a jps2 yeah keyboard I bought I bought fucking keyboard mania okay
7152120	7155480	I think I think that qualifies I can tell you what our most expensive game was what
7155480	7162720	was probably dracula x oh yeah yeah that's right Loki um I bought an arcade cabinet to
7162720	7168640	put in ddr in never really got around to putting ddr in it though but looking at accessories
7168640	7175480	on their own what is the most small my rock man stuff because I have you know a hundred
7175480	7182040	dollar guitar here and drum set and another bass guitar they got specially that's collecting
7182040	7189040	dust under my desk at work now what was your most expensive system what is the most you've
7189040	7198040	ever paid for a single video game system my first xbox 360 oh you you dumb bastard you
7198040	7209080	did pay a lot for that most I paid for a system might be my playstation 3 I think a ps3 was
7209080	7213520	more expensive than importing the playstation 2 I will second that because keep in mind
7213520	7219240	when we bought ours we still have our first model ps3 and thanks to discover we got a
7219240	7224080	hundred bucks knocked off of it because we got a reward on it so we paid 600 bucks for
7224080	7228980	our first model ps3 now the one and only bobby blackwolf in our chat room at vog network
7228980	7234880	dot com said I own a very expensive set of Roland V drums and I just put it on twit pic
7234880	7240880	so that is that does work with that does but that's not really necessarily an accessory
7240880	7244960	okay so then moving forward to it let's because I really like elaborating on this one what's
7244960	7250720	the most you've ever paid for a game the most I've ever paid for a game um again Japanese
7250720	7258360	importing probably beat media 2d x6 style I want to say was probably the most expensive
7258360	7262280	one I got because I got that when it was brand brand new I eventually paid more than a hundred
7262280	7266360	dollars for a game no I don't think I paid a hundred and twenty dollars for the Sailor
7266360	7272720	Moon's super s fighting game on Super Famicom actually I take that back add up all the months
7272720	7278360	of World of Warcraft but I'm saying for the game itself hey Alan's joining us and I think
7278360	7285240	wants to say something hi Alan so we're talking about more most spent on a game yes sir when
7285240	7290280	I was there was a year or two where I was importing Japanese games and I only got four
7290280	7294760	or five of them but I want to say Tobel number two the sequel to the square fighting game
7294760	7301260	I think I spent close to like 90 95 bucks all told to get that game it also had the
7301260	7308340	demo on it though for um Final Fantasy 7 wasn't it yeah uh Alan remember when we had disposable
7308340	7313840	income I know right what about you let me ask my iPad says hi what's the most you've
7313840	7322040	ever paid for a game standalone didn't come with anything else Motorstorm apocalypse because
7322040	7327520	it was a beta or it was a bear yeah you bought that on eBay or something didn't you yeah
7327520	7333760	yeah so I would know what about people who bought that Capcom met game that was like
7333760	7339100	200 bucks because they had the whole controller oh still battalion I've got I've no check
7339100	7346440	this now I have two copies and two controllers you're sick but I mean that would love okay
7346440	7353680	so no no no no what is the rarest system that you own I love SSG 100 Matt the most I've
7353680	7359800	ever spent on a game was Yaris for zero points paid way too much for it I agree I'm sorry
7359800	7364200	the most we ever spent on a what a system what do you think is your most valuable system
7364200	7370960	that you own in terms of personal value and then in terms of financial value my still
7370960	7377240	working Super Nintendo in terms of personal value in terms of actual I don't really have
7377240	7385080	a lot of rare systems I don't really have any old shit that still works the HD DVD player
7385080	7396000	on my Xbox 360 arcade system for most valuable and for personal value the Xbox of Fame the
7396000	7402000	Xbox oh good answer the one that's been autographed by one of the Avengers now yes look at that
7402000	7408360	so for me and yeah I know I've got the collection and this is unfair but actually I think that
7408360	7415160	our most I think our most valuable one is our Neo Geo although we do have a turbo duo
7415160	7420640	but my personal favorite is the turbo duo because no country lockout you can play your
7420640	7426800	Japanese games no problem unless you get a game that requires the arcade card and then
7426800	7433620	you have to have a duo RX alright let's talk about how much money we've spent on this sick
7433620	7439800	obsession here burn the chat room is trying to call me out saying sky had disposable income
7439800	7444600	that could have gone to improving the show talking about that stinkin power device did
7444600	7450380	but it's a lot of money into the show hey this iPad I just did the Facebook questions
7450380	7455600	for the frugal question of the week off the iPad so it did go to improving the show just
7455600	7461080	so you know me by the way I'd like to answer a niche or is it niche or niche whatever I
7461080	7466400	think is Nietzsche Nietzsche that's not how the philosophers name is spelled well whatever
7466400	7472040	there should be a T and a Z in there we did not buy a 3do because there is all of crap
7472040	7479080	for 3do we did almost buy a CDI if you want me to go through the list of what we own no
7479080	7484600	we'll need a whole other show for that all right that's it for the mailbag now we will
7484600	7506920	do the F use of the week angst anger rawr
7506920	7512880	I'm angry at being sick because I mean I feel tons better now this is what's funny I slept

7537020	7542280	I think my fever broke from my bike ride because now like my lungs feel better I still have
7542280	7546480	a do you know the stupid sinus headache but I feel like infinitely better than I have

7656120	7661760	it causing the cough anymore okay that's how mine has gotten better all right and lots
7661760	7666160	of nyquil a couple more stories for you guys then you guys on the skype line at one eight
7666160	7671560	seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio loki all right so let's
7671560	7676280	talk once again about more Activision drama this kind of ties in with the whole lawsuit
7676280	7686040	between you know the Wesson Zampella versus Activision and just some of the dirty stuff
7686040	7691000	that went on obviously the first part of the lawsuits been settled but there's still the
7691000	7697820	whole lawsuit against those people there was this thing that came out called project icebreaker
7697820	7703260	apparently it was an initiative designed by Activision to secretly scour the computers
7703260	7709680	of those two individuals for evidence that would support a firing this involved them
7709680	7716720	attempting to hack into their accounts or their systems also the possibility of faking
7716720	7720400	a fire drill to get them to leave the building so that someone could go and hack into their
7720400	7728120	computers just dirty shit I mean seriously I can't believe that they would even I can
7728120	7735040	believe that they could do that because it's Activision also you know of course some of
7735040	7740840	the stuff you know during that's been released is spreadsheets talking about the top 20 and
7740840	7746140	Finney Ward employees and their salaries and of course Wesson Zampella have made quite
7746140	7754120	a bit of money apparently they've each you know they were expecting bonuses over six
7754120	7761200	hundred thousand dollars and supposed to be getting additional losses from you know the
7761200	7767600	sale of new games for one point four to two point five million dollars that's quite a
7767600	7775520	bit of money thirteen million dollars in bonuses total for 2010 I was reading some of that
7775520	7779380	crazy shit on the internet those Activision emails and so forth and it's just it's a scary
7779380	7786960	inside look to how some of this shit operates it's it's man it's almost evil it is evil
7786960	7796120	it's not almost evil we know how evil they are when you're asking some for like a lawyer's
7796120	7802760	asking somebody to do something illegal and they're you know they're like I don't know
7802760	7807920	if I'm comfortable with doing that you know it's just ridiculous well let's move from
7807920	7815200	something evil to just kind of shady it has to do with THQ and I guess they're gonna be
7815200	7819160	having a June 29 stockholders meeting where they're gonna do what's called a reverse stock
7819160	7824360	split to avoid a delisting from Nasdaq I guess that's really not shady it's just business
7824360	7829200	but it's I guess it's sad a tricky way of doing it is it's totally is a little bit like
7829200	7835120	the shell game they are gonna have some pissed off investors so anyhow apparently what's
7835120	7840080	gonna happen is that they have to do the stock split to maintain one dollar per share minimum
7840080	7844840	that Nasdaq requires apparently they're gonna be three options in the process one of three
7844840	7851080	one of five and one of ten reverse stock split ratios any of these options it means there
7851080	7856080	are fewer outstanding shares with an increased apparent value per share so for example if
7856080	7861640	they do a one to three reverse stock split each stockholder will own one stock for every
7861640	7866800	three that they had prior to the split even though the total value of the company doesn't
7866800	7872240	change so that sixty one cents that they're currently trading at they do a one of ten
7872240	7876760	now it's oh it's six dollars ten cents a share but hopefully one share and say I only have
7876760	7882880	one share instead of ten exactly but they can do that they have happens if you have
7882880	7887280	like two stock or two share that's how I was gonna say there's a lot of not people to get
7887280	7891080	novelty stock you know they just buy one share but then again how many people just buy one
7891080	7896000	share of thq probably not you got more people to do that shit with like Facebook or Disney
7896000	7901940	or you know coca-cola or Pepsi you know what big companies there's there's there's actually
7901940	7906440	a company out there some website and I hate that I'm giving them free advertising but
7906440	7910560	whatever it's like buy one share calm or one share calm and they actually do this whole
7910560	7915400	little stick where they they'll print out a certificate you can frame it you know it's
7915400	7920080	like a gift-giving thing it's kind of a kind of a neat idea for a gift like imagine it
7920080	7924640	I think they did a report on some website the other day and it was like if you had bought
7924640	7931760	a one share of Apple in like 1982 it would be worth a thousand dollars now my mom who
7931760	7937080	actually worked for Intel for a while you know part of their thing was that each employee
7937080	7943280	got you know a certain amount of stock well this is way back you know in the seventies
7943280	7948800	and eighties and stuff and she still has to she found their certificate in the attic the
7948800	7953920	other day wow and it's funny as we looked into it and that's split so many times since
7953920	7958880	you know that one like one share of stock were around I only think is one shares like
7958880	7963760	a few shares of stock is like a hundred and fifty shares of stock now it's just like ridiculous
7963760	7971160	oh wow that's still really cool though yeah like you can sell that you know alright well
7971160	7974800	now we're going to get to the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to give us
7974800	7979680	a call right now one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge
7979680	7983360	radio give us a call we'll talk about anything we've talked about prior tonight or maybe
7983360	7986100	you have something else that you want to bring up again that's one eight seven seven game
7986100	7991500	olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio I do not have the twitter topics up
7991500	7996200	yet so maybe loki I know there might be some last minute stories tonight because there
7996200	8000000	was a lot of stuff we had to cut from tonight's show and it's just it's picking up as we move
8000000	8010840	towards e3 um I'm sure we've got some stuff here of course I'm not ready as usual um still
8010840	8016680	looking at those the hacking stuff it's very interesting just I can't believe all the information
8016680	8020800	that they have out there you know basically telling you use like those like white pages
8020800	8027080	or reverse searches and stuff like that to find um how people's personal information
8027080	8032480	um that you know your phone company and stuff collects so you can hack someone's xbox live
8032480	8037720	account it's ridiculous um let's see here we can talk about uh silicon knights this
8037720	8041680	is kind of funny silicon knights you know they were um had this lawsuit against epic
8041680	8046320	because they're saying your engine was too hard to use that's why our game sucked balls
8046320	8056280	um and apparently they they failed to um provide evidence you know of damages or whatever uh
8056280	8061360	for their lawsuit and so the um the judge assigned them their own value of a dollar
8061360	8065600	so if they win their claim they get a dollar a whole dollar a whole dollar you can buy
8065600	8069640	a candy bar with that maybe all right we got a call coming in let's go to the phones hi
8069640	8073440	you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the one person actually sent an email into
8073440	8078080	the mailbag ron you know what's funny is that the chatters were like no rama doesn't get
8078080	8081940	through tonight rama does not get to calling because he sent an email but when nobody else
8081940	8088480	calls you guys i can't help it i have the fastest internet in america to beat everybody
8088480	8093720	else 99 at a time you're just that awesome what's on your mind tonight rama um my what's
8093720	8097660	on my mind is a bit of a hardware review which is in conjunction with the email that i sent
8097660	8102880	earlier when i was at pax east playing uh at the squirt enix booth they had these nice
8102880	8107800	headphones and i was playing a theater rhythm with it i was like the music quality is just
8107800	8111660	phenomenal where did you get it they told me they had it at the astro gaming booth i
8111660	8117080	checked out their equipment and after thinking about it for all of five seconds i decided
8117080	8121900	to buy them but not right away i decided to save my money get them for my birthday and
8121900	8130980	which i did so now i own a pair of astro a30 gaming headsets with a powered mix amp which
8130980	8141140	is perfect for xbox 360 pc television and cell phone and i have to say audio quality
8141140	8148220	is quite phenomenal compared to what i was used to listening to sorry we just we i'm
8148220	8151880	yelling with the chatters because apparently we had a drop but i'm showing that we've we
8151880	8158340	didn't usually if we drop we show that our scent information drops way down but i don't
8158340	8162700	see that so whatever no they're just saying it because i'm on the phone they're just like
8162700	8167540	drop the stream so i get off the phone no haters gonna hate the timer reset to one minute
8167540	8171020	30 seconds so maybe there was a hiccup but that's weird because usually that number resets
8171020	8177220	anyway podcast listeners don't care about this so exactly the hardware so how how expensive
8177220	8184940	is this thing supposed to be okay the headset itself is 129 dollars the mix amp is 99 but
8184940	8194180	you can get it as a bundle for 199 dollars is it worth it if you're an audiophile i say
8194180	8202380	yes but if you're looking to change your normal headphones for your cell phone or mp3 player
8202380	8206820	if you're looking for something a bit of a change like for mobile gaming i would definitely
8206820	8214100	go with the headset stand alone the mix amp like i said gives better audio quality i mean
8214100	8219540	one of the songs i actually tested to see how well the clarity of the music is was low-keys
8219540	8224220	uh verbalicious remix which is one of my personal now here's the thing though are those um headphones
8224220	8227980	surround sound headphones or are they just standard headphones the headphones itself
8227980	8235060	are standard you get the surround sound 7.1 with the mix amp i have those kind of headsets
8235060	8238380	i like the headset with the surround sound built-in it's kind of fun yeah i've got a
8238380	8244580	pair at home but i i paid a lot less than 200 for them yeah me too uh because they're
8244580	8248180	i don't they weren't turtle beach i don't remember how i got their tritons the ones
8248180	8252900	i have i i actually tried on a pair of tritons and they were phenomenal i was playing them
8252900	8260540	with uh bioshock too all right well rama i'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls
8260540	8263780	but uh anything else you want to plug here on the show real quick before i let you go

8316940	8326540	on pokemon plushies pokeballs and why is that is it and you know i was thinking that this
8326540	8331520	call was going to go in the direction of because you live in mexico and not every company releases
8331520	8335580	their products officially in mexico sometimes you have to pay these crazy ass import fees
8335580	8342780	and is is it kind of along the same lines for pokemon well most of the time uh since

8620040	8625500	right now so let's go to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this chugga chugga chugga
8625500	8633100	choo choo you sexy people it's jib sally hey your trains your trains behind schedule you're
8633100	8637780	usually on the bobby blackpool show but you're delayed three hours tonight i got delayed
8637780	8642320	i went on the wrong side of the tracks well you know we we've been saying for a few weeks
8642320	8647660	now that you know we made a left turn at alberkirky and other folks we used to work with made
8647660	8651420	a right so i was thinking maybe you just maybe you just made the wrong turn at alberkirky
8651420	8655980	listen you can't you can't make any can't do anything right when you're doing it in
8655980	8663020	alberkirky that's very true that's very true so what's up jim listen we were talking we
8663020	8668380	talked earlier about putting multiplayer and things in different games it needs to be in
8668380	8672460	skyrim i'm playing this stupid game a lot and lately and i i wish there was like every
8672460	8677260	night again i'd roll up to somebody like me that was uber powerful and could kill everything
8677260	8683100	and it had way too much money well what do you think about the whole elder scrolls online
8683100	8686300	we were talking about that either last week or the week before you know i guess that's
8686300	8690780	trying to appease some of these people who want their multiplayer uh elder scrolls is
8690780	8694940	that enough for you i think it would be great if it was just little missions like go out
8694940	8698600	and hunt a criminal like if i do a lot of bad stuff in the town maybe that town can
8698600	8703100	just pay another player to come chase me and good luck because you ain't gonna kill jim
8703100	8707860	sally in this game i'm stupid powerful do you find when you're playing these games like
8707860	8712840	i'm an accountant so i'm very good with numbers and maximizing productivity i find i just
8712840	8718300	overpower everything in the game it's it's pretty insane right now i i wonder if um
8718300	8722820	there'll be some type of how do you play skyrim on the pc or do you play on console um i played
8722820	8730020	on the console because consoles are better and and um i'm better so that's why i played
8730020	8733620	on the console i gotta say though that might end up being the problem and what keeps you
8733620	8737660	from multiplayer because i seem to remember on pc now granted i play on the console too
8737660	8740940	and i play on the playstation 3 which most people say is the worst way to play it but
8740940	8747580	i don't care um the thing is is that on the pc that game gets modded and even oblivion
8747580	8752940	ended up having a multiplayer mod in it at some point so i don't i i would firmly believe
8752940	8759020	there's going to be some type of unofficial multiplayer mod for skyrim eventually yeah
8759020	8763540	but i'm never gonna see it on the console that's true that's when they when they did
8763540	8767580	it on the on the pc it was janky like someone would pause the game and then my game would
8767580	8770700	just not work i'd have to sit there and wait for two minutes while the guy plays with his
8770700	8774700	menus and then i would get the pause and he'd have to wait for two minutes while i play
8774700	8780220	with my menus they need like oblivion needs to do it oblivion sorry bethesda needs to
8780220	8785860	do it right well you know it's anything's possible we don't know much about these expansions
8785860	8789260	that are supposed to be coming to skyrim i imagine an e3 will finally hear about this
8789260	8794380	first expansion that's coming to skyrim um but since they haven't been releasing them
8794380	8798780	with the frequency that they did for oblivion you know these packs are going to be huge
8798780	8802320	so i would say nothing's off the table maybe we're going to get multiplayer in an expansion
8802320	8807040	pack but i kind of don't think they're going to cannibalize from elder scrolls online i
8807040	8811060	kind of think it's skyrim is going to stay single player and they're going to really
8811060	8815540	try to push you to pay that monthly fee if you want to take it multiplayer so it's about
8815540	8820620	time that they just let obsidian do it for them they make the best sequels to games perfectly
8820620	8824500	solid and stable they should just let obsidian make it they've done it with follow let them
8824500	8829680	do it with oblivion well i i hope they're listening to your suggestion but sadly they
8829680	8834060	probably aren't all right you got that right all right well jim anything else you want
8834060	8839420	to share with us tonight also yeah i play way too much of that walking dead game that
8839420	8845180	the last caller just called about hey people are loving it oh my god the one you you know
8845180	8849180	what brother i'm going to tell you this right now the only the hardest part about the zombie
8849180	8857060	apocalypse we'll be pretending i'm not excited oh my god kim sally's getting ready i'm getting
8857060	8863220	ready well i i i will pass the word along to my friend at telltale because they're very
8863220	8867180	proud of that game and they should be and you know before we were talking about minecrafts
8867180	8872300	you know record-breaking figures uh walking dead was doing very well for itself on xbox
8872300	8877220	live arcade so uh i i think that's some really good news you know because there's a lot of
8877220	8881020	people that think adventure games are like a niche thing you know and yeah telltale's
8881020	8885380	filling that niche very well but walking dead's really kind of broken a mainstream forum and
8885380	8890260	i'm happy for him and for adventure game fans everywhere really you got that right but anyway
8890260	8893720	brother i gotta take off but i was probably with people i want to call in all right so
8893720	8898660	i just want to say everybody that if you go to bed and you don't think about zombies coming
8898660	8906040	then maybe you're not scared enough or too scared something to ponder in bed tonight
8906040	8913500	oh jim hung up there you go i like it when he calls us i like it when he calls bobby
8913500	8917940	too but you know it's okay if he misses that train and calls us once in a while too do

8972860	8978740	um shoot mania which was part of this mania planet series you may remember them from track
8978740	8988060	mania um shoot mania is their um fps editor and it also is a game um shoot mania storm
8988060	8992000	is the first thing they have right now that's in beta and they actually have the registration
8992000	8996900	open for that uh you can check it out but um it looks pretty cool and you can basically
8996900	9001780	create your own fps game with this and they've got all the tools to make i think it's an
9001780	9006720	online fps maker um also should be noted that they're supposed to have quest mania at some
9006720	9012820	point so that means a really cool rpg maker so kind of interested in that sign up for
9012820	9016620	the beta so we'll see when that happens i was checking that out by the way the binding

9053340	9059420	to a couple don't hate me going to a couple tweets from tiger claw death spank the bakening
9059420	9064620	indie game the movie will be steam's first full-length film release i had no idea steam
9064620	9068420	was looking into doing this but apparently steam is going to start giving out movies
9068420	9072700	that's right the 1080p video will be drm'd as much as any other steam product or game
9072700	9077380	for those of you that were worried about that um so you will have to have the steam client
9077380	9082500	in order to watch it but you can pre-order the movie on steam for $8.99 that includes
9082500	9088040	a 10 discount until june 12th when the movie's coming out so this is a new area for steam
9088040	9093380	now they're gonna take on itunes hey by the way huh you know what else is um on that uh
9093380	9099480	sale on steam since you mentioned it what's that psychonauts five bucks five bucks guess
9099480	9104980	who's buying it and not buying minecraft you know what though it's pretty hard psychonauts
9104980	9110560	is a good choice even even the most hardcore of minecraft fan would be hard to argue with
9110560	9116100	you there um i'm trying to load up this other story from tiger claw but our internet's being
9116100	9121260	a little wonky but it's titled a video game designed to help doctors to recognize drug
9121260	9127060	abuse what the hell would that game be but it's not loading because the website is being
9127060	9132160	wonky let me try one more time here there it goes um let's see it's probably heroine
9132160	9138180	hero or heroine hero where you have to chase the chase the giant sword it's using the same
9138180	9144820	technology used to train fbi agents in interrogation tactics a combination of self-disclosure and
9144820	9150100	non-verbal cues the game uses an actor's voice to stimulate a hypothetical conversation with
9150100	9155340	a patient seeking for example pain relievers the program generates responses based on the
9155340	9160300	doctor's questions and the doctor must identify indicators of possible addiction or abuse
9160300	9164560	based on the simulated patient appearing on screen before them so this is something where
9164560	9169660	you're the doctor you're trying to recognize a patient that's asking for a drug who might
9169660	9176160	be addicted to them this sounds like la noir you're looking for those hidden cues to let
9176160	9181380	you know if there's a problem or not that's kind of weird in a way but but neat i guess
9181380	9186360	that you know video games are being used out there in the real world that's going to do
9186360	9191020	it for twitter any other last minute stories tonight loki no that's it all right then that
9191020	9196580	brings us to the end of the show we're ending a little bit early tonight but uh that's because
