9148	26125	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, May 27th, 2012, a new Star Wars game is set to be unveiled After weeks of speculation, 38 studios shuts its doors And a major game publisher is sued for fraud
31656	39659	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
40220	47783	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with my co-host here in studio.
47803	49904	Welcome back tonight, the one and only DarkSakura.
50124	50404	Hi.
50684	52585	Boy, you missed a fun show last week.
53185	55526	No, I didn't because I was eating a bucket of meat.
55866	58147	I guess that is a little better, but we'll talk more about that in a minute.
58510	59670	Yeah, I was very sad though.
59730	62271	I sent you my support from afar as I was eating barbecue chicken.
62411	65392	Now for those that don't know what Bucket of Meat is, dot dot dot.
65632	69553	It is the Big Thunder Barbecue restaurant at Disneyland.
69713	70093	Of course.
70193	73234	Where it's like 30 bucks a head and you get all you can eat meat.
73754	82637	Like beef ribs, sausages, chicken, cornbread, coleslaw, beans.
82737	86878	And they all come in these big shiny, well not kind of shiny, but big iron buckets.
87778	92484	Which a couple people ran off with one Are you a fan of finding big sausages at Disneyland?
93285	102616	Oh yes, oh yes Rob Alright, also say hello joining us tonight to Tech Master Loki That sounds like a southern Brazilian barbecue
103702	104623	It kind of does a little bit.
104883	106985	But Brazilian barbecue is amazing.
107585	108206	I don't know, though.
108346	109366	Cornbread could make it better.
109647	110047	You know what?
110387	111588	Well, they did have cornbread.
112469	117012	But also, the people there on the stage performing did You Got a Friend in Me, all kind of bluegrassy.
117172	117673	Oh, how fun.
117833	118353	It was great.
118653	118934	All right.
120054	123577	We're going to go around and talk about how our weeks were in video games.
123637	126880	But first, I want to start off tonight talking about what happened last week.
126960	130722	Because the podcasters are sitting here going, wait a minute, Dark Sakura was on the last show.
130762	132624	There wasn't a show on the feed last week.
133124	134605	I also have to say one thing for Geovidea.
135285	136666	That place did have vegetarian options.
137207	141269	They had a skewer with peppers and vegetables and tofu.
142530	143711	Well, isn't that special?
144011	144831	And it was delicious.
144851	146872	All right, anyhow, off food, on show.
146933	150675	I'm just saying, it's cool that they have vegetarian options, but I mean, it's bucket of meat.
150735	153096	If it was bucket of salad, I wouldn't be touching the place.
153517	157599	Same if I was a vegetarian and I went to a place that's called bucket of meat, probably wouldn't be my thing.
157659	159260	Alright, look, last week's show.
159661	165866	So, live, we were here last week live, and no, this is not a case of me being lazy and not updating the podcast feed.
165906	166486	Here's what happened.
166886	176154	We were live, we were doing a show, and while we were in the middle of the classic Game of the Week segment, which as you know is always at the end of the first half, the power went out.
176974	178976	The power shut off in the apartment.
179036	180056	It wasn't just my place.
180116	181057	It was the whole unit.
181137	182718	It was the whole stretch.
183038	186080	We still don't know to this tonight what caused the issue.
186800	191023	But unfortunately, what happened is that it caused the live listeners got to hear at least half a show.
191363	198588	But because we were unable to retrieve the MP3 from backup, which, you know, if you want to get technical, it's not really an MP3.
198668	200289	It's a raw Adobe Audition file.
200589	202030	But it was all wrong.
203011	205553	It was too much to be able to fix.
205713	207775	And props to Travis from Understation Live.
208075	209076	He tried to fix it.
209116	211639	He tried to go in and move the little packets that were out of order.
212019	214902	But he said after about 10 minutes worth of show, he gave up.
215282	216283	And I don't blame him.
216323	217464	I don't have the patience for that either.
218045	220006	So that's like trying to knit something.
220067	223029	So unfortunately, last week's show is gone.
223550	226573	So we want to catch you up a little bit on what you missed last week.
227213	232956	So last week we were joined here in studio by Flaco Jones, who you might know if you listen to Horde House.
233016	235657	He's the number one fan of Horde House, my Warcraft show.
235997	237758	But I don't think he'd been on OLR.
238798	240539	He certainly had never been on as a host before.
240559	243000	I don't think he'd even been on as a guest in a very long time.
243520	247242	He talked a lot about his days working at Konami and some of the stuff he got to beta test.
247282	251123	He was a league tester on the Winx games, which I'm really sad.
251164	254545	That was the part of the show you guys... Do you still have that raw file?
254685	260190	I do, and it's like, that's the part of the show I might have to string together and put on Twitter so you guys can hear it.
260210	262952	I don't know, you should just send it to me and maybe I'll... Yeah, we'll see.
263312	266315	But that's, oh man, that's the part of the show you really have to hear, if anything else.
266915	276263	But there's a couple important revelations that came up last week, too, that for the OLR continuity, because believe it or not, this show has a storyline over the past 10 years.
276684	281768	It's very important you understand one of the discussions we had last week, so we're going to re-have it a little bit here tonight.
282308	283790	I play a lot of Minecraft.
283850	284651	A lot of Minecraft.
284671	286052	A lot of Minecraft.
303106	306088	And I'm very sad when I see you signing on and you're not playing Minecraft.
306108	308889	Because I'm playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer usually.
309289	309489	Yes.
309750	311551	But here's the deal.
311831	315333	As you guys know, a few months ago on the show, we talked about, you know what?
315813	316933	We tried Minecraft.
317494	319155	We don't get it.
319215	319655	It's cool.
319695	321336	For those of you that are into Minecraft, it's cool.
321376	322557	But for us, we don't understand.
323397	325518	All hell broke loose when the 360 version came out.
325558	331601	Because for me, it was about, oh, there's a tutorial mode that is explaining the point.
332882	334483	This game now has a point.
335623	343707	And once I kind of was able to get the basic parts down, and plus it's important to note that the 360 version really simplifies crafting and da-da-da-da-da.
344768	347389	Once I understood all that, I was like, okay, I'm into this.
347849	349590	And Loki, I'm imagining it's a similar thing for you.
349770	350370	Yeah, pretty much.
350471	356175	I went through part of the tutorial, not even the whole tutorial, just the very basic stuff.
356255	365241	And once I figured out, okay, this is iCraft stuff, this is how you do this, this is what this is for, okay, I'm just going to start my own world and did that.
365802	366582	But you know what?
366762	366943	What?
367123	367563	Tacos.
368764	374428	Yeah, DarkSakura has yet to try Minecraft on the 360 and she has not been turned yet, but we're working on her.
374708	375069	You know what?
375109	376770	If I have to pay for it, probably not.
377876	378476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
407671	418494	Now, here's another important comparison I brought up last week that the podcasty folks didn't get to hear because we realize there's been a lot of slamming on the 360 by the PC fans because it's not as advanced.
418554	419994	It's based on an earlier version of the game.
420494	428636	And the other big, big, big one I hear is the finite size of the map is only, what, 1024 by 1024, which for me is big enough.
428736	435298	I got enough to work with, but I understand where the PC fans, especially if you're playing a bunch of people on one of those servers, really...
436078	436638	Civilization 4, Civilization 5
466198	474285	Really quick when you don't have hours and hours and hours to play Civ 5 because Civ 5 can go for hours and hours and hours.
474605	476947	But Civ Rev is a really good way to kind of get a quick fix.
477147	480991	So I enjoyed both games and I think that's where I'm at with Minecraft now.
481371	486335	Because of me getting into the 360 version, Alan has been obsessed with the PC version lately.
486915	489918	I mean, well, I see just like kind of getting ideas.
490038	493181	One of the first things I did after I built a few things was...
493981	497403	Okay, what are cool things I could build on the 360 version?
497483	502105	So I did a bunch of internet searches on YouTube, well, just YouTube searches and stuff.
502425	505126	And I just kind of bookmarked a bunch of things that I wanted to make.
505906	507667	And so I did that.
507707	518512	But there's a lot of cool mods like Industry Craft and stuff like that that you could build machines that will do mining for you and ridiculous stuff like power drills and batteries and stuff.
518732	524345	Piping, and all sorts of crazy stuff But, I mean, it's really cool And I hope they implement
525225	550527	within the next week I want to go back and give another game a try that I originally kind of I didn't really diss it on the show but I just kind of gave it a review of I don't get it lol and that's the game Terraria because supposedly that's the 2D Minecraft so now that I get Minecraft I'm going to try Terraria again and I'll let you guys know next week how that goes because that's something else I want to explore oh by the way since we did bring it up Civ 5 is on sale on Steam today for $7.49
552035	553376	My friend's been playing it on Xbox.
553396	553796	Becky's husband.
579044	597880	there is no Civ 5 on Xbox you must be thinking Civilization Revolution which is the game I mentioned a minute ago but I've been watching that and it actually is pretty cool except you know that's totally not my thing just like Minecraft 360 it's a good way to get your feet wet with the series other things you might have missed last week we had an exclusive story but we're going to repeat that at the top of tonight's show so we'll come back to that in a minute
599021	600241	You guys missed a lot last week.
600481	603243	And there was also the Classic Game of the Week.
603323	614190	Just for housekeeping purposes, we decided because Jim was not able to finish his Classic Game of the Week, we're not going to have that officially be the Classic Game of the Week.
614510	620954	We are going to invite him back on the show whenever he wants to come back as a fourth host even and let him finish what he started.
620974	627098	Jamie said she would kindly give over the Classic Game of the Week segment whatever week he comes back so he can finish what he started that night.
627578	631940	So just, and if you didn't, if you don't know what the classic game is, well, I have to leave some suspense.
632100	634400	So you'll just have to figure it out in a later week.
636341	637501	I think that was about it.
637541	641003	I think that was all the stuff that came up last week that was important and worth mentioning.
641503	646885	So let's get into how is your gaming, oh, VOG Network.
646905	648605	I want to say really quickly about VOG Network.
650326	652507	Friday night, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
653707	656790	The next phase of VOG will be revealed.
657010	673405	Yes, I'm teasing a teaser, but I think if you guys are really interested in what we're up to and what the full vision is here, and I know there's a lot of people out there who still have questions like, why did you leave where you were at before just to do yet another radio network?
673685	677068	There's more to it than a radio network, and some of that is going to be unveiled soon.
677889	678389	on Friday.
678489	679670	So I'm really excited about that.
679730	684354	So again, Friday, 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, right here at vognetwork.com.
685215	689518	We're supposed to have an interview at 6.30 tonight, and I teased that on the Twitter a little bit.
689898	690699	Her name is Susan.
690739	693401	She's with the website hackedonexbox.com.
694662	699466	And we're going to talk a little bit about what... She's basically the Nancy Drew of the gaming industry this week.
700107	701788	And I say that with love.
701888	702549	I love Nancy Drew.
703149	725887	but she really got down to the bottom of what is really going on on Xbox 360 with what they're not calling Xbox hackings but Xbox jackings and we'll talk a little bit about the difference and why that is hopefully we get her on the show here in 10 minutes unfortunately just we don't see her it's kind of like that interview we had two weeks ago where the dude disappeared for a little bit
726227	744806	I haven't heard from her on Twitter or Skype today these things happen especially because her piece got picked up by a lot of the big gaming blogs she might just be very popular and in demand right now so we're gonna see if we can't get her on if we can't we'll just roll it over to a later week when she can come on but we'll check in with you guys in 10 minutes
746458	748859	DarkSakura, you've been out for a week.
748899	749680	How was your gaming weeks?
749920	750920	I've actually played stuff.
752221	753282	Played lots of things.
753902	755724	Although I still haven't played Mass Effect.
755744	756564	I'm very sorry.
758225	762188	I played a lot of Portal 2 while I was out.
762608	768112	I've been playing Words with Friends because I figure since I already paid for it, Zynga already got my damn money.
768292	772154	And honestly, while I'm at work, it's kind of something I can keep up with Dan.
772495	774136	So I've been keeping up with that.
775878	779662	I did try to play Draw Something, but I'm using the free version just because I want to see what all the fuss is about.
780283	780683	It's cute.
781104	784688	I like it.
785229	787792	I started playing a lot more Fractal.
788373	793679	In fact, if you look on my Facebook fan page for Jamie Summers, hint, hint,
795341	798183	I posted a screencap of what Fractal looks like.
798904	802547	And I'm going to be actually showcasing a different game on Steam that I'm playing.
803107	804408	So that everyone can see what it is.
805349	807191	I'm going to be starting Fallout New Vegas again.
807811	808972	Just starting over from scratch.
809372	810153	And I'm playing Droplets.
810173	811254	I got Droplets on iPhone.
811514	814597	Which is kind of weird and not as fun as playing it on Steam.
815398	817119	And I played some WoW.
817319	819121	But I've really been playing Diablo 3.
819481	821443	I played a crap ton of it last night.
822223	846532	and I was like you know what this is like playing Ragnarok online without people this is great so I've really been getting into Diablo and because it was free because I signed over the blood pact it was free with a big footnote yeah well as you saw what you know when I told my friend on Facebook that it was free he said great how Dan said she signed her life away for a year for a year
847409	848489	Which, you know, is what?
848970	849590	A third over?
849850	850770	So, it's not bad.
852311	860814	But yeah, I think everyone's playing Diablo because I'll log on to WoW and say, Hey, where's all my peeps at?
860875	861975	And they're all on Diablo.
863015	863376	Whatever.
866117	868698	And then I've been playing some more Puzzle Bobble again.
868898	869358	Bust a Move.
870378	873240	Because I really love that game and it's really great to play when...
874580	881506	I don't know what it is, but when I'm sick, and I'm over my cold, guys, I just sound like I'm on the tail of it, but I slept for two days.
881546	882306	It was glorious.
883267	886329	I was really sick two weeks ago, you might remember, and I'm still coughing.
886389	887450	I'm still having coughing fits.
887470	888091	People at my work.
888191	893795	And see, I had that sinus attack, and then I had it bad at Disneyland, and then I came back to a full-blown cold.
893815	894436	I ran a fever.
894576	895456	You know what I just remembered?
895937	897358	I have coffee brewing in the kitchen.
897498	898198	Yes, you do.
898218	898279	Bye.
900538	907442	Anyway, so when I'm sick, it's like I don't really have this mental focus.
907522	913126	However, I think when my brain shuts down, I become really fantastic at puzzle games.
913566	917749	And that was like clearing out levels on Fractal that I had never been able to pass before.
918249	920850	And for anyone, it's not an easy game.
920991	927294	It really is not very easy because you've got so much to keep in mind with the direction of how your little things move.
928054	929855	I still tell everyone, get Fractal.
929975	931076	It is worth the money.
931216	932937	It is such a fun game.
934758	935758	Again, it's called Fractal.
935798	936819	Make blooms, not war.
936999	942202	And I hope that they pay me for my sponsorship because I am doing that for free.
942982	952289	And then I'm also supposed to be sitting down because our friend loaned us the Street Fighter Cross Tekken.
952789	957332	And I'm kind of afraid to try it because I do not want to play against the Mega Man.
958113	959994	But I'm thinking about it.
960294	961095	So, meh.
962956	964537	Did you play anything other than Minecraft?
964878	965838	I play Minecraft.
965898	966759	Lots of Minecraft.
967099	967239	Okay.
968567	969908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
992441	993422	He built the Deep Run Tran.
993862	994903	Yeah, he did.
995183	1001007	So when we are talking that Loki started playing Minecraft, we're not fucking around.
1002808	1004710	He is really into Minecraft.
1004930	1011394	And what's great is when I go into Loki's world, I can hear Nelly laughing in the background whenever something stupid happens.
1011835	1013776	So she's got to be into this a little bit too, right?
1013796	1014837	She's not into it at all.
1014877	1017999	She keeps asking me, aren't you sick of this game yet?
1018519	1019980	What's the point of this game?
1021361	1023102	And I'm just like, there is no point.
1023363	1024163	It's just like Legos.
1024904	1026725	It's Legos for men!
1027806	1028146	And girls.
1028526	1031008	I have been playing Minecraft more than Call of Duty this week.
1031108	1032209	I did play Call of Duty, though.
1032969	1040114	We finally got to check out the new... Well, they're maps technically for the new game type face-off.
1040595	1042376	However, you can use them for anything.
1042756	1049261	So we've been playing on them for just our deathmatch maps since we only have like two to four people usually playing at a time.
1049921	1051447	Well, three to four people, but
1052622	1057426	It's perfect for what we use it for, so we've been actually enjoying those quite a bit.
1059387	1069394	However, one of the new maps, Ground, it's quite apparent that the spawn points in there aren't that random.
1069414	1077379	There was one time I literally killed somebody and they spawned again right in front of me, so I knifed them to death and then they spawned again right in the next room.
1077439	1079961	It's like, wow, that's pretty close.
1082522	1083422	Let's see other things.
1083643	1084823	Well, let's go back to Minecraft.
1085103	1093366	So the first thing I did in Minecraft this week is I explored the whole map or as much of the map as I could because I was looking for a spot to dig with dynamite.
1093706	1097167	And that's what I did because I duped a bunch of dynamite and that kind of stuff.
1097227	1103910	We also made a portal to the nether and went there and I got my glowstone and I don't remember what it's called.
1103970	1108752	It's the dirt that's all in the ender that you can set on fire and that will burn forever.
1108892	1109592	So that's kind of cool.
1110293	1116027	and there's some other like sand soul sand or something that makes people walk slow I don't really know what the point would that be for um
1118215	1122218	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1143753	1147438	and I'm slowly hollowing it out for I don't know what purpose.
1147578	1148580	I'm just doing it right now.
1148600	1149601	You should fill it with candy.
1150542	1151283	I don't have candy.
1151423	1152465	I can't fill it with candy yet.
1152935	1154295	That's why Minecraft isn't a 10.
1154335	1154875	It's only about a 9.
1154935	1160317	You should fill it with whatever those things that try to kill you are.
1160377	1161917	There's no coffee and there's no candy.
1162697	1164397	But there are... Well, see, you're Jewish.
1164417	1164817	Fill it with sheep.
1164837	1167338	I was going to say there are pork chops, which is pretty exciting.
1167518	1168358	Oh, yes, there is cake.
1168658	1169658	Fill it with cake.
1170679	1171959	Fill it with cake and sheep.
1173079	1174239	Like, throw sheep down the hole.
1174279	1175300	You apparently can.
1175660	1180601	However, I don't know if you've noticed, if you pick up an egg... Have you tried throwing an egg?
1181501	1182241	It'll create a chicken.
1182688	1183248	www.DarkSakura.com
1213635	1216016	Wait, are you talking about an automated death machine for chickens?
1216096	1217296	Yes, I've actually thought of that.
1219237	1219857	Nothing is safe.
1219877	1236201	Well, I've thought of that for the pigs, and I actually built a trap to catch the pigs, but it doesn't seem to work too well because when you sleep or whatever, the animals respawn and they don't stay in the pen that I made, which is kind of lame.
1238442	1239103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1253698	1254218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1283977	1291781	and then I tried putting a glass top ceiling in one of the caves under the ocean and I kept drowning myself when I did that so I said, eh, fuck that.
1291961	1292541	I'm not doing that.
1293261	1293901	Now, at least.
1295042	1295802	So that's what I did.
1296483	1297723	I also played the Pocket Edition.
1297843	1298804	Pocket Edition's pretty fun.
1300482	1301283	More Minecraft.
1301984	1302605	My Gaming Week.
1302965	1307090	I didn't play a lot of new stuff, mostly because I've been content playing Diablo 3.
1307490	1317522	Mass Effect 3 has got a big multiplayer thing going on this weekend, and I don't know what made me think I would even remotely possibly hit that goal of promoting three people during the weekend, but, you know, I've
1317682	1318983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1344488	1345448	I bought an iPad.
1345708	1349150	Yeah, I bought one of the new iPads and, you know, I wanted one.
1350090	1352211	I'm really not going to give you any better reason than that.
1352311	1352871	I wanted one.
1353772	1369858	I'm in a slightly different position at work now where I might be doing some more travel-oriented things again and I thought the iPad would come in very handy for that because my laptop is kind of getting a little bit old and there is some stuff you can do with an iPad and some of that does include remote taping and broadcasting a podcast.
1370078	1370718	I've thought of that too.
1371358	1376505	But in the meantime, before I get to all that busy, busy work stuff, I'm doing fun stuff on the iPad, like playing games.
1376906	1380530	And one of the games that I got addicted to is Temple Run.
1381852	1385397	And it's one of those games that's really stupidly simple in design.
1385437	1387960	It's like the game itself could have been on the Atari 2600 for all I know.
1390363	1394907	It's like you swipe up to jump, you swipe down to slide, left and right to go left and right.
1395307	1400693	And the whole kitsch of the game is you're running fast to escape these monkeys that if they catch you, they're going to eat you.
1401794	1403615	Because I guess you took their treasure or whatever.
1404116	1408220	And it's so, so, so simple and so stupid, yet it is so addicting.
1408280	1409181	I can't stop playing it.
1410161	1412964	So yeah, Temple Run is what I've been playing a lot on my iPad.
1413184	1414806	That's like the iPad go-to game right now.
1415186	1417066	And the screen's really pretty, you guys.
1417667	1418707	We were watching Archer.
1419227	1421287	Like, it's pretty for a cartoon.
1422088	1422988	Don't shake your head at me.
1423028	1423828	That's you judging me.
1423888	1424468	I can hear you.
1424988	1425308	I am.
1426969	1428089	So that was pretty much my week.
1429069	1429309	All right.
1429869	1433530	So a little bit of housekeeping and then we're going to get into some news and so forth.
1433950	1434431	Housekeeping.
1435471	1436071	I want to mention...
1437264	1438525	Dark Tetsuya Ready Player One
1461243	1485436	and he ran this whole virtual contest where people had to like play and joust and find the hidden easter egg screen and adventure and just you know cute fun stuff you know there's there was no point no seriousness just let's have fun on the internet and that's really what it was and it has a winner so I want to congratulate Orange Right won the hunt this week so yay Orange Right you win
1487566	1487886	Something.
1487926	1490648	We're going to send Orange Wright something from OLR Studios.
1491208	1493830	I will find a... Get his address later.
1493850	1494490	A lock of my hair.
1494570	1496371	I know he... Do you mean that?
1496391	1498573	Because I'll go... All right.
1498593	1504056	We're going to send Orange Wright a lock of DarkSakura's hair and something else actually useful from OLR Studios.
1504456	1505497	I think I know what we can send him.
1505757	1506337	Some cat litter.
1506698	1506958	All right.
1507458	1508599	We're not sending him cat litter.
1509619	1510140	It's useful.
1510920	1512981	You can use cat litter for a whole bunch of stuff, Rob.
1513222	1513582	All right.
1513702	1517184	You know if you spill oil, if oil drips from your car, you can put cat litter on it?
1517705	1518726	I think we have posters over there.
1518746	1519487	Oh, just stop.
1519847	1520267	All right, what?
1520427	1521528	Oh, yeah, we could send him a post.
1521589	1523130	Well, posters are kind of a bitch to mail.
1523190	1526313	I was thinking we have a bunch of these little guys here, so I'll send him one of these.
1526573	1527674	All right.
1527694	1529416	All right.
1529496	1537983	Also, I know he's a Bomani fan, and in the other room I have literally stacks and stacks of promo CDs we were going to give away at live events we never did.
1538344	1542788	So I'm just going to put a bunch of those in a box and be all like, LOL, have fun, and I think he'll get a kick out of that.
1543988	1544248	All right.
1546129	1546409	Let's see.
1546489	1547689	Second place, you get nothing.
1547889	1548169	Sorry.
1549670	1550970	Tough life lesson learned.
1551650	1551950	All right.
1552610	1553110	Let's see.
1553230	1557671	The other housekeeping thing I wanted to mention was that we will not be here live next week.
1557812	1558592	Sorry to say.
1559252	1561812	I am going to be at Bucket of Meat or Disneyland.
1563053	1567954	So I have to make the most out of my past because the prices just went up and there's no way I'm renewing at the end of the year.
1568454	1594262	so I am going this next week so there will be no live show we are going to try to pre-tape a show earlier in the week we just have to find something that blends with all of our schedules so I'm sorry live listeners you won't have anything here but think of it as fair because last week you got a show that the podcasters never heard so next week you're going to have to get the podcast show just like a lot of other people do so that's next week's show
1595382	1597023	I think that's it I have for housekeeping.
1597703	1599344	All right, the other thing I have for housekeeping.
1600825	1605768	We were supposed to be having an interview right now with Susan from hackedonexbox.com.
1606608	1609069	Unfortunately, she's not online.
1609930	1612631	This is almost exactly what happened with MegaRan a couple weeks ago.
1612951	1614192	What is it about our show?
1614592	1615313	Are we scary?
1615433	1615933	I don't know.
1616773	1617154	You know what?
1617234	1621176	I was looking at her personal Twitter, and it said something about, I got two hours of sleep last night.
1621196	1621896	That was yesterday.
1622356	1622776	Oh, was it?
1622917	1623577	I thought it was today.
1623917	1625639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1641195	1645636	I was going to use this interview to talk about something that's been going on in the news this week.
1645896	1649458	Loki, hopefully you can talk about it instead since Susan's not here.
1649478	1649858	Sure.
1650418	1657320	But apparently there was some stuff going on with the whole we think we know how some accounts are getting stolen.
1658018	1668301	Yeah, so basically Susan had actually put together an article on her website talking about how she kind of figured out how some of this is going now.
1668741	1670762	Now I'm not sure how she came about the website.
1670802	1678084	I'm assuming just web searches because doing the same similar type of web search was able to pull up the same information.
1678544	1679926	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1696262	1712471	and it doesn't matter what sort of safe you know any sort of passwords questions whatever it doesn't matter because they find a way to get that information from Microsoft or the third party companies representing Microsoft customer service or whatever it is.
1713371	1720978	So, they basically, there was this, it was on, I'm trying to remember which website it was now.
1721599	1722820	Well, I know Kotaku picked it up.
1722960	1726123	And then it was originally hacked on Xbox.com and then Kotaku picked it up, right?
1726183	1727544	And that's where it really kind of blew up.
1728164	1729165	Yeah.
1729986	1738554	But basically, the one of the websites, I can't remember what the original website that had this step-by-step information was.
1739034	1739334	GameTagJackers
1768854	1769675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1787130	1787831	DarkSakura.com
1803369	1808973	So basically, they talk about the strategy to do it.
1808993	1815198	First, you go to Xbox.com, you click support, and basically at the bottom of the page, there's a contact us stuff.
1816159	1828810	On that page, you click the email us link, and then Xbox Live, and then you basically, at that point, they impersonate an employee of Microsoft.
1829330	1832993	So they put, you know, an email address at Microsoft.com.
1833353	1836655	They put the agent's name, somebody that they, I guess, talk to.
1836815	1840838	They could, you know, call up customer service and, hi, blah, blah, blah, my name is blah, blah.
1841358	1843940	They write it down, you know, and they go through this web form.
1846100	1847161	You put the customer.
1847661	1851422	Basically, you fill out a little note to them.
1851462	1852962	Customer, and you put the name.
1854522	1857563	Verify the 16-digit credit card number.
1857883	1861764	He has made an inquiry about how he has forgotten his account's information.
1861864	1866865	Since I am a Tier 1 agent, I am unable to view the customer's gamer tag.
1866925	1873787	He has requested to have an answer changed to... And then you put some realistic answer, I guess, for the question.
1874528	1877291	The Xbox Live Gamertag is... And you put the Gamertag down.
1878072	1883059	And then the person's name is supposedly contacting them that you're spoofing.
1883340	1888787	So basically, they're working it by... Because Microsoft is so big...
1889608	1904433	and there's so many departments that don't talk to each other essentially they're impersonating department to department they're impersonating the many branches of Microsoft in order to get your gamer tag and there ain't shit you can do about it except don't put a credit card on Xbox
1905291	1911073	There's really nothing you can do about it because they're literally going and finding the answers to the questions that you put down.
1911233	1920716	Even if you put down which city were you born in and you put down Abraham Lincoln or something like that, they can still get the answer to it and they're basically changing it to whatever they want.
1921065	1932394	Um, now, unfortunately, you know, one of the things I wanted to ask Susan tonight from hackedonexbox.com, and I gotta hand it to the chatters at, uh, vognetwork.com, ssh100matt says, even the best show hosts get cancelled on.
1932574	1934395	Carson Letterman have been cancelled on, too.
1934815	1937678	And WhatUpG says, when the interview comes on, it should be good even late.
1937718	1938278	And I agree.
1938318	1940660	And hopefully, maybe she forgot it was Memorial Day weekend.
1940760	1941060	I don't know.
1941120	1943142	But anyway, uh, we'll hopefully get her on.
1943622	1944623	Yeah, there's always another time.
1944643	1944923	Perfect.
1945583	1946523	Yeah, we'll figure something out.
1946563	1954286	But anyway, one thing I want to ask her about was that apparently Microsoft responded via Kotaku to her report.
1954346	1954886	Did you see that?
1955046	1955586	Yes, I did see that.
1955606	1959747	Where they basically said, well, you can't do this anymore.
1959988	1961468	Well, okay.
1961948	1971011	I don't really see... They're basically, you know... Well, they're trying... I thought it was irritating because they really tried to poo-poo her story.
1971691	1999354	and it it kind of pissed me off because it's kind of like well you never Microsoft you never acknowledged that this was happening and now you're trying to poo-poo it like well you can't do it anymore and I understand that Microsoft certainly to save their image doesn't want to admit that they had a problem but at the same time being that they are I mean they are on the stock market yes they're a publicly traded company right yeah isn't there some sort of responsibility that they should be reporting this shit's happening
1999454	2005697	Yeah, and they basically said, hey, here's what their Microsoft or Kotaku asked for a comment from them.
2005977	2014100	Their response was, there are several different methods malicious users employ to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
2014580	2016201	Social engineering is one of them.
2016241	2026525	We are aware of vulnerabilities that social engineering pose and continue to address these through tools and training to help our members keep our members safe and secure.
2027225	2029270	Well, right there, that sounds like tools and training.
2029510	2030152	They're members.
2030913	2032015	It sounds like us.
2032416	2035222	They're teaching us how to not be social engineered, which...
2036397	2042422	Cool, but that doesn't really seem to apply to us because we're not the ones being contacted by these people.
2042643	2044725	It's your customer service reps.
2045705	2047587	Here's another thing I really wanted to get into.
2047667	2058657	As much as I respect what Susan's done this week and what she's been able to find out and put out what needed to be out there on the internet, she put out what people needed to hear this week, and I so respect her for that.
2059378	2062501	I don't think it is the sole reason this stuff is happening.
2063061	2065746	Now, I'm having a hard time remembering when I was hacked.
2065786	2068390	I think it was about six months ago at this point.
2068931	2077906	I seem to recall my password was never changed, which would tell me that this didn't happen to me because they're resetting your password in this, right?
2078226	2078887	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2096008	2100829	and then obviously they're not going to get a response because they're not at that email.
2101209	2110611	You call up Xbox 30 minutes later and after the answer you say that you got disconnected from a Tier 2 agent and asked to be transferred back.
2111071	2119492	After they transfer you to a Tier 2 agent, you give them the number, the one that you wrote, the one that I guess your customer... Once they pull it up, say...
2125455	2144789	they'll say it'll take a little while to change it call back say you forgot your email but you know what the security question or the secret question answer is and they will ask for your gamertag and answer them and they will give you the email so now so I guess let's see here
2148462	2156799	so basically now you have their email and I guess their security question I'm not really sure how I guess I don't know if that allows you to change it immediately I thought they would send you a
2158450	2160452	Maybe I just want to deny, deny, deny.
2160713	2163476	Just like I want to deny that I couldn't have been phished either.
2165398	2169642	Maybe I'm just being a little hard-headed, but I kind of think, why would someone want my account?
2169723	2179854	I mean, granted, maybe, although I don't think I have much of a public face, I have a public face thanks to this podcast nonetheless, so maybe some a-hole out there wanted it.
2180294	2181937	I don't know why they used it to play FIFA 13
2197057	2197638	which I don't.
2197718	2199340	I don't think I have a name people want.
2199460	2208069	Yeah, so it's not necessarily that or sometimes accounts get hacked because you're a member of live for X number of years.
2208109	2208870	That could be.
2209311	2210151	That I would agree.
2210552	2212434	I don't know why someone would want to account for that but
2213995	2218480	I have friends who were hacked that hadn't touched their Xbox in years.
2219260	2220602	It's not clicking for me.
2220782	2223565	They could just probably find random people.
2223645	2226187	Maybe just try it on one or another.
2226668	2233935	Perhaps it's given the amount of time it's gone since it's been used, it makes it an easy target because it's someone less likely to check.
2234640	2241385	I feel like this story has blown a hole in it, but it hasn't still yet shown us everything that's going on.
2241665	2244407	Let me quickly go to the chatroom because there's some good comments here from the chatroom.
2244988	2254794	DJ Morpheus from Understation Live Saturday nights here on VOG says, Has anyone considered the possibility if there is inside help within the Xbox call centers for the Jackers?
2255215	2256956	That's a scary thought, isn't it?
2257877	2258577	It's not unheard of.
2258717	2259638	It is not unheard of.
2259978	2261259	Well, here's an example.
2261539	2272669	When I worked for the mortgage servicer I used to work for, one of our clients had a bunch of information stolen by one of their employees stealing a laptop.
2273630	2273910	Wow.
2274370	2283077	And it had something like, I want to say, 3,000 bank account information.
2283498	2284138	New bank accounts.
2284519	2285780	Just saying.
2286060	2287081	It happens within companies.
2287498	2288239	It does, it does.
2288279	2295807	You know, I work in the insurance industry and there's laws set in place to prosecute people who use the information that they find in malicious ways.
2295827	2304516	Because, you know, imagine if you could access a celebrity's medical records, the things that might happen there, you know, but there's laws in place to protect everybody.
2304536	2305537	It's like with my job now.
2305998	2308781	I run into the same thing, you know, with inspections.
2309501	2309722	Yeah.
2310876	2314717	Let me read this comment from Actdeft in our chatroom as well because I like this too at vognetwork.com.
2315097	2316318	Actdeft says, let me put it this way.
2316778	2320679	PlayStation Network handled their hacking issue horribly, but they handled it nonetheless.
2321239	2326621	Steam handled their forums being hacked really well and kept the users informed and users of what was happening.
2327461	2349904	Microsoft handling the Xbox livejackings is non-existent which is worse of what Sony did and DJ Morpheus added to that remember this is Microsoft they never admit issues until necessary look at Vista and how it was a disaster and Actdeft said yeah pretty much what I'm saying Microsoft denying the whole issue is worse than what Sony did and we're talking that Sony didn't handle the problem that well to begin with
2350424	2373679	and I've said this for months now as much as we give Sony shit and yes they do deserve quite a bit of shit over what happened and you know kind of how they made themselves a target and everything although we give them shit at least they said what was going on and they did take their network down when it was a problem and you know most of all they never had money actually stolen
2376693	2382435	yet here we are on Xbox this much later and we're still hearing stories about how it's done.
2382475	2386496	And you go to that website, hackedonexbox.com, it is still happening.
2387476	2395239	If you have not changed your password on Xbox Live in the past six months, you are a fool to not do it now.
2395799	2405002	If you do not change your password on Xbox Live, if you have sat through all of these stories and have still not changed your Xbox Live password, you are a fool.
2406365	2432991	And I wish you the best of luck Now that I've berated everybody Hopefully that wasn't anybody actually listening Oh gee, I should go change my password right now I forgive you if it's the first time you've ever heard me ranting Maybe you didn't think to change it before But if you've been sitting here for the past six months And you still haven't changed it You're just asking for it I've done mine twice since then Because I routinely change my passwords every three months
2433191	2437072	Well, here's the weird thing, too, and this actually just came up in the past week and a half.
2437772	2446054	I got an email, or I tried to log in to Xbox.com or something, and it made me change my password, but it wasn't a reset or something.
2446135	2451356	It was some type of, somebody's been trying to log into your account too many times, you better change your password.
2451776	2462499	And so that made me, you know, the first thing I went to, my bank account, to make sure no more money had been stolen or any of that crap is going on, but I looked in the game history, have they been in there, been able to play anything?
2462939	2463961	Thankfully, no.
2465363	2468628	No one actually got in there, but it made me go, they're still fucking trying.
2473695	2473956	All right.
2475402	2475682	Anyhow.
2475802	2479365	Anyways, it was hackforums.net is where this stuff originated from.
2480125	2484048	They have the whole Priv 7, how to jack any Xbox account.
2484068	2486729	That's where all that information was from on her website.
2487610	2487890	All right.
2487930	2498117	Well, I'm hoping we can get her on here to tell us more about the story about how she found it and kind of her opinions really having heard so many of these stories on what Microsoft should do.
2498197	2499818	But we'll have to get that in a later week.
2500458	2501278	Death Rising 3 Death Rising 3
2526469	2527410	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2548707	2550468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2571198	2579164	It's like, hey, so by the way, man, tell your friend who liked this post that I'm the new face of Dead Rising 3, lol.
2579564	2581746	I saw he works for video games.
2581886	2585148	The trailer should be coming out soon in the next month or two.
2585488	2586009	It's crazy.
2586049	2589011	They sent me to this place called MOVA in San Francisco.
2589111	2590112	Insane technology.
2590452	2591453	They did Benjamin Button.
2591853	2592633	Looks so real.
2592914	2594735	I'll post it on here when they give it to me.
2595676	2597297	Just real quick, are you sure the name's not Jorge?
2598137	2599058	I'm sorry, it's Jorge.
2627980	2630521	Auto Mechanic, LA, Illegal Immigrant, Aliens, Controversy
2643186	2643886	Dead Rising 3
2673925	2674225	For sure.
2674425	2678968	That'll probably be one of, like, Xbox or PlayStation's things.
2679248	2679969	Sure, sure.
2680629	2681270	So there you go.
2681470	2683351	No Frank West or the other guy?
2683591	2684311	No, of course not.
2684331	2684852	Okay.
2685592	2685872	Yet.
2686473	2686953	Until DLC.
2686973	2687674	I don't know, man.
2687774	2692336	Like, Frank West, you know, the whole Dead Rising 2 off the record bombed, so...
2693297	2698818	Well, because I think a lot of people kind of saw it as a... I think a lot of people saw it for what it was.
2699618	2704919	It was a cheap attempt to try and get Dead Rising 2 more popularity when it just should have been there to begin with.
2705319	2705819	You know what I mean?
2706299	2710840	I think people are starting to call Capcom out on a lot of this shit, and it's kind of fun to watch.
2710860	2713700	It's like watching a soap opera.
2713901	2714401	A little bit.
2714621	2721582	It's just, hey, just like, you know, all the on-disc DLC for Street Fighter X, Tekken, and Dragon Dog, Dragon's Dogma.
2721602	2721742	Yeah.
2723038	2724539	Let's talk Minecraft.
2725000	2726701	I bet Loki will be excited about this.
2727041	2729463	I bet you never thought this would be something happening on OLR.
2729803	2730884	Minecraft segment.
2731004	2731324	All right.
2731685	2733786	Hey, we used to talk about Minecraft updates all the time.
2733806	2734507	I don't have you now.
2734787	2735588	Okay, here we go.
2735708	2737109	No, this is some serious Minecraft news.
2738710	2743714	Xbox Live Arcade, what game is being played the most online?
2744254	2745735	Well, it's still Modern Warfare 3.
2746396	2751660	But Minecraft has now edged out Call of Duty Black Ops for the number two spot.
2753379	2753999	DarkSakura.com
2773880	2780482	Now, I guess the next update for Minecraft is going to be 1.7.3, which will add pistons into the game.
2780502	2781122	Which is awesome.
2781162	2783743	That's the next thing that Xbox is slated to get.
2783783	2790425	But at some point, 1.8, which was the adventure update on the PC, that will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2791265	2795129	The quote from 4J Studios, they're the ones who ported the game for Xbox Live Arcade.
2813383	2820612	The game isn't Minecraft on the Xbox, it's Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition, so it isn't really a direct port of the PC game.
2820632	2826779	That's kind of them trying to weave these tangled words of, we didn't promise you everything.
2828444	2829184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2857489	2861753	Although I imagine there'll still be a casual mode that won't have that element in it.
2863975	2874944	So Minecraft, sales figures, 6 million sold on the PC, 9 million across all platforms when you factor in Xbox, Android, and iOS.
2875564	2877286	Maybe 9.2 million.
2877566	2880849	That's according to Daniel Kaplan with Mojang.
2881369	2881870	That's a lot.
2882170	2882530	That's a lot.
2882550	2887252	That's a lot, especially considering I don't think the iOS and... I can't imagine those sold a lot.
2887472	2888693	I mean, I don't think in the millions.
2889173	2890093	Maybe a million a pop.
2890433	2893794	I mean, the Xbox One's probably sold at least a million and a half at this point.
2894435	2897776	So... Well, they said they were profitable within 10 hours.
2898576	2909380	That is... This is the type of thing they're going to look back on in 10 years and be all like, hey, remember in the 2010s when people played Minecraft?
2909560	2910861	Just like we kind of look back and go...
2911281	2913102	Hey, remember the pet rock?
2914343	2924948	You know, I think it'll be that whole thing where it's still... I just have a feeling that Lego is just kicking themselves going, Damn it, we could have done something like this.
2925088	2928089	We could have so done something like this.
2928670	2930971	You're going to see this on VH1 in 10 years.
2931091	2934012	Michael Ian Black commenting on VH1's I Love the 10s.
2934032	2935453	Do we even do that anymore?
2936613	2937434	I Love the 10s.
2937794	2939315	Remember Minecraft?
2940642	2943388	Remember when we used to have this show?
2944451	2946336	Do countdowns of decades and stuff?
2946817	2948020	And it just stopped.
2951214	2952054	Alright, so there you go.
2952395	2954096	That's what's going on in Minecraft world.
2954656	2957358	So DarkSakura, if you want to talk about a different game, now would be a good chance.
2957518	2962722	Well, I said if people want me to play the damn game, they need to buy it for me on PC.
2963542	2964843	That's cute.
2964963	2966905	You think you live in a world where that will happen.
2967005	2968446	So that means I don't have to play it.
2969046	2969366	No, no.
2970067	2972389	Don't even try to get out of it like that.
2972769	2976431	You can download the classic version completely free on their website.
2976451	2977212	So I tried to tell her.
2978052	2978533	Star Wars Star Wars
2993710	2996992	There's going to be a new Star Wars franchise unveiled next week.
2998613	2999573	And it's a bold vision.
2999994	3001014	And we don't know what the crap it is.
3001094	3003576	But it's going to be on GTTV.
3004516	3005617	So, good.
3006037	3006798	That's on Thursday.
3008639	3013461	What it was said, though, is that it actually had a pretty high caliber team on it.
3014022	3015803	And it's going to be very bold.
3016043	3016603	Very bold.
3016643	3017404	But we don't know what it is.
3018124	3026627	So, I mean, hopefully it's going to be better than the MMO because the MMO was losing people and it really wasn't all that great that I saw.
3026987	3027908	I'm not impressed by it.
3028828	3032449	Except I do kind of like the alignment change thing, but that's about it.
3032929	3033630	That's really about it.
3034410	3034590	Yay.
3035222	3037624	It's going to be a new Battlefront series, and that sounds awesome.
3037704	3038024	You think?
3038244	3038684	I think so.
3038804	3039425	That would be worth it.
3039445	3041486	They're just going to call it something different.
3041626	3046389	How about a return to the Super Nintendo-style side-scroller games?
3046409	3047250	That would be rad.
3048531	3049532	Yeah, that would be cool.
3049832	3056496	And of course, a lot of times when I think about LucasArts, I think about the point-and-click adventure games from back in the day, like Loom and Indiana Jones and shit.
3056536	3065102	So how about a fucking, like, you know, hey, Telltale's kind of made that industry cool again with the whole Walking Dead's doing very well.
3067683	3072686	Since they're already stealing from Blizzard, why don't they just keep doing it and do like a Diablo style?
3073687	3075128	You know, point like that.
3076288	3079891	Since they're already, I'm sorry, borrowing from Blizzard.
3080071	3086234	I am with Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com as long as it's not Han Solo's dance party for the Kinect.
3088495	3090477	You know what Han Solo's dance party would be?
3091137	3092018	Him shooting people.
3092458	3092758	The end.
3096591	3100612	God, I just hope they don't make a sequel to that game because it was terrible.
3101332	3104434	It probably sold okay, but man, it was a terrible game.
3105974	3111736	Speaking of terrible, there's been some terrible things going on at 38 Studios and Big Huge Games.
3111876	3113297	They've laid off their entire staff.
3113837	3114737	Thanks for watching.
3114798	3115458	I'll see you next time.
3135427	3136287	Thank you for watching!
3148177	3148838	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3148878	3153441	Wasn't there a tweet that something like they had sold 1.2 million or something?
3153962	3158525	Or was that like shipped versus sold in that whole clever math that we see in the gaming industry?
3159566	3165151	Honestly, I don't know when that update was, but it sold well under 3 million units, that's for sure.
3166012	3171336	I mean, that stuff takes time, but not enough time to repay their debts.
3171576	3176100	And it's just there was a whole bunch of just...
3176640	3178121	Terrible stuff going on there.
3178241	3179122	I was reading things.
3180143	3183885	Oh, yeah, 1.22 million units in the first 90 days is what they said.
3185826	3192070	But also, like, I heard stuff where some of the employees that were relocated to work for this company.
3193271	3195613	Oh, by the way, you know that house that we bought for you?
3197474	3200316	Yeah, we never paid for it.
3200456	3203478	We took a second mortgage out on your home just so you know.
3203498	3204179	Yeah, I heard about that.
3204199	3205720	You have another mortgage now.
3207200	3209141	Yeah, that sucks.
3209201	3211363	And that kind of stuff can really fuck your credit.
3211563	3215285	I mean, that's the really sad thing about this, you know.
3216445	3223209	But hooray to the gaming industry for at least trying to... Because usually you think of the gaming industry and you think of the people on Xbox Live, you know.
3223729	3225370	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you know.
3225770	3227791	And also, I mean, considering that there was almost...
3228771	3254317	380 employees at 38 studios so they you know people on Twitter have been kind of rallying to you know with 38 the hashtag 38 jobs also Facebook group 38 jobs and they've got you know people including like Alex Rubens you know game journalist and he's been you know collecting like stuff into a Google Doc with all these different studios with openings and stuff and
3254657	3277999	and there's also job fairs going on in their area and they're kind of letting these people know he might be a listener of the show because him and I have followed each other on Twitter for a while and so I actually kind of saw his tweets about that when he was putting it together his whole Google Docs thing and I thought that was a really cool idea so props to him I'm glad you're getting your especially because I know he's an aspiring game journalist this is a good thing you know good begets good you know what I mean so good for him
3278659	3282022	I had a clever retort Okay, what is your retort, young lady?
3306673	3308915	The douches keep girl bits clean, so how is that bad?
3312597	3317380	Well, look, whatever he is, he's apparently not the best businessman in the world.
3317821	3318881	We can certainly say that.
3318981	3333712	So, I mean, what about the repercussions that are being felt for the fact that his name basically got a state to believe in his company enough to give them this huge loan that now they're going to have to eat?
3334432	3335654	Thanks for watching!
3354656	3356558	That's a lot of money.
3356598	3363504	DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, Amalur wasn't that bad of a game, but the timing for its release couldn't get out from Skyrim Shadow.
3363564	3364845	Which, I mean, I don't know.
3365746	3368208	A lot of people had already burned through Skyrim by the time it had come out.
3368228	3371171	I wouldn't blame Skyrim, because it was a few months after Skyrim.
3371331	3375715	I would blame Mass Effect 3, because it came out literally like three weeks before Mass Effect 3.
3376215	3383037	Well, not even that, but maybe it's just me and the fact that I don't watch a lot of TV or when I do, I watch it without commercials.
3383698	3389560	I hadn't really heard a lot about this game, which, you know, considering I do this show, you'd think... To be honest, it's the first I've ever heard of it.
3389940	3390200	Right?
3390460	3391460	Maybe that's a problem.
3391600	3396982	Well, it is a problem considering it's EA the one publishing it and they usually pimp the shit out of their games.
3397443	3401144	I mean, I heard about it and stuff and I saw, you know, they had a demo and...
3401844	3409251	I didn't really see any TV advertisement for it, but then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so it's possible that they had stuff for it.
3410152	3414055	But it's not like Madden or something, they'd spend a lot of money on it.
3415636	3419838	Phantasm, our chatroom says, Reckoning had a bad release window with Skyrim and Mass Effect 3.
3419978	3422879	Is it possible that the game just released at a bad time?
3424460	3426080	Once again, I'm not going to blame Skyrim.
3426120	3427601	Skyrim was two months before it.
3427901	3431382	It could contribute, but I think there might be other factors.
3431522	3440966	What about just the fact that maybe the month it released usually isn't a big month for games, especially maybe they should have held it off until summer because those first few weeks really do make or break your game.
3441325	3442125	You know what I'm going to blame?
3442145	3445806	I'm going to blame the fucking online pass because it was a game that had an online pass.
3445886	3449867	They literally called it an online pass for a game that had no online component.
3451228	3452508	Oh, that's right.
3452548	3453288	That was this game.
3453308	3460850	They had no online component, but the online pass, they literally called it an online pass, was just bonus DLC.
3461030	3461850	Yeah, that didn't help.
3462731	3463491	So, I mean...
3465612	3466912	Just call it bonus DLC.
3467493	3469854	Then if you don't buy it at launch, you don't get the bonus DLC.
3470074	3474155	And all you can do is go, well, damn, I should have bought the game at launch.
3474255	3476036	I mean, I don't see how that's a bad thing at all.
3476816	3478037	Instead, you're calling an online pass.
3478077	3479618	Oh, you've got to pay this extra money to get...
3480518	3497048	Get online and download this extra DLC I don't really know what the spin was on that Alright, well continuing with things that might drive the gaming industry further into a hole You've got to hear about this patent that was discovered this week Sony Computer Entertainment America, or SCEA
3497868	3499429	Filed for this patent in 2011.
3499469	3501991	It usually takes a little time for these patents to be found.
3502051	3504373	So yes, it's an older patent, but it's just being found now.
3505334	3511958	The patent was for an advertising system where a game will be suspended during play for an advertisement to come up.
3512359	3513519	Then the game will continue.
3513920	3517402	Think of it like how TV commercials interrupt your show.
3517763	3518103	Hulu.
3519043	3519484	Or Hulu.
3521107	3529354	Adds would be preceded by a warning and a slowdown of gameplay, with another warning displayed when gameplay is about to resume.
3529855	3534639	So it's kind of like, ad incoming, everything slowed down.
3534659	3535580	Movie sign!
3535680	3536321	Bye, Pepsi!
3537862	3539243	Okay, let's get back into the game.
3539403	3544088	Yeah, seriously, that reminds me of Mr. Sensei with the movie sign.
3545911	3567400	um now just because they filed the patent doesn't mean it will be implemented it's just you know again patents are to kind of protect ideas or what have you which is weird because i thought i i thought ios games did this shit already doesn't word with friends kind of do something like this where you play and then you get mad if you have the um free version yeah if you i i i have the paid version of words with friends that never does that crap to me
3567699	3573248	I don't know, would this be terrible if it was to support free full console games?
3573288	3575111	Like, for example, ad-supported stuff?
3576252	3582322	Say I want to get LittleBigPlanet 2 and I get an ad-supported version that stops gameplay once in a while to pimp me Pepsi or something?
3583443	3589767	I would probably, I'd probably just want to buy the regular game, which is what they want you to do in the first place, but they can make more ad revenue.
3590028	3594090	If this shit pops up in a fucking retail game, I'm not fucking buying that.
3594130	3596012	This was in Wipeout as well, wasn't it?
3596112	3596492	Sorta?
3596752	3597052	Sorta?
3597092	3599414	I mean, it didn't really pause gameplay, but it was in like the loading screens.
3600049	3601390	Well, that's one thing.
3601530	3606395	If they have it as something that's not going to be obtrusive.
3606975	3612040	If it's not going to interrupt your gameplay, I don't so much have a problem with it.
3612981	3614822	I'm cool with the billboards in racing games.
3615663	3622049	But I think that if they're doing this as a way to bring in more revenue, they need to decrease the price of the game.
3622595	3623296	Absolutely.
3623836	3628258	Now, Brad from PodCulture is in our chat room and says, don't effing get me started on patents.
3628639	3632501	Had my phone delayed in customs a week or so ago because of a BS Apple patent.
3632841	3638084	Well, you know, a lot of folks are saying the patent industry in this country is really screwed up right now.
3638684	3641426	And it's a lot of just offensive and defensive maneuvers.
3641486	3644748	Remember when Twitter came out and said, we have all of these patents.
3644768	3649691	They actually put out a press release that said, we have acquired all these patents and we only plan to use them defensively.
3650491	3652173	Like it's a fucking game of chess.
3652974	3654976	That's what the patent industry in this country has become.
3655256	3657858	So yeah, maybe Sony is not even going to do anything with this.
3657939	3663023	It's just we just want to defend ourselves against when somebody tries to call us on it or something.
3663184	3669610	And to throw my political two cents into it, this is what happens when you allow certain businesses to go deregulated.
3670924	3675371	DJ Morpheus is in our chat room and gives us an example of what could come to a PlayStation game near you.
3676152	3681782	We'll return you to your blood carnage marathon game after this message from some feminine yeast infection product.
3685470	3687491	That would be freaking hilarious.
3687611	3693772	Actually, that I could support just for the comic value alone because I'd want to see reaction videos to that on the interwebs.
3693913	3694593	It'd be hilarious.
3695133	3703975	Now, maybe this is related news, but Sony Online Entertainment, or SOE, has announced a free-to-play game called Bullet Run.
3704515	3707256	It's a revamped game from Acony Games.
3707396	3708777	What was this?
3708917	3712237	Head1 or Headin was the game with a new title?
3712838	3713598	H-E-D-O-N-E.
3713638	3713738	Head1?
3713798	3713938	Head1?
3715146	3715826	Yeah, I had one.
3741738	3771207	known for such games as APB and Battleforge meaning they haven't had a lot of luck so far but maybe this will be it and maybe this will make Sony money because oh I'm about to score a headshot on my opponent and have you tried Summer's Eve speaking of douches it'd be funnier it's just relative to the conversation yes it'd be funnier if it was in Max Payne 3 bullet time advertisement
3772952	3775607	Bullet time over Advertisement gone
3777338	3777698	Interesting.
3777738	3781401	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, You know those ads that appear in billboards in games and such?
3781441	3784224	They actually find ways to block those ads from loading in games.
3784664	3786946	You know that ad that pops up on the Xbox Live dashboard?
3786966	3789428	There's a little tweak you can make that blocks it so it doesn't load.
3789748	3795233	I seem to remember reading something about that once where it's like on your router, you block a certain domain or something.
3795253	3797014	You never have to see that shit.
3797274	3805121	Basically, you redirect certain IPs to your local domain so that it doesn't load those things up.
3805821	3824633	um but yeah i mean you could do that it would it depends but you'd all you would be you'd be interrupted with a blank screen instead you know what my favorite way of getting rid of ads is i'm not giving a fuck ignore it how about that don't give a fuck
3825282	3828204	or just don't, I mean, this is the age of the internet.
3828284	3831746	You're gonna know when there's gonna be some sort of software out there that has ads in it.
3831966	3833047	It's gonna be on fucking blogs.
3833327	3840751	Hey, can you imagine this next God of War game has fucking ads for like, you know, Subway in the middle of the damn game.
3840991	3842432	Are you out of fucks to give?
3842732	3844673	Try new Folgers Instant Coffee.
3845133	3846374	It will perk you right back up.
3846394	3847415	You'll have plenty of fucks.
3848355	3849055	This is my thing.
3849155	3855597	If it's free or a very inexpensive service, I don't really care if there's ads.
3856057	3860078	If it keeps the cost low or free, fine.
3860278	3862578	That's great.
3863459	3866839	And then offer a paid option if you don't want to see the ads.
3866959	3868680	That, I think, is fair.
3869780	3876962	But when you've already paid the money for the game, and then you have your game interrupted, that's a little too far.
3877062	3877542	I'm with you.
3877602	3884344	It's that and the microtransaction stuff, the Facebook-style game in your $60 game.
3884664	3885965	That shit pisses me the fuck off.
3885985	3889846	They're going to keep doing it because they can charge $60 for a game and someone's going to pay for it.
3890346	3891546	If they charge $20 for the game.
3891746	3894087	That's why there's going to be another video game industry crash.
3894407	3894587	Wait.
3894787	3911736	If they paid, now if they charged $20 for a game and then had, I refuse to use the word, had individual transactions within the game, that I could understand a little bit more because then you're paying for the cost of development, you're paying for the cost of advertising, and you're paying for the shipping.
3911956	3917839	So you're a supporter of Ridge Racer for the Vita, which was basically a $30 game that came with nothing.
3918079	3922241	It was basically a six, six, no, I'm sorry, six cars, three tracks.
3922261	3923142	That game can ask my D.
3924147	3924527	You know what?
3925308	3930333	I paid two bucks for Best Move, and I paid for all the maps, all the puzzles.
3931134	3932675	I ended up spending six bucks on that game.
3932695	3934557	Yeah, but two versus 30 is a huge difference.
3934577	3936259	But I'm saying as an example.
3936789	3939272	Alright, going to a couple more comments from chat and then we'll move on.
3939332	3944298	ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Too much effort for something that really doesn't mean anything.
3944318	3946360	And I believe that's in regards to blocking the ads.
3947061	3950084	Sepwin says, I don't have a problem with ads when they fit.
3950505	3954109	Like ads in a sports game that look like the ads you see at a real game.
3954409	3955471	Yeah, believe it or not, I don't...
3956051	3957151	I don't give a shit about those at all.
3957171	3958652	It kind of adds to the experience, really.
3959712	3960812	It makes it more realistic.
3960832	3961452	I mean, it really does.
3963393	3964353	YouTube ads, however.
3964773	3970334	Infanel says, stupid ads like on Xbox Dashboard make me want to avoid that product or service.
3970474	3971014	Here's what you do.
3971054	3972295	I don't know if I go that far with it.
3972335	3973835	Here's what you do, ad people.
3974095	3975855	And this is pure ad genius right here.
3976375	3983437	You make a fighting game a la Smash Brothers or Sony mascot Battle Royale, whatever they're calling it.
3984097	3988360	Um, and you just make it with the mascots from those advertisements.
3988560	3989101	And there you go.
3989241	3991503	It's one big ad that actually fits within the game.
3991543	3994285	But there were whole games around, um, mascots.
3994365	3995586	Remember, like, the Yo!
3995646	3999728	Noid and Cool Spot and... Exactly, and I'm saying... Oh, yeah, Mick Kids.
4000569	4000989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4018237	4021599	Those Burger King games were one of the best things I've seen, actually.
4022059	4026582	I mean, although the games were stupid, I mean, just the fact that they even made them is quite astounding.
4026902	4030324	Alright, quickly, I want to read this comment from chat, and then we need to move on for time.
4030624	4035427	Blender in our chatroom says, I bought a Subway sandwich for the Uncharted 3 freebies.
4035627	4037288	I gotta say, that was a really good promotion, too.
4037308	4037828	It really was.
4037868	4042771	Yeah, I bought a Subway sandwich for those Uncharted 3 freebies as well, and they didn't give up to me!
4044127	4046508	Yeah, but that's your individual Subway's fault.
4046689	4054413	I've been, like, multiple Subways for the, I've been getting, like, the large, you know, they're all, yeah, buy a large drink and you get code for some Battleship thing.
4054793	4058335	I have yet to get a fucking code in, like, five different Subways.
4058395	4059476	A Battleship thing?
4059676	4060456	It's, like, for money.
4060637	4061037	I don't know.
4061177	4062778	But it's tying in with the movie.
4063118	4064979	Which is a fail.
4065119	4065599	I get it.
4065820	4066680	I get it.
4066980	4069882	Because they're sub-sandwiches.
4070983	4072083	Congratulations.
4072123	4073144	You figured it out.
4078606	4084007	I saw the best article on Oh No They Didn't, which is one of my favorite websites on the entire internet.
4084388	4091490	It was an article that was just, here is the complete bits of dialogue that Rihanna had in the movie Battleship.
4096247	4098568	Oh my god, it was just, it was great.
4098648	4099509	Anyway, let's move on.
4099669	4100409	Video game news.
4100449	4101850	How about something that's actually cool?
4101910	4102950	Less Battleship, yes.
4103250	4104551	How about some Kojima news?
4105291	4111434	There's been some artwork revealed for a particular game that I know a lot of people are super excited about.
4111514	4112094	You know what that is?
4112995	4113195	No.
4113395	4114836	A new zone of the Enders.
4116336	4123800	The Enders project is in an experimental phase and he's trying to develop the game using the Fox engine.
4124640	4149752	so hopefully we can see this out before too long right now though it's supposed to be a fully fledged sequel to Zone of the Enders the second runner and so hopefully we can see that out before too long and there's also been plenty of artwork tweeted by people who were at the press event I'd like to see a new Zone of the Enders game that would be fun
4150438	4153707	And this event actually was specific for the Ender's HD Collection.
4154389	4155973	What's up with all these HD Collections?
4156872	4157552	People are buying them.
4157852	4158172	I know.
4158232	4158913	That's what's up with them.
4159873	4167115	All right, let's travel around the world and look at some games that are going to be coming out a whole lot sooner, as in this week, as we travel the world with release dates.
4167215	4167875	Loki, US.
4168155	4169936	There's not a whole lot coming out this week.
4170296	4173437	I mean, some re-releases, I guess, or I don't know.
4174297	4184721	We've got Batman Arkham City Game of the Year Edition, which is coming out this week on PS3 and Xbox 360 with that wonderful Harley Quinn's Revenge.
4186301	4188182	DLC and crap thrown in.
4188222	4193605	Hey, I like how they talk about... I know people genuinely excited about that and it sounds pretty robust.
4193685	4195286	I'm into it.
4195887	4198208	Robust, like Catwoman.
4198948	4200669	It's robust bust.
4201870	4202450	Whatever.
4203030	4203571	Whatever.
4205060	4207062	Let's see, other fun things this week.
4207102	4212547	Deer Drive, Legends on the 3DS, get your deer hunting on in 3D.
4213227	4217131	Otlier Maruru, The Apprentice of Arland on PlayStation 3 this week.
4217671	4219873	Resistance, Burning Skies on the Vita.
4221354	4223276	Might have to check that out, that looks pretty neat.
4226560	4227822	There's not a whole lot this week.
4227862	4229484	A lot of it getting cancelled.
4231306	4234289	Max Payne 3, special edition and the regular edition on PC coming out as well.
4234329	4234630	And that's it.
4244020	4245361	Alright, let's travel to Japan.
4245741	4249024	Check out the games that are coming out over there in Japan on the Nintendo 3DS.
4249945	4254668	I don't know, I don't think there's a Disney game this week, but for some reason a bunch of character cases are coming out.
4254708	4259992	So if you've ever wanted to stitch character case, import one from Japan because there's a bunch of those coming out there from Hori.
4260573	4263475	It must tie into Dream Drop Distance somehow, it must.
4264155	4278881	uh but what is coming out on the 3ds this is kind of a big deal Dragon Quest Monsters Terry No Wonderland 3d so it's not in the main series of Dragon Quest games but still it carries the name it is from Square Enix so it'll be a little bit of a deal there
4279501	4282545	Guild 01 from level 5 comes out as well.
4282585	4284928	That's all again on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

4318254	4318675	Pachinko.
4318815	4319275	Pachinko game.
4319875	4320355	Not like Al Pacino.
4320376	4321596	I heard Legend in there somewhere.
4321756	4323357	Yeah, it's a Sega Pachinko game.
4323897	4324538	That's what you get.
4325659	4342721	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13 but that is in English but it's getting a Japanese release and hey Portal 2 gets a price reduction so if you want to hear what GLaDOS sounds like in Japanese there you go lastly on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week Portal 2 gets that same price reduction and that's really it
4343382	4344563	How about the UK, DarkSakura?

4353049	4356832	And then we have on June 1st Max Payne 3 for PC.
4357573	4358614	That's about it.
4359134	4363117	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4363197	4364098	But first, Loki.
4364933	4365473	Ah, yes.
4366193	4370294	So let's talk a little bit about... This is kind of funny.
4370634	4371014	Connect.
4371374	4373195	They have new technology now.
4373555	4376476	New technology where they can detect you sitting down.
4377016	4377456	That's right.
4377516	4380396	Connect Software Development Kit Update 1.5.
4381057	4386698	Now features the ability to connect with you sitting on the couch.
4388338	4417550	and now it can't tell if I'm wearing pants or not right because you know I have this legit fear about the Kinect that if I you know it's my house I'll do what I want and if I'm sitting in front of the Xbox 360 not wearing pants and playing Minecraft I don't want that image broadcast to the internet and I have this fear in the back of my mind I put a little box in front of the Kinect when I don't want to be seen by the internet um yeah they don't have that ability in here it's not one of the listed features but um
4418385	4421610	Other fun stuff, they've got a development kit for face tracking.
4422551	4426577	Also, some human interface guidelines and other improvements.
4427719	4428961	Also, they're saying that...
4431640	4437184	They have full seated skeletal tracking mode, which is to track people sitting down.
4437685	4456059	And they said also that, I think this is more, obviously this is only on PC, but I think a little bit, since most people on PC are probably sitting down to interface with stuff, I would hate to have to stand up to read an email or something like that with Kinect.
4457116	4462000	Well, it'll be nice, too, that now you can play Kinect without actually having to move.
4463322	4465844	It's kind of the nice, you know, antithesis.
4465924	4470048	I'm pretty sure, I mean, the Kinect does detect you sitting down.
4471149	4475112	Like, for some things, like, you can browse menus and stuff like that in the Xbox Kinect, just...
4476233	4477093	I think sitting down.
4477353	4480815	I don't think you have to stand up to browse video menus and stuff like that.
4481675	4490358	Then again, I'm not stupid enough to hook up Kinect to do that when I could go, Huh, controller is faster.
4490958	4501821	Seriously, why would I need... I never understood why I need to browse those menus with my arm when I can just put the controller in my hand and just do that.
4501881	4502282	I mean, I...
4503662	4504404	It's faster.
4504785	4505827	It really is faster.
4506328	4513403	Voice searches, that's kind of cool, but moving my hand around to select things, that is slower.
4515546	4518347	Well, we will see what this brings into games later on.
4518387	4520227	Although, couldn't you play Joyride sitting down?
4520427	4522287	Was it supposed to be able to see your hands driving the car?
4523507	4524928	Um, I didn't play that long.
4524948	4526428	Maybe it's because it was only looking at your hands.
4526468	4527528	It wasn't looking at the rest of your body.
4527568	4527908	I don't know.
4528708	4535770	Well, there's somewhat of an in-joke amongst the community of Konami fans that have been following them for some time, and it's called Konami Will Sue.
4536270	4539950	But maybe this week the joke should be changed to Konami Will Be Sued.
4540371	4542691	Because Konami was sued this week, and, uh...
4543952	4545613	You'd be pretty impressed what it's for.
4545673	4546273	It's pretty crazy.
4546754	4551938	City National Bank is the one that's filed the suit against Konami and Autumn Games.
4552538	4553939	And it's over fraud.
4554680	4562626	And the reason why is because the bank hasn't received any return on a $15 million line of credit that it approved to both Konami and Autumn Games.
4563067	4569472	And the court documents claim that the financial state of Autumn and Konami were false.
4570032	4575534	at the time that they were made and that defendants never had any intention of repaying the loan as promised.
4575974	4579075	That's all a quote from the court documents and so is this.
4579576	4592440	Rather than paying game-related proceeds directly to CNB or City National Bank as agreed, defendants have kept all game-related proceeds for themselves and have refused to remit any such proceeds to City National Bank.
4592480	4593341	Here's what I think the problem is.
4594841	4603926	I think that they think that those games or, you know, Def Jam Rapstar was going to be successful and they're like, where's our percentage of, you know, of the profits?
4604066	4605167	Why are we only getting like $10?
4605207	4608229	Well, that is your percentage, actually.
4609890	4611971	You can't divide by zero, stupid.
4612752	4616254	Sorry, that's how much, that's how many copies we sold.
4616574	4617755	You get a big fat check for $20.
4618635	4619636	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4644713	4645774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4665151	4666152	But there were no lawsuits.
4666452	4667393	There were no laws.
4667733	4668593	Yes, right.
4669074	4671255	There were no laws in this game, actually.
4671275	4672136	I think this is a perfect day.
4672156	4673397	It was lawless land.
4673677	4678660	We're going to travel back in time and visit the classic game of the week.
4679280	4689067	Every week, DarkSakura dives into the vault and pulls out a classic game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brat, your new fangled crap.
4690308	4693190	Go back and play something old school like this.
4693670	4694951	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4695291	4695611	Diablo 2 Diablo 3
4713647	4717310	This is Ragnarok Online, which was my crack.
4717931	4721113	And I have, from time to time, been known to go back on a free server.
4721974	4729820	I am also one of the people who basically has a permanent account on IRO, the International Ragnarok Online, because I played in the beta.
4730561	4734384	I played in the Korean beta, I played in the Japanese beta, and I played in the US beta.
4734964	4736465	Yeah, I've played a lot of Ragnarok.
4737286	4740609	And my last, I think... Fuck, even I remember this music.
4742000	4742380	DarkSakura.com
4761591	4763571	Anyway, it's made by Gravity.
4764312	4767812	It is based off of the Mantua, which is called Ragnarok.
4768773	4772213	And there was a Ragnarok 3 animation based off of it.
4772233	4774414	It was actually a pretty good little anime.
4776294	4777855	It really captured the game very well.
4779195	4783756	You've got different types of gameplay that are in it.
4783776	4787317	You have PvE, you have Guild vs. Guild, and PvP.
4788357	4790999	So you can initiate PvP anywhere.
4792861	4796724	Guild vs. Guild, I really, really, really liked that function.
4797245	4799907	Because it was a big capture the flag kind of thing.
4800728	4812137	And I think that's something that... Now while I'm not a PvP fan, that is kind of the only reason why I like Battlegrounds at all in WoW.
4813038	4815680	It's because it kind of reminds me of this, even though I didn't do it that often.
4815700	4818022	Because, honestly, I was a PvE person.
4818082	4819203	I'm always a PvE person.
4820664	4822285	It's sprite-based.
4822746	4827469	It is with different 3D environments.
4828470	4836136	And you basically travel all over this little world in the game getting different creatures.
4836256	4841280	And for as long as I played this damn game, Rob, I have not been everywhere in it.
4842020	4843061	It is big.
4844661	4860229	I mean, yeah, I've been to everything on the main map, but there's all the little caves and the dungeons and the special areas, and I haven't been everywhere in the game, although I have been to certain areas of the games many times, like the freaking Toy Factory.
4860469	4861290	Or Prontera.
4861590	4862130	Pronterra.
4862571	4863671	Warp to prompt, please.
4863971	4864972	Warp to prompt, please.
4865692	4870335	I'm glad that they took out that warping thing because that was such a pain.
4870875	4877719	Basically, priests could teleport and they could open warp portals and they did something because that's not there anymore.
4878559	4878640	Um...
4879700	4884463	It really was based heavily off of Norse mythology.
4886484	4888565	You have different classes.
4889766	4894709	They also offered transcendent classes that keep going forward.
4895549	4897871	So yeah, with the different versions you have your jobs.
4899372	4900753	Everyone starts off as a novice.
4901373	4906076	And then you actually can become a super novice where you get different aspects of other classes.
4906756	4910519	Then you have a swordman who can become a knight or a crusader.
4911079	4914521	And then rebirth classes where you start over and rebuild them with more goodies.
4916242	4921286	So basically your first job class is swordsman, mage, archer, merchant, thief, acolyte.
4922187	4929949	and then you can expand to guns you also have expanded classes such as Gunslinger Ninja or Taekwon which playing a Taekwon is actually really fun
4930580	4934843	The chat room was getting upset with the music because it's the only music you ever heard in the game.
4934883	4937504	So I switched it because there was more than one song in Ragnarok Online.
4938265	4939346	Oh, I love that music.
4939406	4940486	That's Juno, isn't it?
4941907	4942968	That music is so pretty.
4943008	4943868	I love that area.
4944069	4944309	Anyway.
4945289	4946310	I thought you might approve.
4946510	4950293	After the 2-1, you can actually become a Night Wizard, Hunter, Blacksmith, Assassin, or Priest.
4950713	4952674	I played a Blacksmith for a while named Tony Stark.
4952974	4953395	Just saying.
4954195	4961820	Mecha, Crusader, Sage, Bard, Dancer, Alchemist, Rogue, Monk Lord Knight, High Wizard, Sniper, Master Smith, Assassin, Cross, High Priest Paladin, Scholar, Minstrel, Gypsy, Biochemist, Stalker, Champion
4980013	4982454	I actually have to say that minstrels are pretty fun.
4984215	4988237	For female ones, you had a dancer who basically looks like a harem chick.
4989538	4990819	There's a soundtrack come out.
4991179	4993180	There's all kinds of stuff for this.
4993720	5001824	There are pay-to-play servers, and then there's tons of freemium stuff that goes on with it, too, like the Caffra shop.
5001844	5002925	You can buy different stuff.
5004146	5008368	With free-to-play servers, basically, you can play for free, but to support...
5009328	5014612	The servers, they usually have special freebie goods or special goods that you can pay for.
5015153	5019756	Like for one server I played on, there used to be these little dolls you could get that sit on top of your head.
5019816	5020737	They were selling doll hats.
5021037	5022819	They had a sprite artist who would make doll hats.
5023459	5025661	And you paid like 20 bucks and you got a doll hat.
5026961	5029002	And it was good because it kept the server paid for.
5029022	5031722	Because it does cost money to keep these going off.
5032062	5040384	There's also Ragnarok Mobile that you can use to focus on your characters.
5040464	5043585	And then there was the Ragnarok RPG that I've been playing.
5043625	5050067	And there's a version on Game Boy that I... You got me the Japanese version of it, didn't you?
5050327	5050487	Yeah.
5051127	5079826	I played the crap out of that because I could read Prontera and I knew where I was on the damn map and I think an English version of that since came out too but it is really fun I would say that if you're looking for just like a little freebie RPG to get into Ragnarok Online is really fun and like my favorite class still to this day is Assassin because it's like pow pow pow pow it's just all speed it was awesome so yeah my game is Ragnarok Online
5081744	5084505	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Ragnarok Online for the PC.
5085945	5088846	And various spin-offs on other devices that DarkSakura named.
5089066	5089267	Yes.
5089407	5091247	A game I haven't played in about ten years.
5091387	5094608	I have, I've been playing the one on the iPhone lately, and it's pretty fun.
5094768	5095149	That's cool.
5095289	5095469	Yeah.
5096309	5097069	I might have to check that out.
5097089	5098950	Yeah, you play a total... On my shiny new iPad.
5099410	5100810	You play a total asshole, though.
5100870	5101431	He's so fun.
5101851	5102331	Good times.
5103780	5105782	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5106182	5113668	We're going to take a break here live as we are taping our episode number 458B here live on May the 27th of 2012.
5113748	5116510	We're going to take a quick break here, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5116530	5118051	We've got plenty more show to come.
5118111	5119392	We've got some rapid-fire news.

5137921	5140422	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5140462	5148207	We are live on this Memorial Day weekend May the 27th of 2012 with episode number 458B of our podcast.
5148287	5150007	Why is it episode 458B?
5150588	5153489	Well go back and listen to the first part of the show if you want to know why it is 458B.
5155551	5159334	Anyhow, we're going to get back in with some rapid-fire news here.
5160435	5168563	Again, I just want to really plug the VOG conference on Friday at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, live at vognetwork.com.
5169023	5173748	And I'm getting some people that are just sending me their ideas for VOG stuff, and I love it.
5173908	5175249	And I know Bobby wants to hear it.
5175329	5176410	DarkSakura would like to hear it.
5176790	5180574	Shit, anybody you can talk to that's one of the hosts on VOG somewhere...
5181034	5207146	Loki, Travis, whoever you know we love hearing the ideas and I'm talking to somebody about one idea right now I'm like well that is a good idea actually yes we should do that and so I love it because it's you know just like Orange Lounge Radio where every gamer has a voice was never really just about us VOG Network isn't really just about us either so it's about me it's about everybody no it's about me and my fabulousness stop hating Rob stop hating she's being a parody alright stop hating let's move on
5207646	5209047	It's about the gaming news now.
5209087	5214271	We're going to travel around and check out some quick stories in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5214351	5214591	Loki.
5215431	5215691	All right.
5216512	5219314	Let's talk a little bit about some upcoming games.
5220014	5224597	XCOM Enemy Unknown actually has been announced to be coming out on October 9th.
5225158	5236625	Now, I thought when I first saw this that this means, ah, damn, I guess we're not going to have any Grand Theft Auto V game announcement for October.
5237846	5248788	I'm not so sure if that's going to be the case anymore because actually there was an announcement for... Was it Take-Two put out their estimates for their fiscal years?
5249488	5257650	And for 2013, which would cover up through now through... Was it March of... March 31st, 2013.
5258070	5261471	And then we'll play some awesome music.
5263651	5286004	they have about 700 million dollars or you know unaccounted revenue in there and even if like some of these games do really well I don't think they're gonna hit that spot so people are thinking uh maybe that's Grand Theft Auto 5 in there somewhere which honestly if it were to come out in October it would um it probably would compete very well
5287800	5290262	They wouldn't cannibalize stuff.
5291263	5292544	God, I hope it's October.
5293565	5302032	Anyways, so yes, XCOM Enemy Unknown, October 9th, and I guess 13th internationally as well.
5302933	5303273	Pretty cool.
5303973	5314222	And then, of course, there's rumors, spoiler, I don't know, that EA's next Need for Speed game is actually going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted.
5315951	5318194	and perhaps a reboot of that franchise.
5318214	5319576	Wait, they already had a Most Wanted.
5319596	5320537	Yes, they did.
5320577	5324102	They also had a Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but that didn't stop them from having that last year.
5325283	5328788	So perhaps Most Wanted could be, you know...
5332597	5335759	It's like Apple's methodology.
5335859	5337280	It's the new most wanted.
5338421	5339702	More wanted-er.
5340823	5341884	Maybe most wanted-to.
5342004	5342404	I don't know.
5343485	5351671	Apparently, there's a schedule going around showing the game's going to be shown on...
5352672	5363062	EA's booth, and also apparently there was a Twitch TV feed or something like that for E3 that also has that listed on there as well, amongst some other TBA titles from Ubisoft.
5363682	5373652	So yeah, we'll probably see something from EA for Need for Speed Most Wanted, whether it be... I hope it's not the same damn title, because that's going to be confusing, because it didn't come out that long ago.
5373692	5375653	That was only like five years ago.
5376254	5378376	That's not that long in game time.
5379415	5384978	And last but not least, Carmageddon Reincarnation has hit their goal with 10 days left to go.
5385278	5393301	And of course, I guess that means we're going to be getting a remade Carmageddon game.
5393882	5400465	Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding some DLC to it now and probably going to be setting some different stretch goals for that as well.
5401065	5404907	And funding will be done in a few more days.
5406647	5408408	All right, let's move on with some other news.
5409649	5412151	You ever been to a website where you have to punch in CAPTCHA?
5412772	5417615	You know, like if you want to like download something or if you want to register for an account, you have to put in CAPTCHA.
5418316	5420598	And sometimes the words are very like nonsense.
5420618	5423520	I love this mock-up where somebody put kill me in the CAPTCHA.
5424301	5425101	Well, I love this.
5425241	5427783	Apparently, there is... I had destroyed enemies once.
5428204	5428664	Did you really?
5428704	5429104	Yes, I did.
5429184	5429765	That's awesome.
5430565	5435547	Anyhow, I guess there's a new Detroit-based startup company and they're called Are You a Human?
5435947	5442549	And what they aim to do, they want to replace the Captcha box that people use with mini-games.
5443270	5443730	Why not?
5443770	5445010	It accomplishes the same thing.
5445030	5447511	You wouldn't be able to beat the game if you weren't actually a human.
5447851	5455574	The tool they're developing is called Playthrough and it's going to allow a website owner to fight bots and spammers by using simple mini-games.
5455934	5472023	for example there could be a level where you put tools in a toolbox or you put toppings on a pizza some websites that are already using this Quicken Loans and Fathead I don't know what Fathead does but Fathead makes giant posters on the wall of sports figures oh
5472743	5474145	That's why I had no idea who they were.
5474205	5475187	I don't own any of those.
5475467	5476909	They do have a sweet Tron poster.
5476929	5483237	I don't own any of those either, but the reason I know they do that is because they also have that option for your Xbox Live avatar.
5483257	5486522	And I'm like, why the fuck would I want a six foot tall picture of my avatar on the wall?
5486562	5488484	I really have a big problem with your Tron poster.
5488985	5489205	What?
5489505	5495427	Just because it looks like all those little teleporting effects are just really bad use of the blur tool.
5496208	5496988	Well, I'm sorry.
5497008	5502610	Speaking of Tron, I did happen to see that that episode of Tron Uprising was on Disney last night.
5502990	5504190	And I was like, ooh, that's right.
5504230	5506491	We're only a couple weeks away from actual new episodes.
5506851	5513013	Well, you know what I found out is that, funny enough, a week from tonight, they are going to be doing some type of kickoff event at Downtown Disney.
5513413	5514754	Guess where I'm gonna be, yo?
5515254	5517176	So I plan to bring you a VOG.
5517196	5518697	You better bring me Tron stuff.
5518837	5521699	You better have a neon blue carpet.
5521819	5522720	I am so going.
5523541	5525903	And there will be a full report on VOG for sure.
5527304	5528745	I'm not expecting much though.
5528845	5533068	For all I know, they're just going to have a giant screen out in the middle of downtown Disney that's playing it.
5533108	5533729	So we'll see.
5533749	5536111	You're going to get kidnapped by a recognizer.
5536451	5537914	It'd be awesome if Paul Rubens was there.
5538375	5539496	Oh my gosh, it'd be awesome.
5539577	5540298	So we'll see, we'll see.
5540338	5541079	I'm not going to hold my breath.
5541119	5544665	Do you know who was at Disneyland, by the way, last weekend when we were there?
5545466	5546067	Lady Gaga.
5547637	5548818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5568732	5570153	Anyhow, don't ask me how I know that.
5570193	5571334	Alright, moving on.
5572575	5575616	Rumors about a new Castlevania game on the 3DS.
5575737	5577177	Apparently the name has leaked out.
5577238	5579339	Castlevania Mirror of Faith.
5580219	5582161	Supposedly this is a game that's going to be shown at E3.
5582701	5583401	Makes sense to me.
5583582	5585803	It's about time there's a new Castlevania game out on a handheld.
5585923	5588024	I have no reason to disbelieve this.
5589325	5594393	Especially because it's funny because this particular site is a site Nintendo Netherlands or whatever.
5594973	5599039	You might remember OLR blew the story on that about six years ago.
5599119	5601462	One of the DS games we had the exclusive on.
5601482	5603045	So I have no reason to doubt them.
5603265	5603846	They're sloppy.
5604026	5604667	The names get out.
5606974	5607494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5627967	5653669	I don't know, they're claiming it's directly from Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft would know some of this shit because they are doing some of the launch games which include, for Ubisoft Rayman Legends, The Avengers, Assassin's Creed 3 and Just Dance 4 a game called Killer Freaks from Outer Space supposed to arrive a few weeks after launch those are some pretty specific, I mean, granted about three of those are a duh but Killer Freaks from Outer Space, you can't guess that that was announced at E3 last year oh was it?
5653869	5656251	I don't remember that one yeah, they even had a video of it
5656531	5659852	Alright, so maybe it's just somebody using logic, but we'll see.
5659912	5662273	It looks like a cross between the Rabbids and Critters.
5662813	5665534	Like, the Rabbids were like evil alien things.
5665674	5666894	Wii U does DirectX 11.
5667514	5668995	It's already running Unreal Engine 4.
5669835	5673336	2 gigs of RAM, 560 megs of that dedicated to the OS.
5674196	5680138	November 23rd, the launch date, but remember that's coming out of Milan, so could be a little bit around there for other regions.
5680638	5683739	Launch price hasn't yet been decided, but they're saying $350 to $450, which tells me $399.
5687060	5689681	Multiple versions of the console out there with developers.
5690022	5693203	Graphics being powered by a Radeon HD 6770 chipset.
5693883	5696704	Assassin's Creed 3 is 60 frames a second at 1080p.
5697105	5699626	It is only running 720p on the other consoles right now.
5701246	5703147	November 23rd would be a Friday.
5703207	5704127	I don't know if they launch it.
5704167	5706048	But again, that's Milan.
5706088	5707449	That's not America.
5707769	5709950	So there sometimes is some shift with the days.
5710010	5711070	And you know the other thing?
5711150	5711551	Those Italians.
5711631	5712171	Italians.
5712691	5724173	Well, here's a problem I have with Ubisoft, this information coming from Ubisoft Milan, because Ubisoft Milan would be a, it's basically a portion of the company that does development for certain games.
5724293	5727834	So which game are they working on that they would be privy to this information?
5728114	5740937	Because, you know, Ubisoft Milan, let's see, let's... I'm sorry, I can't hear Ubisoft Milan without hearing in the back of my head RuPaul saying, London, Paris, Milan.
5742614	5743455	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5759142	5765363	Most interesting about this, Valve working on a digital distribution platform and portal ports.
5765963	5769244	That could be very interesting if Valve is involved with the Wii.
5769684	5776405	That's going to bring a heck of a lot of core gamer quote-unquote oomph to the Wii U. That would be amazing.
5776845	5781106	One other thing I'll say here, the new button supposedly has some link to the Wii Vitality Sensor.
5781466	5783607	So maybe a new form of it or something like that.
5783967	5785787	Well, I figured it would be a biometric button.
5787839	5794162	Alright, so that's it for the Wii U rumors, so let's move on with some more rapid fire news.
5795293	5803838	Okay, Rob, well, how about some stuff having to do with touchscreen graffiti controls for Jet Set Radio?
5804278	5805879	This is for the Vita release.
5807200	5821769	Basically, well, and there's still not a date on it yet, but they're saying that they're bringing in touchscreen controls and camera integration so that I guess you can, for customizing your tags in the game, so that should be pretty cool.
5822649	5837181	and then this is the thing that I lusted over yesterday and oh my god I want this so bad it like seriously makes me moist um girl the Street Fighter um
5839302	5868612	25th Anniversary Collector Set that comes in a big black box has a review figure 15 discs that includes on it Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online Edition, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition and the DLC and Street Fighter X Tekken and the DLC with a documentary, 2 anime movies, the full Street Fighter animated series and 11 discs of music
5868832	5871514	and it has a light up Ryu statue and Ryu's belt.
5871774	5873034	That is too much Street Fighter.
5873295	5873655	For $150.
5873935	5875616	You know what?
5875916	5876416	I want it.
5877357	5877997	Of course you do.
5878698	5880299	Because you are a consumer whore.
5880359	5880859	And how.
5881879	5884481	But really, I don't care because I freaking love Street Fighter.
5884881	5890344	I'm looking at this set and oh my dear God, it just, I'm literally moist right now.
5890444	5890905	I can't help it.
5893206	5894427	So, how about Harry Potter stuff?
5894727	5895167	How about it?
5896468	5899192	Apparently there's going to be a Harry Potter for Kinect and there's a trailer out.
5900494	5903318	It's got a really creepy face capture thing on it.
5904139	5906663	It does, but it actually looks pretty good.
5908345	5911390	It looks good in the trailer.
5912199	5915521	But then I'm like, the games are never really like that.
5916062	5918223	Just make the damn MMO already.
5918323	5918824	You know what?
5920065	5922787	Screw Harry Potter because fucking Ryu.
5922847	5923687	No, he's underage.
5924068	5924968	Statue, not anymore.
5926229	5928291	Statues, statue of Ryu that lights up.
5929071	5933653	with... It even has a certificate of authenticity.
5934614	5935274	How can you pass that up?
5935294	5936935	So you know it's authenticity.
5937815	5945219	It'll go on my wall and I will stare at Ryu for hours because that was my first video game crush was Ryu when I was a little kid.
5946340	5947600	Aw, that's kind of adorable.
5949001	5949201	Yep.
5949581	5949801	Okay.
5950142	5950422	I'm done.
5950542	5950962	I'm spent.
5951082	5951642	I'm really spent.
5952123	5952383	All right.
5952743	5956645	We are going to go to the Fugle question of the week.
5964482	5972929	The Google Question of the Week is a segment of our show where we ask a question on Facebook and Google+, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.
5973890	5974750	We didn't ask one tonight.
5974810	5978613	Some of you might have said, hey, I didn't see a new question on Facebook or Google this week.
5978654	5983537	That's because we never got to read last week's answers because of the crash, and it was a pretty timely question.
5983918	5986080	So I want to go through some of those right now.
5986100	5988762	So we're going to start on our Google Plus page.
5989903	5990283	Shit.
5990823	5991384	Google Plus.
5992071	5994375	I just dropped that brand new iPad of mine.
5994695	5995376	How convenient.
5996979	5997961	That's why I have a case on it.
5998201	5999022	Well, here's the weird thing.
5999122	6000705	I can't access Facebook right now.
6001206	6002328	Can you access Facebook, Loki?
6002708	6003808	Can I access Facebook?
6003828	6004268	Oh, there it went.
6004308	6004709	It just went.
6004749	6005109	Okay, good.
6005129	6008330	Because I was getting worried that I was going to miss the questions here.
6009310	6009850	Alright, anyhow.
6010550	6011170	The question of the week.
6011751	6014451	More and more games are incorporating multiplayer into their games.
6014511	6015572	For example, Mass Effect 3.
6016492	6021654	Some in the industry have been quoted as saying that multiplayer is essential in this day and age to having a successful game.
6022114	6025635	How important do you feel that multiplayer is to the games you purchase?
6026055	6029896	Have you ever been swayed on a game purchase because of the fact that it did or did not have multiplayer?
6031249	6045009	Redertainment answers the question and says multiplayer is irrelevant to me due to my ISP being fucking incompetent PSN being incompetent and me cancelling Xbox Live Gold as part of my effort to buy a house so in other words the world is out to get him
6047148	6052434	Vlogus responds and says, these are all from Google Plus again, Uncharted, Gears, Halo, etc.
6052974	6055918	All have some form of competitive multiplayer that I've never tried.
6056258	6061424	I only buy games for the single player component due to the rampant negativity on the online services.
6061964	6064667	I do love co-op multiplayer with my family or friends.
6065088	6068031	Tell Jamie I apologize for my bad grammar and punctuation.
6068331	6069391	That's okay, I'm not reading it.
6069411	6071392	You apologized to the wrong person.
6071912	6072593	And I'm mad.
6072713	6073213	No, I'm just kidding.
6073233	6074333	You actually didn't do a bad job.
6075114	6077835	I have pretty bad grammar myself, so I'm usually pretty forgiving.
6078455	6078715	All right.
6079255	6085658	And lastly, Jim, he was supposed to be here last week to answer this in person, but he decided to go on Google Plus and answer instead.
6086419	6102659	Flaco Jones I don't care much for multiplayer modes in games because I'm all about the story and it doesn't make much sense story wise when there are seven Nathan Drakes running around shooting other players at the same time plus I rent or buy used so I don't even get to play multiplayer thanks to online passes
6104220	6112605	Let's go to the Facebook community now that Facebook is working for me at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and read some of the answers that you guys sent us over there.
6113125	6121430	And we're going to start off with a reply from DDR Dollar Bill who says, Never, as in, has you ever been swayed?
6121950	6122210	Never.
6122310	6125072	Multiplayer never made or break a purchase for me.
6125192	6127073	It was nice, but it wasn't life or death either.
6127393	6131656	And it wouldn't change a game grade by one point if it was included nor excluded.
6132456	6139200	JVmon says I almost never play multiplayer online and if I do it's only with friends who usually don't buy the same games as me.
6139640	6143643	Even then cross game chat fixes that problem and we can hang out while playing.
6143903	6144763	So would it sway me?
6145143	6145684	Not at all.
6147054	6150176	So we have a lot of people that are like, no, no, no, never, never, never.
6152217	6153818	Let's go to an answer from RedTheHaze.
6154458	6164263	I've no problems with added multiplayer as long as it's good, builds on the single player game, and adds to the experience, but has no negative consequences to the single player.
6164744	6174029	Just like when I bought Mass Effect 3 when it was on sale for $30 just for multiplayer, even though I haven't played Mass Effect 2, but I plan to play 3 once I get to.
6174409	6175209	Panaxium responded and said...
6194378	6199068	However, Prime Hunters was a lot more fun, except for the cramping and trolls, but I digress.
6199509	6204479	In the end, I would rather have an amazing single experience than half-baked multiplayer.
6206506	6211247	Mike B responded saying, I think it's great as long as it has a co-op story mode.
6211707	6213808	It is fun playing through the story with friends.
6214308	6221790	I kind of like that whole co-op versus versus too because I think the type of multiplayer can really change a lot too.
6222430	6224010	I think that's really important to state too.
6224050	6225691	I think a game like LittleBigPlanet
6226451	6228412	Really is enhanced by the multiplayer.
6228432	6230293	And that's one game I didn't really see get brought up here.
6230333	6235996	But a game like LittleBigPlanet really gets enhanced because it's more of a co-op.
6236536	6238697	And of course, I'm into Mass Effect 3 right now.
6239377	6240658	And a lot of that is because it's co-op.
6242919	6251166	It isn't necessary, especially for established single-player franchises, but sometimes it can be a welcome addition that doesn't take away from its campaign.
6251487	6255590	Portal 2, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 are just a few examples.
6255630	6256951	Those are all really good examples.
6258312	6263397	Let me read one more from John K. Oh, excuse me, I didn't read the name.
6263417	6264418	It's Critical Myth, my bad.
6289861	6294502	So again, those are all answers from our Facebook account, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
6294542	6298343	Come thumbs up us over there and you can answer a question in a future week.
6298663	6299924	How about you guys here in studio?
6300304	6302184	How important is multiplayer to you?
6302784	6303285	Not at all.
6303985	6305265	I don't really give a crap about it.
6305285	6306946	You really go out of your way to avoid it.
6307226	6308146	But yet you play an MMO.
6309338	6311579	Yeah, but you notice, what do I do most of the time?
6311779	6312380	I quest.
6312920	6314781	I play by myself and just chat with people.
6315482	6317603	It's the having to play with other people.
6318183	6319724	Like, I like raiding, okay?
6319784	6321345	Because I'm with my guildmates.
6321825	6323906	I'm with people that I pretty much know.
6325482	6340383	PVP I hate I mean I don't really mind doing like the most fun that I have in dungeons is when basically I've just tagged along with you know with the ones that you've done for like what was that one that was really fun that you drug me around in your motorcycle for
6342556	6343577	The Isle of Conquest?
6343677	6344598	Yeah, Isle of Conquest.
6345198	6347300	That was fun because I was playing with you and Alan.
6347720	6348201	That was fun.
6348861	6352604	But I just have this thing about the random stranger thing.
6353805	6357768	All appearances to the contrary, I am a bit of an introvert.
6359269	6366735	I've taught myself how to be outwardly extroverted, but really I kind of like to do my own thing and stick with the folks I know.
6366755	6367476	So...
6371998	6391626	I lost my train of thought that's alright I'll go ahead and just say I really agree with the answer that said it's best when it more enhances a single player game that's already there especially the examples of Portal 2 and Mass Effect 3 I think are two great examples of where multiplayer really just sweetened the pot for a game that would have already been worth the asking price
6392571	6394573	Portal 2 Multiplayer Portal 2 Strangers
6420752	6421452	You're so mature.
6421892	6425513	All right, before I get to Loki's answer, let me get to our chat room.
6425793	6427273	Some folks talking about Skyrim.
6427533	6431554	Because, you know, obviously Skyrim gets brought up as a game that didn't need multiplayer to be successful.
6431894	6436175	Jim Sally says, Skyrim is awesome, but it would be twice as good if a co-op mode was added.
6436195	6437615	And a lot of people have been asking for something like that.
6437916	6441356	But ShadowNextGen says, I don't know if Skyrim would be good with co-op.
6441516	6444317	That game is really all about your personal choices.
6445137	6448360	I don't necessarily need multiplayer for Final Fantasy or something like that.
6468813	6490378	Blender brings up a great point in our chat room what about Journey Orange Lounge Radio and he's not talking about the one from the 80s about the band he's talking about that new one on PlayStation Network and I gotta say no one's bought it for me yet well I have it and I've played through it and I gotta say Journey is like on a whole nother level with the multiplayer it's like a new type of multiplayer experience you can't even really define you don't have to talk to them do you
6490698	6491579	No, you never do.
6508427	6531249	which it's it's so crazy like the simplicity of the game and kind of what it's done for multiplayer games Journey again if you haven't played it on PlayStation 3 and you own a PlayStation 3 you really gotta check it out it just it's amazing it was better when people didn't tell you there was a multiplayer component and I did not even know there was going to be multiplayer in it and I was just blown away amazing
6532390	6534571	Anyhow, that's going to do it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
6534591	6535992	Thank you to everybody who responded.
6536012	6537432	We had a ton of answers on Facebook.
6537452	6539253	I'm so sorry I didn't have time to read all of them.
6539913	6542454	But answer us in a future week, and we'll try to get some in.
6542755	6547537	You can always get your thoughts through to our mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6548397	6549839	and we'll read those in a future week.
6550059	6551180	For now... We don't have any.
6551360	6556125	Yeah, sadly we didn't get any mail this week so we don't have anything to read but maybe in a future week.
6556666	6558528	For now though, let's get to some news.
6558728	6558968	Loki.
6559809	6560109	Alright.
6560630	6562392	So let's talk a little bit about...
6563573	6564475	Thank you for watching!
6580057	6597662	It's for a project called Destiny and also they're talking about some of the expected bonuses and stuff based on performance and also saying that they're going to have a version of the game that's going to come out on the Xbox 360.
6600942	6609064	Also, in the fall of 2013, there's going to be follow-ups in multiple years, and it's supposed to be a four-game deal.
6609384	6614426	Also, at the end of that, they're going to have the option to fund a new marathon game.
6617006	6617906	So that's kind of neat.
6618147	6619587	I mean, that's definitely a lot of...
6621327	6629689	corporate mumbo jumbo at least in the leaked document but it'll be cool to see what this new Destiny game is supposed to be like.
6630409	6631770	It'll probably be like Halo.
6632490	6633470	I'm thinking it will be.
6634230	6640732	I was hoping it would be Pimps at Sea but you know unfortunately we can dream but that's not going to happen.
6641932	6643253	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
6662000	6667542	have no part of this whole authenticator and ways to protect their account.
6667822	6686168	So Blizzard's coming in and saying, well, people need to be more careful with their account information, but apparently it has come through in recent days that there are a small number of accounts that are being hacked with authenticators on them, but it's coming through malware on the user system.
6686668	6697551	and the blue posts that are on the forums are very adamant that, yeah, we're looking at the MSInfo files of people that are saying they're getting hacked with an authenticator and they've got all sorts of malware on the system and that's where it's coming from.
6697651	6706993	So this whole single player always connected experience is really starting to rub people the wrong way and this is just the latest feather in that hat.
6707053	6707653	Like, really?
6708233	6714135	I did not want to fucking deal with this and now people are getting hacked and all this shit because they don't have an authenticator on their account?
6714895	6720740	I mean, Diablo 3 had amazing sales in their first week, but what is the long-term damage this shit is causing?
6721600	6735931	We talked a little more about this on Horde House this week at www.hordehouse.com, my World of Warcraft themed spinoff show, but to kind of ask here a little bit, Loki, I think you're a good one to ask because you're not as sucked into this Warcraft phenomenon as DarkSakura and I are.
6736572	6743096	What are your thoughts about Diablo 3 being always connected and have they screwed PC games
6744277	6749041	that might want to explore this in the future with this consistent botched thing after another.
6749281	6753544	Well, I never like any always connected games there, especially if it's not required.
6753584	6759348	If it's not an MMO, then what's the point of me having to be always required a connection for this to happen?
6759888	6764872	Because, say, if I want a game on my laptop, it doesn't mean I'm going to have Wi-Fi everywhere I go.
6765752	6765893	And...
6767133	6773077	You know, that kind of sucks if I can't play my game that I purchased because I don't have an internet connection at the time.
6776099	6776780	I mean, I don't know.
6776800	6780742	Yeah, it's another reason why I wouldn't get the game, I guess.
6781063	6784905	Other than, you know, just don't really want to buy the game.
6785646	6787767	Burn, our chatroom, asks, so it's malware?
6787847	6790849	The rumor was it was joining public games that opened you up to it.
6791229	6794611	You know, Blizzard is passionately denying those claims.
6794631	6794732	Yeah.
6795913	6800378	As we've learned, though, throughout other parts of the game industry, that doesn't necessarily always mean anything, though.
6800919	6810632	I would like to think that they've tested that and it's true, but... And just because you have malware, I mean, because there's a lot of malware out there, but, I mean...
6811993	6814956	Just saying, oh, well, we can see that you have malware on your system.
6815437	6817258	Is it the same malware for each thing?
6817438	6820782	I mean, what exactly does this malware do?
6822003	6828969	Because there's malware that just, I go search something on Google and all of a sudden I get transferred to another page that has nothing to do with what I just searched for.
6829049	6830150	It's like another search engine.
6830230	6835315	Or is it something that's like, I'm specifically putting this malware on your system to steal your information?
6836596	6857417	Also, why can't Blizzard, just to give extra protection to the accounts, very similar to what Star Wars, the Old Republic did, you have these personal questions that only you would know the answer to, and whenever Star Wars suspects that you're making a major change or you're doing something weird where it might not really be you, it asks you to answer three of those questions at random.
6857437	6857537	Right.
6857977	6859638	You know, why couldn't they?
6860299	6864641	Gee, you usually play Diablo 3 in Sacramento, California.
6865142	6867403	All of a sudden, you're trying to log in from China.
6867983	6877810	Maybe I should ask you a private question that only you would know the answer to because the odds that you were playing in California and now you're suddenly playing in China are very, very low.
6878930	6894501	Or here's a thought, since we've gotten these little readouts of what processes you have running and stuff, and we've noticed that there's specific malware programs or whatever running.
6894861	6895942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6923700	6925983	Oh, it's because probably none of that has any information.
6926003	6934595	It's like saying, oh, well, you know, you've got some sort of virus on your computer, so that must be how they're hacking your system.
6934867	6938969	And seriously, most malware that you'll find are usually like site trackers.
6939529	6940109	That type of thing.
6940169	6941410	Nothing that's really going to have anything.
6941770	6942731	It's for advertising.
6942871	6943411	That's all it is.
6945032	6946092	So, all right.
6948313	6950194	Let's hope Blizzard can patch this shit up.
6950634	6952995	I seriously think they're doing some long-term damage here.
6953155	6954796	I did find a new patch applied last night.
6955096	6955356	Oh, yeah?
6955696	6959118	Yeah, I didn't see what it was for, but they did patch my game last night.
6960121	6960681	We ain't found shit!
6988220	6992306	I guess some people in chat are saying they emailed within the past hour or so.
6992406	6993408	Well, check it again.
6993428	6994289	You want to check it again?
6994730	6996893	We'll do the FUs of the week first.
6997373	6998515	This is usually the time we do that.
6998615	6999897	Oh, Loki wants to jump in.
6999917	7001920	No, I was just going to jump in with some random stuff.
7001940	7003382	So I figured I'd... Already logged in.
7004143	7004644	We have one.
7006139	7035443	I was doing Google searches for information regarding this Xbox jacking stuff there's actually a whole bunch of information about doxing which is finding out the information on people like their name, city, state all the personal information based on some of this other stuff and that's how they steal accounts it's by knowing all your personal information tons of ebooks on it too be careful who you add on your social networks that's for sure so we have one
7036232	7037862	Alright, yay, we do have an email after all.
7037902	7038345	From Munma.
7038989	7039310	Of course.
7040532	7041532	Question for the staff.
7041612	7046774	What has to be the single most expensive gaming accessory you have purchased for your gaming console?
7047374	7054337	And to read the disclaimer, this email was brought to you by Anime Jam Session, the podcast about anime, cosplay, convention, roasting, pop culture, and everything in between.
7054377	7055858	Podcast guaranteed to derail in 10 minutes.
7055898	7056378	Your money back.
7056398	7058879	Check us out at www.animejamsession.com.
7058959	7062780	That was the cheapest fucking plug I have ever seen in the history of this show.
7063160	7066781	I'm going to ask a really generic question and then plug the shit out of my show.
7066941	7068022	Micro Machines.
7068843	7070084	That's alright, you know what?
7070585	7081120	Because we love Anime Jam Session John Machida was great We're gonna allow it I did buy my husband Steel Battalion Oh yeah?
7081673	7082914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7101625	7127312	So, um, but keep in mind, if you look at my BitMoney collection, I've got a poppin' music controller, I have four 2DX controllers now, I have two Guitar Freaks controllers, I have a keyboard for Keyboard Mania, I have a drum controller for Drum Mania, and then we have all this crap we have for Guitar Hero, so it's really hard to say when you look at the whole thing, but I think the single most expensive has to be the Steel Battalion controller, because that was 300 bucks.
7130491	7141414	I would say the most expensive... I know this probably doesn't count for the original question, but I fucking bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 just so I could play all those Bomani games back in the day, so I think I get that one.
7141534	7146575	Especially, you know, I bought the controller, I bought the DDR mats, all to work with the Japanese setup.
7146595	7147536	We bought a JPS2.
7147796	7150497	Yeah, keyboard... I bought fucking keyboard mania, okay?
7151177	7153297	So, I think that qualifies.
7153317	7154838	I can tell you what our most expensive game was.
7155078	7155278	What?
7155618	7158159	Was probably Dracula X. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
7159159	7159359	Loki?
7159379	7159479	Yeah.
7160639	7164083	I bought an arcade cabinet to put DDR in.
7164964	7167006	Never really gone around to putting DDR in it, though.
7167146	7170690	But looking at accessories on their own, what is the most...
7171829	7173110	Just all my Rockman stuff.
7174030	7183676	Because I have, you know, $100 guitar here and drum set and another bass guitar that I got specially that's collecting dust under my desk at work.
7186238	7188059	Now what was your most expensive system?
7188439	7190841	What is the most you've ever paid for a single video game system?
7190941	7192161	My first Xbox 360.
7193142	7196264	Oh, you dumb bastard.
7197945	7199346	You did pay a lot for that.
7201545	7202265	Was it your PS2?
7202965	7204066	Most I paid for a system?
7204546	7205506	Yeah.
7206047	7207187	Might be my PlayStation 3.
7208128	7210989	I think a PS3 was more expensive than importing the PlayStation 2.
7211889	7216071	I will second that because keep in mind when we bought ours, we still have our first model PS3.
7217052	7221834	And thanks to Discover, we got $100 knocked off of it because we got a reward on it.
7222574	7225296	So we paid $600 for our first model PS3.
7226391	7234396	Now, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at vognetwork.com said, I own a very expensive set of Roland V-Drums, and I just put it on TwitPick.
7235877	7237758	Because it does work with... That does.
7238199	7240620	But that's not really necessarily an accessory.
7241000	7244543	Okay, so then moving forward to... Because I really like elaborating on this one.
7244703	7246484	What's the most you've ever paid for a game?
7247464	7249265	The most I've ever paid for a game?
7249846	7251447	Again, Japanese importing...
7252622	7256986	and probably Beatmania 2DX6 style.
7257026	7260509	I want to say it was probably the most expensive one I got because I got that when it was brand, brand new.
7261069	7263051	I have actually paid more than $100 for a game.
7263611	7265413	I don't think I've ever paid more than that.
7265513	7269657	I paid $120 for the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game on Super Famicom.
7270317	7271218	Actually, I take that back.
7272019	7273740	Add up all the months of World of Warcraft.
7274421	7276202	But I'm saying for the game itself.
7277023	7279245	Hey, Alan's joining us and I think wants to say something.
7279824	7304714	Hi Alan So we're talking about most spent on a game Yes sir When I was, there was a year or two where I was importing Japanese games And I only got four or five of them But I want to say Tobel number two The sequel to the Square Fighting game I think I spent close to like 90, 95 bucks all told to get that game It also had the demo on it though for Final Fantasy 7, wasn't it?
7305615	7308856	Yeah I think so Yeah Alan, remember when we had disposable income?
7310194	7311015	What about you, Loki?
7311115	7311295	P.S.
7311316	7312617	My iPad says hi.
7312677	7312917	What?
7313338	7315060	What's the most you've ever paid for a game?
7315661	7317223	Standalone didn't come with anything else.
7319637	7345073	Motorstorm Apocalypse because it was a beta or it was a barely yeah you bought that on eBay or something didn't you yeah yeah so I would what about people who bought that Capcom mech game that was like 200 bucks because they have the whole controller oh Steel Battalion I've got no check this now I have two copies and two controllers you're sick but I mean that would love
7346323	7347604	Okay, so no, no, no, no, no.
7348404	7350425	What is the rarest system that you own?
7351686	7353087	I love SSJ100, Matt.
7353327	7356268	The most I've ever spent on a game was Yaris for zero points.
7356568	7358189	Paid way too much for it.
7358830	7359190	I agree.
7359550	7361251	I'm sorry, the most we ever spent on a what?
7361451	7361851	A system?
7362571	7364672	What do you think is your most valuable system that you own?
7366794	7369595	In terms of personal value and then in terms of financial value.
7370618	7373779	My still working Super Nintendo in terms of personal value.
7374840	7378101	In terms of actual... I don't really have a lot of rare systems.
7378141	7380442	I don't really have any old shit that still works.
7383803	7385924	The HD DVD player on my Xbox 360.
7386844	7393547	My arcade system for most valuable and for personal value.
7393747	7395108	The Xbox of fame.
7395888	7397309	I think our most valuable one is our Neo Geo.
7413345	7413585	DarkSakura,
7430276	7434659	All right, let's talk about how much money we've spent on this sick obsession here.
7435940	7441885	Burr in the chat room is trying to call me out saying, Sky had disposable income that could have gone to improving the show.
7442025	7443666	Talking about that stinking power device.
7443686	7445968	He did put a lot of money into the show.
7445988	7447549	Hey, this iPad.
7448710	7452993	I just did the Facebook questions for the Fugle Question of the Week off the iPad.
7453093	7456316	So it did go to improving the show, just so you know.
7457653	7474765	by the way I'd like to answer a niche or is it niche or niche whatever I think it's Nietzsche Nietzsche that's not how the philosopher's name is spelled oh well whatever there should be a T and a Z in there we did not buy a 3DO because there is all of crap for 3DO we did almost buy a CDI
7476385	7487810	if you want me to go through the list of what we own we'll need a whole other show for that alright that's it for the mailbag now we will do the FUs of the week angst, anger um
7506980	7508642	I'm angry at being sick.
7509603	7511024	I mean, I feel tons better now.
7511445	7512226	This is what's funny.
7512406	7513727	I slept all day yesterday.
7514068	7516030	I mean, literally almost all day yesterday.
7516530	7519954	And I slept most of this morning, had weird ass freaking fever dreams.
7520595	7526140	And then I go out on my bicycle feeling like crap because I needed to go get NyQuil from the Kmart around the corner from my house.
7526841	7527902	So, I mean, it's about a mile.
7528142	7531804	You know, I rode my bike a mile there, got all my stuff, rode it back with a backpack full of stuff.
7532665	7536508	And I was so hot and feverish and shaky when I got home.
7537108	7541211	I think my fever broke from my bike ride because now, like, my lungs feel better.
7541891	7547155	I still have, you know, the stupid sinus headache, but I feel, like, infinitely better than I have in weeks.
7547895	7551057	So, F you to having to go through all of that just to feel better.
7551758	7555460	And F you to bread.
7556881	7558702	I'm having to go back on raw food again.
7561103	7565605	And hey, don't knock Kmart because I got a Sonic the Hedgehog shirt there.
7566566	7567126	And it's cheap.
7569247	7569527	Loki.
7570708	7576651	F you to my cult and F you to power not being available during our show sometimes.
7579952	7582154	F you to the music stopping.
7583801	7592087	Um, F you to Burr in our chatroom for saying the Fugo questions just had to be read from a retina display to protect Skye's precious eyes.
7592467	7593668	That's right, F you.
7593688	7599452	Uh, and then my other F you of the week goes to this cough that will not leave.
7601233	7603035	Because I've had this cough for like two weeks.
7603055	7604696	You remember when I was sick on the show a couple weeks ago?
7604876	7605737	I still have the cough.
7605937	7606397	If I may.
7606577	7607278	I'm just hiding it well.
7607318	7607658	Yes, ma'am.
7607678	7608779	DarkSakura's medical advice.
7610868	7615870	Which I'm not a doctor, disclaimer, disclaimer Are you taking any Guafenicin?
7617230	7618951	Excuse you, what is that?
7619091	7622552	Mucinex This is the former, what's that store?
7622632	7639777	GC, whatever that you used to work at I used to work at GMC Yeah, that's a GMC Well, you can go to the dollar store, Rob And get plain old Guafenicin And take two doses of it And it is the pharmacy dose And I guarantee you, it will clear up your cough
7640990	7642112	Yeah, what else will it do to me?
7642893	7645656	It's the same stuff the doctor gives you a prescription.
7646898	7647699	No!
7649902	7652425	Seriously, I like my big gay life, dammit.
7652565	7654387	All it does is a mucus thinner.
7654487	7657371	It helps you produce it so that you don't have it causing the cough anymore.
7658380	7658700	Okay.
7658740	7660082	That's how mine has gotten better.
7661062	7661383	All right.
7661403	7662303	That and lots of NyQuil.
7662924	7664245	A couple more stories for you guys.
7664265	7669709	And then you guys on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7669790	7670050	Loki.
7670790	7671191	All right.
7671291	7674033	So let's talk once again about more Activision drama.
7674073	7682160	This kind of ties in with the whole lawsuit between, you know, Wes and Zempela versus Activision.
7682860	7686983	and just some of the dirty stuff that went on.
7687163	7693086	Obviously the first part of the lawsuit's been settled, but there's still the whole lawsuit against those people.
7694667	7697629	There was this thing that came out called Project Icebreaker.
7697949	7704453	Apparently it was an initiative designed by Activision to secretly scour the computers of those two individuals
7705013	7707155	for evidence that would support a firing.
7707556	7714362	This involved them attempting to hack into their accounts or their systems.
7714642	7720948	Also, the possibility of faking a fire drill to get them to leave the building so that someone could go and hack into their computers.
7721669	7723651	Just dirty shit.
7723731	7729816	I mean, seriously, I can't believe that they would even... Well, no, I can believe that they could do that because it's Activision.
7730437	7730517	Um...
7732592	7750409	also um you know of course some of the stuff you know during that's been released is spreadsheets um talking about the top 20 um Infinity Ward employees and their salaries and of course Wes and Zempella have made quite a bit of money um apparently they've each uh
7752376	7753317	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7774508	7781291	I was reading some of that crazy shit on the internet, those Activision emails and so forth, and it's a scary inside look to how some of this shit operates.
7782532	7785713	It's, man, it's almost evil.
7786313	7787094	It is evil.
7787814	7789895	It's not almost evil, we know how evil they are.
7793699	7804591	When you're asking a lawyer to do something illegal, they're like, I don't know if I'm comfortable doing that.
7805051	7806873	It's just ridiculous.
7807313	7810096	Well, let's move from something evil to just kind of shady.
7810297	7811418	Yeah.
7812298	7822327	It has to do with THQ, and I guess they're going to be having a June 29 stockholders meeting where they're going to do what's called a reverse stock split to avoid a delisting from NASDAQ.
7822407	7825989	I guess that's really not shady, it's just business, but I guess it's sad.
7826009	7827391	It's a tricky way of doing things.
7827451	7827791	It is.
7827871	7828592	It totally is.
7828612	7830053	It's a little bit like the shell game.
7830733	7832695	They are going to have some pissed off investors.
7833010	7841233	So anyhow, apparently what's going to happen is that they have to do the stock split to maintain $1 per share minimum that NASDAQ requires.
7841874	7848496	Apparently there are going to be three options in the process, one of three, one of five, and one of ten, reverse stock split ratios.
7849277	7854979	Any of these options, it means there are fewer outstanding shares with an increased apparent value per share.
7855379	7867305	So for example, if they do a one to three reverse stock split, each stockholder will own one stock for every three that they had prior to the split, even though the total value of the company doesn't change.
7867765	7871607	So that 61 cents that they're currently trading at, they do a one of 10.
7872347	7877589	Now it's, oh, it's $6.10 a share, but hopefully you only have one share instead of 10.
7877929	7878450	Exactly.
7879510	7880371	But they can do that.
7881751	7885272	What happens if you have two shares?
7885292	7886092	That's what I was going to say.
7886112	7888493	There's a lot of people that get novelty stock.
7888513	7889453	They just buy one share.
7889473	7892034	But then again, how many people just buy one share of THQ?
7892554	7892894	Probably not.
7892914	7899396	You've got more people that do that shit with Facebook or Disney or Coca-Cola or Pepsi, big companies.
7899997	7900177	There's...
7901317	7906758	There's actually a company out there, some website, and I hate that I'm giving them free advertising, but whatever.
7906798	7914720	It's like buyoneshare.com or oneshare.com, and they actually do this whole little shtick where they'll print out a certificate, and you can frame it.
7915360	7916600	It's like a gift-giving thing.
7917040	7919181	It's kind of a neat idea for a gift.
7919281	7927522	I think they did a report on some website the other day, and it was like, if you had bought one share of Apple in 1982, it would be worth $1,000 now.
7930700	7938903	My mom, who actually worked for Intel for a while, part of their thing was that each employee got a certain amount of stock.
7939803	7946966	Well, this was way back in the 70s and 80s and stuff, and she still has it.
7946986	7949126	She found the certificate in the attic the other day.
7949146	7949466	Oh, wow.
7949947	7959990	And it's funny, as we looked into it, and that split so many times since that one share of stock, I only think it was one share, it was like a few shares of stock, it was like,
7960750	7961291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7990010	8007664	I do not have the Twitter topics up yet so maybe Loki I know there might be some last minute stories tonight because there was a lot of stuff we had to cut from tonight's show and it's just it's picking up as we move towards E3 I'm sure we've got some stuff here of course I'm not ready as usual
8009465	8013047	I'm still looking at that hacking stuff.
8013087	8014407	It's very interesting.
8014427	8017348	I can't believe all the information that they have out there.
8018308	8032934	Basically telling you to use those white pages or reverse searches and stuff like that to find out people's personal information that your phone company and stuff collects so you can hack someone's Xbox Live account.
8033034	8033594	It's ridiculous.
8034394	8034915	Let's see here.
8034955	8037637	We can talk about Silicon Knights.
8037657	8038317	This is kind of funny.
8038337	8044701	Silicon Knights had this lawsuit against Epic because they're saying, Your engine was too hard to use.
8044761	8046382	That's why our games suck balls.
8047763	8057210	And apparently they failed to provide evidence of damages or whatever for their lawsuit.
8057290	8061112	And so the judge assigned them their own value of a dollar.
8061532	8063274	So if they win their claim, they get a dollar.
8064074	8064835	A whole dollar?
8064855	8065455	A whole dollar.
8065475	8066936	You could buy a candy bar with that.
8067076	8067376	Maybe.
8067456	8068597	Alright, we got a call coming in.
8068617	8069277	Let's go to the phones.
8069637	8070518	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8070538	8070918	Who's this?
8071498	8074580	It's the one person that actually sent an email into the mailbag, Ranma.
8074660	8078702	You know what's funny is that the chatters were like, no, Ranma doesn't get through tonight.
8078782	8080623	Ranma does not get to call in because he sent an email.
8080923	8089788	But when nobody else calls, you guys... I can't help it that I have the fastest internet in America to beat everybody else 99% of the time.
8089828	8090788	You're just that awesome.
8090808	8091709	What's on your mind tonight, Ranma?
8092928	8098132	Um, what's on my mind is a bit of a hardware review, which is in conjunction with the email that I sent earlier.
8099312	8109359	When I was at PAX East playing at the Square Enix booth, they had these nice headphones that I was playing a theater rhythm with, and I was like, the music quality is just phenomenal, where did you get it?
8109739	8117705	They told me they had it at the Astro Gaming booth, and I checked out their equipment, and after thinking about it for all of five seconds, I decided to buy them.
8118065	8122508	But not right away, I decided to save my money and get them for my birthday, and which I did.
8125049	8136753	So now I own a pair of Astro A30 gaming headsets with a powered mix amp, which is perfect for Xbox 360, PC, television, and cell phone.
8138533	8144015	And I have to say, audio quality is quite phenomenal compared to what I was used to listening to.
8147188	8152173	Sorry, I'm yelling with the chatters because apparently we had a drop, but I'm showing that we didn't.
8152293	8159381	Usually if we drop, we show that our sent information drops way down, but I don't see that, so whatever.
8159972	8161813	No, they're just saying it because I'm on the phone.
8161833	8164353	They're just like, drop the stream so I get off the phone.
8164953	8165854	Haters gonna hate.
8166134	8170975	The timer reset to 1 minute 30 seconds so maybe there was a hiccup, but that's weird because usually that number resets.
8171115	8173596	Anyway, podcast listeners don't care about this.
8173956	8176256	So, the hardware.
8176296	8178017	So how expensive is this thing supposed to be?
8178877	8180598	Okay, the headset itself is $129.
8180638	8183338	The mix amp is $99, but you can get it as a bundle for $199.
8183398	8184159	Is it worth it?
8191812	8194514	If you're an audiophile, I say yes.
8195254	8208301	But if you're looking to change your normal headphones for your cell phone or MP3 player, if you're looking for a bit of a change for mobile gaming, I would definitely go with the headset standalone.
8209002	8212284	The Mixamp, like I said, gives better audio quality.
8214291	8222096	One of the songs I actually tested to see how well the clarity of the music is was Loki's Verbalicious remix, which is one of my personal favorites.
8222156	8223276	Now, here's the thing, though.
8223737	8226598	Are those surround sound headphones or are they just standard headphones?
8227179	8228720	The headphones itself are standard.
8228900	8230441	You get the surround sound 7.1 with the mix amp.
8234108	8235109	I have those kind of headsets.
8235149	8236750	I like the headset with the surround sound built in.
8236790	8237271	It's kind of fun.
8237531	8241694	Yeah, I've got a pair at home, but I paid a lot less than $200 for them.
8241714	8242254	Yeah, me too.
8243035	8245817	Because they weren't Turtle Beach.
8245837	8247018	I don't remember what the hell I got.
8247058	8248599	They're Tritons, the ones I have.
8250020	8253923	I actually tried on a pair of Tritons, and they were phenomenal while I was playing them with Bioshock 2.
8253983	8254183	Hmm.
8257492	8263295	Alright, well, Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but anything else you want to plug here on the show real quick before we let you go?
8263936	8269839	No, Luke Chan already plugged it for me, so I'm going to run high back under my rock for the next seven days.
8270479	8271880	We'll see you in seven days.
8272420	8272740	Got it.
8272821	8273361	Alright, bye.
8273841	8275422	Bye.
8275502	8276082	Thank you, Ranma.
8276122	8278804	Sorry I was a little distracted during that call, but those things happen.
8278824	8282366	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8282486	8282926	Oh, there it goes.
8282946	8283306	Look at that.
8283386	8284327	Phone's ringing right off the hook.
8284647	8285528	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8285548	8285868	Who's this?
8286721	8287546	Hi, this is Actdeft.
8287667	8288914	Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?
8290607	8295389	I just want to talk about the email Ranma sent you.
8295949	8296309	Okay.
8297049	8298310	A little tangent about it.
8300051	8305693	I don't have any accessories or a very expensive video game.
8305773	8312635	I think the most expensive one I have paid for is Bitmania 12, Happy Sky.
8313776	8317437	But I have spent tons and tons of money on
8319093	8320975	on Pokemon plushies, Pokeballs.
8323979	8324660	And why is that?
8325421	8335673	And, you know, I was thinking that this call was going to go in the direction of because you live in Mexico and not every company releases their products officially in Mexico, sometimes you have to pay these crazy-ass import fees.
8336574	8338236	Is it kind of along the same lines for Pokemon?
8340602	8355576	Well, most of the time, since a friend helped me get most of the stuff I get from the United States, so I import, so I pretty much pay what you would pay for something like that.
8357237	8362202	But it's still a pretty expensive little hobby, if you want to call it like that.
8363961	8364964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8370559	8373760	I live pretty much 10 minutes to the border.
8373860	8374280	Oh, shit.
8374681	8375561	I live pretty close.
8375821	8376341	Oh, okay, shit.
8376361	8376841	That's nothing.
8377221	8383844	So how often do you just drive up into the States to pick up what you want?
8385204	8390966	Well, unfortunately, I can't right now because I don't have a passport or a visa.
8391426	8391987	Oh, dope.
8392027	8395088	So I cannot cross the border, but I used to, and...
8396168	8398989	Well, it depends on how much traffic is there.
8399750	8406753	It usually, it can take up to an hour to cross the border and pretty much go to the next town.
8407333	8411335	There's a GameStop, there's a mall too, and there's a Best Buy.
8411955	8418918	And there's pretty much, well, very renowned stores to go and buy stuff.
8419618	8420679	So it's not that difficult.
8420879	8426542	And please tell me you live in one of those parts of Mexico I'm not seeing on the news, like you live in one of the safer parts, I hope?
8428643	8430544	More or less.
8431284	8432444	Take care of yourself, buddy.
8432525	8434646	I don't like some of the stuff I see on the news.
8434686	8435726	It makes me very sad.
8436606	8445010	It is safe around where I live, but we live pretty close to some of the other parts that you do see on TV, so...
8446691	8452592	Yeah, it's not that bad right now, but it's not that good either.
8452812	8465255	Well, I'm sending happier thoughts your guys' way, because I always, you know, when I see that stuff on the news, believe it or not, I do think about, I know people in Mexico, and I hope this is not something they're having to deal with, you know?
8465375	8469716	But Mexico's a big place, so I know there's a lot of parts you see on TV and parts that are just fine.
8470236	8470436	Yeah.
8472016	8476697	Anyhow, didn't mean to steer the conversation in a totally different direction, but that'll happen sometimes on OLR.
8477217	8479638	Any recent games you've been playing you want to talk about?
8481338	8483419	Not many, pretty much.
8483879	8487280	I did play The Walking Dead on Steam.
8488660	8493721	I got it for free on the Tall Tale Twitter account.
8493741	8495022	Oh, okay, very cool.
8495542	8495722	Yeah.
8496564	8498886	Pretty thoughtful of them to give me one.
8498906	8500167	Yeah, that's awesome.
8500207	8501469	But it's a pretty cool game.
8502510	8510097	Not that much action, but story and the decisions you take, it's pretty much, well, compelling.
8510117	8511358	It sucks you in.
8512788	8513689	I hear it's a great game.
8513729	8515130	I've really got to check it out at some point.
8515150	8518272	I know nothing about the books or the TV show, but that doesn't matter.
8518292	8519893	It can still be a great game.
8520273	8525877	I still need to play the Jurassic Park game, which even though I know that game got kind of razzed, I like the movies well enough.
8525897	8526578	I want to try it.
8526998	8528319	Now I have Weird Al in my head.
8528779	8531802	Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.
8532722	8533643	Aw, Donna Summer.
8533723	8536105	All the dinosaurs are running wild.
8536165	8539787	I remember another song, but I don't sing that well.
8540028	8540248	All right.
8541489	8544010	All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can try and get another call.
8544030	8544791	But take care, okay?
8545291	8545612	You too.
8545692	8546192	And I mean that.
8546252	8546612	Take care.
8546852	8549354	Bye.
8549374	8550235	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8550315	8551776	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8551796	8552477	Donna Summer.
8553317	8553537	I know.
8553577	8554218	I was trying to say.
8554298	8555579	I was at work.
8555739	8557760	I was legitimately verklempt by that news.
8558241	8559061	I was so sad.
8559161	8562384	I mean, granted, I know there was... Go ahead.
8562424	8563865	There was a death I was more saddened by.
8564724	8565164	Robin Gibb?
8565525	8565685	No.
8566145	8566426	No!
8567246	8567687	Bee Gees!
8568127	8568347	No.
8569689	8572891	By Adam Yalch, MCA.
8573072	8575073	Yeah, that was... Because... He was young, too.
8575494	8577836	Well, it's not just, you know, that he was famous.
8577936	8583241	It was all the good stuff he was doing and just how absolutely brilliant of a person he was.
8583681	8585002	That big Kurosawa fan.
8585163	8585283	So...
8585743	8587724	And is it just me or did she stay gorgeous?
8587744	8588104	Yes, she did.
8588124	8588464	She sure did.
8612560	8616966	So, you know, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8619089	8621753	Oh, we have a call coming in right now, so let's go to it.
8622213	8623155	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8623175	8623495	Who's this?
8624366	8651523	Chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo You sexy people, it's Jim Sally Hey, your train's behind schedule You're usually on the Bobby Blackwolf show But you're delayed three hours tonight I got delayed, I went on the wrong side of the tracks today Well, you know, we've been saying for a few weeks now That, you know, we made a left turn at Albuquerque And other folks we used to work with made a right So I was thinking maybe you just made the wrong turn at Albuquerque
8652850	8656713	Listen, you can't do anything right when you're doing it in Albuquerque.
8657773	8658774	That's very true.
8659154	8659955	That's very true.
8660455	8661176	So what's up, Jim?
8662036	8666480	Listen, we were talking earlier about putting multiplayer in things in different games.
8667660	8668881	It needs to be in Skyrim.
8668901	8670623	I'm playing this stupid game a lot lately.
8671363	8679549	I wish there was like every now and again I'd roll up to somebody like me that was uber powerful and could kill everything and had way too much money.
8681126	8683167	What do you think about the whole Elder Scrolls Online?
8683207	8685307	We were talking about that either last week or the week before.
8685688	8690589	I guess that's trying to appease some of these people who want their multiplayer Elder Scrolls.
8690789	8691669	Is that enough for you?
8692390	8695931	I think it would be great if it was just little missions like go out and hunt a criminal.
8696131	8700352	If I do a lot of bad stuff in the town, maybe that town can just pay another player to come chase me.
8701678	8727675	and good luck because you ain't gonna kill Jim Sally in this game I'm stupid powerful do you find when you're playing these games like I'm an accountant so I'm very good with numbers and maximizing productivity I find I just overpower everything in the game it's it's pretty insane right now I I wonder if um there'll be some type of how do you play Skyrim on the PC or do you play on console um I play it on the console because consoles are better yeah and and um
8728445	8730726	I'm better, so that's why I play it on the console.
8758945	8759626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8777256	8780897	Oblivion needs to do it, sorry, Bethesda needs to do it right.
8807143	8814326	I kind of think Skyrim is going to stay single player and they're going to really try to push you to pay that monthly fee if you want to take it multiplayer.
8815086	8818107	Listen, it's about time that they just let Obsidian do it for them.
8818127	8823089	If they make the best sequels to games, perfectly solid and stable, they should just let Obsidian make it.
8823449	8824370	They've done it with Fallout.
8824410	8825530	Let them do it with Oblivion.
8825970	8830432	Well, I hope they're listening to your suggestion, but sadly they probably aren't.
8831953	8832573	You got that right.
8833033	8834754	Alright, well Jim, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
8836005	8840890	Also, I play way too much of that Walking Dead game that the last caller just called about.
8841550	8842972	Hey, people are loving it.
8843312	8844093	Oh my god.
8844573	8845794	You know what, brother?
8845814	8846895	I'm going to tell you this right now.
8847336	8850238	The hardest part about the zombie apocalypse?
8851319	8853181	We'll be pretending I'm not excited.
8853922	8855123	Oh my god.
8855383	8856544	Kim Sally's getting ready.
8856864	8857465	I'm getting ready.
8858880	8864704	Well, I will pass the word along to my friend at Telltale because they're very proud of that game and they should be.
8865005	8873091	And you know, before we were talking about Minecraft's, you know, record-breaking figures, Walking Dead was doing very well for itself on Xbox Live Arcade.
8873151	8888122	So I think that's some really good news, you know, because there's a lot of people that think adventure games are like a niche thing, you know, and yeah, Telltale's filling that niche very well, but Walking Dead's really kind of broken it mainstream for them and I'm happy for them and for adventure game fans everywhere, really.
8889261	8889861	You got that right.
8890001	8893403	But anyway, brother, I got to take off.
8893783	8902046	I just want to say, everybody, that if you go to bed and you don't think about zombies coming, then maybe you're not scared enough or too scared.
8904387	8906088	Something to ponder in bed tonight.
8906188	8906788	Oh, Jim hung up.
8906828	8907228	There you go.
8909369	8910630	I like it when he calls us.
8912324	8917349	I like it when he calls Bobby too, but it's okay if he misses that train and calls us once in a while too.
8917910	8918771	Do a little alternating.
8919111	8920753	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8920793	8922715	Thank you guys who tried to call.
8922775	8925258	I'm sorry if you didn't get through, but please send us an email.
8925438	8930964	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com In the meantime, any other last minute stories?
8931004	8932185	I want to get to these Twitter topics.
8932225	8932866	I have a few of them.
8933942	8935062	My brain is broken, Rob.
8935662	8936583	It requires Pinkberry.
8937503	8938683	We might be able to manage that.
8938763	8941344	Let me quickly do some Twitter topics here from Actdeft.
8941964	8946505	A lot of indie games on sale until June 1st for the PC, Steam, and iOS, Android.
8946785	8948146	Support indie devs.
8948546	8950647	BecauseWeMay.com That's right.
8950667	8952047	We didn't even bring that up during the show.
8952147	8952727	Shame on us.
8952747	8954187	I think that's a great thing to support.
8954288	8955328	At least look into it, guys.
8955648	8961770	BecauseWeMay.com Actdeft also wants to share that you can get the Awesome Knots theme song for free.
8961810	8963190	If you haven't played Awesome Knots yet...
8963671	8965797	It has an awesome theme song and you should definitely check it out.
8967482	8970029	I'll do a few more tweets here, but let me ask Loki first.
8970089	8970932	Any last minute stories?
8971523	8977405	Yeah, I was going to talk about Shootmania, which was part of this Mania Planet series.
8977425	8979285	You may remember them from Trackmania.
8980045	8985427	Shootmania is their FPS editor, and it also is a game.
8987047	8992788	Shootmania Storm is the first thing they have right now that's in beta, and they actually have the registration open for that.
8993108	8993709	You can check it out.
8994329	8994489	But...
8995629	9002913	It looks pretty cool, and you can basically create your own FPS game with this, and they've got all the tools to make, I think it's an online FPS maker.
9004294	9012399	Also, it should be noted that they're supposed to have Quest Mania at some point, so that means a really cool RPG maker, so I'm kind of interested in that.
9012539	9014500	Sign up for the beta, so we'll see when that happens.
9014681	9015821	I was checking that out, by the way.
9016322	9018263	The Binding of Isaac is one of the games, and they're two bucks.
9018523	9020384	Oh, yeah, yeah, I was actually going to pick that up this weekend.
9020824	9021545	Thanks for reminding me.
9023866	9024826	A couple more tweets here.
9025266	9028408	Ionotropic tweets us on Twitter.com slash OLR.
9028728	9030309	Ragnarok Odyssey for Vita.
9030389	9031509	Is it going to be awesome or not?
9032070	9035991	Well, it's hard to say when the game's not in front of me, but did you even know that that was coming to the Vita?
9036492	9036752	No.
9037972	9039753	I don't even know anything about it.
9040013	9041774	I will check it out.
9044235	9044535	Why not?
9044875	9046656	I don't have a Vita, so I don't really care.
9047476	9048477	You can borrow mine.
9051660	9053000	Now that you've got your iPad.
9054521	9055021	Don't hate me.
9055502	9057142	Going to a couple tweets from Tiger Claw.
9057523	9058823	Death spank the bacon-ing.
9059324	9063646	Indie game The Movie will be Steam's first full-length film release.
9063786	9067448	I had no idea Steam was looking into doing this, but apparently Steam is going to start giving out movies.
9068328	9074213	That's right, the 1080p video will be DRM'd as much as any other Steam product or game for those of you that were worried about that.
9075474	9078296	So you will have to have the Steam client in order to watch it.
9078636	9080598	But you can pre-order the movie on Steam for $8.99.
9081819	9086002	That includes a 10% discount until June 12th when the movie's coming out.
9086062	9087824	So this is a new area for Steam.
9087844	9089365	Now they're going to take on iTunes.
9089926	9095032	Hey, by the way, you know what else is on that sale on Steam since you mentioned it?
9095112	9095452	What's that?
9095512	9096093	Psychonauts.
9096593	9097014	Five bucks.
9097054	9097294	Oh, really?
9098055	9098635	Five bucks.
9099276	9101899	Guess who's buying it and not buying Minecraft?
9103080	9103581	You know what, though?
9103621	9104162	It's pretty hard.
9104382	9105723	Psychonauts is a good choice.
9105903	9110929	Even the most hardcore of Minecraft fan would be hard to argue with you there.
9113199	9121745	I'm trying to load up this other story from Tigerclaw, but our internet's being a little wonky, but it's titled A Video Game Designed to Help Doctors to Recognize Drug Abuse.
9121765	9123927	What the hell would that game be?
9127074	9146025	It's using the same technology used to train FBI agents in interrogation tactics, a combination of self-disclosure and nonverbal cues.
9146365	9152789	The game uses an actor's voice to stimulate a hypothetical conversation with a patient seeking, for example, pain relievers.
9153209	9163176	The program generates responses based on the doctor's questions and the doctor must identify indicators of possible addiction or abuse based on the simulated patient appearing on screen before them.
9163457	9170502	So this is something where you're the doctor, you're trying to recognize a patient that's asking for a drug who might be addicted to them.
9170762	9171963	This sounds like L.A.
9172023	9172543	Noire.
9173584	9177990	You're looking for those hidden cues to let you know if there's a problem or not.
9178030	9185239	That's kind of weird in a way, but neat, I guess, that video games are being used out there in the real world.
9186000	9187002	That's going to do it for Twitter.
9187142	9188684	Any other last-minute stories tonight, Loki?
9189044	9189485	No, that's it.
9189980	9192863	Alright, then that brings us to the end of the show.
9193664	9199451	We're ending a little bit early tonight, but that's because we unfortunately didn't have that interview happen, but hey, you know what?
9199491	9200031	Things happen.
9200432	9203495	I really hope you guys out there enjoy the rest of your Memorial Day weekend.
9205257	9207920	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap it up for tonight.
9207960	9208901	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
9208941	9209482	Your final thought.
9209642	9211444	Freaking steam and stuff on sale.
9212611	9213331	taking all your money.
9214092	9217514	My final thought tonight is be sure to check out Girls Gone Wow.
9217574	9218114	We love them.
9218154	9220435	They're a great show and I was their guest this week.
9220776	9223137	So I need to make sure that I plug that appearance at some point.
9223177	9225558	GirlsGoneWow.net Loki.
9225979	9226859	Time for more Minecraft.
9227319	9228440	Time for more Minecraft.
9229425	9237149	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening live, however you are tuning in, and for supporting independent radio and independent broadcasting.
9237429	9242132	You know what we say, if you like what you hear, tell a friend or two or five about the show.
9242212	9247774	Apparently, Blender was telling me he brought in some friends of his from PlayStation Home to listen to the network tonight.
9248035	9252997	That's exactly the types of stuff we're looking for, so thank you to Blender, and thank you to everybody who is helping to spread the word.
9253097	9257039	And no thank you to PlayStation Home for not upping the caps limit of their club.
9257299	9257719	Right?
9257739	9265064	Because we want to have everybody in our clubhouse, but we can only have 25 people, and it was maxed out a year ago, so I'm sad.
9265545	9266085	But maybe.
9266545	9267786	Maybe things will change someday.
9267886	9268126	Anyway.
9270467	9270988	That's it.
9271408	9271848	We're done.
9271889	9272509	We're out of here.
9272549	9273230	Have a wonderful week.
9273270	9275832	We will not be here live next week.
9275933	9276633	Very important.
9277034	9277774	Bobby will.
9278115	9278775	We will not.
9279516	9281578	We will see you live in two weeks.
9281758	9284561	We will be on the podcast feed next week, however, with a pre-tape show.
9284681	9285402	Hardcore, yeah.
9285702	9285943	All right.
9286263	9287784	Have a great week, everybody.
9288405	9289046	Be safe.
9289706	9290467	Don't be a dick.
9291188	9292049	And good night.
9292887	9295849	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9296489	9300712	Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
