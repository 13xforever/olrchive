00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight April 8th, 2012

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Capcom responds to Better Business Bureau complaints

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sex offenders get booted from Xbox Live in one state

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And our listeners sound off

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is EA really the worst company ever?

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are live for this April 8th of 2012

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With episode number 453 of our show

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Not with Dark Sakura

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or Jamie Summers, sadly

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She is not here tonight

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We had to make a last minute cancellation tonight

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Because she's not feeling well

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So we hope she feels better

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She's got like a science fiction double feature

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She has a sinus infection double feature

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Her sinus infection could be science fictional

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It could be

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She sounded like hell

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's just put it that way

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She sounded like goddamn hell

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And you did not want her on the show tonight

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Also, Tech Master Lowkey

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is not here tonight

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He's doing Easter stuff

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
With his Jewish wife

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know how that works

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's obviously a holiday for the family

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So they're doing stuff with their kid

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And all that

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So there's no Dark Sakura

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's no Lowkey

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But there's me

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Rob Roberts

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And obviously you can hear over there

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My loud ass

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Interrupting

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Excuse me, Alan

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You dropped

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I keep forgetting you dropped your handle

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A couple weeks ago

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's too mouthy and wordy to say

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, well how you doing Alan?

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm good

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I haven't been on the show in a long time

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You haven't

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I'm glad we have an opportunity

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To have you on

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Again tonight

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For the listeners who haven't heard you

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why don't you give us a quick introduction

64
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
About yourself

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And the types of games you like

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And all that

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mid 30's

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Been playing since the Atari 2600

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Favorite console is the Super NES

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right now I'm playing a lot of PC games

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Dragon Age, Orange

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Dragon Age

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oranges

74
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Not Oranges

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which would be weird

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mass Effect

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And so on

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Alright

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we live together

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So you get to see me all the time

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes

84
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright

85
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Um

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We have to have a third co-host obviously

87
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Orange Country doesn't work without three co-hosts

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Insert Ferret here

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Alright

90
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Say hello everybody

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Welcome back

92
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
By the way to VX JasonXV

93
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Or just Jason if you will

94
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is back with us tonight

95
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Three weeks

96
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Uh

97
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Three weeks

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Quite a better turnaround

99
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Than the eight years that we were going on

100
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
About previously

101
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I was gonna say

102
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For somebody who lives in Denver

103
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's really good to be able to get to a show

104
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Three weeks

105
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's like I got home on the train

106
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Turned around

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Took another one

108
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And hey I'm back

109
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Which is actually what happened

110
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Pretty much

111
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now I don't know how much I can and can't say on the show

112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I think I'm okay saying

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You were trying to get like a job thing

114
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Out here

115
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you got it

116
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yay

117
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Congrats

118
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that's why you're back

119
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Last time I was out here for my interview

120
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I'm still

121
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm still kind of giving the company the chance to

122
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Announce it because they make a pretty big deal out of it

123
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But yeah I got the job offer

124
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Monday night

125
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I took Tuesday to pack and wrap up things at home

126
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And tell my other job

127
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Peace out guys

128
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm on a train tomorrow

129
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Love to give you two weeks

130
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Two weeks notice

131
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But that's not happening

132
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So Monday

133
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Monday night

134
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Solidified everything

135
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Tuesday night

136
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Tuesday in general

137
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Finished off everything that I needed to do

138
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wednesday morning on the train

139
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And I've been here since

140
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Just after business hours on Thursday

141
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But there were no snakes on the train

142
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we're good

143
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There were no snakes on the train

144
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright that's good

145
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's good

146
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well welcome back

147
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm glad you're able to be here

148
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Especially on a week where we need a lot of people

149
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But you have the

150
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have an awesome radio voice

151
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I'm happy you get to kind of step up and be a co-host tonight

152
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So some folks might be wondering like

153
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well why

154
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay Rob why would you do a show without Dark Sakura

155
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And without Loki

156
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And you know well

157
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
With no slight to Alan or Jason

158
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who are fine step in hosts tonight

159
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But you know it is a little weird

160
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That there's only one of the regular OLR hosts here

161
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But remember guys

162
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice

163
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And it's not necessarily just about me

164
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Or just about Jamie

165
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Or just about Loki

166
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's about you guys

167
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we want to make sure that we would have a show here

168
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And a place where you guys can interact

169
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And still chat with us

170
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have to say I did take some inspiration

171
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A little bit from what's going on over at Video Game Outsiders

172
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Which is another show on the All Games Network that I listen to

173
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And poor John's been holding down the fort over there for a while

174
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because his two co-hosts have had just other stuff going on

175
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But they still do the show every week

176
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So there's no reason we can't

177
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We're actually not going to be here next week

178
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That was a pre-planned thing

179
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we knew that Loki would be out tonight

180
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But we thought Dark Sakura would be here

181
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But of course people get sick

182
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That happens

183
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we knew we would not be here next week

184
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And we didn't want to go two weeks in a row with no show

185
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So we have the show going tonight

186
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And you guys can chat live with us

187
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

188
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And AlphaKanandagram starts us off in the chatroom tonight saying

189
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yay weird show! Fuck yes!

190
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Aww, but you guys

191
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
More like Brorange Lounge Radio, right?

192
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show

193
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean obviously Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years

194
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And you played Bamani games just like Dark Sakura, Loki and I did

195
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just at a different arcade

196
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did

197
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But you were in all that stuff

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And Alan, well Alan's cool too

199
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right

200
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Alright, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week and all that tonight

201
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought we could talk a little bit about not just the weird oddities

202
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of having only one of the regular hosts here

203
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I mentioned next week we were going to not be here

204
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because I have a pre-planned trip

205
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're going to Disneyland, which I know shock and awe, dying of shock

206
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Alan's coming with me of course because he does that

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And we're going to the final ever electronica

208
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But for those who didn't know, they turned California Adventure into

209
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like this whole, they turned a part of it, not the whole damn park

210
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But they turned a little part of it into The Grid on like Friday and Saturday nights

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And they did this back when the Tron Legacy movie first came out in theaters

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And it got extended several times

213
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think it was only supposed to run for about 6 months the first time

214
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's been extended to like 18 months or even longer now

215
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's been about a year and a half since that movie came out

216
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before

217
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that electronica also has a replica of Flynn's arcade from the movie

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With classic 80's video games that are in great condition

219
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because you know it's Disneyland, they're not going to let shitty run down games into their park

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And the one time I have seen a broken machine there

221
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They had a dude out there fixing it in like 5 seconds

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So we're going to go say goodbye to electronica

223
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because you know they made a business decision to get rid of it

224
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that

228
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But they're replacing it with the mad tea party

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And that's tea as in just the letter T

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime

231
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where's failed trombone? Do you have it queued up?

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can get failed trombone queued up

233
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's too late

234
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are you

235
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you're upset about the mad tea party

236
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like you're personally offended right

237
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We saw that movie and I didn't think it was going to be very good

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And you were very optimistic

239
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It'll be okay it's Tim Burton and it was shitty

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I didn't like it at all

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all

242
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is that unfortunately with electronica changing over to the mad tea party

244
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They're going to close Flynn's arcade

245
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Now supposedly the mad hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade

246
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80's retro games

247
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
From what I hear they're supposed to be like skee-ball

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And it's what happened to every other arcade from the 80's

249
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They're now birthday kid palace

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Where the machines spit tickets and all that stuff

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Although I heard the mad tea party won't even give you tickets

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's just playing skee-ball for the sake of playing skee-ball

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Which is weird and absurd to me but whatever

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Disney Imagineers if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You should fix the bootsy run down arcade off of space mountain

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And put Flynn's arcade there

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And it will be super awesome

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Exactly and tomorrow lands a great fit for it

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Or just fucking bulldoze interventions

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Cause who goes in the interventions building like ever

261
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And just make a giant Tron grid

262
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing

263
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But my hope is, here's my secret hope

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have a secret wish hope pie in the sky idea

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They're going to give away some of the arcade games

267
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You get an arcade machine

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You get an arcade machine

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Everybody gets an arcade machine

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In reality that fucking won't happen

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because I think they're leasing them from a local company

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That specializes in this shit

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But hold on I want my idea

274
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want my pie in the sky idea

275
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And that is that they're going to give away these machines

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So I was thinking about if you could have a retro arcade machine in your house

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What arcade machine would you want to have in your house

278
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What game would you want

280
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is a tough one

281
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cause there's a lot of like great games

282
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And part of me wants to say Dig Dug

283
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Cause I'm actually pretty good at that one

284
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Part of me wants to say BurgerTime

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because I damn near bought a-

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine

287
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like not even a couple months ago

288
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And then I realized I live in an apartment

289
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And that would be a really shitty idea

290
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
To bring an arcade machine into the apartment

291
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine Alan right

292
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was like I could forego getting an iPad

293
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your BurgerTime machine

294
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I think the machine I would really really want to have

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't know why it's just

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is a spy hunter machine

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Any of the racing games from that era

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Cause they all had different like variety of pedals

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Switches, different steering wheels

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Like All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites

302
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
From that time period

303
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it

304
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Because that's what they had

306
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay shut up

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was at the local roller rink

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too

309
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It was that or the pizza parlor

310
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Pizza parlor was like a sit down

311
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Either like a joust or a galaga or something like that

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
One of the two sided top sitting

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's probably a name for that I don't know what it is

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I want a Spy Hunter machine

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last electronica

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Jason what arcade machine would you want?

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know I had one in mind

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I kind of forgot what it was entirely

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Not just Light Cycle Tron

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But one of the I think it was like the

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Movie Tron arcade machines

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There were two Tron machines

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There was Tron

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It was just called Tron

326
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And then there was Discs of Tron

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And did that have

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think there's even a third one

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because there should have been one that had like the assault on the MCP and tanks

330
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Tron was made up of four mini games

331
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I think you're just thinking they're all separate games

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game?

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's one of the mini games

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's just the most popular one

335
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There was Light Cycle game

336
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's the MCP cone

337
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There's the tanks

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And there's

339
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I would probably say Discs of Tron

340
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Discs of Tron

341
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I would not mind more time with that game

342
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've only played it like once or twice

343
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And it looked really good

344
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was very engaging

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was really fun

346
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's arcade

347
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Or excuse me, have Oprah give you one

348
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Gift you one

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What would you want her to give you?

350
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well I don't think it's in Flynn's arcade

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house

352
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It would have to be multiplayer

353
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it would have to have large cabinets

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
To set drinks on

355
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I would go with Golden Axe

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Because that game is amazing

357
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Like every time I've played Golden Axe

359
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not to just take a crap on what Alan said

360
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Not this shitty port that was on Genesis

361
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And is currently on XBLA or whatever

362
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But the original arcade Golden Axe

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
With three people

364
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was a good time

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was good memories

366
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It was good memories

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
God damn that goblin

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Attack faster, come on

369
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Awesome comments from our chat room

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because everybody's joining in in the chat room

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Love this

373
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
DDRdollabill says

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Robotron2084 would be his game

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hands bloody fucking down

376
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Brad from Pod Culture

377
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Love this answer

378
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is one I would want too

379
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Fucking Star Wars the arcade game

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Good call

381
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I completely forgot about that

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado

383
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And all that

384
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean I like the movies

385
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't like obsess over them

386
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But the arcade game

388
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Was so fucking good

389
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is that the Vectrex one?

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes

391
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that?

392
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There was

393
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't remember how official it was

394
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Has it on a little

396
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Not a ROM switcher but a cart switcher

397
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I was completely unaware that there was essentially a second Star Wars arcade

398
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There was

399
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There was

400
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It was a little more complicated

401
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But yes there was one

402
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was pretty awesome

403
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's see

404
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Tigerclaw on chat says

405
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If they did that

406
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Meaning handing out the arcade games

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if he won an actual arcade

408
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But then he'd be like

409
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here

410
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I would tie it to the roof of my Honda

411
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't even care

412
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go driving down by five

413
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Catching all the bugs

414
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Jim Sally says

415
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Burger Time all the way

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Burger Time for the win

417
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah I was almost there too

418
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Stan says

419
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Pac-Man but the small table version

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where both players sit at opposite ends of each other

421
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A cocktail machine

422
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Cocktail machine

423
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh my god I'd love to have a cocktail machine

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Those are hard to come by though

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Cocktail machines are really sought after

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Isn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive

427
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's the latest cocktail cabinet

428
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines

429
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition

430
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But like an arcade

431
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Pac-Man Battle Royale

432
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I remember it had a funny name

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And it's in Vegas and like New York and no where else or something

434
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My Dave and Busters in Colorado had it

435
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It was really fun

436
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Rama says

437
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Magic Sword

438
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh good fucking call I love that one

439
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That was the one they had at Round Table Pizza

440
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That I would just play the shit out of

441
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Pork Chop says

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
APB is awesome

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Brad from Pod Culture also says

444
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The original Gauntlet would be hella awesome

445
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There's a good multiplayer game too

446
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So good calls all around

447
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Love the classic arcade game suggestions

448
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes

449
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But our plan

450
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There's actually like a group of us going

451
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft

452
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Nerd nerd

453
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Some of my DDR friends from back in the day

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mel and Mel

455
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mr. Mel B who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day

456
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is going with us

457
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's going to be good

458
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And our plan is to at the end of all of it

459
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yell end of line and then collapse into tears

460
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Drunken tears

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And I want to see Laser Man because I still haven't seen that shit

462
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Laser Man will be there from what I understand

463
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So there you go

464
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hey Dark Soccer joined our chat room

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hello Dark Soccer and said Dave and Busters in Roseville has it

466
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale there you go

467
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We haven't been there since

468
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We haven't been there in a while

469
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Busters

470
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Because it's not redemption but it kind of feels like it

471
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And it's just a quick engaging game of Pac-Man

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm thinking Dark Soccer should have a local birthday thingy thingy at Dave and Busters

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wink wink nudge nudge with her two gay besties

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If nothing else

475
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Should have a Dave and Busters night

476
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That would be fun wouldn't it Alan?

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Alright

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Anyhow that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games

480
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And we will not be here again next week

481
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf who we are usually after

482
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
At All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show

483
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

484
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He's been off for the past two weeks

485
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He will be back next week

486
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So at least live folks you have something to look forward to

487
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Our 9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They will still be doing their thing

489
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They've been constant over the past few weeks

490
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR

491
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks

492
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Maybe a rarity

493
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive

494
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week

495
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It'll be fun

496
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Meanwhile let's talk about our gaming weeks

497
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And how was your gaming week?

498
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I would usually say ladies first but there are no ladies

499
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So Alan since you're within kicking range

500
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Kick kick go

501
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
How was your gaming week?

502
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I've been playing the Mass Effect trilogy

503
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Inspired mostly in part by all of the wank

504
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I got mad and bullshit over the ending of Mass Effect 3

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I've had the first two games in my steam account thanks to those crazy sales

506
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to 3 at some point if I can buy it

507
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade

508
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Which is sort of goody two shoes good guy and asshole good guy

509
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it

510
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense

511
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The characters die and I had to save and quit to do the show

512
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now

513
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes but that's all I've been playing for the last week

514
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's probably good to have a break once in a while

515
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Microphone extension cords and headphones

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No we need him to focus

517
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or Darth Sock tonight

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So unless you want to be funny he has to bring the funny

519
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Alright so that's it for you Mass Effect, Mass Effect and more Mass Effect

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Now what are you going to do? Are you going to buy the third game or are you going to try to play the second one over again?

521
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well I'm doing my goody two shoes play through right now

522
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So once I beat that then I'll load up my female femshep

523
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And she's just like fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe

524
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls

525
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay

526
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What a shock, yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her?

528
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's alright, Portal 2 is a pretty kickass game

530
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Alright, Jason how was your gaming week?

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well as I kind of started to say at the top of the show

532
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The first half of the week almost didn't exist for me with trying to get back out here

533
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But I did load down my iPad for the train with games and I just kind of picked up some old favorites of mine

534
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Death Rally has a modern iOS remake which is really fun

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I picked that up again and started working through the missions again

536
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Jetpack Joyride and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku type games

537
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Pickris type games

538
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I feel like I'm missing something significant but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix I don't think I was

539
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Sometimes you have to game on the go

540
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah

541
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And when you have 33 hours to do nothing but sit there and bounce to the left and to the right and back and forth and stumble through a narrow corridor

542
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
By which I just mean a train in real life

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes, certainly

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There's a lot of people talking about Mass Effect and lots of people getting into Mass Effect

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
AcidicVampire says everyone should play the Mass Effect series, end of story

547
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
A lot of folks saying they got the Steam deals going on there

548
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's see, Dark Soccer is yelling at me saying girl I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam

549
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Tigerclaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for $3.60 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug

550
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Which is set to be released next week

551
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem

552
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks

554
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
To I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that

555
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it

556
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So they were like I don't get it, I don't get the rage

557
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it

558
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So like maybe he's not mad today but next week he'll be like raging internet angry

559
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Or 3am

560
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
WAIT WHAT

561
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Waking up in a cold sweat DAMN YOU

562
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3 but just the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now

563
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome but if the last 20 minutes of the endgame rashetty for the whole trilogy

564
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That franchise in my opinion has given me at least 100 hours of quality emotional rewarding gameplay

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So it's not a waste of time

566
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3

568
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that

569
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So I've been playing it, it's been amazing as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show

570
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready, I gotta catch up to where Alan's at

571
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I have been playing a few other games though I want to tell you guys about, one of them is old and one of them is very new

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target it was on clearance

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I might be partially responsible for this

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it

575
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And I pick up the box and I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic

576
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise

577
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games

578
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is that THQ or Ubisoft?

579
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I want to say it's THQ that did this one

580
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Here's the thing Dance Paradise it has a really good song list

581
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's got like Lady Gaga it's kind of a euro infused song list it's like songs I think that were bigger a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond

582
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Because you got things like Jerry Halliwell and nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up

583
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But you know you got Lady Gaga you got a few Rihanna it's basically gay bar in a box right

584
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And you know it's going to be good music because it's gay bar in a box and it's a great song list don't get me wrong

585
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has

586
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game

587
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Like and the way you play it is really stupid like

588
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Because you have to take a you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it

589
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And then a step to the right and it's not the time warp

590
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes exactly you jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to

591
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Imagine it looks like rock band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down

592
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Well you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes you have falling dance moves

593
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or you know kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central

594
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But the fact that you move back for like who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird

595
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
For those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it

596
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere

597
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video

598
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the video that was really cool

599
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that right and that's the king of the crop

600
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You might see some like you'll definitely see like like for um oh

601
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
There's a little bit of booty and baby got back

602
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah there's that and then what the hell's that oh what's the goblin male dance what's that

603
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Soulja Boy tell us

604
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Soulja Boy okay thank you isn't it sad that that's how we communicate

605
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We have problems

606
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And unfortunately I know wow just enough to understand that too now

607
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay Soulja Boy you do that dance in Dance Central so some of the big ones are there

608
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But it doesn't like match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos

609
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And Dance Central is still a lot of fun I mean it doesn't really matter

610
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It kind of bothers me that like you have you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise

611
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out

612
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Dance Masters

613
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Dance Masters the Konami game Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together if you think about it

614
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's just para para of Kinect right

615
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Or even not not exactly there are three or four there are three or four

616
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Wow

617
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have para para routines

618
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But everything else to the extent of my knowledge completely original

619
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But it really is like fully fledged dance minus walking around a stage because Kinect is narrow tracking

620
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though they had a lot of DDR crossovers

621
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh yeah everything was Konami original period

622
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But the ones that weren't para para were very the routines were actually well they were fun to watch

623
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because I haven't exactly learned them yet but they were fun to watch

624
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But there was some really weird weird crossovers though because like I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic

625
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Which I was trying to find in my my archive here but it's like it's not really a song you can dance to

626
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I mean it's a DDR song it's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured

627
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement

628
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song

629
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The routine from what I recall the little bits and pieces it like the song the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I found it here we go so you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and like see the routine

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And realize it doesn't really work very well

632
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What is up with the backup dancers this is like pg-13 here look at this

633
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But anyway it's not a very like it's a good song like it was great back in the DDR days

634
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But like to like freestyle move it's weird and it doesn't really like make sense

635
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So here's the thing you've got a great interface and a great shell not even just dance masters

636
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But say rhythm party right the game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade

637
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But not even the Bimani community seems to care about at this point

638
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's actually a really well put together game and I've said that for weeks on the show

639
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
There's a Bimani community

640
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah well you know what I mean I think there's a Bimani community

641
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What's left of it? What's left of it?

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So you've got that and then you have to it's like they need to learn something from each other

643
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
If you had rhythm party with Dance Paradise's song list you would have an amazing music game

644
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Or if you had you know something that if Konami would just take the risk and license more than literally three licensed songs

645
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play

646
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And not just relying on the music to sell your game

647
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both

648
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand

649
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Konami a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm

650
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier

651
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that

652
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well

653
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh yeah

654
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Notably starting with Rock Revolution

655
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Harmonix is now the top tier

656
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them

657
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Absolutely I would sign on to that

658
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's too bad but there you go

659
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Anyhow so that was my big bloated Dance Paradise of a year and a half old game Dance Paradise there you go

660
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And that was your gaming week

661
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
One other game I'm sorry I have to say it quickly quickly there's a new pinball game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade

662
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I don't even remember the name of it it's just called like pinball I think

663
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Arcade pinball or something

664
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Here's the thing though it's a bunch of classic tables it's it's the guys that made the like Williams pinball collection

665
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And the Stern pinball collection like those games have already been out

666
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade but I see what they're doing they're piecemealing it

667
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because the game itself comes with four tables

668
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's four damn good tables it's Ripley's Believe It or Not which is a great table

669
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables

670
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four like killer tables and then they're gonna do DLC later like Pinbot

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses

672
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They're licensed with Stern and Williams so they're gonna get all those tables into their game

673
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously

674
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever

675
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal

676
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
If you like pinball there's some great tables in there

677
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there

678
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Or if you're named Dark Soccer and just have all the tables in your house anyways

679
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This may also not be for you as cheap as it as it is by comparison

680
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well I want to say Ripley's Believe It or Not was one of their like sought after tables that they wanted

681
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So they can do a virtual version of it on the Xbox 360

682
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Pinball Arcade says Zethur in the chatroom at chat.orangesauceradio.com

683
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I knew it had a very very basic name to it so Pinball Arcade that's the name of it

684
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Medieval Madness is DLC says Zethur and I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites

685
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And you know they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot

686
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's got some great original tables

687
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation

689
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out

690
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Alright now I'm done with my gaming week

691
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Housekeeping check us out on Twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r

692
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Of course always our website orangesauceradio.com

693
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If you want to find more of the OL Army members check it out in the upper right hand corner

694
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
At orangesauceradio.com there's a box called Extended Play where you can find us on Steam

695
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You can find us at Last.fm

696
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Lots of places to play with other cool folks who are not going to be a jerk

697
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because you know the number one rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick

698
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Because there's so many dicks ruining the game experience on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network

699
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We want to be different than that

700
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
There you go

701
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Alright let's get into some actual gaming news

702
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Jason why don't you start us off tonight

703
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game

704
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Again taken from the Rock Band franchise that they've been so excellent with over the past 5 years? 6 years?

705
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I actually don't even know what year they really started with it anymore

706
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They're returning to a frequency style layout with some very notable differences

707
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
There was a very famous point in amplitude and frequencies history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score

708
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz a slightly simpler game

709
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
One track per instrument and it was either 2 or 3 targets per instrument

710
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I forget which

711
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But the power ups aren't as track specific, the video is talking about a multi-measure automatic note auto player

712
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And then there was like a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner picking up notes along the way

713
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo

714
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound

715
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
A slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night

716
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog so if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game

717
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and what was the indie version of Rock Band Network?

718
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That is Rock Band Network, yeah

719
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Rock Band Store is the license, you know all that stuff

720
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content

721
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style

722
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well

723
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's interesting like I was partially really excited by the news, I have to admit a hint of disappointment

724
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because knowing that like this is the big project Harmonics has been working on

725
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like oh I was kind of hoping for something new

726
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But okay I mean it's really fucking hard to be disappointed when this sounds like a real powerhouse of a game

727
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And the fact that it imports everything that's already on your drive, that's huge

728
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What other company even keeps all your stuff like that anymore?

729
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Exactly, like seriously what other company is going to give you that type of value?

730
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Does EA own Harmonics at this point? No they don't, Harmonics is independent

731
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
They bought themselves out from MTV

732
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was like surely this is not behavior coming out of EA

733
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well that just proves Harmonics is independent

734
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So yeah they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games, that was where they were at when Rock Band started

735
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But just the value they're giving you there, it's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether

736
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Now it's like here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought

737
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Like well fucking done, applause

738
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
This is, I mean I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game

739
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'll definitely be picking it up day one, I mean now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like okay

740
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I did like amplitude and frequency a lot, people did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude

741
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable

742
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And so I'm excited for it, I am

743
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I mean the way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade style band

744
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience

745
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And that was literally with like Guitar Freaks Dramania, the early Konami games

746
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar

747
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band

748
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else

749
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have an actual performing gear that you can actually plug in and use with the game

750
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
What else are they going to add into the Rock Band franchise that isn't going to be tacky as hell

751
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And so instead to kind of go off the beaten path, whether they do something new which is hit or miss

752
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Or they use this engine that was really fun and have all of your content like you just said

753
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That's not a bad decision

754
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I mean fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band

755
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360

756
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import what $200 in content automatically

757
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade, it's at most going to be $20

758
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So maybe even $10

759
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Probably less than $20

760
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Well with 25 licensed songs or whatever it is they're doing

761
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
That in turn are going to play in Rock Band 3

762
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Amazing!

763
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We love you Harmonix

764
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Who else is doing this?

765
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You remember?

766
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay remember like three years ago before Rock Band 3 came out

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And they were talking about the Rock Band store

768
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
They were talking about how they wanted Rock Band to be like iTunes

769
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like it's iTunes for your consoles

770
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said oh yeah you're doing music

771
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You're not the same as iTunes

772
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
iTunes is for your iPod

773
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes

774
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But now here we are years later

775
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That's what they were setting the seeds for

776
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because now they've enhanced

777
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC

778
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console

779
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That is starting to feel a little more like iTunes for your console, that's amazing

780
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So like I said it's hard to be that upset

781
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And deep down inside I kind of think

782
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Rock Band Blitz is more of probably a side project

783
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
To something that's you know

784
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Something that's really going on

785
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I bet there's something else

786
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I mean there was the iPhone stuff too

787
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
They had the vid rhythm or whatever that was called

788
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The sampler video plus audio

789
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah the experimental thing

790
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year

791
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Because they've announced this in time for PAX obviously

792
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And you know we're showing it on the floor there

793
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Maybe they've got something else to show at E3

794
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles

795
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Maybe it's something for the Wii U, who knows

796
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So again my disappointment is like one grain of sand

797
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
In a oh my god I can't wait to eat this delicious cake

798
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's gonna be amazing

799
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And actually if anybody's interested

800
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I believe they're based out of Massachusetts

801
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
When I was job hunting a couple people pushed me in their direction

802
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But I didn't really want to relocate

803
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But if you are willing to and you're interested

804
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
They actually had a lot of positions available

805
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Anything from creative to programming to design

806
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think even like program management that kind of stuff

807
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
If you're interested look them up

808
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's all I have to say

809
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
As Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn

810
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Dead air

811
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I thought I had a break to eat

812
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Bad co-host

813
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's alright you're learning

814
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Learning

815
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You have to learn how to fill in those gaps

816
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So I can be a fat ass

817
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You'll get there

818
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright anyhow

819
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well let me ask Alan you've been awfully quiet on that story

820
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I mean I know you're not like as huge in the music games as the rest of us

821
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go hmm

822
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah I've kind of been abstaining because

823
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Rock band and that whole genre

824
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Guitar Hero

825
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I never really

826
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Was into it at all

827
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But it sounds like what they're doing with this new Blitz game is amazing so

828
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You don't like watching your friends get drunk and sing Lady Gaga and make asses out of themselves?

829
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Eh

830
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You could get that before there was rock band

831
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't have a smart phone with a camera to put it on Facebook so

832
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If I can't blackmail you then

833
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then where's the fun in that

834
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Alright well another game was announced just this past week

835
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's a game

836
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's a reimagining of an old game

837
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We've seen a few of these lately

838
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WayForward the company that brought us

839
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What the hell did they bring?

840
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
There was another

841
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
God dammit they did blood rain

842
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I think blood rain betrayal was one of their games they did

843
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
There's another one I was trying to think of

844
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
They are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise

845
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I had no idea that it was up for grabs

846
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But it makes sense

847
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise

848
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Who had it before?

849
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm trying to remember

850
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Trade West

851
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Maybe Midway had it and it was one of the things that went under

852
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
When they went under

853
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise

854
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So it's being reinvented as

855
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Double Dragon Neon

856
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Which is going to come out on Xbox Live

857
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And Playstation Network

858
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon?

859
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Well because it is

860
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
80's-tastic

861
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The colors

862
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The colors are the best

863
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
around

864
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Hopefully that can be in the game

865
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But I don't know. There is a trailer

866
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Let me play some of this for you

867
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Because it does have some nice remix music

868
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And you can notice

869
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The way the characters move

870
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Is very fluid and all that

871
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You know it looks really nice

872
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
In HD

873
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yeah that is pretty

874
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Beyond pastel-tastic

875
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah and everybody is very 80-infused

876
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like you see the afros

877
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And the leather jackets

878
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff

879
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You know call me crazy

880
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Or call me stupid if this already happened

881
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But you know what I'd love to see a

882
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Very modern remake of in this style

883
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Captain America and the Avengers

884
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Well especially when there is the movie and everything

885
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But I think they did another game for that

886
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Here is my concern with Double Dragon Neon

887
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Okay I bought Double Dragon

888
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
When it was available on Xbox Live Arcade

889
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It is not available anymore obviously

890
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time

891
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
When you know other people had the license

892
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
We played it together and we did

893
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We did

894
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then Darkstakers Dan yelled at us for trashing it

895
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I remember that

896
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yes because we played through it and we were like

897
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This game isn't very good

898
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What the hell were we smoking when we were 12

899
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This game sucks

900
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And now I'm looking at this going

901
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It looks like it's a faithful port

902
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Of the original Double Dragon game

903
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But Double Dragon

904
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Maybe I'm just old but it kind of gets old

905
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
After the first stage

906
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You're like punch punch

907
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Kick kick kick and I'm over it

908
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
What Double Dragon

909
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Founded Final Fight made better

910
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And I'd rather play that

911
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But even playing Final Fight now

912
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same

913
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Better dudes

914
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
They're all the same

915
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see

916
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
In new fighting games a little bit

917
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Maybe more like versus

918
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And special moves and combo attacks

919
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh god

920
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Don't give them ideas

921
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But I will

922
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'll at least check out the demo

923
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So that's coming out this summer

924
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So what you're saying is

925
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You want them to bring back that mode from

926
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Tekken Tag Tournament

927
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Actually that mode kicked ass

928
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So yes I want them to bring that back

929
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It was a little bit more fun

930
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Because there was the entire moveset

931
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And a little bit more depth to a side scroller

932
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And you could play it as panda

933
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And the concept of a fighting game where a panda bear

934
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Beats up everyone

935
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Is pretty fucking awesome you have to admit

936
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I think they brought that out it's just not a side scroller

937
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Oh right!

938
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Wow did

939
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Panda kills everyone

940
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Anyhow

941
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Wow reference number 5 today

942
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Keep that number going

943
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah sorry

944
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Sorry guys

945
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans

946
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Nintendo of America

947
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Is bringing Pokemon

948
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And Nobunaga's

949
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Ambition

950
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What?

951
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Nobunaga's Ambition

952
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Nobunaga

953
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Cowabunga

954
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Cowabunga?

955
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
They're bringing that to the US

956
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Called Pokemon Conquest

957
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And it's coming out on June 18th

958
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And you play a warlord

959
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Who has a Pokemon

960
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
PAL and you have to build up your army

961
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG

962
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And if you follow import games

963
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And

964
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You're a fan of

965
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Nobunaga's Ambition

966
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
This is great

967
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know I remember when I heard

968
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
That this game was coming out in Japan

969
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Like what a weird fucking idea

970
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And to hear that this game

971
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Is actually coming out here

972
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I have mixed emotions

973
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Look I get it

974
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Pokemon has it's rabid fan base

975
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon

976
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Like I'm totally

977
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Like I understand that fine

978
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But how on earth

979
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Does the US get

980
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition

981
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Relatively close to the Japanese release

982
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You know within a year yes I would call close

983
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
To this yet we had to pull

984
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Out fucking teeth to get

985
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Xenoblade

986
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Is this an

987
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Example of maybe

988
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I mean I guess technically it wasn't

989
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
A Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it

990
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Maybe that's the key difference

991
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Because Pokemon just shits

992
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Money and it's the Pokemon factor

993
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I mean it's

994
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Even if the whole feudal warlord fails

995
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
To grab onto people it can still be

996
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Propped up and kept afloat

997
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
At least a little bit more with something like

998
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh I don't know a Pokemon franchise

999
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Which is insanely popular

1000
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
As opposed to a

1001
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm not going to say an underground favorite

1002
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But definitely a less trafficked

1003
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Series in the Zen of Years

1004
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Zen of Sagas and of course

1005
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Why?

1006
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I understand why they changed the name

1007
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Because you don't exactly have your

1008
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here

1009
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
In the US I mean there was that

1010
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They had like a few of them on the NES

1011
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Like Nobunaga and Romance of the

1012
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Three Kingdoms and some of that but

1013
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That series has kind of been deader than dead here

1014
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
For years or at least I think it exists on the

1015
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
PC it definitely has like a cult

1016
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Following but nothing mainstream

1017
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So I get why they

1018
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Changed the name but you know there's going to be those purists

1019
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Though there's always some goddamn purist who's

1020
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Going to be like why couldn't they just call

1021
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It Pokemon Nobunaga

1022
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
They think it's they dumbed it down for stupid Americans

1023
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Stupid Americans

1024
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Get off your goddamn horse

1025
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
They changed it for Americans indeed

1026
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes they did change it for Americans

1027
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Because we don't have like two

1028
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
New Nobunaga Ambition games coming

1029
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Out on consoles every year like they do

1030
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
In Japan wake up

1031
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's fucking amazing this game

1032
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Is coming out here in the first place that's basically my point

1033
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And it sounds like it has six on six

1034
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Battles and

1035
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Battle conditions can change on every turn

1036
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Keeping players on their toes in anticipation

1037
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Of what will happen next

1038
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Me me me me me me

1039
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Fancy pants reading of the quote

1040
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And this article from Scott Moffett

1041
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Nintendo of America's executive vice president

1042
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Of sales and marketing

1043
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Pokemon fans are always

1044
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Interested in playing in new

1045
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Environments and experiencing new

Adventures. Pokemon conquest

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Gives them an entirely new way

To enjoy this beloved series

1049
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
With exciting new settings

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Fierce battles and nearly 200

1051
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Pokemon to team up with

1052
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Read that first phrase again in that quote

1053
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Real quick. In that voice or normally?

1054
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Whatever you want

1055
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Pokemon fans are always interested

1056
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
In playing in new environments

1057
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And experiencing new adventures

1058
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Okay okay you know what that translates to?

1059
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Pokemon fans will open up their wallets

1060
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And give us all their- They will buy fucking everything

1061
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They will buy any fucking thing that we put

1062
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
In front of them and they will like it

1063
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
If this was something that we were

1064
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That we were you know head over heels

1065
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Interested in we have a quote

1066
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
For this too

1067
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Shut up and take my money!

1068
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Exactly. As I screw up the quote the first time

1069
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I got it

1070
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But I know people like that

1071
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Shane's like that

1072
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
He probably has his pre-order in already

1073
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that

1074
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Alright let's go on to the next story

1075
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Was that mine? I'm keeping up

1076
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I swear. My computer isn't though

1077
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Um

1078
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Max Payne is being brought out

1079
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Again and being adapted to

1080
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
IOS was this one

1081
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I think this one uh yeah an Android

1082
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Version is actually gonna come a couple of weeks later

1083
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The current rumor says that

1084
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Max Payne for IOS is going to

1085
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Come out on April 12th I believe that

1086
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Is Wednesday of this coming week

1087
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
As to

1088
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Be expected it's gonna- The game is gonna be

1089
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Scaled down and adapted so that you can get your

1090
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bullet time portable on

1091
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Purely on screen controls no talk

1092
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
About any kind of a controller or anything to do

1093
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That but you can start diving around

1094
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And rolling around and uh

1095
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Falling off the- Oh what was that

1096
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Scene where you were going in like a drug

1097
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Crazed and you had that terrible

1098
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Walkway to navigate against that's gonna be

1099
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Really really bad with touch controls

1100
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Most ports are really really bad

1101
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
With touch controls that's what

1102
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Makes the story interesting because like

1103
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I- That was the other game

1104
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I didn't mention in my gaming week is that um

1105
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Midway read

1106
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
For the 200th time

1107
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Re-released their whole classic arcade game machine

1108
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Uh, classic arcade game compilation

1109
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And I picked it up in all the packs

1110
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So I have um

1111
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
YARV, Gauntlet, um

1112
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The sequel to Smash TV, same characters

1113
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Uh, I completely

1114
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Forgot what it was called but then most specifically

1115
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Like my favorite game- Total carnage!

1116
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Thank you. My favorite game with a

1117
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Mouthful of popcorn again

1118
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Total popcorn!

1119
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Like I- Like I was

1120
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Just saying one of my favorite classic games in the arcade

1121
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Was All Points Bulletin and that is

1122
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
In this collection but it uses

1123
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It uses the accelerometer

1124
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Or the dryer or one of the two and it uses

1125
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You have to tilt the phone to steer

1126
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And that-

1127
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That sucks! It's like

1128
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I would have been less torn up if there

1129
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Was an optional D-pad but the fact

1130
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass

1131
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah that's the- I think I have that same one

1132
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's the like Williams collection or something it's called

1133
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I thought it was Midway specifically

1134
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's only on my iPad it's over in the other room

1135
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I have it it's called

1136
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Midway Arcade it looks just like that right?

1137
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Okay I have it too and Spy Hunter

1138
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Speaking of that game is in the- Playing that on the train too

1139
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And it fucking sucks

1140
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yep

1141
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Like that's not how I want to play the game Hey look there's the fork in the road

1142
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Let me get off to the left. No why are you going to the right?

1143
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
No, no I said to

1144
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Crash! There are- Okay there are

1145
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Two games that are actually

1146
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Three games that are tolerable in that collection

1147
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
One of them is Joust

1148
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Because think about it

1149
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
In Joust you didn't have up or down

1150
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You had left, right, and flap

1151
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So that works okay because

1152
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There's only so many buttons you can- You're not going to like

1153
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Accidentally screw up and hit up left when you meant to hit

1154
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Just left because you have a fat thumb

1155
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Or any of that right? There's left, right, and flap

1156
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So Joust works surprisingly alright

1157
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The other two are Ski Ball

1158
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And that- Basketball or- Dumb little

1159
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Basketball game

1160
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Which aren't even fucking Midway games they're just

1161
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But you still get tickets from them

1162
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Exactly! You can get the virtual

1163
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Prizes from the prize stand

1164
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets

1165
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Here's your players tip for Midway Arcade

1166
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Just fucking sit there and start Ski Ball

1167
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And go, just swipe your finger

1168
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Nine times really fast, restart

1169
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Nine times really fast, restart

1170
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I managed to get a 900 game within about

1171
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Five or six times of trying

1172
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
There you go. So Max Payne this week

1173
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Android about a week and a half later

1174
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And everything else

1175
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Touch world is okay, moving on

1176
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Can I ask this real quick before we get into the

1177
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Next story? Ridgey you wanna say something?

1178
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
No. Oh okay. Um

1179
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Did you hear the news around the internet this week

1180
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
About how Instagram came out for Android?

1181
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Mhmm

1182
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And was suddenly bashed by

1183
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
All the iPhone users everywhere that was like

1184
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Ugh

1185
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I can't believe Instagram is slumming

1186
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It up on Android

1187
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Hipstergram is now Losergram

1188
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Ugh

1189
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
They need to come out with something new on the iPhone

1190
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Because I refuse to use an

1191
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
App that exists on Android

1192
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
What the fuck is up with that attitude?

1193
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Like I don't, where does that come from?

1194
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
All the same holy wars that divide

1195
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Them in the first place. The same brainwashing

1196
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That has them upgrade a personal appliance

1197
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Every fucking nine months for $500

1198
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And they see nothing wrong with that

1199
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Same attitude. I'm gonna club

1200
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You with my iPhone if you keep talking

1201
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'll help

1202
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But I'm not like that

1203
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I think everybody, I love it

1204
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
When Android users get the same apps

1205
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Because sometimes we can still like play together

1206
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And stuff. I'm totally fine with

1207
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Android users having the apps

1208
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
All my Android buddies have all the same

1209
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Words with friends hanging with friends

1210
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm sorry I haven't joined the

1211
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Zynga must die petition completely yet

1212
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I haven't started draw something

1213
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
For that reason but I still play words with friends

1214
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Hanging with friends and scramble with friends

1215
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's alright I'll just judge you from back here

1216
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Exactly. All the way across the table give that

1217
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Evil glare for the rest of the show

1218
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
He still gives money to Zynga

1219
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I would ask Jason to host the show again

1220
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But he fucking plays Zynga games

1221
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Like he's so not cool

1222
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And then there are some other games we've

1223
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Played like there was, I can't even

1224
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator

1225
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That had like 8 ball 9 ball and

1226
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Different table arrangements and that kind of stuff

1227
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And yeah those are all cross platform

1228
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And since they're asynchronous

1229
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And just alternating they work

1230
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Very well. They're very nice and they get everybody

1231
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Involved. Okay going to our chatroom at

1232
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Cat.orangeslaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says

1233
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sky it's Apple fanboys

1234
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
They are elitists. No they're not

1235
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm an Apple

1236
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Fanboy and I'm the guy that buys

1237
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
The iPhone every time. And your desktop is a

1238
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Windows machine

1239
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm by

1240
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm by

1241
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Alan I have to tell you something

1242
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm by. Computeral

1243
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
By portable. And you have the sense to

1244
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Skip a release before you

1245
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Upgrade. Yeah alright

1246
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So dig yourself out of that hole

1247
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Although also recall

1248
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
One of the first couple of words out of my mouth

1249
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
After I walked in here last time

1250
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Wow I'm in Windows world. This feels

1251
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Weird. Okay then fanboy

1252
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Do you consider, you're worse than I am clearly

1253
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Do you consider yourself an elitist?

1254
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You have to think about this. I can't

1255
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I can talk like it. I don't mean it

1256
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I mean when I was

1257
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
When I had my whole phone switching

1258
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
debacle I actively looked at what Sprint

1259
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Had offerings for both Android and Windows

1260
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And because I had an iPad

1261
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I was more than willing to get a different

1262
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Phone because I still had something to let

1263
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Me get done with the tools that I wanted to use

1264
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But

1265
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Sprint's selection was fucking garbage

1266
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done

1267
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I figured it out

1268
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And that's the story of how I have the

1269
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Latest phone. There you go

1270
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Alright let's

1271
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Let's go. It's not the Apple

1272
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Show. Let's move on to this story. That's my

1273
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Other show that I do. Oh that's

1274
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Right. You really do have an Apple

1275
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Show. I do. I should let you guys plug your

1276
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Podcast because he has one too. I'll let you

1277
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Do that at the start of the next half of the

1278
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Show. Alright for now

1279
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Let's talk about the Wii U

1280
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And a rumor about the Wii U

1281
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And usually I don't like to talk about rumors

1282
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Like these but it was kind of a slow news week

1283
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East

1284
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Thing. Which by the way we will have some phone calls

1285
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
On that later. But for now

1286
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We better. Rumors. Yeah we better

1287
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Because I didn't go this year. I'm kind of sad

1288
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Some of the other all game shows had it

1289
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Covered but you know

1290
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I might go to West Coast

1291
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
This year which is really exciting so

1292
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We'll hear from the folks

1293
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That were at PAX East a little later

1294
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
For now let's talk about the Wii U

1295
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Launch date

1296
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Rumor spreading around the internet like wildfire

1297
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
We're talking being picked up by Eurogamer

1298
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
GameSpot and so on

1299
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
The rumor is the Wii U

1300
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Is out November 18th

1301
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That day sounds awfully familiar

1302
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That's

1303
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Five years later isn't it?

1304
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Didn't the Wii U launch right around that day?

1305
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Did the Wii U launch? Or did the regular Wii U launch

1306
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
November 18th? I don't remember

1307
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It was just before Thanksgiving

1308
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona

1309
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Apparently it's coming from

1310
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
A Japanese retailer email

1311
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Or something like that is where this date is coming from

1312
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So you know take it or leave it

1313
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But November 18th is the day

1314
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So

1315
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Here's my honest reaction to that

1316
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet

1317
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet

1318
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I think Nintendo in part is

1319
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Waiting to hear what Microsoft

1320
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And Sony are doing although I guess they have to

1321
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Release a date at E3

1322
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe they don't have to

1323
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3

1324
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That year

1325
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't even remember

1326
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
The Wii

1327
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Came out on November

1328
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
19th of 2006

1329
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh so close

1330
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Well okay at least that shows that

1331
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
They're aiming for the same weekend essentially

1332
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So

1333
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I would not put it past a retailer

1334
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
To stub a date based off

1335
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What they saw before

1336
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
To have some record in their system

1337
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So they can start saying pre-order

1338
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Pre-order give us your money

1339
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Or at least some of it

1340
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So

1341
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yep there you go

1342
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Another day Wii U

1343
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
What else can you say?

1344
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Alright moving on

1345
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So there's been a lot

1346
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Of anger over

1347
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out

1348
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
A couple weeks ago

1349
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
In regards to all of the

1350
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Launch day launch week DLC

1351
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Available

1352
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
That is on the disc that you have to pay to

1353
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Unlock and I know if Loki were here

1354
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
He would be pitching a fit right now

1355
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Because this is obviously a thorn in his side

1356
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
There have been a lot of

1357
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Better business bureau complaints

1358
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
About this and Capcom has finally released a statement

1359
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's very

1360
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Professionally coded

1361
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And groomed

1362
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
To say

1363
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
We're sorry you feel that way

1364
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But

1365
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We didn't do anything wrong

1366
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Nanny nanny boo boo

1367
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The first draft of that said fuck you

1368
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You fucking fucks

1369
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But that got scrapped

1370
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah they rubbed it through the PR machine

1371
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Some bubbles came out

1372
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Basically they're saying that

1373
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
They make sure that the majority of

1374
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Content is on the disc

1375
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
There's 38 fighters to play out of the box

1376
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It doesn't matter if the DLC is available

1377
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
On the day after the release date

1378
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Or three weeks

1379
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You still have to pay whatever

1380
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Five, six bucks, PSN points

1381
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Xbox Live points

1382
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
To access the content

1383
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So there's no difference between

1384
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock

1385
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Versus stuff that's downloaded later

1386
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And they're saying

1387
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
That the

1388
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Disc, the product of the game

1389
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
When that has to go gold

1390
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
When they actually say this game is done

1391
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And then the release date which comes a couple months later

1392
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Even if that

1393
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc

1394
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's

1395
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
From their point of view

1396
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It was always

1397
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Intended to be something

1398
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Supplementary to the original product

1399
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And it's not wrong

1400
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Because Xbox and PSN lets them do this

1401
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And they're sorry but

1402
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You have to pay to unlock it either way

1403
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Whether it's day one or day 22

1404
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So

1405
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
What do you think? You personally

1406
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You're a fighting game fan

1407
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I know that

1408
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Given what happened with Street Fighter 4

1409
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And Mortal Kombat

1410
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I basically learned to just say

1411
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Screw fighting games and wait until two years later

1412
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Which I know some people in chat are like

1413
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I don't know the name but

1414
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
They're going to release a comprehensive

1415
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition

1416
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'd rather buy that

1417
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
They have sworn they're not doing it this time

1418
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Unless you want to get the Vita version

1419
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Or whatever

1420
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Then sure, that's what Loki says

1421
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Get the Vita version

1422
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You have a Vita, we can get it

1423
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That was code for

1424
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Rob, buy it for your Vita

1425
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And let me play it

1426
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Let me play it when you're at work

1427
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I guess it's

1428
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It's sleazy but like they said

1429
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It's not wrong

1430
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2

1431
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Which has a lot of

1432
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Several hour long DLC episode

1433
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Packs for it, missions with bonus weapons

1434
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And blah blah blah

1435
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
But the game itself is already so long that you don't

1436
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
You don't really need it

1437
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And it's just being a completionist and knowing that

1438
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad

1439
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But I don't have to but I want to

1440
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And it's on the disc

1441
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It's frustrating to know that

1442
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's right there on the disc but they want you to pay

1443
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I mean that's the frustrating thing about it

1444
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff you actually download

1445
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And while there might be seeds of information

1446
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
On the disc, you're still downloading

1447
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
A good chunk of the dialogue and you know

1448
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
All that you're actually downloading

1449
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You're not able to hack it off the disc

1450
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
In my opinion

1451
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Capcom may think this is the more convenient

1452
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Way to do it or whatever but

1453
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The hacking community is kind of

1454
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Teaching them a lesson here

1455
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
If you go that route

1456
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Here's the price you're going to pay for it

1457
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And it kind of sucks that legitimate users

1458
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Get screwed in the end

1459
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots

1460
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Like always

1461
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And on that note, there's actually related news reports

1462
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Coming out about this

1463
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
About the fact that Capcom has posted

1464
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I believe it's on their own forums as well as also

1465
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
The official Xbox Live boards

1466
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Is that they want people to enforce

1467
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
To help enforce against the hackers

1468
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And report people who are using these

1469
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Hacked unlocked characters

1470
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And are using them on online matches

1471
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They can't do their own fucking job?

1472
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
But if this is the more convenient way to do it

1473
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Then police it your goddamn self

1474
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I guess to save themselves a lot of wank

1475
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
From their fans

1476
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Have it be available on launch day

1477
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Digitally

1478
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Do not put that shit on the disc

1479
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
For any reason at all

1480
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And even if people want to make the argument that

1481
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc

1482
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And now you're saying there's $40 worth of

1483
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
DLC for me to get

1484
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Why wasn't it on the disc? They could just say

1485
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, because you have to download it

1486
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's not on the disc

1487
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And that will remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now

1488
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
AcidicVampire in our chat room says

1489
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock

1490
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It sucks, but if you want to have it your way

1491
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You should wait until the final Ultimate Edition

1492
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is eventually released

1493
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Yeah, exactly

1494
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The vote with your wallet statement

1495
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Which I think a lot of us are on board with

1496
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah, I didn't buy it

1497
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it

1498
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Was because Capcom has historically shown

1499
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That even if they swear up and down

1500
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
They're not going to do it this time

1501
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I don't believe them

1502
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition

1503
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like $20

1504
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Then I'll buy that

1505
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And then the $20 to unlock everything

1506
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That'll be about the game right there, right?

1507
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
This story

1508
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The hackers, I guess, that have

1509
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Figured out how to play those

1510
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Pay to unlock characters online

1511
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Without having to actually

1512
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Get the DLC

1513
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Apparently Jill and Shumagoreth

1514
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
From MVC3

1515
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Were on the disc launch day

1516
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
As Pay to unlock characters

1517
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But they were incomplete assets

1518
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
So to pull down that final 20%

1519
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That made them playable

1520
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That was a remote file package

1521
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That you could bring down to your console

1522
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Which is probably what they should have done here

1523
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm assuming

1524
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
If they wanted to keep the hackers truly not playing it online

1525
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Or what have you

1526
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Let's see

1527
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Other comments in our chatroom at chat.orangenautry.com

1528
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Porkchop says

1529
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Capcom left characters on the disc

1530
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And the hackers saw it as a personal challenge

1531
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And they took it, they ran with it

1532
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And gee

1533
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
What number of times is this that we've heard it?

1534
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Millionth and a half?

1535
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Absolutely, well you know the old saying

1536
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Hackers gonna hack

1537
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Right? Haters gonna hate and hackers

1538
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Gonna hack. So when you say

1539
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Your system is unhackable

1540
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That is like printing a wedding invitation

1541
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
To all the hackers says you are cordially invited

1542
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
To hack the fuck out of this box

1543
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network

1544
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And almost the company

1545
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I mean, what set everybody off about

1546
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
PlayStation when they removed Linux?

1547
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You wanna piss off a hacker?

1548
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Take their Linux away?

1549
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean for real

1550
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Take away their command line

1551
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Take away their way of exploring

1552
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And they'll make a new way

1553
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Brute or not

1554
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And for people that work in IT

1555
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
That are hardcore crypto people

1556
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
They don't even have to be gamers

1557
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
They see this stuff as a Rubik's Cube

1558
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It's exactly like you said

1559
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's a gauntlet thrown down, it's a challenge

1560
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Once they release into the crack community

1561
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Here's how you

1562
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Unlock this

1563
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
They may not even be gamers, they're just really into crypto

1564
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And the community is there

1565
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And they're always gonna find a way around it

1566
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It is pretty surprising that they're

1567
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Not only hacking, but they're going activist

1568
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
With it and actually playing these

1569
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And matches and using it as advertising

1570
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's pretty ballsy

1571
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
To go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag

1572
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And be all, look at me, bitch

1573
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place

1574
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
That on a console that is hacked

1575
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Actively prevent them from going on

1576
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Xbox Live first

1577
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And nothing goes wrong

1578
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And then they have to knowingly unlock it

1579
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And undo any mods or however the process actually works

1580
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
But yeah, this is

1581
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Probably attributable to the last six months

1582
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Or so of tech news

1583
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But they're not only hacking, they're going activist

1584
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
On it as well

1585
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
That's the more interesting story for me personally

1586
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Interesting

1587
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Because now people in our chat room are talking

1588
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
About what is likely next

1589
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And Wylan says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4

1590
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But Stan says, I'll totally

1591
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Buy Darkstalkers 4 even if there's stupid DLC

1592
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I've been waiting for that forever

1593
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Act F says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4

1594
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
When the Ultimate Edition comes out

1595
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
This is interesting

1596
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Have the reputation of fighting games

1597
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Been tarnished due to not just the behavior

1598
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat

1599
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And WB Games

1600
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Didn't really do anything different, granted they didn't leave it

1601
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
On the disc, but they did release

1602
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Extra fighters just to turn around

1603
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
This is February or March, they had the comprehensive

1604
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Freddy Krueger, Scarlet

1605
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You know, Kenji

1606
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
DLC edition

1607
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it

1608
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I still stand by my argument

1609
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
That EVO has something to do with the timing

1610
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And the extensive release

1611
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And all that kind of stuff

1612
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I really do feel that that factors in

1613
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream

1614
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And EVO, if there's something bigger than that

1615
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I don't know what it is

1616
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
At least here in the States, of course

1617
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't have a specific point

1618
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That comes off that

1619
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Ties into all of this

1620
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur

1621
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Done this shit? I don't think they have

1622
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
They're still the one franchise that's relatively

1623
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Tarnished

1624
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Well, Soul Calibur

1625
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Well, if you had Yoda, you could pay to

1626
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Get Vader, and if you had Vader

1627
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Because of the version you bought, you could pay to unlock Yoda

1628
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But that was really it

1629
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It was one character, and everyone knew that was gonna happen

1630
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Well, you know what they're doing now

1631
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Is it's all the-

1632
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yeah, because 5 just came out and I have no idea what they're doing with it

1633
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
They're doing princess packs

1634
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
If you want to dress up your pretty princess

1635
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
In all the gear, you have to download the

1636
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Costume packs

1637
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But that's

1638
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's still shitty

1639
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But it's cosmetic

1640
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Whereas in this, it's players, characters

1641
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Right, I mean, it's not

1642
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I think what they're doing is not

1643
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Nearly as bad as what's happening here

1644
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Over at Capcom

1645
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And if you're into the design character stuff

1646
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Which I know some of our listeners are

1647
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
They sent a bunch of custom characters

1648
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
He made, and a lot of them are just hilarious

1649
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Like, they're great

1650
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Real life interpretations made in the game

1651
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And with even more stuff

1652
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I can just imagine the additional

1653
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Opportunities that opens up

1654
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
But that's totally different than

1655
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You know, a whole different character is here

1656
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
On the disc, you know

1657
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But I don't think they really had

1658
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
DLC characters, there might have been like

1659
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
One that came with the collector's edition

1660
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I can't remember

1661
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The best buy, I want to say

1662
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
The really over the top silly

1663
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Like vaudeville character

1664
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I would imagine that after a couple of months he would be made

1665
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Available for DLC, but there's a precedent

1666
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
For that, that they did with Vader and Yoda

1667
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Right

1668
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Alright, let's move on

1669
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer

1670
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Near you that will require you to buy it in the store

1671
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And then buy all the DLC later

1672
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Okay, maybe not

1673
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
What's coming out in the US, Jason?

1674
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Especially considering the selection that I have to work with

1675
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If these games have DLC that would scare

1676
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That would scare me to death

1677
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Pretty light week

1678
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
As far as I see from the next week

1679
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Three games that

1680
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't know if I should even go on with them

1681
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But here they are

1682
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir

1683
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
With bonus

1684
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Drops on the 13th

1685
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh, that's just a strategy guide

1686
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Why is that in a game?

1687
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You fail-tastic

1688
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery

1689
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Maybe with DLC you can

1690
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Float the ship back up with ping pong balls

1691
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I solved the mystery

1692
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
It sinks

1693
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom

1694
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
With the anchor

1695
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And lastly

1696
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
With the iceberg

1697
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I don't even remember the blue character's name

1698
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So there's not even really a way to narrow that down anymore

1699
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Mrs. Peacock?

1700
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Yeah, that's not water related at all

1701
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh, okay

1702
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
There was a tie in there somewhere, but I'm not witty enough

1703
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Speaking of boat sinking, I think that joke just sank

1704
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
To the bottom of the Pacific

1705
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I'll never let go, Jack

1706
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'll never let go

1707
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
We were watching Titan AE last night

1708
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And the very ending had a very similar situation

1709
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I'll never let go

1710
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I'll never let go

1711
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I'll save you

1712
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
At any rate

1713
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Lastly, oh, so Titanic Mystery

1714
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Is...

1715
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's not next week, that's two days ago

1716
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot

1717
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Spirit camera for the DS

1718
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Titanic Mystery for the DS

1719
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
4-in-1 action pack for the PS3

1720
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Drops on Tuesday

1721
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Quiet week

1722
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
An unexciting week

1723
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there

1724
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
On the 12th in Japan

1725
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
On the Nintendo 3DS

1726
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Nintendo Sudoku 3D

1727
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Dai Ni Shu

1728
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Eitsuno Puzzle Day 1000mon

1729
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
That is, for real, the name of the game

1730
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's fucking Sudoku in 3D

1731
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Okay

1732
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Like

1733
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Can somebody explain to me

1734
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
How Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions?

1735
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Because you can have a cube instead of just a flat surface

1736
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
No, it's not even that

1737
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Well, it could be a cube

1738
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Your brain couldn't fucking handle the Sudoku coob

1739
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I could do that

1740
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
The Sudoku

1741
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Sudoku Coos? What?

1742
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Sudoku

1743
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Moving on to others

1744
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
That's all that's on the 3DS this week

1745
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
With a title that long

1746
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I thought it was Sudoku with schoolgirl titties

1747
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Or whatever Japanese has

1748
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That would have been far more interesting

1749
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I would play a Sudoku game if

1750
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
After you beat the puzzle

1751
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Sexy lady dance, titties in 3D

1752
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Maybe that's the hidden feature

1753
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Or you know

1754
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Guys in their underwear

1755
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Shaking it in 3D

1756
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Whatever it is you're into

1757
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You could have a switch

1758
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners

1759
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Look, it's like Mass Effect

1760
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
You get a choice

1761
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You can point the thing up or down

1762
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
If you were worried about tonight being a dry night

1763
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Dry night

1764
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
How about the Vita?

1765
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
How about it? In Japan this week

1766
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Rayman Origins

1767
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And, and ready?

1768
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Nikolai no Sudoku 5

1769
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Shugyoku number 12

1770
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Puzzle, that's right

1771
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's a Sudoku game on the Vita

1772
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
As well

1773
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Is that a swastika? What is that?

1774
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That's one of the puzzles

1775
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
No, that is not a swastika

1776
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
That is not Sudoku

1777
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's rotated

1778
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Look at it diagonally

1779
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I need the chat

1780
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Oh, it kind of does look like a swastika

1781
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Don't buy that game you guys

1782
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
That's not cool

1783
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It's in chat, tell us we're wrong

1784
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
That is not a Sudoku puzzle, that's the other one

1785
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
What's that? Kakoru?

1786
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
There's the missing number crossword

1787
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Kakoru or something like that

1788
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I don't remember the name of it, god dammit

1789
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
How about on the consoles?

1790
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Maybe there's something to save us on the

1791
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Playstation 3 this week in Japan

1792
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Dirt 3

1793
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You get Sudoku or Dirt

1794
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Also

1795
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Grand Slam Tennis 2

1796
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And Rayman Origins

1797
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
On the Playstation 3

1798
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And lastly on the Xbox 360

1799
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Nothing, because no one owns

1800
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
a 360 in Japan

1801
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No seriously, there's nothing on the 360

1802
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
this week in Japan

1803
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
How about Europe? UK

1804
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
All those countries over there

1805
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Looks like

1806
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
a light week over on the UK side

1807
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
or the Europe side as well

1808
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
On the 11th I have Football

1809
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Manager handheld for the Android

1810
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Legend of

1811
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Grimrock for the PC

1812
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Skullgirls for

1813
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Playstation 3 and 360

1814
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
On the 12th we have

1815
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered

1816
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Tribes Ascend for the PC

1817
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
On the 13th

1818
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Fez

1819
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Fez, not Rez

1820
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Fez, maybe your little Shriners in the little cars

1821
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Fez for the 360

1822
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
On the 14th, Pandora's

1823
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Tower for the Wii

1824
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Which is kind of

1825
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
a big deal

1826
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That's one of those Operation Rainfall games

1827
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Pandora's Tower?

1828
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So while we wait here in the US

1829
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
everybody's going to be pirating it

1830
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Because that's what

1831
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
people do

1832
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Alright, I'm just kidding kids, don't pirate

1833
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But seriously

1834
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting

1835
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Center Blade Chronicles

1836
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Like they just bought it in the store this week

1837
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And I was like, what? Oh yeah

1838
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I guess we should only really be playing that

1839
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Starting this week

1840
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oops

1841
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade

1842
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
A year ago

1843
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Nintendo, you've made the bed

1844
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Now lie in it

1845
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Moving on, let's do one other

1846
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Quick story before we get to the classic game of the week

1847
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
DarkSakura's not here tonight

1848
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants

1849
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But we're taking the

1850
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Classic game of the week car and driving it

1851
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
In another direction tonight, so here we go

1852
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Jason, one more story though

1853
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
By the way, the chat room

1854
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Oh there was, hey, look at the main intention

1855
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Well I'll say this real quick, the chat room is

1856
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Lighting up, saying there is

1857
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
What we know as a swastika

1858
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
In Japanese can be a manji

1859
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Which is actually a good luck

1860
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And some old video games had that

1861
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
For instance there was some

1862
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Dungeons and Zelda, somebody was saying in our chat room

1863
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Kind of looked like that

1864
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I remember it was 1942 and 1943

1865
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Had those symbols

1866
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
In the Japanese versions

1867
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And they were like extra life or something

1868
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So, and it's not controversial there

1869
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Because it has a different meaning

1870
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It looks mirrored to me

1871
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yes, I believe it's the other direction

1872
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake

1873
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
For commoners, so generally

1874
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Games that would have had it and come to America

1875
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Get it just changed to something else entirely

1876
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Or just stripped out

1877
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Was there another comment on that one?

1878
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
No

1879
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yes, one last story because I swear I am keeping up with things

1880
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders

1881
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Off online gaming networks

1882
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple

1883
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
All cooperated with the purge

1884
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Which follows a court case

1885
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
In the state of New York

1886
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
In which a 19 year old pleaded guilty

1887
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
To abusing a 10 year old

1888
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
He met on Xbox Live

1889
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
New York law demands all convicted sex offenders

1890
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
To hand over any email addresses

1891
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And online aliases

1892
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
To help limit their access on vulnerable web networks

1893
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked

1894
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
In relation to online gaming

1895
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Pretty, pretty

1896
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Didn't, we

1897
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
We never went through this

1898
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Six years ago with Uno

1899
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And yet we're finally here

1900
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Oh god, strip Uno, I remember that story

1901
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Look, here's the thing though

1902
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Obviously

1903
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
People that would do that stuff to kids

1904
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Are not okay and they need to be dealt with

1905
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
In ways like this, I get that

1906
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But, there's another side to this

1907
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
That kind of bothers me

1908
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
What parent was letting their 10 year old

1909
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Play on Xbox Live unsupervised?

1910
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Hello

1911
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Did they just not know

1912
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
What happens on Xbox Live?

1913
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse

1914
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You know what I mean?

1915
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
That should be a wake up call

1916
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
To parents everywhere

1917
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You need to supervise children

1918
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That are going to play games online like that

1919
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Again, I'm not saying

1920
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
What the 19 year old

1921
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
19 year old did was right

1922
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
That's no excuse, but I'm just saying

1923
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture

1924
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Although, take it on the flip side

1925
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And I can say something from my youth

1926
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
While I wasn't 10 years old

1927
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I was still really young

1928
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And my parents were divorced

1929
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And I was living with my mom

1930
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And on the times that she had custody of me

1931
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And even sometimes when my dad

1932
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Had custody of us

1933
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Sometimes it was just myself

1934
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And my sister who is 3 years older than me

1935
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But sometimes it was just straight up me

1936
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Often times, especially after my

1937
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Sister grew up and moved out

1938
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It was just myself in the house

1939
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
All weekend

1940
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
This is before the years of online gaming

1941
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Functionally

1942
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This is just a modern version of that

1943
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But these situations

1944
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And I completely understand

1945
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Where you're coming from

1946
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
One, there are bad parents

1947
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Two, there are bad situations with good parents

1948
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And

1949
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
It would be

1950
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Great if parental controls

1951
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Were a lot more perfect

1952
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
If Microsoft could step in a lot better

1953
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And have some kind of a camera

1954
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Filter or if they were just kind of smarter about it

1955
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But these situations happen

1956
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And it's incredibly unfortunate

1957
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I can kind of meet you halfway there because

1958
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
When I was probably about 12 or 13

1959
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
On my Commodore 64

1960
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
On my 300 baud modem

1961
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I was calling into BBS's

1962
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Local bulletin board systems

1963
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And posting on message boards and playing door games

1964
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit

1965
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
At like 14 and 15 right

1966
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Which if you ever played those games back in the day

1967
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Nice games

1968
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And my mom just said oh he's on the computer

1969
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
You know and I was posting on message boards and stuff

1970
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And there would be people on the message boards

1971
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It's like yeah you should like come out to this meetup

1972
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And all this stuff and it's like okay I'm 15

1973
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You know and

1974
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know I can kind of see

1975
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
That side of it

1976
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
That sometimes the parents

1977
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
If she knew what I was doing online though

1978
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
She would have punched me in the face

1979
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
She would have taken the cord

1980
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
She would have burned the cord in front of my eyes

1981
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
She knew what kind of stuff

1982
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I was doing on the computer

1983
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
How does the outside world exist anymore?

1984
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Especially nowadays

1985
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
With us I mean look at what we're doing here

1986
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Three nerds around the table and a lot of cords

1987
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That are just connecting us to the rest of everybody else

1988
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Did you have a comment on this Alan?

1989
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I feel that

1990
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
A lot of people

1991
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that

1992
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
A TV or a console should not be a babysitter

1993
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But it's

1994
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
A privilege for a kid to have

1995
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Two adults that are in the same household

1996
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
As them invested in raising them

1997
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And sometimes if they have to work

1998
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Full time jobs you know

1999
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
To do what's necessary to run that household

2000
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
A console or a TV will be a babysitter

2001
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
For four or five hours a day

2002
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And I don't really think that that's negligent to do so

2003
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And even if the parents

2004
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff

2005
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It doesn't necessarily mean the 10 year old

2006
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Doesn't know how to crack their parents

2007
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Password and lock it themselves

2008
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Like they're not

2009
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Idiots at 10

2010
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I guess that's true you know but

2011
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Don't fucking buy them an Xbox Live subscription

2012
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Do not buy a 10 year old an Xbox Live subscription

2013
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Ever

2014
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And if you're gonna get one for yourself

2015
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house

2016
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's dangerous

2017
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah and if the kid still cracks the password

2018
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
There shouldn't be icky

2019
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
20 plus, 30 plus year old pedos

2020
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Creeping on them

2021
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Well that's still absolutely true and I'm still

2022
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But I'm just saying you know

2023
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here

2024
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Alright

2025
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Anyhow let's move on

2026
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Let's move on to a time when

2027
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Xbox Live didn't exist and we didn't have these

2028
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Complicated situations

2029
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Although the Nintendo

2030
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Did still babysit us a little bit

2031
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week

2032
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
An old computer would babysit

2033
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Okay so here's the deal Dark Soccer's not here tonight

2034
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So this is Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week

2035
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But we're taking over

2036
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's my Classic Game of the Week tonight

2037
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Dark Soccer had picked a game for tonight

2038
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But I was like, it's a good game, but I'm like

2039
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
She can, I wouldn't want to

2040
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I wouldn't want to do it without her here

2041
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Because then she might have things she wants to say about that game

2042
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So we'll let her roll it over to next week

2043
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And I'm gonna do a game tonight

2044
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That I know she would never pick

2045
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Why? Because I picked a game

2046
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
From the Commodore 64

2047
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That's right, the game I've picked tonight

2048
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Is tonight's Classic Game of the Week is

2049
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Impossible Mission

2050
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game

2051
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But this game was awesome

2052
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Because it was one of the first games ever

2053
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
To use a voice synthesizer

2054
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And so here you go

2055
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Here's what you would hear when you would start

2056
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Impossible Mission

2057
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Another visitor

2058
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Stay a while

2059
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Stay forever

2060
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
That was the shit

2061
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
When I was a kid

2062
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
By the way, he's saying another visitor

2063
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Another visitor

2064
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Stay forever

2065
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
The last Metroid

2066
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Is in captivity

2067
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
The galaxy is at peace

2068
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It was kind of like that

2069
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So the original version was on the Commodore 64

2070
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And it was done by Epyx in 1984

2071
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Epyx was the company that made this game

2072
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Can we even hear the thing?

2073
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
By the way, the sound effects

2074
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And stuff in this game is very

2075
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Ambient

2076
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
There's no music

2077
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So you just have some very ambient noises

2078
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
If you want to jump a little bit there

2079
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Alright, so anyway, here is the deal

2080
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
In Impossible Mission

2081
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Not to be confused with Mission Impossible

2082
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Wink Wink Nudge Nudge

2083
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
The big show from the 60s

2084
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent

2085
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Not to be confused with 007

2086
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
That is trying to stop an evil genius

2087
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Elvin Atombender

2088
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Is tampering with

2089
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
National security computers

2090
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So you go into the stronghold

2091
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And you race against the clock

2092
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Which in turn will make a password

2093
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
While you avoid deadly

2094
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Electrocuting face eating robots

2095
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Ok, they don't eat your face

2096
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But they will electrocute you

2097
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And you will sometimes fall

2098
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Down bottomless pits and all you'll hear is

2099
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Ahhhh

2100
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Anyhow

2101
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
We've got the chorus going on now

2102
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Once you finally put the password pieces together

2103
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You'll put the completed password in the main

2104
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Control room door, and that's where you

2105
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,800
find the evil professor. Where do you find password pieces? In the furniture of

2106
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,480
course. You search the furniture in the rooms you might find lift resets and

2107
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,640
snoozes in the rooms as well. You also will have a room where you can get more

2108
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:40,100
lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle. There you go.

2109
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,840
Everything in this game was randomized which kind of made this a lot of fun

2110
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,200
because you could play it over and over again. Sometimes you would have layouts

2111
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:54,520
of the mansion or the stronghold that like were not winnable. But most of the

2112
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:59,920
time you got winnable and sometimes you get really easy one too. Rogue apparently

2113
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,600
was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts. The designer

2114
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,480
cited rogue. Do you remember the old old ass rogue game that was on like

2115
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,200
terminals? I don't know that I've originally I've played an original rogue but I've played a

2116
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:15,680
million roguelikes. Oh yeah well then you kind of know what the deal is there.

2117
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:21,800
Here is the speech that is in the game. There is the death scream which can also

2118
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:27,800
be heard in Beachhead 2. They recycled the death scream. There's another visitor

2119
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:34,900
stay a while stay forever and then there's also destroy him my robots. Which

2120
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:38,800
happens in the very first room you walk into a never again correct? It's a

2121
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,640
randomized room. Really? And then there's also when the game is over there's a

2122
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:50,640
laugh and then if you find him he'll say no no no and then there's a lady voice

2123
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,120
that says mission accomplished congratulations and that's all the

2124
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,280
speech in the game that's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a

2125
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,760
quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days.

2126
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,480
There were only two types of enemies and impossible missions there were the laser

2127
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:11,240
spout and robots and then there was also some some would move slow some would

2128
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:16,200
move fast and then there's also other types of security guards that would kind

2129
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,000
of just stay in place and then it would wake up when you got really close to it

2130
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,200
there. You get six hours to beat the game 36 puzzle pieces every time you die

2131
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:32,760
ten minutes are deducted from the total time. This game was ported like mad. It

2132
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:39,200
was on the Apple 2, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC

2133
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:44,760
Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System. Not all of them had

2134
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:51,840
speech though. Get this the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that

2135
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,640
made the game impossible to win. So it really was impossible mission somebody

2136
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,760
took the game name to literally there. Looks like level 30 syndrome started a

2137
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,480
bit earlier than we thought. Aha there was a sequel called impossible mission

2138
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:11,960
2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold. There was a 3d

2139
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,000
sequel planned for Epyx's handy system. I don't know if you guys know but Epyx was

2140
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,960
going to launch their own system. It eventually became the Atari Lynx so that

2141
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:28,840
didn't happen. Impossible mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga which was

2142
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:34,040
kind of the similar gameplay. Impossible mission did show up later in 2004 it was

2143
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,240
on the Commodore 64 direct-to-tv and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in

2144
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:45,480
2004 and the Sony PSP in 2008. Get that. This game is also available on the Wii

2145
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,680
Virtual Console but only in Europe because the Commodore 64 was a fucking

2146
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:54,320
huge deal in Europe. It was kind of big here but it was huge in Europe April 11

2147
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:59,200
2008 is when it came out there. This is one of those games that this is the game

2148
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,760
in my opinion and I'm obviously very age biased myself in that it's gotten better

2149
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,280
with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just

2150
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,000
like running jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things.

2151
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,080
You had no idea what the fuck you were doing right? I can ride lifts up and down

2152
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:19,120
inside the side and sometimes not even that couldn't always figure it out but

2153
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:23,680
now that I've grown up and matured I actually understand what's going on and

2154
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:28,080
what I have to do and this game is freaking hard but it's a good challenge

2155
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,400
and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to finally starting to get

2156
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:36,200
played again. I have actually I still have not beaten the game to this day but

2157
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,560
knowing what I have to do going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64

2158
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,680
version under emulation I've been making an active an active try to do it and

2159
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,360
come up short so far but I've still had a lot of fun doing it.

2160
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,680
Tigercall on our chat room says Sky do you think Impossible Mission could ever

2161
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,080
get remade? Well I mean I mean we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones but yeah

2162
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:01,320
that the Wii the Wii version and all those modern consoles I I would call it

2163
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:07,080
a remake because it's not it's not just like improved graphics a lot of a lot of

2164
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,200
aspects of the game changed like you don't pick up numbers you pick up puzzle

2165
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:17,160
pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map security

2166
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,640
code something or other I got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it

2167
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,960
it's technically already happened but not in a significant way. I think there

2168
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,880
would be a brilliant use on like let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation

2169
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,240
Network of multiplayer can you imagine if you and three other people all

2170
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,040
attacked the same Citadel at the same time and like you could maybe see the

2171
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,560
shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think

2172
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,720
this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization

2173
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,940
element in it and everything I think for like old-school fans I think there's

2174
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:50,120
really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made

2175
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:54,800
these other ports. For some very obvious reasons perhaps. You should be giving me

2176
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,360
the rights to do this franchise even though I know nothing about game or

2177
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:02,000
programming games I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live

2178
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
you could like do multiplayer co-op and competitive you do co-op where you're

2179
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,380
both collecting puzzle pieces I think this is a great franchise. One person

2180
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,640
manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person

2181
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,880
swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning scanning the

2182
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,320
furniture and everything else a lot of potential absolutely. Well there it is

2183
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,080
your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64 where it all started

2184
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,160
although it's available in a shitload of systems after that impossible mission

2185
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,760
Commodore 64 your classic game of the week

2186
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:38,960
haha Dark Sakura haha took your other classic game and just threw it out the

2187
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,440
window now she'll bring it back next week I know she will it's okay

2188
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:47,640
considering what the game is it would just float to safety there's your hint

2189
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:51,680
for next week all right that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but

2199
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:33,480
2012 with the 453rd episode of our show little weird tonight because we're not

2200
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,680
missing just one but two co-hosts but we have two fantastic co-hosts sitting in

2201
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,600
tonight we have Alan of course and Jason filling in that's me I promised you guys

2202
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,560
could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just

2203
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,800
co-host here but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do Jason

2204
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,840
we'll start with you you mentioned you do an Apple related thing yeah there's a

2205
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,760
there's a network of nerd topic goodness called a stack exchange and myself I'm

2206
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,320
quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called

2207
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:06,200
ask different and so myself and two others started up the ask different

2208
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:11,200
podcast and we've been going since I want to say last summer but suddenly

2209
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,640
that feels wrong for some reason but ask different podcast pretty easy to search

2210
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:20,920
for ask different comm is the site and there's links to blog chat finding us

2211
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,240
finding the site itself and all that content pretty simple I'm assuming

2212
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,640
that's a little pun on the think different yeah and that that's that was

2213
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:32,960
that was the name chosen for the site the highest voted name for to actually

2214
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,560
to actually call this site there there's like I could rant for like 30 minutes on

2215
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,720
how we came to that name but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic

2216
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,200
and you really do have a great radio voice I'm not just saying that cuz you're

2217
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,800
here but I mean it's convenient but you do have a great real voice I can only

2218
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:52,120
imagine it's the ass different podcast is great so all right not as a exciting

2219
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:56,480
and hilarious as the show is at least 99% of the time sometimes we get in a

2220
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,120
good good pun that's okay this show can be pretty boring too now I'm kidding it

2221
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:05,600
shows always amazing always Alan you you now in the time that you have been for

2222
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,920
your last guest co-hosting on this program you now have your own podcast

2223
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,560
right I've branched out of the olr network how very dare I how very dare

2224
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,880
you I'm surprised I'm surprised you were banned from this program actually I just

2225
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:23,080
sleep on the couch for a week so pretend you didn't make me do that I am on a

2226
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:28,920
podcast called fabulous flames and it is a World of Warcraft podcast maybe I

2227
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:35,920
guess a competitor of courthouse yeah I know it's my hair yeah I was invited to

2228
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,000
be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on whorehouse so

2229
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,600
there's three of us and it's just I guess World of Warcraft from a male

2230
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:48,440
point of view I don't really know what the gimmick is but yeah we it's a gay

2231
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:53,760
Wow podcast that's what the gimmick is fabulous flames is an actual spell from

2232
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:59,360
an encounter from this latest expansion and it's the gay dragon that was

2233
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:04,200
originally supposed to sound like Paul in from match game and Blizzard like cut

2234
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,440
his voice our listeners are listeners are too young to get that reference

2235
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:11,280
honey so Blizzard cut his voice acting going no this is not good so we're

2236
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,000
joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames bask in

2237
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,160
them so it's it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at

2238
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:24,520
fabulous flames on Twitter and fabulous flames calm or on iTunes how very dare

2239
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:32,560
you work that tagline so one gay dragons two talking dragons is my lack of Wow

2240
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,640
biting me somewhere here it's the Twilight dragon twins it's a brother and

2241
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:42,920
sister and the brother is on fire so I I've often been obviously I have a side

2242
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,080
project I do not just orange on studio but I have a podcast about the World of

2243
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,780
Warcraft called the best little whorehouse in Azeroth and our tagline is

2244
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:54,880
it's all things World of Warcraft but never too seriously so you know that's

2245
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,880
what we've got and I often get asked the question is it weird that you and your

2246
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:05,880
boyfriend are on competing podcasts and I'm like no because I support all

2247
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,680
independent podcasts and that's what I've been preaching on orange launch

2248
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,360
radio for years so I fucking love it that he's doing his own show it's great

2249
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:21,080
I love it no it is it is fabulous flames is still very much on its sea legs we're

2250
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,320
only on our fourth or fifth episode so we have we have a long way to grow

2251
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:31,240
you're still basic bitches but you'll grow I've been I am so rude to the the

2252
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,200
main host of their sunshine I'm I am such a bitch to him on Twitter but it's

2253
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:39,080
fun because you know we're frenemies we're frenemy podcasts is what we call

2254
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:43,840
each other and so I've said I I have all these names for fabulous wives I call

2255
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,480
them the fabulous flops it's my favorite name them so anyhow alright so there you

2256
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,760
go and honestly I really do I think it's great because it's not like most people

2257
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,000
I know that listen to podcasts listen at work and they've got plenty of time to

2258
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,420
listen to plenty of shows and I would rather somebody be listening to an

2259
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:07,320
independent podcast then some of that crap that certain websites that won't be

2260
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:14,840
named produce honey yeah you try I had to dig in one more come on come on

2261
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,640
alright anyhow so there you go let's um also I would do shoutouts for PAX East

2262
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:24,200
since we're giving other shows shoutouts I do want to say I heard little bits and

2263
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,840
pieces of what the B team which is one of the other shows on the all games

2264
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:32,360
network did they were live at PAX East and did some good shows so check that

2265
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:37,000
out I also know electric sistahood which is also on the all games network did a

2266
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,120
show while they were there I don't think it was live but I think maybe it was I

2267
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:46,960
don't remember sorry girls but they did one and it will be on their podcast feed

2268

01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,000
this show all the time and we'll be on the show tonight guest it on it so I'm

2270
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,720
glad to see the all games network big happy family getting together at PAX I

2271
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:02,040
will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great

2272
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,820
year I mean oh man that was a that was like one of my favorite cons ever was

2273
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,840
that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there we were

2274
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,880
broadcasting it was a great year but I did go to PAX East the first year a

2275
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:17,200
couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but

2276
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:21,640
you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to

2277
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:26,200
Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to a PAX Prime this

2278
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:31,120
year if nothing else all right I'll advertise real far advertising the all

2279
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:37,600
games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise I have

2280
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:42,060
no good response tonight I was gonna say something bitchy about one of the

2281
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:45,720
corporate networks but I'm not gonna go there and I'm just gonna ask that we go

2282
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:51,400
for some rapid-fire news so you know what's funny about that I'm on a loaner

2283
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,640
laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out so I can tell you the

2284
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:00,120
first story purely from recollection is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid

2285
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:03,400
May what's the next quest what's the next question for the great dungeon

2286
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,880
crawl torchlight when is it they haven't said yet soon soon shortly after Diablo

2287
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,560
3 which is still soon but not soon enough you want to give me the headlines

2288
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:21,080
of the next two because I can hard angle oh what there you go

2289
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:27,040
theater rhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the what is that midsummer

2290
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,440
July 3rd mm-hmm game was actually completely off my radar but looking at

2291
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,680
the looking at the screenshots looks fun I did get a particular amount of

2292
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:39,240
amusement of the fact that cloud stripes face was completely obscured in the one

2293
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,520
screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the the the note exceeding the

2294
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,800
target zone whatever the particular vocabulary is for that and finally Sega

2295
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,680
says rhythm thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have

2296
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,080
on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody

2297
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,800
saved my poor dead-air ass there was they were on the paxi Sega was at PAX

2298
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,920
East and there was confirmation that rhythm thief is still happening this is

2299
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,320
despite all the Sega bad news we had last week

2300
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,000
rhythm thief was not canceled so it is still happening it's a 3ds rhythm action

2301
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,040
game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on

2302
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,720
disco floors there you go all right some other rapid-fire news for you guys

2303
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:27,160
fallout the original not the fallout 3 which was still really good but the

2304
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,640
original original game way back in the day was free I say was because you

2305
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,960
missed it it was on good old games or gog.com it was earlier this week

2306
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,200
unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I

2307
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:44,320
reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free

2308
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,920
fallout which is a great great PC get your PC gaming fan I know you know yes

2309
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,200
all serious also it's worth mentioning since we brought up gog they throw a

2310
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,840
little shade at steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give

2311
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,560
these games away for such low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I

2312
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:08,000
thought was an interesting little dig it helps me I can't imagine I mean EA

2313
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,480
fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and

2314
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,600
only sell things through their own platform but if a game developer is

2315
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:24,000
letting steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99 I don't think valve is

2316
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,680
twisting their arm zithers in our chat room talking about the Sega stuff saying

2317
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,520
I hope to God we get Phantasy Star online to hear if that gets canned I

2318
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:37,800
will explode I hear ya that character creator came out this week overseas it's

2319
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,560
not you know that the game has been announced for the US cross your fingers

2320
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,960
and your toes we get any three announcement because if you don't hear

2321
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,800
it at e3 it's probably not happening you know what is happening though a sieve

2322
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,040
5 expansion civilization 5 gods and kings it is going to be coming out on

2323
01:40:54,040 --> 01:41:01,160
June 19 is the release date for that 22nd if you're international there was

2324
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,880
more information announced about this a game developers conference but in case

2325
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:09,960
you forgot 27 new units 13 new buildings 9 new wonders and civilization they're

2326
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,840
also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to

2327
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,000
diplomacy so hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked

2328
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,600
in the game to begin with but if any of my sieve friends are listening we're

2329
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:25,960
gonna need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm

2330
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:30,080
I'm eager to revisit the game again but God you know how the sieve 5 matches

2331
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,960
will go you started at six o'clock in the evening and then suddenly oh shit

2332
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:41,200
it's 2 a.m. and we just discovered railroads another story this week epic

2333
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:47,520
games you know epic games they make well you know epic games including unreal and

2334
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,080
you know the Gears of War here's the deal they have announced sort of that

2335
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:57,960
they're doing a PC exclusive project it was mentioned during a PAX East panel

2336
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:02,880
the unannounced PC project is under development the plans are to keep the

2337
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:08,280
game exclusive to the PC so if you were worried that epic was all about the

2338
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:11,800
consoles and I don't know iOS games now because that's the other big thing they

2339
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:17,920
did right infinity blade don't worry a PC exclusive title is in the works hmm

2340
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:27,160
could be interesting Alan there has been an online petition for the game Dark

2341
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:31,960
Souls the sequel to Demon's Souls otherwise known as one of the hardest

2342
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:39,520
console games ever this generation the petitions been to bring it on to the PC

2343
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:46,400
platform and Atlas has come out and said yes there will be a PC edition of Dark

2344
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:52,960
Souls and it's called the Dark Souls prepare to die edition to which anyone

2345
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:58,960
that's played the game would say very much yes you will die there was a lot of

2346
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,360
hype in last few weeks about the game journey I believe it is that sort of has

2347
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:08,320
an online element if that's correct Demon's Souls was similar in that when

2348
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,960
you were fighting in these labyrinths you would fight these ghouls that were

2349
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,000
actually other players and Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic or sorry Dark

2350
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,520
Souls has a similar mechanic so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's

2351
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,760
coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was

2352
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:33,600
a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC

2353
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:41,260
Edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so so Dark

2354
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:48,400
Souls fans on PC you're in luck Skyrim 1.5 patch which I was surprised when I

2355
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:52,120
read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a

2356
01:43:52,120 --> 01:44:00,440
couple weeks now is hitting 360 and ps3 this week and it's mostly bug fixes at

2357
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:06,800
least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests

2358
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,760
the big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's it's adding kill

2359
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:19,280
moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile

2360
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:23,240
weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new

2361
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,640
kill moves for melee weapons so now not only can you behead people you can fry

2362
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:31,480
them you can shoot arrows through their necks and all that other stuff you saw

2363
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:36,160
in shaky cam Hunger Games yes they fixed what it looks like when you go underwater

2364
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:42,640
and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug Lydia is the first

2365
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:47,640
guard woman that you get and you when you buy a house she if you're wearing an

2366
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:51,600
omelet amulet of Mara you should be able to propose to her she's been bugged this

2367
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:58,820
whole time since November or whatever so finally they fixed the Lydia bug yes I

2368
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:05,920
look for that on Xbox and ps3 this week finally Sonic 4 episode 2 the big 2d

2369
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:12,600
HD resurgence of the sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an

2370
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:18,840
elevator is getting its episode 2 like everyone's like it sounds so awesome and

2371
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,760
then it came out and it's no one Kerr it is finally getting its episode 2 and it

2372
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:29,240
will likely be the last episode so they are wrapping this up really fast

2373
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:33,560
episodic content is the way of the future like we'll give you a part 2

2374
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,760
because no one like this shit and we don't want to make it anymore so thanks

2375
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:44,920
Gabe Newell PSN version will be released on a May 15th XBL a version of Sonic 4

2376
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:50,840
episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess

2377
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:57,040
confirmed but to be announced later all right that's all let's go to the

2378
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,440
frugal question of the week oh no we won't go to the frugal question of the

2379
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:07,480
week well one quick thing I missed in the theater them story if you're at PAX

2380
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:12,960
East you can go check out the oh sorry nevermind it's over yeah it was joke may

2381
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:23,760
I do the frugal now absolutely every week we ask you guys a question over at

2382
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,520
Facebook or Google Plus Facebook put together that's Google that's our concern

2383
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,880
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio if you want to like us over there and

2384
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,040
Google Plus slash search for orange lounge radio because we don't get short

2385
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:39,880
URLs there I'll start with Google Plus tonight because the very first answer on

2386
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:42,880
Google Plus I need to read this because it has something very important in it oh

2387
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,160
I should tell you guys what the question was just like I forgot to tell you what

2388
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,040
the question was just then I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week

2389
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:55,760
so I made it really easy this week I said how was your gaming week shit we

2390
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,680
all have to say every night how our gaming weeks were the host of the show

2391
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,320
so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot so how was your gaming week

2392
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:05,580
listeners I especially said what game are you into right now that everybody

2393
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:09,600
else should be playing so Derek H starts us off on Google Plus and this is worth

2394
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,880
mentioning he's playing pinball arcade on Xbox Live arcade but everyone should

2395
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:19,520
be playing joust on maim as part of the hunt and I totally forgot to mention

2396
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,600
this I'm so bad and I had like notes to myself to mention this partly because I

2397
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,560
had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week after last week

2398
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,440
show but dark Tetsuya who pretty much writes most of the articles in orange

2399
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:36,320
launch radio.com at this point it's either him or act after me me

2400
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,920
publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point dark Tetsuya is

2401
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,880
doing a little contest and it's called the hunt and it's based off of the book

2402
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,920
ready player one where they kind of do something very similar I don't want to

2403
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,440
go into all the details but he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition

2404
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:56,120
called the hunt and it involves classic video games and being able to get

2405
01:47:56,120 --> 01:48:00,720
scores that are better than what dark Tetsuya gets and he doesn't really try

2406
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,520
super hard because he makes it you know beatable so right now the contest he's

2407
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:08,640
running is joust and if you can beat a score of 39,000 something so I mean

2408
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:13,120
39,800 you take a screen cap of it and either email it to dark Tetsuya or you

2409
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,000
post it on Twitter and you're gonna get a little copper key and some points that

2410
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,800
let you into the next round of the competition so joust is the game that

2411
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,960
they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping

2412
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:30,120
dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't

2424
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,040
game though like if you like you know your retro shooters he did a good job I

2425
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,480
did buy it I bought it like two years ago when it first came out so he's

2426
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:33,920
probably long spent the money but I did buy it all right uh pwk responded and

2427
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,680
said I was at my first packs this weekend congratulations I hope you had

2428
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:43,080
fun I want to hear more about it Tony M responded and said this is an oldie but

2429
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:47,000
after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads I've been playing

2430
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,800
persona 3 portable it's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs you know persona is

2431
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,080
one of the series I hear nothing but good things about but I just I personally

2432
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:59,200
haven't sat down and played it myself but like I said the same thing about

2433
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,240
Mass Effect a few months ago on the show I haven't really played it myself but I

2434
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,280
hear a lot of people are really into it so persona one of these days I'm gonna

2435
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:10,720
sit down and play it maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect

2436
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,080
play persona is that a serious interest you at all no you did play it before

2437
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:19,000
though didn't I have you don't know three and four for ps2 I think might

2438
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,600
still be shrink-wrapped on this show all right let's go to Facebook read some of

2439
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,480
the answers there um lots of replies on Facebook I can't possibly read these all

2440
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:32,960
but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these

2441
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,720
let's see another persona Austin W says right now I'm really into persona 4 on

2442
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,760
PlayStation 2 anyone who is a fan of JRPGs dungeon crawlers and the social

2443
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:48,120
character interaction aspect of games should check it out let's see going to

2444
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:53,960
Stan says splitting my time between draw something angry bird space push mo on

2445
01:50:53,960 --> 01:51:00,760
3ds and more Soulcalibur 5 online trying to show off my creative souls Chad C

2446
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,880
responds and says been playing realm of the mad god it's an MMORPG shooter with

2447
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:12,240
85 player groups what free to play on your browser also on steam 35 make

2448
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:18,240
download 8-bit graphics perma death kind of sucks when your guy you log 30 plus

2449
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:22,320
hours on dies but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing

2450
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,960
more what perma death and an MMO that's crazy once you hit level 20 you start

2451
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,040
gaming gaining fame which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons the

2452
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,320
final boss is onyx everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests

2453
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,960
are completed on your realm and someone kills 2500 mobs the game isn't over when

2454
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,160
he dies however because you can keep getting gaining fame to unlock harder

2455
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:46,840
dungeons and get better loots I don't know this game but it sounds crazy

2456
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,080
thank you I keep bumping into it but I haven't really taken the plunge myself

2457
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:54,040
huh now you knew there were gonna be some people talking about Xenoblade this

2458
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:58,280
week so we have Barry M Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG

2459
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:02,480
game much in the vein of Final Fantasy 12 meets my White Knight Chronicles I

2460
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:06,440
think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it actually also

2461
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:10,280
playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita Kid Icarus uprising on 3ds and Tales of

2462
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:16,440
Graces F on PlayStation 3 this is a great year for RPG fans Carlos M says

2463
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:21,880
I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something

2464
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,840
I'd like that those two games are like on the same level there it's awesome

2465
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:31,720
zether simply responds Xenoblade everyone probably knows why and dark

2466
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:35,720
soccer would kick me if I didn't say I randomly started playing Portal 2 again

2467
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:41,000
I know I know I should be playing Mass Effect yes you should I'm gonna read

2468
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,440
this comment from unfolded Raptor it's a long one but it's good this past week

2469
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,880
the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a

2470
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:53,000
liquidation sale and had to sell everything so I found a whole bunch of

2471
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,280
really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each I ended up buying 15 that I never

2472
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,360
played yet and probably won't for a while I'm not gonna read all these but

2473
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:07,720
like Twisted Metal Demon Souls Deus Ex Bulletstorm there's a ton in here grand

2474
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,240
total of a hundred and seventy three dollars for those games it's a steal

2475
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:15,200
considering at Walmart and even at the evil G the lowest some of these get is

2476
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,320
around 20 bucks I highly suggest people play Borderlands that they haven't yet

2477
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:22,640
it's a ton of fun other than that I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden

2478
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:26,840
3 and have almost finished it I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the

2479
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:31,040
hate for it sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun pretty

2480
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,000
similar situation in my neck of the woods and I'm sure many other places

2481
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,760
people people around work were saying you what if there's any movie you've

2482
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,400
been wanting for a long time go check out the blockbuster right down the hill

2483
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:46,760
cuz uh it'll be gone soon I want a blockbuster to go out of business here

2484
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:51,120
California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse well they all

2485
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:54,920
went under already years ago red box took over years ago here there's like

2486
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:59,400
only I can only think of like where one blockbuster even is there's one over on

2487
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,880
Folsom below are that I know I'll keep your eye on it for it to go under well

2488
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,200
okay I will do that it's right next door to Papa Murphy's so we it's like the

2489
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:12,680
only pizza chain I'll eat so anymore so all right there you go that was our

2490
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:16,200
frugal question of the week thank you guys for responding sorry I didn't read

2491
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,000
them all but like that was more that since it was such an easy question there

2492
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:26,000
was more there than like ever before so let's move on Jason more news electronic

2493
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,440
arts has been voted the worst American company ever okay not ever but just in

2494
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,840
2012 so I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started

2495
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,420
whatever beyond that the consumerist holds an annual tournament to determine

2496
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:44,160
the most despised American companies nominations are put to a vote and the

2497
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,120
ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of this of the year electronic

2498
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:55,240
arts congratulations in a poll that took over 250,000 votes EA beat out the Bank

2499
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:00,920
of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead

2500
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:07,640
hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers I don't think EA has ever double

2501
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:11,480
withdrawn someone's mortgage payment and I know people can be evaded have had

2502
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:16,400
that happen so I'm a little skeptical I know the study has been going on for a

2503
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:22,480
while but with the timing to the Mass Effect 3 ending wank this seems I timed

2504
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:27,560
poorly for the story for me I ate all the popcorn I'd saved for this story

2505
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,080
because I have not seen such internet lulls like I've seen this week on this

2506
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:37,840
story from all facets I mean there's obviously the people that you know voted

2507
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,120
for this and allowed it to win that just their seething hatred for EA that mostly

2508
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:46,560
comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect and you granted there's

2509
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:51,240
the DLC stuff there's I mean I'm not letting an EA off easy here but you know

2510
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:57,120
it's not like they're Capcom there's I think EA's kind of taken the burden for

2511
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:01,240
everything that everything hey everybody hates with the gaming industry right now

2512
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:05,080
I think it's kind of said in that statement but then what also cracks me

2513
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:10,480
up is like the people on the consumerist that are like fucking gamers fucking

2514
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:16,200
gamers ruining this poll fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company

2515
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:21,680
in the world what the fuck is wrong with gamers obviously gamers are too poor to

2516
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:27,720
own a house and it's like you guys internet polls are really fucking

2517
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:33,280
serious business everybody look at your lives look at your choices you are all

2518
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:42,000
rabble-rabble ing over an internet poll on some website that is owned by the

2519
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,240
same people that don't go talk to I think I know no they sold it off years

2520
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:48,600
ago but then one time you know what I'm saying it's just who cares it's an

2521
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:54,120
internet poll it is not that serious you know what your worst company is and who

2522
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:58,800
you're gonna give money to and not and so forth it's it's kind of an individual

2523
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:04,520
decision so and meanwhile Activision Blizzard is going to dodge that bullet

2524
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:10,320
girl we ain't done shit the rest of this article is a pretty good read I'll leave

2525
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:15,200
it verbatim to those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video

2526
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:19,320
game company winning the worst company in American vote it's that exact kind of

2527
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:23,800
attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to

2528
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:28,100
nickel-and-dime consumers to death argues the site for years while movies

2529
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:32,300
and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or

2530
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:37,240
multiple modes of delivery or multiple modes of delivery is added value to

2531
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:41,040
entice customers to buy video games have continued to be priced like premium

2532
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,920
goods for its exploitation of the downloadable content model the

2533
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:49,640
consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy the poo is

2534
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:53,180
usually presented on a red pillow but this year the company is sending a

2535
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:58,200
choice of colors mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending haha

2536
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:03,600
like the Razzies sorry it's okay as gratuitous as EA's deals he is I can't

2537
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:08,560
help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures of or some of

2538
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:13,080
the other scummy things the companies in the running did there you go though the

2539
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:19,440
internet hath spoken also hath was my addition it said has but there you go

2540
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:26,440
and I loved EA put out some response that was very like we don't give a fuck

2541
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:31,120
like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies we don't care

2542
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:38,240
it's so amazing no it was very like well I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of

2543
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:44,080
them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year and then pop cap

2544
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:49,000
put out a statement that was like you fucking design quality games for 30

2545
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fuck his healthy pop cap would put it that

2546
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,160
way but it was basically you fucking design games for 30 years that are

2547
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:59,240
quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you

2548
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:05,840
but in my opinion that statement as much as I love pop cap I love them a lot but

2549
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,880
that statement they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're

2550
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:12,760
starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this

2551
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,160
award look at the reason that look at the trends that EA has been starting

2552
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:22,040
look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you

2553
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:26,080
know obviously this whole Mass Effect thing they're taking some of the brunt

2554
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:32,120
on that EA sports games every year with no discernible difference is probably

2555
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:36,120
the exclusive contract is probably the driving force between behind trying to

2556
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:40,720
lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle you know they want that to happen

2557
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:48,240
look at origin Oh God an origin yeah not wanting to play nice with other gaming

2558
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:52,520
companies they they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live

2559
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,960
and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not

2560
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,640
putting our games out on your system and the kind of using that muscle Mass Effect

2561
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:06,840
3 isn't on Steam and you know that would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your

2562
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:12,440
golden poo yeah internet polls are very serious business clearly now there's an

2563
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:16,080
interesting follow-up to the all this stuff it isn't directly a follow-up to

2564
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,440
the same same story but there's always going to be that guy that asks what

2565
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:26,120
about all the good things EA did and to be fair EA had a couple big stories this

2566
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:30,400
week that were some good news so let's cover them one of them which I think all

2567
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:35,480
of you have got to be aware of by now but it is out there they have announced

2568
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:43,280
that there will be Mass Effect 3 extended cut Mass Effect 3 DLC extended

2569
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:47,640
cut is coming out it's going to be coming out this summer it is going to be

2570
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:52,920
providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans it's going to bring

2571
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:58,080
closure to the ending is there nice PC way of saying we're gonna fix the

2572
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:01,980
goddamn ending then fine here's the big thing about it that I got a mid even

2573
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:07,240
caught me is my surprise it's gonna be free it's gonna be free through April of

2574
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:12,120
2014 or something like that and even then they said they buy aware said they

2575
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:17,340
only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated

2576
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:21,440
and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it and it's free

2577
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:25,800
because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is

2578
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:31,140
literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the

2579
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:37,000
expositor expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that

2580
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,660
you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's not it's it's additional

2581
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:47,920
content but it's not playable some rumors going around that the voice

2582
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:53,640
actors for femshep and male Shep have not been asked to come back yet which

2583
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:58,500
implies that you know and again I got a I got a tread lightly around the ending

2584
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:04,640
here but if they're not in it then how could they really do much of an ending

2585
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:09,120
that perhaps it's just gonna be text on the screen all a text I think that's a

2586
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:12,440
little bit silly there could be some type of like third-person narration or

2587
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:16,980
something going on I could see that happening but or maybe it's gonna be

2588
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:20,220
told from somebody else's point of view like years later or something I don't

2589
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:23,780
know I think there's still a lot they could do with it that even though they

2590
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,400
don't have the voice actors back but it sounds like again the Internet's already

2591
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:32,120
not happy with it well it's it's not a new ending which is what people are

2592
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:35,740
demanding they're like throw this shit that you put in the game out give us

2593
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:39,720
something completely different but they wear that there I was like no this is

2594
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:44,560
our artistic you know point of view so it's not a different ending and it's not

2595
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,120
any new ending choices they are just fleshing out what's already there yeah

2596
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:52,240
trying to explain it more or what have you so in a way it's kind of like saying

2597
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:58,240
well it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it

2598
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:03,000
so if you didn't get it then here's we're gonna throw you a bone so what do

2599
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,760
you think about the fact that the internet got their way well they didn't

2600
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,920
they didn't I mean they're getting something else I'm actually I'm legit

2601
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,180
surprised they're doing it for free and I said a few weeks ago on the show I

2602
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:18,840
said if they don't put it out for free then they're just assholes and to my

2603
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,920
surprise they're doing it for free so I have to stand by what I said and that is

2604
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,480
that it's hard to complain about this I feel that they only really did this

2605
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:31,240
because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fist fiscal impact

2606
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:34,960
with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective

2607
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:40,040
product I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're

2608
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:44,480
throwing the Phantom of fandom a bone but you know if EA has the final say

2609
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:49,580
this is just damage control to say that they they attempted something even if

2610
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:55,340
fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they

2611
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:58,960
could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the Phantom was

2612
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:07,640
showing so as far as the fact that them them getting getting their way but they

2613
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:10,940
kind of didn't get their way they didn't they didn't I mean it's gonna be really

2614
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:13,600
hard to say until it comes out but I just I think there's gonna be a lot of

2615
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:18,960
people that still aren't happy with it imagine if the internet it was what it

2616
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:26,960
is today with Final Fantasy 7 right oh no game will ever be as hyped up or as

2617
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:33,160
anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal

2618
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:36,560
with it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or

2619
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:43,280
resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to you fee who

2620
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:49,120
feet visit what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right

2621
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:52,840
I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC though

2622
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:58,920
did you have anything to say Jason I'm just effect so I I will probably get

2623
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:03,000
around to the series eventually but yeah not yet completely missed it well here's

2624
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,680
something that impacts Mass Effect and it's and some other Bioware games it's

2625
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:11,640
something Bioware is kind of known for and Bioware obviously tells these very

2626
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:16,920
deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories and Bioware has

2627
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:22,680
been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want meaning if you

2628
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,920
want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship

2629
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:31,640
and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns

2630
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:35,840
Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti gay letter writing

2631
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:40,360
campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters

2632
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:46,400
objecting to same-sex relationships in their games the letters are being sent

2633
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:51,200
to a variety of senior leaders at EA threatening to boycott EA games until it

2634
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:56,920
changes its policy EA is standing by it say standing by their games saying they

2635
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:01,920
will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options every one of

2636
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:06,160
EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors so it's hard to believe

2637
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,840
anyone is surprised by the content this isn't about protecting children it's

2638
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,840
about political harassment that's from EA's chief spokesperson Jeff Brown

2639
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:21,760
obviously Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man woman man man woman woman woman

2640
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:27,960
alien shit you can do whatever you want in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 1 was

2641
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:32,960
originally going to have same gendered pairings but with Dragon Age Origins

2642
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,320
coming out on the horizon which had a more involved relationship system they

2643
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:40,760
cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent mm-hmm and

2644
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:45,720
Mass Effect 1 sorry to interrupt took a lot of heat from conservative funding

2645
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:50,920
groups for having sex at all and many people having a sexual machine which

2646
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:54,320
isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like nip tuck

2647
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:59,840
or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars the Old Republic is going to be

2648
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,640
having same-sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy

2649
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:08,560
with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I

2650
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:13,800
loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that

2651
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:19,440
later ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so although that is

2652
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:25,720
completely right although that is completely incest is a okay but heaven

2653
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:31,600
forbid Vader be a homo which isn't even how it works Star Wars the Old Republic

2654
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:36,200
takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that it's completely

2655
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:38,840
different and saying it should be noted same-sex relationships aren't in the

2656
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:45,920
game yet it's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game the letters

2657
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:51,920
are coming from Florida the where the Florida Family Association is at and

2658
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:57,320
again EA is standing by it but I mean they're doing these it's clearly a form

2659
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:00,920
letter and if you look at the form letters like people will hand write

2660
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:04,320
messages on them that say like remembers like look at this one there's a

2661
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,640
handwritten message here you'll get a kick out of this thank you remember

2662
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:13,760
Sodom and then it's signed I had a friend who turned into salt last week so

2663
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:20,200
that shit is real and you will not minimize that that still happens can I

2664
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:25,920
read can I read the hate mail here dear mr. Riccitello it was troubling to learn

2665
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,560
that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add

2666
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:38,000
LGBT content to Star Wars video games pressured by who they always announced

2667
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:44,000
it was going to be there I am also concerned that Bioware employees state

2668
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,960
in postings at SWTOR.com that they have been censoring deleting and banning

2669
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:53,600
forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content

2670
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:59,560
in the games children play guess what on a person's private forum the First

2671
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:05,600
Amendment does not exist for example if you're a guest in my home and you start

2672
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,960
talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's

2673
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:13,260
our guest and we invite Jason over in our house and Jason says you know I

2674
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:18,120
really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together

2675
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:23,040
what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right we're gonna we're gonna

2676
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,840
ban him right we're gonna kick him out of our house and he's not allowed to

2677
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:29,200
come here anymore obviously he wouldn't do that but I'm just he's sitting right

2678
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:32,800
there and he's an example this is the same analogy here if you come into

2679
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,680
somebody's house and say something they don't like they have every right to

2680
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:41,740
remove you you don't get a First Amendment yeah the overwhelming number

2681
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:45,880
of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as

2682
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:50,000
a captured audience to participate in homosexual content thirty-year-old

2683
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,280
children living in their parents basement whoa whoa whoa again if you're

2684
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:58,040
letting your child play an MMO unsupervised they're not getting that

2685
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:04,600
$14.99 a month themselves someone's credit card uh-huh we ask that you

2686
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,840
please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this

2687
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:16,640
type of advocacy representation in your games what EA had a policy no please do

2688
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:20,760
not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many

2689
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:27,600
children thank you remember Sodom there it I mean the facts are just being

2690
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:33,440
distorted terribly I mean that this is here's the thing about this though is

2691
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:38,160
that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games all

2692
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:44,240
together are the goddamn devil yep so there's no there's no real boycott

2693
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:49,160
happening here this is all for show it's all for press it's all for show it's

2694
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:54,160
just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates

2695
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:58,920
fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fat mr. Rogers is

2696
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:04,160
burning in hell because you know America's a fag-loving country and all

2697
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:07,080
this I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight but unfortunately I see it

2698
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:12,960
in these you know protests and things like that and it's just they do it what

2699
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:19,080
for attention for those that remember I know this isn't all that similar but

2700
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:23,920
when nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl the FCC came

2701
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:27,040
out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got it was some

2702
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:32,660
random group that was made up of 20 icky old creepy old white dudes that just had

2703
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:36,640
a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC so the the fact that

2704
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:41,400
they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public

2705
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:45,640
feels because these these are just really isolated groups telling that

2706
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:49,800
they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up

2707
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:55,360
that makes it's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to

2708
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:59,960
do with their lives they this is what they choose to do instead of going out

2709
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:05,240
into their community and choosing to do some good because what Alan and I have

2710
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:10,480
is so threatening there is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the

2711
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:18,160
gym we don't have time stop you Amy stop it anyway so it's even I love that they

2712
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:22,280
scan this in its signed I can't read that name is that homa Johnson home no

2713
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:39,760
homa Jay Lorne homa Jay Lorne dear homa Jay Lorne shut the fuck up anyhow prop

2714
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:45,160
CEA at least for standing by this whole thing because you know what I gotta say

2715
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:49,920
this even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet I spoiled myself and

2716
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:53,120
looked at some of the stuff on YouTube I've looked at all the different romance

2717
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,520
scenes I've looked at the female female I've looked at the male female I've

2718
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,160
looked at the male-male relationships and I got to tell you the male-male

2719
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:05,480
relationship that they do one of the one in particular they do in the game is so

2720
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:12,280
well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's

2721
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:17,960
not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and

2722
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:25,400
they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so

2723
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:29,860
offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what

2724
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:38,240
earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high right let's move on I'm all huffy

this has been brought up on olr yet or not but have any of you checked out the

2733
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:28,480
web series titled cron tendo it's one dude playing every single Famicom slash

2734
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:35,000
nest game release in chronological order oh my god he plays them enough to give a

2735
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,420
basic review and some history of the title needless to say it's a massive

2736
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:42,840
undertaking and worth checking out he has a YouTube channel but much more

2737
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:49,520
content is posted on the archive org site he also started a cron Sega series

2738
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:54,360
which is going through all of the master system titles in order the humor is

2739
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:58,800
pretty dry but fun to watch anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history

2740
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:04,920
or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look man some

2741
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:12,000
people have a lot of time I think it's great it's a great endeavor though I saw

2742
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,880
similar linked me to it might have been dark Sakura actually a group of let's

2743
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:21,660
play people on YouTube there's four of them they did a simultaneous battle

2744
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:25,920
toads the original that game is hard as hell it's it's on YouTube but it's quad

2745
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:30,480
screen just a competition to see who could get reach the end of the game the

2746
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:34,200
fastest and it's filled with swears because that game is hard now is very

2747
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:38,240
fun so look up about battle toads competition for that second email is

2748
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:43,840
from Stan who writes hi olr I have a question for you and anyone listening or

2749
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,640
this could be a future fool question what video game franchise would you like

2750
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:53,760
to see reimagined or translated into another genre for example the morrows

2751
02:15:53,760 --> 02:16:00,720
the Mario for example the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG yes my answer

2752
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:04,840
would be seen the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced

2753
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:09,960
in a Soul Calibur game so like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy well there was

2754
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:15,640
our guys you want to kind of stretch it a little bit I also think it'd be funny

2755
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:22,400
to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game now that's just

2756
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:29,800
silly signed Stan sent from his iPhone and he's very upset about the Instagram

2757
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:34,840
news this week no um gosh that's that's a tough one what would I like to see

2758
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:42,320
cross genres and persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from

2759
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:48,240
Alice and I was like what how about an 8-bit version of demon souls like the

2760
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:53,520
platforming game where it dials up on a modem it's just basic online no it's

2761
02:16:53,520 --> 02:17:00,880
just asshole Mario is all you guys have heard of the the the portal mod for the

2762
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:05,320
original Mario one haven't you oh yeah the Mario with the stylized oh yeah have

2763
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:08,960
you heard what the latest update is gonna be I think I heard something about

2764
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:14,480
soundtrack six player co-op now that sounds fun yeah not exactly cross genre

2765
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:19,440
unless you want to say it's portal being ported to 8-bit sidescroller that that

2766
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:25,840
yeah that question is really insanely difficult yeah my mind is just stuck in

2767
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:30,160
the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the

2768
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:34,120
first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think

2769
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:38,680
it might be my very first RPG I ever actually beat Superstar Saga was not

2770
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:43,000
half-bad partners in time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun

2771
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I mean a Disney RPG Kingdom Hearts was grand I don't I don't know that there's

2772
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,680
one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre

2773
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:57,760
though that I could really pick yeah this is a hard one especially because I

2774
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,320
didn't really think about it beforehand like I'm trying to look through my game

2775
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:03,000
collection right now and see if anything jumps out of my eye is like something

2776
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:08,260
I'd want different Alan did anything come to mind for you at all I'm still

2777
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:11,600
thinking about it I have some great comments from chat oh let's hear some of

2782
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:42,160

2783
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:46,160

2785
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:58,800
talking about Mario franchises Call of Duty Oh a first for our head shot

2786
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:07,040
against Princess Peach how about Mass Effect as a more fantasy RPG like with

2787
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,080
hit points and shit instead of the whole like first person although I gotta say I

2788
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:15,480
do I don't know shows Shepard arrives on this hit L and pulls out a gun blade not

2789
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:19,880
that crazy but I don't know that I gotta admit I'm not much of a first-person

2790
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:23,320
shooter type person but the map the combat Mass Effect is pretty darn good I

2791
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,400
guess I really wouldn't change it I did hear though they were doing that legit

2792
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:29,160
first-person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would've been kind of fun to

2793
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:34,240
play I think yeah us to move the music game as an RPG kind of dance summit

2794
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:40,360
style yeah cuz you got kitty Ann and then you know she could cast spells

2795
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:46,040

2801
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:32,800
it's the part of the show where we get angsty

2802
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:38,480
I'll start tonight fu to that people that are sending those letters to EA

2803
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:42,480
there's so many reasons to hate EA but that's not one of them that's one of the

2804
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:47,280
reasons to appreciate what they're doing so F you to all of them F you to sheep

2805
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:52,880
F you to people that are sheep because that's who those type of people are are

2806
02:20:52,880 --> 02:21:01,000
sheep so think for yourselves F you to sheep Alan I guess F you to the fact

2807
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,720
that I had a job interview two weeks ago and I didn't get it you know shit happens

2808
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:10,800
it's good to have an interview but also while I was trekking home from that

2809
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:15,000
interview for the job I didn't get I was completely done up in a suit dress shoes

2810
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,720
you know interview attire rolled my ankle on uneven pavement and completely

2811
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:25,920
ate shit on the sidewalk hilarious I'm sure should be on YouTube if anyone had

2812
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:29,400
a camera going out so yeah F you to I guess not getting a job and being a

2813
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:35,520
klutz in the middle public F you did not having a job and needing a new pair of

2814
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:38,720
pants now yeah nobody to buy it throw the pants out because the road roush was

2815
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:44,080
so bad it ripped all in it do you have anything Jason F you to myself for

2816
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:49,800
forgetting how to get out of a door of a car I have this really nasty gash on the

2817
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:53,960
right side of my head because I apparently when I grabbed my bag in turn

2818
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:57,160
to get out of the backseat of a car I leaned forward and just completely

2819
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:01,240
knocked the corner of the door it hurt a whole hell of a lot and it looks pretty

2820
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:06,320
nasty and it feels kind of nasty but anti F you to immune systems and the

2821
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:10,880
ability to recover from that and I think there was another thing something about

2822
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:15,800
keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here but I think I think

2823
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,000
the injury made me forget it so I guess I don't have it right now if anyone asks

2824
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:23,600
story though if anyone asks someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit

2825
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,360
out of them and that's the little mark or tell him it's a sex injury let him

2826
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:31,520
try to figure it out I think I was coming up with some kind of I I tried to

2827
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:35,400
participate I was a casted for the role of something and face-off and that was

2828
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:39,280
the suspicion mark they tested to see how how good my face bar fight bar fight

2829
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:42,960

2834
02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:00,240
we can talk to them about PAX East because we all ignorant because we

2835
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:04,600
weren't there so we need the ol army to help us out especially the New Yorkers

2836

for now a few more stories for you guys Jason miss explosion man is finally

2838
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:18,240
making it to iOS more specifically explosion man of any form is finally

2839
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:21,800
making it to iOS which will arrive this summer you may remember a couple months

2840
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:27,040
ago Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Max explosion

2841
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:31,300
that came out on iOS and there was a little a little a little kerfuffle

2842
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:35,520
between the two studios Capcom and twisted pixel twisted pixel says well

2843
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:40,180
you know Capcom made Megaman so I guess it's not all that bad and drama ceased

2844
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:44,920
very quickly miss explosion man was obviously the hit sequel to the original

2845
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:49,440
explosion man both Xbox Live arcade titles miss explosion man is heading to

2846
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:54,160

2849
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:10,520

2850
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:14,140
about this game that I'm about to talk about and it's kind of sad when you get

2851
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:18,560
more excited about the portable version of a game then the console version of a

2852
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:23,840
game but you I have legit reason for this guy's epic Mickey of course is

2853
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:27,340
getting epic Mickey 2 on the consoles which you know is all fine and dandy

2854
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:33,400
whatever still we right we Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 okay so good for them

2855
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:41,480
stepping it up but on the 3ds Disney epic Mickey power of illusion oh yes

2856
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:47,240
it's what it sounds like it's a basic I don't want to say a sequel to but

2857
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:54,920
heavily inspired by castle of illusion oh my god that game was gorgeous for its

2858
02:24:54,920 --> 02:25:00,320
day and a really amazing platformer oh my god and now it's gonna be on the 3ds

2859
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:05,840
and it's going to incorporate yet you get to draw objects that magically

2860
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,960
transform into Disney style 2d illustrations and then they're gonna be

2861
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:15,240
3d on the 3ds is top screen blah blah blah but it gets its influence from a

2862
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:20,080
lot of modern-day Disney movies like Tangled is gonna have a level and yeah

2863
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:24,880
I'm so excited about this Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can

2864
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:31,440
see I mean it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it no Tron no sale

2865
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:36,120
you never know you never know Peter Pan Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game

2866
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:43,320
coming out dreamed up distance so it just looks gorgeous I'm so excited like

2867
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:47,260
I could care less now about the console one just bring me that 3ds game you guys

2868
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:53,840
is a 3ds game I'm excited about yeah it's not just a port a 3d port of a

2869
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:57,720
client of a good classic game like Zelda Rama in the chat room put it best I

2870
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:02,560
can't say it any better myself shut up and take my money

2871
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:11,200
amen Allen so this story is a doozy wow I'm not sure how to report this I guess

2872
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:15,640
I wanted you to do this for a reason I guess the state of Arizona just looked

2873
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:19,760
at Florida is the worst state of in the country and was like no we have to do

2874
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:24,760
better and and for the last seven or eight years they have been okay so this

2875
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:30,720
story is about a bill that has passed the both sides of the state legislature

2876
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:36,520
so it's ready to be signed by the governor and it's the anti trolling

2877
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:41,280
cyberbullying bill is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of reminds

2878
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:47,280
you a Cruella de Vil like I'm not sure he's the one who put her finger in the

2879
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:50,960
face of Obama yeah yeah just like don't doesn't she remind you of Cruella de

2880
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:54,120
Vil a little bit like I'm not trying to get political or whatever and I'm not

2881
02:26:54,120 --> 02:27:00,780
it's it's just she's kind of nasty anyway sorry didn't mean to derail you

2882
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:04,160
yeah so it passed both houses it's waiting for the governor to sign it a

2883
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:11,720
governor Brewer and basically if let me read exactly what the the statute

2884
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:18,880
dictates it is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify intimidate

2885
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:26,680
threaten harass annoy or offend to use any electronic or digital device digital

2886
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:31,560
device and use any obscene lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or

2887
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:36,920
lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property

2888
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:42,480
of any person so you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient

2889
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:47,420
is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you it could be a class one I

2890
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:54,040
think misdemeanor which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and

2891
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:58,020
up to six months in jail is that the right direction that the receiver has to

2892
02:27:58,020 --> 02:28:02,280
be in Arizona I kind of figured it would have been the cinder the origin oh that

2893
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:09,080
that is actually addressed here let me find it sorry yeah come arrest me

2894
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:15,320
Arizona sucks what are you gonna do about it there are already exceptions to

2895
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:19,040
the First Amendment which is freedom of speech which is which is obscene and

2896
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:24,480
obscenity is very vague and also inciting violence site like saying this

2897
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:27,960
person should get beat up let's all meet at the place in time that's inciting

2898
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:32,040
violence but just being an asshole on the internet you know think of the penny

2899
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:37,800
arcade greater internet theory have you ever read the comments to a story on

2900
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:47,620
yahoo news oh my god they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight I'm fucking

2901
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:52,000
serious go read the comments to any story on yahoo news story any of them or

2902
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,360
the answers on yahoo answers it could be a story about like fluffy kitties and

2903
02:28:56,360 --> 02:29:00,960
dogs and it'll be like that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama

2904
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:05,760
dog because Obama's ugly and all like this this is what oh my god I gotta go

2905
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:10,000
to yahoo news right now and give you an idea what I mean here a whole new level

2906
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,360
of quality for the show huh this is important because yes and this is this

2907
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:20,440
is how it ties into the gaming world because of course what did gamers love

2908
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:26,360
to do more than anything troll be shitty to each other with no consequences which

2909
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:30,760
I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like

2910
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:36,040
many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like

2911
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:39,040
a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's

2912
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:42,960
unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's

2913
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:47,280
constitutional not for years and eventually goes away so already you know

2914
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,780
people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is

2915
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:54,280
enforceable and blah blah blah and call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal

2916
02:29:54,280 --> 02:30:00,040
in this state but the text of the the text of this bill is it's one of those

2917
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:04,160
things like for some reason there have been these weird weird quirk grammar

2918
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:10,120
stories in the news lately notably talking about the the talking about a

2919
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:14,720
the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new

2920
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:20,880
iPad so if anybody says I want the iPad 3 no you want a the new iPad but you you

2921
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:24,560
read you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me

2922
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:29,280
immediately was it is unlawful for any for any person with intent intimidate

2923
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:36,180
blah blah blah to use a any electronic or digital device it is unlawful for any

2924
02:30:36,180 --> 02:30:43,080
person to use a any electric or digital device is one little letter I don't I

2925
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:47,160
don't mean to like narrow in on this but it's just kind of like the language

2926
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:50,360
already sucks but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn

2927
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:56,400
sense come on guys so if I write something rude on the side of a toaster

2928
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:02,560
incentive trolling here's I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're

2929
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:07,480
trolling you are now a wanted criminal in Arizona since the bill stipulates

2930
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:12,600
that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil that basically puts the

2931
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:19,400
entire internet on notice according to this article so if the infraction

2932
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:25,080
allegedly is it is viewable within Arizona which of course Facebook last I

2933
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:29,840
check doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona maybe they should now that'll

2934
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:34,200
make the people in Arizona really happy Google already block YouTube in Arizona

2935
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:38,680
yet yeah that'll probably be in next week's stories we out so if the

2936
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:44,820
infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network then you I guess

2937
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:48,720
according to this bill have the right to try and prosecute the narrow mindedness

2938
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:55,360
of something that in their dream little world could affect to the whole freaking

2939
02:31:55,360 --> 02:32:03,960
world another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing proof

2940
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:09,040
if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a

2941
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,020
person then that would bring it up to a class 3 felony and there's a whole

2942
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:18,480
additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this I guess

2943
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:24,400
it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying which I do believe kids

2944
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:28,320
have killed kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this

2945
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:33,400
page that someone is you know a fat slut on Facebook that's shitty and parents

2946
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:37,440
and teachers should get involved so cyberbullying sucks but an anti trolling

2947
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:42,640
bill is not the way to go about it at least not the way it's written so some

2948
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:46,640
sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins

2949
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:51,560
which I guess a lot but here let me give you an example here's a story on

2950
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:58,360
President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy Passover Easter so what's the harm

2951
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:01,560
in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe

2952
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:06,920
it right nothing wrong with that right let's see

2953
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:13,280
Jack Haynes says Obama stop lying we know you're a secret Muslim Bob Harvey

2954
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:18,960
says Muslim use a fabric Bob Harvey says I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I

2955
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:24,000
vote for this egotistical clueless inept narcissist there actually is a story

2956
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,680
about a dead politician beating an alive one Jack Van Valen says did he get the

2957
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:36,840
okay from the Muslim Brotherhood like and the thing if you if you are

2958
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:43,960
Republican Democrat whatever I don't I don't care you Romney Obama just don't

2959
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:48,920
fucking vote for Rick Santorum seriously oh my god like that I draw the fucking

2960
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:53,880
line at that asshole but I mean he is the president scroll up what's the

2961
02:33:53,880 --> 02:34:00,080
headline again Obama wishes President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy

2962
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:05,000
Passover Easter the White House Christmas card from this most recent

2963
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,600
December was I think their cat or their dog I don't remember what fucking pet

2964
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:13,760
they have it just said happy holidays that's it no Merry Christmas or Hanukkah

2965
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:17,160
or anything happy holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity and the

2966
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:22,400
Christians flipped their shit now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover

2967
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:32,320
some Christian sorry flip their shit yes so it's yeah can't win for losing any

2968
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:38,560
how it's okay if you're Muslim all right now that Christian or at you can't we

2969
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:42,840
all just get along holidays of advertising past all right now only if

2970
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:51,920
you're in Arizona all right look less politics more gaming stories Jason help

2971
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:58,600
with well I guess it's not exactly politics but cute childish I owe cute

2972
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:04,760
iOS app childhoods end back online after pedo bear mix-up Apple was worried it

2973
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:09,160
might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles essentially what this boils

2974
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:12,960
down to is that there was a tower defense game called childhoods end which

2975
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:21,760
featured large bears converging on the point where you would die in a tower

2976
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:26,480
defense scenario and the developer submitted an update and the one

2977
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:31,840
particular Apple the one particular App Store reviewer got a hold of it and said

2978
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:37,840
why is pedal bear advancing on a childhood game and they they sent the

2979
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:41,840
developer a notice that they will need to take extended time they will be they

2980
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:45,480
will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed

2981
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:49,000
that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern

2982
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,460
and caution over the subject matter I've never heard of this app before and I

2983
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:57,760
looked at a I looked at a lot of stuff about it but perhaps one of the things

2984
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:01,960
that doesn't exactly help why were you so interested in a pedo bear app I'm

2985
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:09,000
just researching the story the description of the app says use your

2986
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:13,800
wits and tactics to guide big Phil along his quest in this engrossing defense

2987
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:19,320
game with towers join big Phil now and help him navigate his adolescence as he

2988
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:23,760
fights off the evil teddy bears of his childhood your tactical skills and with

2989
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:27,560
a little bit of luck is all big Phil needs to see him through his teenage

2990
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:33,960
years not exactly the childish that you would expect but you know you know

2991
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:39,360
what's in a name there's a couple things coming out about the this article I

2992
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:43,080
haven't exactly understood what exactly this is but they put a there's a

2993
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:49,680
screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of pedo bear and saying of

2994
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:53,160
course the image is broken now so I can't recite it off but it's it's it's

2995
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:57,160
drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear you will see it in almost any

2996
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:02,280
American child's home that has stuffed animals why is this a big deal I mean we

2997
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:06,120
know why it's a big deal but this particular version just makes no sense

2998
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:11,600
the the game was subtly changed the art for the bear was changed a little bit

2999
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:18,720
at the update resubmitted and I believe it's been approved at this point now

3000
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:25,360
Peter bear free yeah if one of those things said it's a silly situation for

3001
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:31,200
something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so man you know one

3002
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:35,000
more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show

3003
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,480
couldn't go any further down the toilet I think this news story is kind of like

3004
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:46,040
it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this

3005
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:51,040
guy can't be fucking serious I'll go governor Brewer well the arrest this

3006
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:57,640
man it is who did this it was Camille german pres I'm sorry if I butchered

PAX East this is your third PAX East where does this rank because I was

3047
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:53,160
reading some negative negativities on Twitter the negativities are probably

3048
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:55,720
coming from the people that were complaining about the fact it was the

3049
02:41:55,720 --> 02:42:00,040
same weekend as anime Boston hey look people if you gone to more than five to

3050
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:03,240
six anime conventions in a year it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming

3051
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:07,280
convention which was a hell of a lot better just just please shower while

3052
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:10,380
you're at the convention that's all we ask I actually at the game you can at

3053
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:18,920
this one there was a lot of showering there was very little confunk laughing

3054
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:23,700
because act-deaf in the chat room the pee and poo dolls might be out of stock

3055

3073
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:06,920

different from last year's where it was front a lot mega Rana came Murdoch they

3082
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:48,480
pretty much discussed the history of hip-hop nerdcore how it came together

3083
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:55,040
last year mega had discussed more about how he got into it his backstory this

3088
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:19,800
Metroid metal and this was my first time listening to them and I was like wow the

3089
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:26,440
best way I can describe Metroid metal is this take Metallica India prime at plus

3090
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:30,960

3146
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:46,200
for your birthday cake and pinkberry that sounds doable I think we could do

3147
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:55,320
that yeah because well I mean I'm doing a something this Friday but I you know

3148
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:58,880

3149
02:50:58,880 --> 02:51:03,960
exactly make it last you only get one a year so make it last for a month exactly

3150
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:11,000

3151
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:16,260
thinking about having a pie party I'm thinking about it pie is awesome so I

3152
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:19,960

Dave & Buster's and I drink until I bar for something I don't know I hope you

02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:27,440
feel better in time for that to come around I hope this doesn't like stick

3155
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:33,600
around for a week no it's all allergies I on Thursday I played over I was over

3156
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:39,360
at Becky's house playing with her son in the backyard that was very grassy very

3157
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:44,840
allergic to grass and I started stuffing up like right after that and Friday I

3158
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:49,680
was just sniffy got a sniffy over and then started hacking so that's why I

3159
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:58,720
have no voice better huh I hope you feel better thank you I am all right and I

3160
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:03,000
hope you're not too mad I changed the classic game of the week no bitch all

3161
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:07,880
right I kind of expected it cuz honestly I you know I would have been

3162
02:52:07,880 --> 02:52:11,880
disappointed if I didn't get to do the one I wanted exactly so we'll hear that

3163
02:52:11,880 --> 02:52:15,240
in two weeks when we come back with OLR anything else you want to let the

listeners know before we let you go pass out from Robitussin I'm not gonna pass

3168
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:43,680
you're on orange on radio who's this so Shane hi Shane what's up I'm playing

3169
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:47,240
World of Warcraft that's what's up did you go to PAX East this weekend I

3170
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:53,880
totally didn't so why are you calling I don't know why are you calling you you

3171
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:57,280
called us what do you want what's on what's on your mind um I wanted to

3172
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:01,520
respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever

3173
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:06,520
uh-huh I totally after reading EA statement that they put out I felt

3174
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:12,160
really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because

3175
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:17,920
they were just way too loud and they should not have you know beaten Bank of

3176
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:22,080
America of all people you do realize in their statement they need like they said

3177
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:26,640
well at least it wasn't Halliburton or did it and yeah they named like three of

3178
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:31,320
the prior winners of the contest I didn't know their prior winners but

3179
02:53:31,320 --> 02:53:35,760
still I don't I don't think they should have even come close to winning I think

3180
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:39,440
there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw and they're like half a

3181
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:44,200
picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site like I think I

3182
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:48,240
saw a Best Buy up there which they deserve to be up there I think I saw I

3183
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:52,680
think I saw AT&T which deserved to be up there here's the thing though here's the

3184
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:57,560
thing does it really matter it's just the internet it's a poll on the internet

3185
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:01,680
no honestly I guess it's publicity and you know the whole saying about

3186
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:07,740
publicity and stuff and it's never bad blah blah blah well right after we

3187
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:10,740
reported on that we turned around and talked about a couple good things that

3188
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:14,120
EA is doing and I'm sure you have opinions on these so first yes the Mass

3189
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:20,480
Effect 3 ending um I'm torn I appreciate what they're doing it's still not what I

3190
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:25,380
would like but one of the writers clarified some things this week on

3191
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:31,200
Twitter and it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from

3192
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:36,640
the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that but

3193
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:40,520
you know that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things

3194
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:43,360
you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been

3195
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:51,040
going so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me

3196
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:55,360
though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible

3197
02:54:55,360 --> 02:55:03,600
request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though um

3198
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:09,320
yes what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and

3199
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:15,200
just make a new story and keep it going cuz I am not done with Shepard or any of

3200
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:21,000
my crew members even the ones that may or may not have died in 3 and so you're

3201
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:26,240
trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with yes especially Caden

3202
02:55:26,240 --> 02:55:32,320
and you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4 no no but better romance scenes would

3203
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:38,280
be nice because it's it's like you know maybe a ten-year-old came up with them

3204
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:43,120
and they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing

3205
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:48,040
and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often well

3206
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:51,360
wait a minute though okay let's get into the other story which is about the whole

3207
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:55,280
target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign so you've you've

3208
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:59,120
obviously romanced Kaidan with your with your man Shep so your benefits yeah

3209
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:06,320
you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game a do you think

3210
02:56:06,320 --> 02:56:11,280
this campaign means anything no it's just something for that stupid

3211
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:17,240
organization to do this week cuz they pick something new every week and B well

3212
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:22,880
you kind of like showed me these scenes that you know the the man-on-man with

3213
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:28,200
Kaidan and all that and how well done they were well they're well done well

3214
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:33,520
okay wait wait let me back up the romance scene is not well done once you

3215
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:38,560
get into the romance part but like the date scene and the conversations they

3216
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:44,400
have brilliant because I aware for the most part can write amazingly well but

3217
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:49,440
they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes cuz Dragon Age that was

3218
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:53,540
laughable I didn't see Mass Effect 1 I didn't do anything in two because you

3219
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:58,440
know saving myself for Kaidan and in three it's like let me get pushed down

3220
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:02,360
on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh

3221
02:57:02,360 --> 02:57:05,680
we're under covers now and we're sleeping okay but it's not like they're

3222
02:57:05,680 --> 02:57:14,060
gonna get porno on you you know but it was also more like can't spoil things it

3223
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:22,100
was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with

3224
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:29,360
another crew member that isn't romantic at all wrestling well there's like a

3225
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:34,340
like a little sparring match that's kind of what it reminded me of except we had

3226
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:41,660
no pants all right pants in the sparring match all right but but otherwise I

3227
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:45,880
mean it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any

3228
02:57:45,880 --> 02:57:51,080
other video game wouldn't you say probably more interesting you know the

3229
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:54,320
male male or female female stuff we've seen in other games which has been

3230
02:57:54,320 --> 02:58:00,400
remarkably little but I'm sure in other games there have been better male female

3231
02:58:00,400 --> 02:58:06,680
romance scenes because I assume that the developers are probably straight and

3232
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:10,200
have more experience with that like they couldn't just load up like a porn

3233
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:14,200
website okay that is pretty blanket statement to make though I mean there's

3234
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:17,840
probably hundreds of people that work at Bioware I'm sure there's a couple people

3235
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:22,040
there that have some you know first-hand experience well I'm saying the ones that

3236
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:26,960
that designed the scene not that worked there period gotcha sure they're like

3237
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:31,280
three all right uh Shane I gotta let you go to get some more calls you have

3238
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:36,360
anything else you want to say mmm oh you should go download the rest of your

3239
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:39,840
download content for Mass Effect 2 because the shadow brokers what I did

3240
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:45,480
today that $10 one and it was amazing it was so so good right now except I spent

3241
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:49,680
all my points on that pinball arcade game well go buy more points one more

3242
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:54,960
problem solved holy crap I gotta let you go bye now bye bye all right one eight

3243
02:58:54,960 --> 02:59:01,280
seven seven game olr excuse me or username on skype is orange lounge radio

3244
02:59:01,280 --> 02:59:05,480
acidic vampire in our chat room says the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in

3245
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:11,400
Mass Effect 3 but the after romance scene is quite touching bonds double o

3246
02:59:11,400 --> 02:59:15,880
six says enchanted arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 that has tons of guy on

3247
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:20,240
guy action I vaguely remember that but I don't remember having tons I just

3248
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:22,760
remember being one of the first but anyway we have more calls coming in so

3249
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:29,080
let's get to them hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on

3250
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:36,640
orange launch radio we can't hear you hello oh no I heard it it's click hello

3252
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:44,880
zenocore from the OKC how you guys doing hey how you doing zenocore see I knew

3253
02:59:44,880 --> 02:59:47,320
you knew how to work your Skype it's had to be something like that all right

3254
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:52,220
what's on your mind buddy and not much of it I purchased Arkham City finally

3255
02:59:52,220 --> 02:59:56,320
because I said screw it I'm not gonna get any DLC anyway and it's ruined

3256
02:59:56,320 --> 02:59:59,920
gaming for me now I can't play half the other games because it's not as

3257
02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:04,000
satisfying but I'm sitting knocked everything out of Barbara I can't play

3258
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:09,560
Skyrim now because the combat sucks I can't play dragon aids I can't play half

3259
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:13,000
the RPGs I got anymore because the combat just does nothing whatsoever

3260
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:16,880
Arkham City is just that fucking good like it raised the bar that high that

3261
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:20,780
now everything else sucks asylum is better than that I mean the only thing

3262
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:25,840
that holds a candle to it as far as a RPG like environment I'm not counting

3263
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:29,200
Mass Effect because it's a first-person shooter is mountain blade of all the

3264
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:33,400
things that's the guts they got the most visceral hand-to-hand combat that I know

3265
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:37,240
of in an RPG like setting and that's a conquest game so technically doesn't

3266
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:40,840
even count and it's very disappointing to me is it just the combat that you

3267
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:44,160
love about Arkham City or what is it about this game that makes it so great

3268
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:50,000
it well I guess just the way it goes you actually feel like you're really whooping

3269
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,800
ass I mean everybody knows this about Arkham City in Arkham Asylum anyway this

3270
03:00:53,800 --> 03:00:58,160
isn't new news but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet

3271
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:05,720
is freaking annoying to me I mean I finally upgraded my POS computer to

3272
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:09,280
something that's near top of the line I play Arkham City and I can't play half

3273
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:14,560
the other action action or RPG games on it because they all suck as far as that

3274
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:17,840
it's all I'm doing is clicking the mouse at least in Batman you're somewhat

3275
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:22,580
managing things and using multiple weapons all at once I mean you hell when

3276
03:01:22,580 --> 03:01:25,640
they did added that stuff with Catwoman's like holy shit this is fun as

3277
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:30,040
hell just beating people to death little whip but it is it is really it's just

3278
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,720
it's funny to hear you say how much it's just ruined everything else because it's

3279
03:01:34,720 --> 03:01:40,160
so good I know it man I never thought I'd be in this position so I just blew

3280
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:45,400
almost a thousand bucks on this machine and I've gone back to playing like Space

3281
03:01:45,400 --> 03:01:49,040
Harrier 2 on the on the Sega emulator I got off of Steve and everything else

3282
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:53,440
just because nothing after I start after about 10-15 minutes I got to put it down

3283
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:59,460
because it's not as good as Arkham City or I look oh my god so what about the

3284
03:01:59,460 --> 03:02:07,280
rumors of Arkham world I'm not paying attention to those we'll see but that

3285
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:11,580
combat engine is unique it's not gonna work in anything that's that large

3286
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:16,620
because it's tied to together like the combat from like a way back when from

3287
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:20,800
the game Oh knee when that first came out of ps2 that combat system was

3288
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:23,760
amazing but the way they built it you couldn't do anything else with it there

3289
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:27,280
is no multiplayer ready thing because the way they glued it together so I

3290
03:02:27,280 --> 03:02:32,320
think Arkham City and Arkham asylum that style of gameplay is gonna be stuck in

3291
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:38,280
that have you checked out any of the DLC yet I'm not going to Robin Nightwing

3292
03:02:38,280 --> 03:02:44,520
whatever all I need is a big bad cat woman and I'm good that's interesting I

3293
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:47,000
don't know why but I find that very interesting that even though you love

3294
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:50,640
the game so much you're like man don't really need to do the DLC cuz like for

3295
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:54,880
me like I I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point

3296
03:02:54,880 --> 03:03:02,600
just because I'm getting so into this you know Mass Effect DLC Jesus man what

3297
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:07,480
a what a racket that was have you played the Mass Effect DLC and no because my

3298
03:03:07,480 --> 03:03:13,000
roomy he bought the game run it released and he was gonna ruin it for me so after

3299
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:17,720
seeing what actually were rewards you get it's like beating Rygar but not

3300
03:03:17,720 --> 03:03:21,960
doing it in an old-school way the old-school Rygar ending was something

3301
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:25,640
you got because you fucking earned it everybody can get to the ending in this

3302
03:03:25,640 --> 03:03:29,720
game and it's gonna be a piece of shit so why bother oh my god pay for it

3303
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:32,920
that's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish like

3304
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:37,440
your event yeah my car was two screens and one of them has some animation on

3305
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:41,000
that's it but that game was so freaking hard you're glad to see that screen

3306
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:45,680
because you do not not many people get to see it but seriously yes but uh and

3307
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:48,720
then they're just gonna slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the

3308
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:53,000
explaining the ending apparently so they're not gonna actually make it to

3309
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:56,400
where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without

3310
03:03:56,400 --> 03:04:00,560
making a single choice at the end which ruins the whole experience for me so

3311
03:04:00,560 --> 03:04:05,400
now they're not getting any my money for that series anyway all right any last

3312
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:08,600
thoughts before we let you go tonight Xenocore yeah the dark Sakura let that

this yeah hey Zaku what's up yeah me and uh Adam your Ron was you after the

3323
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:06,960
column we all went to packs together hell we even room together nice how was

3324
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:14,120
it how'd you enjoy PAX East it was uh was it was almost a almost the same as

3325
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:19,560
um last year in terms of crowds like like Friday was just like the heaviest

3326
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:25,440
day like just trying to try my luck in in watching these trailers or playing

3327
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:30,840
some of these games there were like at least two two hours plus in line it

3328
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:35,640
wasn't even worth it what I did do was just hit up most of the panel though

3329
03:05:35,640 --> 03:05:40,320
stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday when they actually explained

3330
03:05:40,320 --> 03:05:45,920
the whole process is to how rock band blitz became actually got it gone about

3331
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:51,920
like it actually started off as a prototype and you know within this was a

3332
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:56,820
prototype that was done within the course of a at least three years even

3333
03:05:56,820 --> 03:06:01,680
though it didn't pick up full steam until that last summer so it basically

3334
03:06:01,680 --> 03:06:07,200
went through several iterations where you know it for example the they

3335
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:11,680
actually they did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls

3336
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:18,000
seeing that they they propose so many so many ideas and solutions that most of

3337
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:21,480
them ended up failing until they found the one that worked which is basically

3338
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:28,200
either the joystick using the the D pads and the buttons or the shoulders just to

3339
03:06:28,200 --> 03:06:33,040
just to hit both notes and then the whole notion of having whether or not to

3340
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:37,440
make it just like like frequency and amplitude in terms of a shifting you

3341
03:06:37,440 --> 03:06:41,360
from one instrument to another automatically so it deviates from that

3342
03:06:41,360 --> 03:06:47,440
in the sense that you can just play any you could stick with one completely like

3343
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:51,480
I tried it today and I was I was pretty much bouncing from one one track to the

3344
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:56,640
other within the song so you know coupled with the fact that you could

3345
03:06:56,640 --> 03:07:01,160
just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you as you obviously hit more notes

3346
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:05,000
then it just basically it's almost like audio surf but in the sense that

3347
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:11,480
everything's structured more importantly everything is um it just said it's just

3348
03:07:11,480 --> 03:07:16,040
binary in the sense wait did they have to have audio surf too on the floor no

3349
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:21,000
no no that wasn't there I'm pretty certain prime will probably that depends

3350
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:26,760
if they the developers of get get themselves a booth for prime but back to

3351
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:31,800
the point it's like like back in the days of amplitude it was pretty much the

3352
03:07:31,800 --> 03:07:37,520
same way but it's the fact that the songs themselves of rock are like a rock

3353
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:41,680
nature where it's not like techno and this is one of the questions that was

3354
03:07:41,680 --> 03:07:46,960
brought up in the panel I guess they're there the rationale was in the it's

3355
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:52,240
easier to just you know release a product in which on day one people who

3356
03:07:52,240 --> 03:07:57,840
have existing rock band users and consumers could just you know start

3357
03:07:57,840 --> 03:08:01,120
playing right away with their with their current with their current collection

3358
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:07,320
whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into a into that

3359
03:08:07,320 --> 03:08:12,800
rock band caliber like a techno trance on that was made you know that and made

3360
03:08:12,800 --> 03:08:18,000
frequency and amplitude pretty much a you know called classic then it would

3361
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:22,360
just like folks have to start over from scratch let me let me try to get away

3362
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:25,360
from the rock band stuff for a minute we've seen so much about it on the

3363
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:29,200
internet what other panels did you get to all right the other all right other

3364
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:36,400
ones I like let me see the Kotaku panel that was on Friday where everyone

3365
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:41,280
everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour so I just threw out one

3366
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:48,400
little question in terms of a sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku if you

3367
03:08:48,400 --> 03:08:52,040
were like really in the in the site you would actually know like all their

3368
03:08:52,040 --> 03:08:55,800
sections like how they how they have their own blocks of stories they let

3369
03:08:55,800 --> 03:09:00,080
anyone have a panel they clearly are letting anyone have a panel so I want to

3370
03:09:00,080 --> 03:09:05,360
know our panel at PAX Prime yeah but that was that folks writing stories

3371
03:09:05,360 --> 03:09:09,920
within the hour and actually you know they actually they had a little work

3372
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:15,640
actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or or or actually

3373
03:09:15,640 --> 03:09:20,360
taking pictures and so forth it was even live blogging that's productive open the

3374
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:24,880
floor back up to the people dance on a website yeah I mean did they suck their

3375
03:09:24,880 --> 03:09:31,040
own dick in front of all you guys too no it's like they were just alright they

3376
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:35,200
what happened was like the the editors or actually the former editor of Kotaku

3377
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:40,360
was was spearheading the panel so the idea was that folks who just like pitch

3378
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:47,700
their their story ideas and the audience the the audience would actually pick the

3379
03:09:47,700 --> 03:09:53,080
ones that that they would want to they would want to hear about and within that

3380
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:57,920
hour they would have to actually produce it you know write an article for it did

3381
03:09:57,920 --> 03:10:03,800
they have a big on the site and did somebody judge people yeah the editors

3382
03:10:03,800 --> 03:10:08,080
obviously the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there

3383
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:12,400
all right no no disrespect but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panels

3384
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:17,000
tell me about our other one all right the other one was caught the tail end of

3385
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:24,600
the epic panel where cliffy be basically we're just going off on sir you know for

3386
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:29,520
questions in the audience one of which was a you know a girl actually trolled

3387
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:34,680
the whole panel is in saying that you know she wants to see Gears of War on

3388
03:10:34,680 --> 03:10:39,880
PlayStation 3 and to which cliffy replied he will if they fix the you know

3389
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:46,520
they fix that god that weak rumble the ps3 controller and then she was promptly

3390
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:50,760
arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel all right but the

3391
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:56,160
last one I caught was a was basically a classic arcade panel like you have no

3392
03:10:56,160 --> 03:11:00,780
interest in penny art you know packs they have they have an actual classic

3393
03:11:00,780 --> 03:11:06,560
arcade room like nothing but old arcade machines good I love that were the folks

3394
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:11,240
from the from a cam the American classic arcade museum actually they ran the

3395
03:11:11,240 --> 03:11:15,520
panel with with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original like

3396
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:21,880
the original older arcade titles one of which was a food fight and miss pac-man

3397
03:11:21,880 --> 03:11:27,640
and then the other the third one was he was a developer for a crew for the

3398
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:32,280
cruising series as they were going through how back in the day they were

3399
03:11:32,280 --> 03:11:38,440
like they basically started off from their dorm dorm rooms at MIT to the

3400
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:42,800
point where they they made they made mod kits for their for existing arcade

3401
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:47,440
arcade cabs like one like one for missile command that actually extended

3402
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:52,400
the gameplay but in the sense that you know you would get more revenue because

3403
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:55,640
the the challenges would be harder you wouldn't be playing the same thing and

3404
03:11:55,640 --> 03:11:59,760
with your guy with a with a single quarter and sheer sheer skill could just

3405
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:04,280
like stay there for hours on end so you know it gets to the point where they get

3406
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:08,880
to buy Atari and then they get picked up and then they start creating this pac-man

3407
03:12:08,880 --> 03:12:13,760
and to the point where it leads up to the the crash we're running long here

3408
03:12:13,760 --> 03:12:19,880
Zaku let me let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con

3409
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:25,760
certain prizes swag it's just like a free shit I mean I think I played

3410
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:30,240
battlefield 3 and a cop you know in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4

3411
03:12:30,240 --> 03:12:35,340
gig USB drive but it was just like not only that is the after party the the

3412
03:12:35,340 --> 03:12:39,760
curse party the curse is like a service site that hosts like all these forms

3413
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:43,360
like including ones for Minecraft they had a killer party with like open bar

3414
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:48,840
and everything and the whole works and that was yesterday and they're saying

3415
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:52,280
me and Adam had had ourselves a kick-ass time all right Zaku I gotta let you go

3416
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:55,040
but I'm glad you had a great time actually I'm a little jealous but I

3417
03:12:55,040 --> 03:13:00,260
guess I'm happy all right take care Zaku all right have a good one later some

3418
03:13:00,260 --> 03:13:05,760
things haven't changed all this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms I I love

3419
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:09,040
hearing the stories about the old game design though my god those guys really

3420
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:13,160
loved what they did and it's just folks that were younger than you or I am now

3421
03:13:13,160 --> 03:13:18,440
you have designed these classic classic games all right I have to close up Skype

3422
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:22,200
you guys we were running long now and I'm really sorry to those didn't get

3423

through it was lit up tonight I still haven't even touched Twitter I've got to

3424
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:28,840
quickly say we're running like so long so let me just read a few tweets here

3425
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:33,160
Rhetortainment tweeted us saying Bank of America tried to foreclose on homes in

3426
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:36,920
a state that they don't have the right to operate in how did EA win worst

3427
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:44,400
company because it's the internet lol lol lol lol dark to see you says the

3428
03:13:44,400 --> 03:13:48,640

3435
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:11,920
different platforms I think that's cool like I saw act def screenshot and

3436
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:15,640
because he's from Mexico all the Xbox stuff was in Spanish and I thought that

3437
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:20,720
was cool because I don't usually get to see that it's different let me read one

3438
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:24,180
of Tiger Claus tweets here he always sends us some great tweets I need to cut

3439
03:14:24,180 --> 03:14:27,240
it a little short tonight but I will read this one because this is about a

3440
03:14:27,240 --> 03:14:32,360
company that we talked about a lot about here on the show Activision Blizzard has

3441
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:38,080
been sued for patent infringement of virtual worlds usage due to World of

3442
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:44,680

3443

03:15:23,520 --> 03:15:26,600
don't know of them but to say they invented I've heard the name too but to

3453
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:29,900
say they they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty it's kind

3454
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:34,520
of like dude I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated

3455
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:42,160
because it's things have changed since the Revolutionary War just slightly ah

3456
03:15:42,160 --> 03:15:47,300

3457
03:15:47,300 --> 03:15:50,400

3460
03:16:01,780 --> 03:16:05,440
will say that actually as a result of this new job there's a chance I can make

these visits a little bit more regular they actually bring all of their out of

3462
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:13,960
town folks in twice a year and so uh perhaps they'll start being a better

3463
03:16:13,960 --> 03:16:18,440
occasions for me to be able to get back on this show again for more than what is

word about the show so please tell a friend or two and then maybe we can get

3481
