00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:26,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, and Loki Tonight, April 8th, 2012 Capcom responds to Better Business Bureau complaints Sex offenders get booted from Xbox Live in one state And our listeners sound off Is EA really the worst company ever?

2
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:36,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:45,450
[SPEAKER_10]: We are live for this April the 8th of 2012 with episode number 453 of our show.

5
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,792
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

6
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:52,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Not with DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, sadly.

7
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:53,576
[SPEAKER_10]: She is not here tonight.

8
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,178
[SPEAKER_10]: She had to make a last minute cancellation tonight because she's not feeling well.

9
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:58,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So we hope she feels better.

10
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,740
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got like a science fiction double feature.

11
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Techmaster Loki is not here tonight.

12
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,920
[SPEAKER_10]: He's doing Easter stuff with his Jewish wife.

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how that works.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,642
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's obviously a holiday for the family.

16
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:30,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're doing stuff with their kid and all that.

17
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:32,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no DarkSakura.

18
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:33,284
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no Loki.

19
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:35,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's me, Rob Roberts.

20
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously you can hear over there.

21
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,466
[SPEAKER_10]: My loud ass.

22
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Interrupting.

23
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:41,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, Alan.

24
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep forgetting you dropped your handle a couple weeks ago.

25
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,649
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too mouthy and wordy to say.

26
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

27
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how are you doing, Alan?

28
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:47,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good.

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been on the show in a long time.

30
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,956
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't, so I'm glad we have an opportunity to have you on again tonight.

31
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:59,863
[SPEAKER_10]: For the listeners who haven't heard you, why don't you give us a quick introduction about yourself and the types of games you like and all that.

32
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Mid-30s, been playing since the Atari 2600.

33
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Favorite console is the Super NES.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now I'm playing a lot of PC games.

35
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:19,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragon Age, Oranges, which would be weird, Mass Effect, and so on.

36
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:20,983
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

37
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:22,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And we live together, so.

38
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,204
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

39
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:26,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get to see me all the time.

40
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:26,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

41
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:28,925
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

42
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:32,186
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to have a third co-host, obviously.

43
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Entree doesn't work without three co-hosts.

44
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Insert ferret here.

45
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:36,448
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

46
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:37,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello, everybody.

47
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:43,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, by the way, to VXJasonXV, or just Jason, if you will, is back with us tonight.

48
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:59,248
[SPEAKER_08]: 3 weeks, uh, 3 weeks, quite a bit of turnaround than the 8 years that we were going on about previously I was gonna say, for somebody who lives in Denver, that's really good to be able to get to a show 3 weeks It's like I got home on the train, turned around, took another one, and hey, I'm back!

49
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is actually what happened

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,271
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,192
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I got the job offer Monday night.

52
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:28,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I took Tuesday to pack and wrap up things at home and tell my other job, Peace out, guys.

53
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on a train tomorrow.

54
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:32,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to give you two weeks notice, but that's not happening.

55
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So Monday night solidified everything.

56
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:40,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesday night, Tuesday in general, finished off everything that I needed to do.

57
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesday morning on the train, and I've been here since just after business hours on Thursday.

58
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:47,342
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

59
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:08,188
[SPEAKER_10]: So some folks might be wondering, like, well, why, okay, Rob, why would you do a show without DarkSakura and without Loki?

60
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:18,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, well, with no slight to Alan or Jason, who are fine step-in hosts tonight, but, you know, it is a little weird that there's only one of the regular OLR hosts here.

61
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,060
[SPEAKER_10]: But remember, guys, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not necessarily just about me or just about Jamie or just about Loki.

63
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about you guys.

64
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:31,043
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to make sure that we would have a show here and a place where you guys can interact and still chat with us.

65
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:38,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say, I did take some inspiration a little bit from what's going on over at Video Game Outsiders, which is another show on the All Games Network that I listen to.

66
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:45,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And poor John's been holding down the fort over there for a while because his two co-hosts have had just other stuff going on.

67
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But they still do the show every week.

68
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no reason we can't.

69
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,250
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually not going to be here next week.

70
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,951
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a pre-planned thing.

71
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:58,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So we knew that Loki would be out tonight, but we thought DarkSakura would be here.

72
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,095
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, people get sick.

73
00:04:59,155 --> 00:04:59,655
[SPEAKER_10]: That happens.

74
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:03,998
[SPEAKER_10]: But we knew we would not be here next week, and we didn't want to go two weeks in a row with no show.

75
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:08,161
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the show going tonight, and you guys can chat live with us.

76
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:15,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And Alpha Cananogram starts us off in the chat room tonight saying, Yay, weird show!

77
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:16,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yes!

78
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:17,587
Ha ha ha!

79
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:21,989
[SPEAKER_12]: More like Broringe Lounge Radio, right?

80
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show.

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years.

82
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:34,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And you played Bomani games just like DarkSakura, Loki, and I did, just at a different arcade.

83
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did.

84
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,136
[SPEAKER_10]: But you were in all that stuff.

85
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:41,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan?

86
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:43,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Alan's cool, too.

87
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:43,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

88
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,562
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan's coming with me, of course, because he does that.

90
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to the final ever electronica.

91
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, dude, dude, dude.

92
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Like 18 months or even longer now.

93
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:47,124
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably, yeah, it's been about a year and a half since that movie came out.

94
00:06:47,804 --> 00:07:00,392
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before, is that Electronica also has a replica of Flynn's Arcade from the movie with classic 80s video games that are in great condition.

95
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, it's Disneyland.

96
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:04,035
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to let shitty rundown games into their park.

97
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:09,358
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one time I have seen a broken machine there, they had a dude out there fixing it in like five seconds.

98
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:10,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

99
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,828
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go say goodbye to Electronica because they made a business decision to get rid of it because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now.

100
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:29,002
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel, although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall, so it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that, but they're replacing it with...

101
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,764
[SPEAKER_10]: with the Mad Tea Party.

102
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:37,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's tea as in just the letter T, not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime.

103
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:37,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's failed trombone?

104
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:38,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have it queued up?

105
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,657
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

106
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I can get failed trombone queued up.

107
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,000
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too late.

108
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:42,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you...

109
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're upset about the Mad Tea Party.

110
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you're personally offended, right?

111
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,663
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw that movie, and I didn't think it was going to be very good, and you were very optimistic.

112
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:01,945
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be okay, it's Tim Burton, and it was shitty.

113
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:29,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't like it at all I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all but here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up is that unfortunately with Electronica changing over to the Mad Tea Party they're going to close Flynn's Arcade now supposedly the Mad Hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade but I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80s retro games from what I hear they're supposed to be like skeeball and it's it's just it's what

114
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney Imagineers, if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea, you should fix the Bootsy Rundown arcade off of Space Mountain and put

115
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Flynn's Arcade there and it will be super awesome.

116
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:56,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

117
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And Tomorrowland's a great fit for it.

118
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:04,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just fucking bulldoze Interventions because who goes in the Interventions building like ever and just make a giant Tron grid.

119
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:08,388
[SPEAKER_10]: It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing.

120
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,863
[SPEAKER_10]: But my hope is, here's my secret hope.

121
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:15,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a secret wish, hope, pie in the sky idea.

122
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:22,552
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica, they're gonna give away some of the arcade games.

123
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,714
[SPEAKER_08]: You get an arcade machine.

124
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,375
[SPEAKER_08]: You get an arcade machine.

125
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody gets an arcade machine.

126
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:35,301
[SPEAKER_10]: In reality, that fucking won't happen because I think they're leasing them from a local company that specializes in this shit.

127
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:35,901
[SPEAKER_10]: But hold on.

128
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:36,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my idea.

129
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my pie in the sky idea.

130
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:41,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is that they're going to give away these machines.

131
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:50,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was thinking about if you could have like a retro arcade machine in your house, what arcade machine would you want to have in your house?

132
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:54,574
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house,

133
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:56,226
[SPEAKER_10]: What game would you want?

134
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,751
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a tough one because there's a lot of great games.

135
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of me wants to say Dig Dug because I'm actually pretty good at that one.

136
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:15,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of me wants to say BurgerTime because I damn near bought a... I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine not even a couple months ago.

137
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I realized I live in an apartment and that would be a really shitty idea to bring an arcade machine into the apartment.

138
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:23,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine, Alan, right?

139
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I could forego getting an iPad and a BurgerTime machine.

140
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:26,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

141
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head.

142
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:38,292
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the machine I would really, really want to have, I don't know why, it's just, is a spy hunter machine.

143
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:46,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of the racing games from that era, because they all had different variety of pedals, switches, different steering wheels.

144
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:52,962
[SPEAKER_08]: All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites from that time period, or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it.

145
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid because that's what they had.

146
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:57,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, shut up.

147
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,355
[SPEAKER_10]: It was at the local roller rink.

148
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,957
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too.

149
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,177
[SPEAKER_12]: It was that or the pizza parlor.

150
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,318
[SPEAKER_08]: You had two choices.

151
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:09,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Pizza parlor was like a sit down, either like a joust or a Galaga or something like that.

152
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,481
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the two-sided top sitting, it's probably a name for that.

153
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

154
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Cocktail cabinet.

155
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:19,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a Spy Hunter machine.

156
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last Electronica.

157
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:24,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, what arcade machine would you want?

158
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,792
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I had one in mind, and then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo, so I kind of forgot what it was entirely.

159
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:39,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just Light Cycle Tron, but one of the, I think it was like the movie Tron arcade machines.

160
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Discs of Tron.

161
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:41,818
[SPEAKER_10]: There were two Tron machines.

162
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,841
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Tron, it was just called Tron, and then there was Discs of Tron.

163
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:54,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And did that have... I think there's even a third one, because there should have been one that had the assault on the MCP and tanks.

164
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:59,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Tron was made up of four minigames, and I think you're just thinking they're all separate games.

165
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game?

166
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:02,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-mm.

167
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,783
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the minigames.

168
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the most popular one.

169
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,786
[SPEAKER_10]: There was the Light Cycle game, there's the MCP Cone, there's the tanks.

170
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:14,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I would probably say Discs of Tron just because I would not mind more time with that game.

171
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:17,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only played it like once or twice and it looked really good.

172
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:18,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very engaging.

173
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,229
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really fun.

174
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:27,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's Arcade or excuse me, have Oprah give you one, gift you one, what would you want her to give you?

175
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:41,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't think it's in Flynn's Arcade, but if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house, it would have to be multiplayer, and it would have to have large cabinets to set drinks on, and I would go with Golden Axe because that game is amazing.

176
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:44,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory.

177
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:58,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Like every time I've played Golden Axe, not to just take a crap on what Alan said, but I just... Not the shitty port that was on Genesis and is currently on XBLA or whatever, but the original arcade Golden Axe with three people is a good time.

178
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:00,182
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good memories.

179
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,343
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good memories.

180
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:02,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Goddamn that goblin.

181
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Attack faster, come on!

182
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome comments from our chatroom.

183
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:10,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com because everybody's joining in in the chatroom.

184
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:10,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Love this.

185
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:15,688
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRDollarBill says, Robotron 2084 would be his game.

186
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Hands bloody fucking down.

187
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Brad from PodCulture, love this answer.

188
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,291
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one I would want too.

189
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking Star Wars the arcade game.

190
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.

191
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely forgot about that.

192
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado and all that.

193
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I like the movies.

194
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like obsess over them.

195
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:36,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie.

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,123
[SPEAKER_10]: But the arcade game was so fucking good.

197
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:42,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the Vectrex one?

198
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:42,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

199
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that?

200
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,027
[SPEAKER_08]: There was.

201
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:53,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember how official it was, but a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement has it on a little...

202
00:13:54,582 --> 00:14:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if you won an actual arcade but then he'd be like wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here?

203
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I would tie it to the roof of my Honda.

204
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:21,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even care.

205
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:24,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Go driving down by five, catching all the bugs.

206
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim Sally says, burger time all the way.

207
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Burger time for the win.

208
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was almost there too.

209
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:38,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Stan says, Pac-Man, but the small table version where both players sit at opposite ends of each other.

210
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,073
[SPEAKER_10]: A cocktail machine.

211
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:41,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Cocktail machine.

212
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I'd love to have a cocktail machine.

213
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are hard to come by though.

214
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Cocktail machines are really sought after.

215
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:54,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive, that's the latest cocktail cabinet?

216
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,260
[SPEAKER_10]: It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines.

217
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition, but like an arcade, Pac-Man Battle Royale.

218
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:02,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember it had a funny name.

219
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's in Vegas and like New York and nowhere else or something.

220
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,564
[SPEAKER_08]: My Dave and Buster's in Colorado had it.

221
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:09,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really fun.

222
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:12,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Ranma says Magic Sword.

223
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:14,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, good fucking call.

224
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that one.

225
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,230
[SPEAKER_10]: That was, that was the one they had at Round Table Pizza that I would just play the shit out of.

226
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Porkchop says APB is awesome.

227
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:27,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Brad from PodCulture also says, um, the original Gauntlet would be hella awesome.

228
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,035
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a good multiplayer game too.

229
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So, good calls all around.

230
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Love the, um, classic arcade game suggestions.

231
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:35,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

232
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:40,179
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes, but our plan... There's actually a group of us going.

233
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft.

234
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Nerd, nerd.

235
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of my DDR friends from back in the day, Mel and Mel.

236
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:54,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Mel B, who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day, is going with us.

237
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:55,123
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be good.

238
00:15:55,163 --> 00:16:00,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And our plan is to, at the end of all of it, yell, end of line, and then collapse into tears.

239
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:02,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Drunken tears.

240
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to see Laser Man, because I still haven't seen that shit.

241
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Laser Man will be there from what I understand.

242
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:08,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

243
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, DarkSakura joined our chat room.

244
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, DarkSakura.

245
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:14,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And said Dave and Buster's in Roseville has it.

246
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,050
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale, there you go.

247
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we haven't been there since that time.

248
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,051
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't been there in a while.

249
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:26,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Buster's because it's not redemption, but it kind of feels like it.

250
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just a quick, engaging game of Pac-Man.

251
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,444
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

252
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow, that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games and we will not be here again next week.

253
00:16:54,943 --> 00:17:05,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who we are usually after at All Games Radio, where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, he's been off for the past two weeks.

254
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,930
[SPEAKER_10]: He will be back next week.

255
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:32,201
[SPEAKER_10]: so at least live folks you have something to look forward to R9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights they will still be doing their thing they've been constant over the past few weeks so there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR we'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks maybe a rarity I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive so maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week it'll be fun

256
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:33,964
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:17:54,381 --> 00:18:20,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had the first two games in my Steam account thanks to those crazy sales so I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to three at some point if I can buy it so two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade which is sort of goody two-shoes good guy and asshole good guy and now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense and characters die and

258
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:22,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to save and quit to do the show.

259
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now.

260
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's all I've been playing for last week.

262
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,121
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably good to have a break once in a while.

263
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Microphone extension cords and headphones.

264
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:35,682
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we need him to focus.

265
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:39,663
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or DarkSakura tonight.

266
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So unless you want to be funny, he has to bring the funny.

267
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:44,085
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

268
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it for you.

269
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:46,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect, Mass Effect, and more Mass Effect.

270
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:46,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, what are you going to do?

271
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to buy the third game?

272
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to kind of try to play the second one over again?

273
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:54,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing my Goody Two Shoes playthrough right now.

274
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,051
[SPEAKER_12]: So once I beat that, then I'll load up my female FemShep.

275
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:02,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's just like, fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe.

276
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,754
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls.

277
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,075
[SPEAKER_12]: That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay.

278
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:14,564
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week.

279
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:15,946
[SPEAKER_10]: What a shot.

280
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:18,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her?

281
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,610
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

282
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:21,252
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

283
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Portal 2 is a pretty kick-ass game.

284
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:24,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, how was your gaming week?

285
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:25,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Rally Death Rally

286
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:59,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Jetpack Joyride, and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku-type games, Picris-type games, and I feel like I'm missing something significant, but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix, I don't think I was.

287
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you have to game on the go.

288
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:22,235
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is yelling at me saying, girl, I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam.

289
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:56,948
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for 360 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug which is set to be released next week which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem

290
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:26,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3 and of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks so I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that and then they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it so they were like I don't get it I don't get the rage

291
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it.

292
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,475
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe he's not mad today, but next week he'll be raging internet angry.

293
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:35,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Or 3 a.m.

294
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:36,657
Wait!

295
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:38,219
What?

296
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Waking up in a cold sweat.

297
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:40,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you!

298
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I, I have, I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3, but just the, the, the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even, I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now.

299
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:58,109
[SPEAKER_12]: 2 is so much, well, I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome, but...

300
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:12,141
[SPEAKER_12]: If the last 20 minutes of the Endgame are shitty for the whole trilogy, that franchise, in my opinion, has given me at least 100 hours of quality, emotional, rewarding gameplay.

301
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,583
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not a waste of time.

302
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:36,316
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news so let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3 and Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to like kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that

303
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I've been playing it.

304
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been amazing, as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show.

305
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:44,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready.

306
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to catch up to where Alan's at.

307
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been playing a few other games, though, I want to tell you guys about.

308
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,541
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them is old, and one of them is very new.

309
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:56,963
[SPEAKER_10]: The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target.

310
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on clearance.

311
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:24,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I might be partially responsible for this yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it and I pick up the box I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic and I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games is that THQ or Ubisoft I want to say it's THQ that did this one

312
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, here's the thing.

313
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Paradise, it has a really good song list.

314
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,589
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a, it's got like Lady Gaga.

315
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,711
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's kind of a Euro infused song list.

316
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:37,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like songs I think that were bigger, a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond.

317
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:43,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you got things like Jerry Hallowell and nobody, nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up.

318
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:47,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, it's, you got Lady Gaga, you got a few Rihanna.

319
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,961
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically gay bar in a box, right?

320
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:54,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And you, you know, you know, it's going to be good music cause it's gay bar in a box and it's, it's a great song list.

321
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:54,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

322
00:23:55,665 --> 00:24:23,838
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has that was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game like and the way you play it is really stupid like because you have to take us you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it

323
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,718
[SPEAKER_12]: and then a step to the right and it's not the time warp.

324
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:27,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

325
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,620
[SPEAKER_10]: You jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to.

326
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine it looks like Rock Band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down.

327
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:44,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes, you have falling dance moves.

328
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:51,344
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or, you know, kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central.

329
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:53,305
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact that you move back and forth like...

330
00:24:54,125 --> 00:25:22,824
[SPEAKER_10]: who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird for those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it but here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video and I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the

331
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:23,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That was really cool.

332
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:25,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that, right?

333
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the king of the crop.

334
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:30,868
[SPEAKER_10]: You might see some, like, you'll definitely see, like, for, oh.

335
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,870
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of booty in Baby Got Back.

336
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's that.

337
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, what the hell's that?

338
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,353
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the Goblin Mail dance?

339
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:41,033
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

340
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:42,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Soulja Boy Teller.

341
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Soulja Boy.

342
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:44,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

343
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it sad that that's how we communicate?

344
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:48,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

345
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:51,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We have problems.

346
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, I know WoW just enough to understand that too now.

347
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:55,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Soulja Boy.

348
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,448
[SPEAKER_10]: You do that dance in Dance Central.

349
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:03,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of the big ones are there, but it doesn't match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos.

350
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dance Central is still a lot of fun.

351
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it doesn't really matter.

352
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:14,957
[SPEAKER_10]: But it kind of bothers me that you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise.

353
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:19,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out?

354
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Masters.

355
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Masters, the Konami game.

356
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:26,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together, if you think about it.

357
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:27,826
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just par-a-par of Kinect, right?

358
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even, not exactly.

359
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:35,672
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three or four... There are three or four... Wow.

360
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:36,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, talking words.

361
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:36,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

362
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:43,648
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have par-a-part routines.

363
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:47,492
[SPEAKER_08]: But everything else, to the extent of my knowledge, completely original.

364
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:54,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But it really is like fully-fledged dance minus walking around a stage, because Kinect is narrow-tracking.

365
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:57,819
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though.

366
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,559
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a lot of DDR crossovers.

367
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, everything was Konami original, period.

368
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:09,602
[SPEAKER_08]: But the ones that weren't Parapara were very... The routines were actually... Well, they were fun to watch because I haven't exactly learned them yet.

369
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:11,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were fun to watch.

370
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:24,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but they, they, there was some really weird, weird crossovers though, because like, I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic, which I was trying to find in my, my archive here, but it's like, it's not really a song you can dance to.

371
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:25,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a DDR song.

372
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:35,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured, but now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement, Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song.

373
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:45,480
[SPEAKER_08]: The routine from what I recall, the little bits and pieces, the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute, something like that.

374
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,181
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very fast.

375
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:46,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I found it.

376
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:47,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

377
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:53,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and see the routine and realize it doesn't really work very well.

378
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:03,751
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with the backup dancers?

379
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:06,534
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like PG-13 here.

380
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:07,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this.

381
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:16,346
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, it's a good song.

382
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:20,330
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great back in the DDR days, but to freestyle move, it's weird.

383
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:22,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't really make sense.

384
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:28,959
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's the thing, you've got a great interface and a great shell, not even just Dance Masters, but say Rhythm Party, right?

385
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:34,802
[SPEAKER_10]: The game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade that not even the Bomani community seems to care about at this point.

386
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:38,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a really well put together game, and I've said that for weeks on the show.

387
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:39,864
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Bomani community?

388
00:28:40,424 --> 00:28:41,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, you know what I mean.

389
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:44,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a Beatmania community and not much more than that.

390
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:45,026
[SPEAKER_10]: What's left of it.

391
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got that, and then you have to, it's like,

392
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:50,987
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

393
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:30,676
[SPEAKER_10]: or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play and not just relying on the music to sell your game if they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both but unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand

394
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:53,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami, a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm in my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier and Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well notably starting with Rock Revolution.

395
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:57,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Harmonix is now the top tier Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them absolutely

396
00:29:58,587 --> 00:29:59,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I would sign on to that.

397
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:01,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too bad, but there you go.

398
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:20,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

399
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:21,483
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bunch of classic tables.

400
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:26,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the guys that made the Williams pinball collection and the Stern pinball collection.

401
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:27,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games have already been out.

402
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:31,297
[SPEAKER_10]: They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade, but I see what they're doing.

403
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:36,083
[SPEAKER_10]: They're piecemealing it because the game itself comes with four tables.

404
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,125
[SPEAKER_10]: It's four damn good tables.

405
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ripley's Believe It or Not, which is a great table.

406
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:45,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables.

407
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:48,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four killer tables.

408
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:51,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're going to do DLC later, like Pinbot.

409
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:56,195
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses.

410
00:30:56,235 --> 00:31:01,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Their license was Stern and Williams, so they're going to get all those tables into their game.

411
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:10,464
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously, I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever.

412
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:16,428
[SPEAKER_10]: But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal, if you like pinball, there's some great tables in there.

413
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:21,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection, so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there.

414
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:22,074
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

415
00:31:45,997 --> 00:32:12,741
[SPEAKER_10]: uh Medieval Madness is DLC says Zether and I know I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites and you know they'll they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot it's got some great original tables I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there and especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation so you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out all right now I'm done with my gaming week

416
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:17,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Housekeeping, check us out on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

417
00:32:17,263 --> 00:32:19,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, always our website, orangelaunchradio.com.

418
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:24,728
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to find more of the OL Army members, check it out in the upper right-hand corner at orangelaunchradio.com.

419
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:42,540
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a box called Extended Play where you can find us on Steam, you can find us on Last.fm, lots of places to play with other cool folks who are not going to be a jerk because you know the number one rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick because there's so many dicks ruining the game experience on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

420
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,781
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be different than that.

421
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:44,942
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

422
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:49,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.

423
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, why don't you start us off tonight?

424
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:59,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game.

425
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, taking from the Rock Band franchise that they've been.

426
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:03,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

427
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:37,308
[SPEAKER_08]: A very famous point in Amplitude and Frequency's history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score, and Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz, a slightly simpler game, one track per instrument, and it was either two or three targets per instrument, I forget which,

428
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:41,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But the power-ups aren't as track-specific.

429
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:54,114
[SPEAKER_08]: The video is talking about a multi-measure note auto-player, and then there was a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner, picking up notes along the way.

430
00:33:54,874 --> 00:34:16,494
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo and you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound, a slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night.

431
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:23,600
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's... It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog.

432
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:31,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and...

433
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:35,620
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the indie version of Rock Band Network?

434
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That is Rock Band Network, yeah.

435
00:34:38,302 --> 00:34:41,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band Store is the license, you know, all that stuff.

436
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:45,985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content.

437
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:55,029
[SPEAKER_08]: No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet, but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style.

438
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:56,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well.

439
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting.

440
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:01,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I was partially really excited by the news.

441
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:12,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit a hint of disappointment because knowing that this is the big project Harmonix has been working on, I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like, oh, I was kind of hoping for something new.

442
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:14,265
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

443
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:32,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't... Does EA own Harmonix at this point?

444
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:32,944
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they don't.

445
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:34,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Harmonix is independent.

446
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they bought themselves out from MTV.

447
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:38,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, surely this is not behavior coming out of EA.

448
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that just proves Harmonix is independent.

449
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:45,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, because they're... Well, yeah, they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games.

450
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,612
[SPEAKER_10]: That was where they were at when Rock Band started.

451
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,493
[SPEAKER_10]: But just the value they're giving you there.

452
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:58,117
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether.

453
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:03,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's like, here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought.

454
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, well, fucking done.

455
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:06,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Applause.

456
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:06,862
[SPEAKER_10]: This is...

457
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:13,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game.

458
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll definitely be picking it up day one.

459
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:21,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like, okay, I did like amplitude and frequency a lot.

460
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:25,513
[SPEAKER_10]: People did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude.

461
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:33,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable.

462
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:35,899
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm excited for it.

463
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:36,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

464
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:44,497
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade-style band...

465
00:36:46,697 --> 00:37:11,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience and that was literally with like Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, the early Konami games and then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar and then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band and then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have a

466
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

467
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:34,033
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a bad decision.

468
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:38,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band?

469
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:41,377
[SPEAKER_10]: It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360.

470
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:46,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import, what, $200 in content automatically?

471
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade.

472
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:49,902
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at most going to be $20.

473
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:50,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

474
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe even $10.

475
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:53,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably less than $20 as well.

476
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:55,043
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, Harmonix.

477
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,771
[SPEAKER_10]: It's iTunes for your consoles.

478
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:24,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said, oh, yeah, you're doing music.

479
00:38:25,174 --> 00:38:26,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not the same as iTunes.

480
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:27,795
[SPEAKER_10]: iTunes is for your iPod.

481
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:30,777
[SPEAKER_10]: And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes.

482
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:34,659
[SPEAKER_10]: But now here we are years later, that's what they were setting the seeds for.

483
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Because now they've enhanced.

484
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,781
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC.

485
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:44,524
[SPEAKER_10]: You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console.

486
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:46,206
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

487
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:13,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The sampler video plus audio little sequence or something.

488
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:22,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year because they've announced this in time for PAX, obviously, and we're showing it on the floor there.

489
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:24,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they've got something else to show at E3.

490
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:26,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles.

491
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's something for the Wii U. Who knows?

492
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:35,478
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, my disappointment is like one grain of sand in a...

493
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,039
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

494
00:39:54,855 --> 00:40:19,897
[SPEAKER_08]: but if you are willing to and you're interested they actually had a lot of positions available anything from creative to programming to design I think even like program management that kind of stuff if you're interested look them up that's all I have to say as Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn dead air I thought I had a break to eat my fault bad co-host it's alright you're learning learning

495
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,090
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to learn how to fill in those gaps so I can be a fat ass.

496
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,130
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get there.

497
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:29,171
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

498
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:31,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let me ask, Alan, you've been awfully quiet on that story.

499
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:39,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know you're not as huge in the music games as the rest of us, but surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go, hmm.

500
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:45,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've kind of been abstaining because rock band and that whole genre, Guitar Hero, I never really...

501
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:47,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Eh.

502
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:47,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

503
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,012
[SPEAKER_10]: You could get that before there was Rock Band.

504
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:10,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a smartphone with a camera to put it on Facebook, so if I can't blackmail you, then... Then where's the fun in that?

505
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:11,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

506
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:11,819
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

507
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:14,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, another game was announced just this past week.

508
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:16,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game... It's a reimagining of an old game.

509
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:17,845
[SPEAKER_10]: We've seen a few of these lately.

510
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,969
[SPEAKER_10]: WayForward, the company that brought us... What the hell did they bring?

511
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:22,209
[SPEAKER_10]: It was...

512
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:25,654
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another... God damn it.

513
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:26,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They did Blood Rain.

514
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Blood Rain Betrayal was one of their games they did.

515
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:29,916
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another one I was trying to think of.

516
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:33,038
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, they are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise.

517
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I had no idea that it was up for grabs, but it makes sense.

518
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise.

519
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:41,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Who had it before?

520
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:48,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to remember, Trade West, maybe Midway had it, and it was one of the things that went under when they went under.

521
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:58,365
[SPEAKER_10]: But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise, so it's being reinvented as Double Dragon Neon, which is going to come out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

522
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:00,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon?

523
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:03,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because it is 80s-tastic.

524
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:08,061
[SPEAKER_10]: The colors, the colors.

525
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,324
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the best around.

526
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:13,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully that can be in the game, but I don't know.

527
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:14,350
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a trailer.

528
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:14,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me show you.

529
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me play some of this for you because it does have some nice remixed music.

530
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,561
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can notice...

531
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:26,597
[SPEAKER_10]: The way the characters move is very fluid and all that.

532
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,579
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it looks really nice in HD.

533
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that is pretty neon.

534
00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:36,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and everybody's very like 80s infused.

535
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:42,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you see the afros and the leather jackets and the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff.

536
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:50,031
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, call me crazy or call me stupid if this already happened, but you know what I'd love to see a very modern remake of in this style?

537
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:51,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain America and the Avengers.

538
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:57,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, especially when there's the movie and everything, but I think they did another game for that.

539
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

540
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my concern with Double Dragon Neon.

541
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I bought Double Dragon when it was available on Xbox Live Arcade.

542
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:09,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not available anymore, obviously, but it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time when, you know, other people had the license.

543
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,094
[SPEAKER_12]: We played it together and we did.

544
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:11,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We did.

545
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:14,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And then DarkSakura's Dan yelled at us for trashing it.

546
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:15,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember that.

547
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:19,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, because we played through it and we were like, this game isn't very good.

548
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,400
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell were we smoking when we were 12?

549
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,682
[SPEAKER_10]: This game sucks

550
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:37,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm looking at this going, it looks like it's a faithful port of the original Double Dragon game, but Double Dragon, and maybe I'm just old, but it kind of gets old after the first stage.

551
00:43:37,955 --> 00:43:40,676
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, punch, punch, kick, kick, kick, and I'm over it.

552
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:46,958
[SPEAKER_12]: What Double Dragon founded, Final Fight made better, and I'd rather play that.

553
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:51,240
[SPEAKER_10]: But even playing Final Fight now, playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same.

554
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Bad Dudes.

555
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:53,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're all the same.

556
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:59,030
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see in new fighting games a little bit.

557
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe more like versus and special moves and combo attacks.

558
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:04,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

559
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't give them ideas.

560
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:23,030
[SPEAKER_10]: but I will I will uh I'll at least check out the demo I will say that so that's coming out uh this summer on so what you're saying is you want them to bring back that mode from tech and tag tournament that that side scrolling tech and tag actually that mode kicked ass so yes I want them to bring that back

561
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little bit more fun because there was the entire moveset and a little bit more depth to a side-scroller.

562
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:30,152
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could play it as Panda.

563
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:36,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And the concept of a fighting game where a Panda bear beats up everyone is pretty fucking awesome.

564
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:37,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to admit.

565
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:38,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they brought that out.

566
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not a side-scroller.

567
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:40,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, right.

568
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:41,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow did.

569
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:42,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Or about to.

570
00:44:42,885 --> 00:44:44,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Panda kills everyone.

571
00:44:44,787 --> 00:44:45,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

572
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow reference number five today?

573
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:51,436
[SPEAKER_08]: That was dead for me.

574
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:52,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

575
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:53,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, guys.

576
00:44:54,198 --> 00:45:03,784
[SPEAKER_12]: So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans, Nintendo of America is bringing Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition.

577
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:06,906
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

578
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:09,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobunaga's Ambition.

579
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:09,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobunaga.

580
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:10,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobunaga.

581
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:11,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Cowabunga.

582
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:12,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Cowabunga?

583
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

584
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:37,963
[SPEAKER_12]: they're bringing that to the US called Pokemon Conquest and it's coming out on June 18th and you play a warlord who has a Pokemon pal and you have to build up your army and it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG and if you follow import games and you're a fan of Nobunaga's Ambition this is great

585
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:45,050
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I remember when I heard that this game was coming out in Japan, I was like, what a weird fucking idea.

586
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:49,573
[SPEAKER_10]: And to hear that this game is actually coming out here, I have mixed emotions.

587
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:51,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I get it.

588
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:56,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon has its rabid fanbase that will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon.

589
00:45:56,077 --> 00:45:59,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm totally, like, I understand that, fine.

590
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

591
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:08,134
[SPEAKER_10]: How on earth does the US get Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition relatively close to the Japanese release?

592
00:46:08,194 --> 00:46:11,156
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, within a year, yes, I would call close for Nintendo for a game like this.

593
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:15,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet, we had to pull out fucking teeth to get Xenoblade.

594
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:30,585
[SPEAKER_10]: is this an example of maybe I guess technically it wasn't a Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it maybe that's the key difference Pokemon just shits money and it's the Pokemon factor

595
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:54,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's... Even if the whole feudal warlord fails to grab onto people, it can still be propped up and kept afloat at least a little bit more with something like, oh, I don't know, a Pokemon franchise, which is insanely popular, as opposed to a... I'm not going to say an underground favorite, but definitely a less-trafficked series in the Xenogears, Xenosaga, Xenocore line.

596
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:04,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand why they changed the name because you don't exactly have your raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here in the US.

597
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:15,556
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a few of them on the NES, like Nobunaga and Romance of the Three Kingdoms and some of that, but that series has kind of been deader than dead here for years, or at least I think it exists on the PC.

598
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:19,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely has a cult following, but nothing mainstream.

599
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

600
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So I get why they changed the name.

601
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:23,282
[SPEAKER_10]: You know there's going to be those purists, though.

602
00:47:23,442 --> 00:47:28,266
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always some goddamn purist who's going to be like, why couldn't they just call it Pokemon Nobunaga?

603
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:31,329
[SPEAKER_10]: They dumped it down for stupid Americans.

604
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:33,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid Americans.

605
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Get off your goddamn horse.

606
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:37,213
[SPEAKER_08]: They changed it for Americans, indeed.

607
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:45,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they did change it for Americans, because we don't have two new Nobunaga Ambition games coming out on consoles every year like they do in Japan.

608
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:46,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Wake up!

609
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:52,005
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking amazing this game is coming out here in the first place.

610
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:52,886
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically my point.

611
00:47:53,406 --> 00:48:02,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sounds like it has six on six battles and battle conditions can change on every turn, keeping players on their toes in anticipation of what will happen next.

612
00:48:03,218 --> 00:48:03,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Me, me, me, me, me.

613
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:12,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Fancy pants reading of the quote and this article from Scott Moffat, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

614
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:19,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon fans are always interested in playing in new environments and experiencing new adventures.

615
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:30,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon Conquest gives them an entirely new way to enjoy this beloved series, with exciting new settings, fierce battles, and nearly 200 Pokemon to team up with.

616
00:48:30,913 --> 00:48:33,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Read that first phrase again in that quote real quick.

617
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,015
[SPEAKER_08]: In that voice or normally?

618
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:36,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever you want.

619
00:48:36,816 --> 00:48:42,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon fans are always interested in playing in new environments and experiencing new adventures.

620
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:42,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

621
00:48:43,158 --> 00:48:44,299
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what that translates to?

622
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon fans will open up their wallets and give us all their... They will buy fucking everything.

623
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,742
[SPEAKER_10]: They will buy any fucking thing that we put in front of them and they will like it.

624
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: If this was something that we were head over heels interested in, we have a quote for this too.

625
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up and take my money!

626
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:03,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

627
00:49:03,553 --> 00:49:05,135
[SPEAKER_08]: As I screw up the quote the first time.

628
00:49:06,216 --> 00:49:06,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

629
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,901
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know people like that.

630
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:12,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane's like that.

631
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:14,885
[SPEAKER_10]: He probably has his pre-order in already.

632
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:19,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

633
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:20,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go on to the next story.

634
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:21,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that mine?

635
00:49:22,484 --> 00:49:23,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm keeping up, I swear.

636
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:24,925
[SPEAKER_08]: My computer isn't, though.

637
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:31,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Max Payne is being brought out again and being adapted to iOS.

638
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:32,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Was this one?

639
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:37,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one... Yeah, an Android version is actually going to come a couple of weeks later.

640
00:49:37,868 --> 00:49:42,329
[SPEAKER_08]: The current rumor says that Max Payne for iOS is going to come out on April 12th.

641
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:44,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that is Wednesday of this coming week.

642
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:52,393
[SPEAKER_08]: As to be expected, the game is going to be scaled down and adapted so that you can get your bullet time portable on.

643
00:49:53,153 --> 00:50:08,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Purely on-screen controls, no talk about any kind of a controller or anything to do that, but you can start diving around and rolling around and falling off the... Oh, what was that scene where you were going in like a drug craze and you had that terrible walkway to navigate against?

644
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,521
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be really, really bad with touch controls.

645
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:10,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

646
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: most ports are really really bad with touch controls that's what makes the story interesting because like I that was the other game I didn't mention in my gaming week is that Midway for the 200th time re-released their whole classic arcade game machine classic arcade game compilation and I picked it up in all the packs so I have Yarve, Gauntlet the sequel to Smash TV same characters

647
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:39,136
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

648
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:05,634
[SPEAKER_08]: and that sucks!

649
00:51:07,174 --> 00:51:13,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been less torn up if there was an optional D-pad, but the fact that it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass.

650
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:15,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have that same one.

651
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:17,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Williams Collection or something it's called.

652
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was Midway specifically.

653
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:19,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only on my iPad.

654
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:20,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over in the other room.

655
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:21,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it.

656
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:23,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Midway Arcade.

657
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:24,580
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks just like that, right?

658
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have it too.

659
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And Spy Hunter, speaking of that game, is in it.

660
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:30,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And it fucking sucks.

661
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:31,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

662
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:33,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's not how I want to play the game.

663
00:51:53,596 --> 00:51:54,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Joust works surprisingly alright.

664
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:56,379
[SPEAKER_10]: The other two are Skee-Ball and that dumb little basketball game.

665
00:51:56,399 --> 00:51:57,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Which aren't even fucking midway games, they're just...

666
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:15,178
[SPEAKER_10]: But you still get tickets from them.

667
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:15,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

668
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,921
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get the virtual prizes from the prize stand.

669
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:20,822
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets?

670
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:22,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's your player's tip for Midway Arcade.

671
00:52:23,303 --> 00:52:28,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Just fucking sit there and start skee-ball and go, just swipe your finger nine times really fast.

672
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Restart nine times really fast.

673
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:30,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Restart.

674
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:33,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I managed to get a 900 game within about five or six times of trying.

675
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:35,251
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

676
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Max Payne this week.

677
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:38,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Android about a week and a half later.

678
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:41,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And everything else, Touch World.

679
00:52:41,755 --> 00:52:42,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, moving on.

680
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I ask this real quick before we get into the next story?

681
00:52:45,672 --> 00:52:46,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you want to say something?

682
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:46,933
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

683
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:48,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

684
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear the news around the internet this week about how Instagram came out for Android?

685
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:54,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

686
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:04,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And was suddenly bashed by all the iPhone users everywhere that was like, ugh, I can't believe Instagram is slumming it up on Android.

687
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Hipstergram is now Losergram.

688
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:07,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

689
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:07,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

690
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:14,453
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to come out with something new on the iPhone because I refuse to use an app that exists on Android.

691
00:53:15,073 --> 00:53:16,994
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is up with that attitude?

692
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:18,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Where does that come from?

693
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,936
[SPEAKER_08]: All the same holy wars that divide them in the first place.

694
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:28,499
[SPEAKER_12]: The same brainwashing that has them upgrade a personal appliance every fucking nine months for $500 and they see nothing wrong with that.

695
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Same attitude.

696
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to club you with my iPhone if you keep talking.

697
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:33,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll help.

698
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not like that.

699
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:43,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it when Android users get the same apps because sometimes we can still play together and stuff.

700
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:46,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm totally fine with Android users having the apps.

701
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:50,766
[SPEAKER_08]: All my Android buddies have all the same Words with Friends, Hanging with Friends.

702
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:55,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I haven't joined the Zynga Must Die petition completely yet.

703
00:53:55,708 --> 00:54:00,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't started Draw Something for that reason, but I still play Words with Friends, Hanging with Friends, and Scramble with Friends.

704
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, I'll just judge you from back here.

705
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:02,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

706
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:06,055
[SPEAKER_08]: All the way across the table, give that evil glare for the rest of the show.

707
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,521
[SPEAKER_08]: He still gives money to Zynga.

708
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:13,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask Jason to host the show again, but he fucking plays Zynga games.

709
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:14,588
[SPEAKER_10]: He's so not cool.

710
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:40,625
[SPEAKER_08]: and then there are some other games we've played like there was I can't even recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator that had like eight ball nine ball and different different table arrangements and that kind of stuff and yeah those are all cross-platform and since they're since they're asynchronous and just alternating they work very well they're they're very nice and they get everybody involved okay going to our chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com Tiger Claw says Sky it's Apple fanboys they are elitists no they're not

711
00:54:42,603 --> 00:54:44,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an Apple fanboy.

712
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the guy that buys the iPhone every time.

713
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:49,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And your desktop is a Windows machine?

714
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:54,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm by... Alan, I have to tell you something.

715
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:56,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm by computer-al.

716
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:58,022
[SPEAKER_10]: By portable.

717
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:01,626
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have the sense to skip a release before you upgrade.

718
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:02,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, alright.

719
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:05,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Dig yourself out of that hole.

720
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, also recall one of the first couple of words out of my mouth after I walked in here last time.

721
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:12,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I'm in Windows World.

722
00:55:12,748 --> 00:55:13,610
[SPEAKER_08]: This feels weird.

723
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, then, fanboy.

724
00:55:15,953 --> 00:55:17,134
[SPEAKER_10]: You're worse than I am, clearly.

725
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:18,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you consider yourself an elitist?

726
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:48,026
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to think about this I can't I can talk like it I don't mean it I mean when I was when I had my whole phone switching debacle I actively looked at what Sprint had offerings for both Android and Windows and because I had an iPad I was more than willing to get a different phone because I still had something to let me get done with the tools that I wanted to use but Sprint's selection was fucking garbage and they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done I figured it out

727
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:51,560
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's the story of how I have the latest phone.

728
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,121
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

729
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:55,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go.

730
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the Apple show.

731
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:58,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to this story.

732
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my other show that I do.

733
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:01,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's right.

734
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:03,271
[SPEAKER_10]: You really do have an Apple show.

735
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:03,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

736
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:06,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I should let you guys plug your podcast because he has one too.

737
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:09,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll let you do that at the start of the next half of the show.

738
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:21,224
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, for now, let's talk about the Wii U and a rumor about the Wii U. And usually I don't like to talk about rumors like these, but it was kind of a slow news week because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East thing.

739
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:23,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, we will have some phone calls on that later.

740
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:25,347
[SPEAKER_10]: But for now... We better.

741
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:26,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Rumors.

742
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:27,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we better because I didn't go this year.

743
00:56:28,028 --> 00:56:28,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of sad.

744
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:31,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of the other all-game shows had it covered.

745
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:36,553
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I might go to West Coast this year, which is really exciting.

746
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

747
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,636
[SPEAKER_10]: That day sounds awfully familiar.

748
00:56:58,069 --> 00:57:00,091
[SPEAKER_08]: That's five years later, isn't it?

749
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:02,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't the Wii launch right around that day?

750
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:03,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Did the Wii U launch?

751
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:05,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did the regular Wii launch November 18th?

752
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:06,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

753
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just before Thanksgiving.

754
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona.

755
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:17,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it's coming from a Japanese retailer email or something like that is where this date is coming from.

756
00:57:17,128 --> 00:57:19,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, take it or leave it.

757
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,292
[SPEAKER_10]: But November 18th is the day, so...

758
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:43,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I here's my honest reaction to that I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet I think Nintendo in part is waiting to hear what Microsoft and Sony are doing although I guess they have to release a date at E3 but they don't maybe they don't have to I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3 that year I don't even I don't even remember mm-hmm

759
00:57:45,908 --> 00:57:49,610
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii came out on November 19th, 2006.

760
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so close.

761
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

762
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:56,373
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that shows that they're aiming for the same weekend, essentially.

763
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:11,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not put it past a retailer to stub a date based off what they saw before to have some record in their system so they can start saying, pre-order, pre-order, give us your money, or at least some of it.

764
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:15,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yep.

765
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:16,793
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

766
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:17,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Another day.

767
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii U, another day, another rumor.

768
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:19,957
[SPEAKER_10]: What else can you say?

769
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

770
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:39,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's been a lot of anger over Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out a couple weeks ago in regards to all of the launch day, launch week DLC available that is on the disc that you have to pay to unlock.

771
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:45,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know if Loki were here, he would be pitching a fit right now because this is obviously a thorn in his side.

772
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:46,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

773
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:52,794
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been a lot of Better Business Bureau complaints about this and Capcom has finally released a statement.

774
00:58:54,195 --> 00:59:02,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very professionally coded and groomed to say, we're sorry you feel that way, but

775
00:59:04,662 --> 00:59:06,883
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't do anything wrong, nanny nanny boo boo.

776
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:50,386
[SPEAKER_12]: it doesn't matter if the DLC is available on the day after the release date or three weeks you still have to pay whatever five six bucks PSN points Xbox live points to access the content so there's no difference between content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock versus stuff that's downloaded later and they're saying you know that the the disc the product of the game

777
00:59:51,283 --> 01:00:13,855
[SPEAKER_12]: When that has to go gold, when they actually say this game is done, and then the release date, which comes a couple months later, even if that extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc, from their point of view, it was always intended to be something supplementary to the original product, and they're not wrong, because Xbox and PSN lets them do this.

778
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:15,876
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're sorry, but...

779
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:17,318
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

780
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,874
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a fighting game fan, I know that.

781
01:00:27,735 --> 01:00:44,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Given what happened with Street Fighter 4 and Mortal Kombat, I basically learned to just say screw fighting games and wait until two years later, which I know some people in chat are like, a two-year-old game, but they're going to release a comprehensive game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition.

782
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:45,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather buy that.

783
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:49,114
[SPEAKER_10]: They have sworn they're not doing it this time.

784
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:51,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you want to get the Vita version or whatever.

785
01:00:52,017 --> 01:01:04,610
[SPEAKER_12]: then sure, that's what Loki says get the Vita version you have a Vita, we can get it, whatever that was code for Rob, buy it for your Vita and let me play it let me play it when you're at work

786
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:11,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's sleazy, but like they said, it's not wrong.

787
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:22,000
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2, which has a lot of several hour long DLC episode packs for admissions with bonus weapons and blah, blah, blah.

788
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:24,962
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game itself is already so long that you don't

789
01:01:25,575 --> 01:01:33,560
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't really need it, and it's just being a completionist and knowing that I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad, but I don't have to, but I want to, and it's on the disc.

790
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, you know... It's frustrating to know that it's right there on the disc, but they want you to pay... I mean, that's the frustrating thing about it.

791
01:01:40,524 --> 01:01:43,005
[SPEAKER_10]: At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff, you actually download.

792
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:49,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And while there might be seeds of information on the disc, you're still downloading a good chunk of the dialogue and all that.

793
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,609
[SPEAKER_10]: You're actually downloading.

794
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,851
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not able to hack it off the disc.

795
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:53,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

796
01:01:53,431 --> 01:02:01,961
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, Capcom may think this is the more convenient way to do it or whatever, but the hacking community is kind of teaching them a lesson here.

797
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:05,786
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to go that route, here's the price you're going to pay for it.

798
01:02:06,346 --> 01:02:09,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of sucks that legitimate users get screwed in the end.

799
01:02:10,051 --> 01:02:12,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots.

800
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:14,094
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't do their own fucking job?

801
01:02:39,716 --> 01:02:45,443
[SPEAKER_10]: But if this is the more convenient way to do it, then police it your goddamn self.

802
01:02:48,546 --> 01:03:16,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess to save themselves a lot of wank from their fans have it be available on launch day digitally do not put that shit on the disc for any reason at all and even if people want to make the argument that well it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc and now you're saying there's $40 worth of DLC for me to get why wasn't it on the disc they could just say well it because it's you know you have to download it it's not on the disc and that'll remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now

803
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:21,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock.

804
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:26,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucks, but if you want to have it your way, you should wait until the final Ultimate Edition is eventually released.

805
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

806
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,763
[SPEAKER_10]: The vote with your wallet statement, which I think a lot of us are on board with.

807
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:32,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I didn't buy it.

808
01:03:32,804 --> 01:03:41,450
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it was because Capcom has historically shown that even if they swear up and down they're not going to do it this time, I don't believe them.

809
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:46,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like 20 bucks.

810
01:03:48,234 --> 01:03:52,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'll buy that, and then the 20 bucks to unlock everything, that'll be about the game right there, right?

811
01:03:53,715 --> 01:04:10,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess, according to this story, the hackers, I guess, that have figured out how to play those pay-to-unlock characters online without having to actually get the DLC, apparently Jill and Shuma Gorath from MVC3

812
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:16,283
[SPEAKER_12]: were on the disc launch day as paid-on-lock characters, but they were incomplete assets.

813
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:24,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So to pull down that final 20% that made them playable, that was a remote file package that you had to bring down to your console.

814
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:26,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is probably what they should have done here.

815
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:31,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Capcom left characters on the disc and the hackers saw it as a personal challenge.

816
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:49,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And they took it, they ran with it, and gee, what number of times is this that we've heard it?

817
01:04:49,438 --> 01:04:50,518
[SPEAKER_08]: The millionth and a half?

818
01:04:50,938 --> 01:04:51,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

819
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:55,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know the old saying, hacker's gonna hack, right?

820
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack.

821
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:06,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you say your system is unhackable, that is like printing a wedding invitation to all the hackers, says you are cordially invited to hack the fuck out of this box.

822
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network and almost the company.

823
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:15,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what set everybody off about PlayStation when they removed Linux?

824
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:17,572
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to piss off a hacker?

825
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:19,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Take their Linux away.

826
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:20,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for real.

827
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:28,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Take away their command line, take away their way of exploring, and they'll make a new way, brute or not.

828
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:34,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And for people that work in IT, that are hardcore crypto people, they don't even have to be gamers.

829
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,682
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll see the stuff as a Rubik's Cube.

830
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly like you said, it's a gauntlet thrown down.

831
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:40,804
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a challenge.

832
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:46,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Once they release into the crack community, here's how you unlock this.

833
01:05:46,848 --> 01:05:47,869
[SPEAKER_12]: They may not even be gamers.

834
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:52,352
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just really into crypto, and the community is there, and they're always going to find a way around it.

835
01:05:53,007 --> 01:06:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: It is pretty surprising that they're not only hacking, but they're going activist with it and actually playing these in matches and using it as advertising.

836
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:06,442
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty ballsy to go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag and be all, look at me, bitch.

837
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:10,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place that on a console that is hacked...

838
01:06:11,627 --> 01:06:12,628
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

839
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:38,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, because now people in our chatroom are talking about what is likely next.

840
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:40,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And Wyland says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4.

841
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:45,474
[SPEAKER_10]: But Stan says, I'll totally buy Darkstalkers 4, even if there's stupid DLC.

842
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been waiting for that forever.

843
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:50,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4 when the Ultimate Edition comes out.

844
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,161
[SPEAKER_10]: This is interesting.

845
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:52,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Has...

846
01:06:53,442 --> 01:07:02,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Have the reputation of fighting games been tarnished due to not just the behavior of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat and WB Games didn't really do anything different.

847
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:05,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, they didn't leave it on the disc, but they did release extra fighters.

848
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:13,796
[SPEAKER_12]: February or March, they had the comprehensive Freddy Krueger, Scarlet, Kenji DLC edition.

849
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:14,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

850
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:17,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it.

851
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:24,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I still stand by my argument that EVO has something to do with the timing and the extensive release and all that kind of stuff.

852
01:07:24,312 --> 01:07:32,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do feel that that factors in because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream and EVO, if there's something bigger than that, I don't know what it is.

853
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:33,517
[SPEAKER_08]: At least here in the States, of course.

854
01:07:35,118 --> 01:08:01,324
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah I don't have a specific point that comes off that I just think it ties into all of this is has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur done this shit I don't think they have they're still the one franchise that's relatively um because well Soul Calibur okay if you had Yoda you could pay to get Vader and if you had Vader because of the version you bought you could pay to unlock Yoda but that was that was really it it was one character and everyone knew that was going to happen

855
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:02,402
[SPEAKER_10]: 5 Princess Packs Costume Packs

856
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:42,801
[SPEAKER_10]: but that's that's still shitty but it's cosmetic whereas in this it's players characters right I mean it's not it I think what they're doing is not nearly as bad as what's happening here over at Capcom you know and if you're into the design character stuff which I know some of our listeners are I got one of our listeners sent a bunch of custom characters he made and a lot of them are just hilarious like they're they're great real-life interpretations made in the game but

857
01:08:43,362 --> 01:08:53,657
[SPEAKER_10]: and with even more stuff I can just imagine the additional opportunities that opens up but that's totally different than a whole different character is here on the disc

858
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:56,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.

859
01:08:56,496 --> 01:08:56,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

860
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

861
01:09:18,564 --> 01:09:24,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer near you that will require you to buy it in the store and then buy all the DLC later.

862
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, maybe not, but what's coming out in the US, Jason?

863
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:34,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially considering the selection that I have to work with, if any of these games have DLC, that would scare me to death.

864
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:39,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty light week as far as I see from the next week.

865
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:44,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Three games that I don't know if I should even go on with them, but here they are.

866
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:49,011
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir, with bonus!

867
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Drops on the 13th.

868
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's just a strategy guide.

869
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:54,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that in a game?

870
01:09:54,603 --> 01:09:56,044
[SPEAKER_08]: You failtastic.

871
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery.

872
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:03,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe with DLC you can float the ship back up with ping pong balls.

873
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:05,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I solved the mystery.

874
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It sinks.

875
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:12,814
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom with the anchor.

876
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:15,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly... With the iceberg.

877
01:10:22,904 --> 01:10:23,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never let go, Jack.

878
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never let go.

879
01:10:43,874 --> 01:10:49,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We were watching Titan AE last night and the very ending had a very similar situation.

880
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:50,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never let go.

881
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:51,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never let go.

882
01:10:52,143 --> 01:10:52,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll save you.

883
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I let you go.

884
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:54,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Be free.

885
01:10:54,645 --> 01:10:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Save the rest of us.

886
01:10:55,747 --> 01:10:56,187
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate.

887
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:59,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, oh, so, Titanic Mystery is...

888
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:01,972
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not next week, that's two days ago.

889
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:04,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot.

890
01:11:04,954 --> 01:11:11,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit Camera for the DS, Titanic Mystery for the DS, 4-in-1 Action Pack for the PS3 drops on Tuesday.

891
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:13,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiet week.

892
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,021
[SPEAKER_08]: An unexciting week.

893
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:19,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there.

894
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:31,779
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 12th, in Japan, on the Nintendo 3DS, Nikoli no Sudoku 3D Dai Nishu Eitsu no Puzzle Day 1000 Mon That is, for real, the name of the game.

895
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,520
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking Sudoku in 3D.

896
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:34,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

897
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:43,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, can somebody explain to me how Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions?

898
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that.

899
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:44,870
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

900
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Pseudocubed.

901
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:00,969
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft,

902
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:30,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners.

903
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:33,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, it's like Mass Effect.

904
01:12:33,111 --> 01:12:33,971
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a choice.

905
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:36,873
[SPEAKER_10]: You can point the thing up or down.

906
01:12:41,076 --> 01:12:43,678
[SPEAKER_08]: You were worried about tonight being a dry night.

907
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,922
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the Vita?

908
01:12:51,463 --> 01:12:52,063
[SPEAKER_10]: How about it?

909
01:12:52,163 --> 01:12:54,545
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan this week, Rayman Origins.

910
01:12:54,945 --> 01:12:56,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And, ready...

911
01:12:57,188 --> 01:13:01,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Nikolai no Sudoku 5, Shugyoku number 12 puzzle.

912
01:13:02,053 --> 01:13:02,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

913
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:05,536
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Sudoku game on the Vita as well.

914
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:07,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a swastika?

915
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:08,259
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?

916
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:09,980
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the puzzles.

917
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:11,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a swastika.

918
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:13,164
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that is not a swastika.

919
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:14,365
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not Sudoku.

920
01:13:15,526 --> 01:13:16,307
[SPEAKER_10]: It's rotated.

921
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:17,688
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not a swastika.

922
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:18,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at it diagonally.

923
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:19,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I need the chair.

924
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:24,008
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

925
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:46,350
[SPEAKER_10]: How about on the consoles?

926
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:50,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's something to save us on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

927
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:52,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Dirt 3!

928
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:55,295
[SPEAKER_10]: You get Sudoku or Dirt.

929
01:13:55,955 --> 01:14:02,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Grand Slam Tennis 2 and Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3.

930
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:08,682
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, on the Xbox 360, nothing, because no one owns a 360 in Japan.

931
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:12,044
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously, there's nothing on the 360 this week in Japan.

932
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,341
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Europe, UK, all those countries over there?

933
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:22,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like a light week over on the UK side or the Europe side as well.

934
01:14:23,282 --> 01:14:34,505
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 11th, I have Football Manager handheld for the Android, Legend of Grimrock for the PC, Skullgirls for PlayStation 3 and 360.

935
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:38,746
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 12th, we have Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered.

936
01:14:39,586 --> 01:14:41,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Tribes Ascend for the PC.

937
01:14:41,908 --> 01:14:43,749
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 13th, Fez.

938
01:14:44,849 --> 01:14:47,030
[SPEAKER_12]: F-E-Z, not Rez, but Fez.

939
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe your little Shriners in the little cars.

940
01:14:49,032 --> 01:14:49,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

941
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:50,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Fez for the 360.

942
01:14:51,373 --> 01:14:53,934
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 14th, Pandora's Tower for the Wii.

943
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:57,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is kind of a big deal.

944
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,538
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of those Operation Rainfall games.

945
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:02,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Pandora's Tower?

946
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,401
[SPEAKER_10]: So while we wait here in the U.S., everybody's going to be pirating it.

947
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:07,402
Yeah.

948
01:15:08,749 --> 01:15:09,610
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's what people do.

949
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:11,171
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

950
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:12,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding, kids.

951
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:13,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't pirate.

952
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:21,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting Center Blade Chronicles like they just bought it in the store this week and I was like, what?

953
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:22,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

954
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:25,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess we should only really be playing that starting this week.

955
01:15:25,381 --> 01:15:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

956
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:26,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

957
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:31,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade a year ago.

958
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:33,647
[SPEAKER_12]: But not from GameStop.

959
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo, you've made the bed, now lie in it.

960
01:15:36,269 --> 01:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

961
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

962
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do one other quick story before we get to the classic game of the week.

963
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:43,154
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's not here tonight.

964
01:15:43,254 --> 01:15:50,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants, but we're taking the classic game of the week car and driving it in another direction tonight.

965
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:50,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So here we go.

966
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, one more story, though.

967
01:15:54,304 --> 01:16:22,974
[SPEAKER_10]: by the way the chat oh there was hey well I'll say this real quick the chat room is lighting up saying there is that what we know as a swastika in Japanese can be a manji which is actually a good luck and some old video games had that for instance there were some dungeons in Zelda somebody was saying in our chat room kind of looked like that I remember it was 1942 and 1943 had those symbols in the Japanese versions and they were like extra life or something

968
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:26,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and it's not controversial there because it has a different meaning.

969
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:29,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It also looks mirrored to me, I think.

970
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:31,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I believe it's the other direction.

971
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:39,747
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake for commoners, so generally games that would have had it and come to America get it just changed to something else entirely or just stripped out.

972
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:40,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

973
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:53,404
[SPEAKER_08]: New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders off online gaming networks.

974
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:58,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple all cooperated with the purge.

975
01:16:58,467 --> 01:17:06,313
[SPEAKER_08]: which follows a court case in the state of New York in which a 19-year-old pleaded guilty to abusing a 10-year-old he met on Xbox Live.

976
01:17:07,114 --> 01:17:15,020
[SPEAKER_08]: New York law demands all convicted sex offenders to hand over any email addresses and online aliases to help limit their access on vulnerable web networks.

977
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,802
[SPEAKER_08]: However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked in relation to online gaming.

978
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:26,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty... We never went through this six years ago with UNO.

979
01:17:27,749 --> 01:17:28,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're finally here.

980
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh God, Strip Uno, I remember that story.

981
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, here's the thing though.

982
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:40,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, people that would do that stuff to kids are not okay and they need to be dealt with in ways like this.

983
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that.

984
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's another side to this that kind of bothers me.

985
01:17:45,545 --> 01:17:49,489
[SPEAKER_10]: What parent was letting their 10-year-old play on Xbox Live unsupervised?

986
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:50,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

987
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they just not know what happens on Xbox Live?

988
01:17:54,929 --> 01:17:56,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse.

989
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:58,090
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

990
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:02,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that should be a wake-up call to parents everywhere.

991
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:06,632
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to supervise children that are going to play games online like that.

992
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:12,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I'm not saying what the 19-year-old did was right.

993
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:13,694
[SPEAKER_10]: That's no excuse.

994
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:17,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying there's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture.

995
01:18:17,935 --> 01:18:18,696
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

996
01:18:35,634 --> 01:18:41,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it was just myself and my sister, who is three years older than me, but sometimes it was just straight up me.

997
01:18:41,659 --> 01:18:48,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Oftentimes, especially after my sister grew up and moved out, it was just myself in the house all weekend.

998
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:51,908
[SPEAKER_08]: This is before the years of online gaming, functionally.

999
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:53,769
[SPEAKER_08]: This technology doesn't exist then.

1000
01:18:53,789 --> 01:18:55,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is just a modern version of that.

1001
01:18:56,051 --> 01:19:00,132
[SPEAKER_08]: These situations, and I completely understand where you're coming from.

1002
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:02,812
[SPEAKER_08]: One, there are bad parents.

1003
01:19:02,892 --> 01:19:05,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Two, there are bad situations with good parents.

1004
01:19:08,073 --> 01:19:19,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be great if parental controls were a lot more perfect, if Microsoft could step in a lot better and have some kind of a camera filter, or if they were just kind of smarter about it.

1005
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:22,176
[SPEAKER_08]: But these situations happen, and it's incredibly unfortunate.

1006
01:19:22,316 --> 01:19:50,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I can kind of meet you halfway there because when I was probably about 12 or 13 on my Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem I was calling into BBS's local bulletin board systems and posting on message boards and playing door games I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit at like 14 and 15 right which you know if you ever played those games back in the day they were not very nice games and my mom just said oh he's on the computer you know and I was posting on message boards and stuff and there would be people on the message boards it's like

1007
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you should, like, come out to this meetup and all this stuff.

1008
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:54,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, okay, I'm 15, huh?

1009
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:59,597
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and... You know, I can kind of see that side of it.

1010
01:20:00,198 --> 01:20:04,920
[SPEAKER_10]: That sometimes the parents... If she knew what I was doing online, though, she would have punched me in the face.

1011
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:08,095
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:48,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel that a lot of people will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that a TV or a console should not be a babysitter, but it's a privilege for a kid to have two adults that are in the same household as them, invested in raising them, and sometimes if they have to work full-time jobs to do what's necessary to run that household,

1013
01:20:49,142 --> 01:20:54,964
[SPEAKER_12]: A console or TV will be a babysitter for four or five hours a day, and I don't really think that that's negligent to do so.

1014
01:20:55,484 --> 01:21:05,308
[SPEAKER_12]: And even if the parents had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff, it doesn't necessarily mean the 10-year-old doesn't know how to crack their parents' password and lock it themselves.

1015
01:21:05,608 --> 01:21:08,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they're not idiots at 10.

1016
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:13,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's true, you know, but don't fucking buy him an Xbox Live subscription.

1017
01:21:14,993 --> 01:21:18,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not buy a 10-year-old an Xbox Live subscription, ever.

1018
01:21:19,516 --> 01:21:22,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're going to get one for yourself, password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house.

1019
01:21:22,998 --> 01:21:23,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dangerous.

1020
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:31,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and if the kid still cracks the password, there shouldn't be icky 20-plus, 30-plus-year-old pedos creeping on him.

1021
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:35,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's still absolutely true, and I'm still in support of that, but I'm just saying, you know.

1022
01:21:37,586 --> 01:21:39,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here.

1023
01:21:40,907 --> 01:21:41,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1024
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:43,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1025
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:46,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to a time when Xbox Live didn't exist.

1026
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:48,429
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't have these complicated situations.

1027
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Although the Nintendo did still babysit us a little bit.

1028
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week, an old computer would babysit.

1029
01:21:56,591 --> 01:21:57,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so here's the deal.

1030
01:21:57,672 --> 01:21:58,832
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's not here tonight.

1031
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:01,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week, but we're taking over!

1032
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:03,324
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1033
01:22:20,445 --> 01:22:20,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1034
01:22:21,386 --> 01:22:23,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I picked a game from the Commodore 64.

1035
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:25,530
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1036
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:30,955
[SPEAKER_10]: The game I've picked tonight as tonight's classic game of the week is Impossible Mission.

1037
01:22:30,975 --> 01:22:39,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game, but this game was awesome because it was one of the first games ever to use a voice synthesizer.

1038
01:22:39,944 --> 01:22:40,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And so here you go.

1039
01:22:40,865 --> 01:22:43,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what you would hear when you would start Impossible Mission.

1040
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Another visitor.

1041
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:48,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay awhile.

1042
01:22:49,618 --> 01:22:51,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay forever.

1043
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:53,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay wild, stay forever

1044
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:16,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we even hear the thing?

1045
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,474
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the sound effects and stuff in this game is very ambient.

1046
01:23:22,454 --> 01:23:23,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no music.

1047
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:26,236
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no music, so you just have some very ambient noises.

1048
01:23:26,296 --> 01:23:27,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to turn it up a little bit there.

1049
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:30,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so anyway, here is the deal.

1050
01:23:30,377 --> 01:23:36,680
[SPEAKER_10]: In Impossible Mission, not to be confused with Mission Impossible, wink wink, nudge nudge, the big show from the 60s.

1051
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:41,962
[SPEAKER_10]: In Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent, not to be confused with 007.

1052
01:23:43,303 --> 01:23:50,369
[SPEAKER_10]: that is trying to stop an evil genius, Elvin Attenbender, is tampering with national security computers.

1053
01:23:50,709 --> 01:24:01,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So you go into the stronghold, and you race against the clock to search for pieces, which in turn will make a password while you avoid deadly, electrocuting, face-eating robots.

1054
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:03,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they don't eat your face, but they will electrocute you.

1055
01:24:04,501 --> 01:24:04,781
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1056
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:10,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And you will sometimes fall down bottomless pits, and all you'll hear is, ahhh!

1057
01:24:14,557 --> 01:24:14,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1058
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:16,218
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the chorus going on now.

1059
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:24,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you finally put the password pieces together, you'll put the completed password in the main control room door, and that's where you find the evil professor.

1060
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you find password pieces?

1061
01:24:26,841 --> 01:24:28,241
[SPEAKER_10]: In the furniture, of course.

1062
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:30,062
[SPEAKER_10]: You search the furniture in the rooms.

1063
01:24:30,102 --> 01:24:32,803
[SPEAKER_10]: You might find lift resets and snoozes in the rooms as well.

1064
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:38,404
[SPEAKER_10]: You also will have a room where you can get more lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle.

1065
01:24:39,305 --> 01:24:39,665
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1066
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:41,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1067
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:02,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Rogue apparently was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts.

1068
01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:04,476
[SPEAKER_10]: The designer cited Rogue.

1069
01:25:04,496 --> 01:25:08,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember the old, old-ass Rogue game that was on like terminals back in the day?

1070
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:12,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that I've played an original Rogue, but I've played a million Roguelikes.

1071
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:14,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, well then you kind of know what the deal is there.

1072
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is the speech that is in the game.

1073
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,121
[SPEAKER_10]: There is the death scream, which can also be heard in Beachhead 2.

1074
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,361
[SPEAKER_10]: They recycled the death scream.

1075
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,002
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another visitor.

1076
01:25:28,282 --> 01:25:29,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay a while.

1077
01:25:29,322 --> 01:25:30,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay forever.

1078
01:25:30,723 --> 01:25:34,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's also, destroy him, my robots.

1079
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:37,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Which happens in the very first room you walk into in Never Again, correct?

1080
01:25:38,665 --> 01:25:39,565
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a randomized room.

1081
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:40,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1082
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:44,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's also, when the game is over, there's a laugh.

1083
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if you find him, he'll say, no, no, no.

1084
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:53,508
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's a lady voice that says, mission accomplished, congratulations.

1085
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,828
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all the speech in the game.

1086
01:25:54,969 --> 01:26:01,190
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days.

1087
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,749
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1088
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:24,371
[SPEAKER_10]: You get six hours to beat the game, 36 puzzle pieces.

1089
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:28,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time you die, 10 minutes are deducted from the total time.

1090
01:26:29,135 --> 01:26:32,057
[SPEAKER_10]: This game was ported like mad.

1091
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:43,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on the Apple II, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System.

1092
01:26:44,145 --> 01:26:45,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Not all of them had speech though.

1093
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:53,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Get this, the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that made the game impossible to win.

1094
01:26:54,495 --> 01:26:56,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So it really was impossible mission.

1095
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:59,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody took the game name too literally there.

1096
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like level 30 syndrome started a bit earlier than we thought.

1097
01:27:02,423 --> 01:27:02,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1098
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:10,447
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a sequel called Impossible Mission 2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold.

1099
01:27:11,088 --> 01:27:15,550
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a 3D sequel planned for Epyx's Handy System.

1100
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:18,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys know, but Epyx was going to launch their own system.

1101
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:20,512
[SPEAKER_10]: It eventually became the Atari Lynx.

1102
01:27:21,433 --> 01:27:22,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So that didn't happen.

1103
01:27:24,014 --> 01:27:30,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Impossible Mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga, which was kind of the similar gameplay.

1104
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Impossible Mission did show up later.

1105
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:39,647
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2004, it was on the Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV, and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004, and the Sony PSP in 2008.

1106
01:27:40,407 --> 01:27:40,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Get that.

1107
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:51,454
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is also available on the Wii Virtual Console, but only in Europe, because the Commodore 64 was a fucking huge deal in Europe.

1108
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:53,355
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of big here, but it was huge in Europe.

1109
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:55,816
[SPEAKER_10]: April 11, 2008 is when it came out there.

1110
01:27:56,597 --> 01:28:02,240
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of those games, this is the game in my opinion, and I'm obviously very age-biased myself.

1111
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:12,111
[SPEAKER_08]: and that it's gotten better with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just like running, jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things.

1112
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: You had no idea what the fuck you were doing, right?

1113
01:28:14,133 --> 01:28:18,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I can ride lifts up and down and side to side and sometimes not even that and couldn't always figure it out.

1114
01:28:19,118 --> 01:28:21,381
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that I've grown up and matured

1115
01:28:22,057 --> 01:28:26,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually understand what's going on and what I have to do, and this game is freaking hard!

1116
01:28:26,818 --> 01:28:33,420
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a good challenge and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to get played again.

1117
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:49,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have not beaten the game to this day, but knowing what I have to do, going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64 version under emulation, I've been making an active try to do it and come up short so far, but I've still had a lot of fun doing it.

1118
01:28:50,134 --> 01:28:53,416
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Sky, do you think Impossible Mission could ever get remade?

1119
01:28:53,496 --> 01:29:04,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones, but... Yeah, the Wii version and all those modern consoles, I would call it a remake because it's not just like improved graphics.

1120
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:09,023
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of aspects of the game change.

1121
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:18,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you don't pick up numbers, you pick up puzzle pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map, security code, something or other, right?

1122
01:29:19,048 --> 01:29:20,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it.

1123
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:24,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's technically already happened, but not in a significant way.

1124
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:30,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there would be a brilliant use on, like, let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network of multiplayer.

1125
01:29:30,435 --> 01:29:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine if you and three other people all attacked the same citadel at the same time?

1126
01:29:34,857 --> 01:29:51,048
[SPEAKER_10]: and like you could maybe see the shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization element in it and everything I think for like old school fans I think there's really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made these other ports

1127
01:29:51,567 --> 01:29:53,307
[SPEAKER_08]: for some very obvious reasons perhaps.

1128
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be giving me the rights to do this franchise.

1129
01:29:56,728 --> 01:30:02,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I know nothing about game or programming games, I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live?

1130
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:04,570
[SPEAKER_10]: You could like do multiplayer, co-op and competitive.

1131
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,250
[SPEAKER_10]: You do co-op where you're both collecting puzzle pieces.

1132
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a great franchise.

1133
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:19,193
[SPEAKER_08]: One person manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning the furniture and everything else.

1134
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,613
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of potential, absolutely.

1135
01:30:20,953 --> 01:30:27,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there it is, your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64, where it all started, although it's available in a shitload of systems after that.

1136
01:30:27,283 --> 01:30:29,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Impossible Mission.

1137
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Commodore 64, your classic game of the week.

1138
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha, DarkSakura.

1139
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:34,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha.

1140
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:39,436
[SPEAKER_10]: took your other classic game and just threw it out the window.

1141
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:41,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, she'll bring it back next week.

1142
01:30:41,117 --> 01:30:41,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I know she will.

1143
01:30:42,118 --> 01:30:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

1144
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:45,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Considering what the game is, it would just float to safety.

1145
01:30:47,121 --> 01:30:48,281
[SPEAKER_10]: There's your hint for next week.

1146
01:30:48,642 --> 01:30:48,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1147
01:30:49,642 --> 01:30:52,224
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1148
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:53,945
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got plenty more to come in the second half of the show.

1149
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:55,927
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk a little more about PAX East.

1150
01:30:55,947 --> 01:30:57,728
[SPEAKER_10]: We're expecting to get a phone call a little later in the show.

1151
01:30:57,748 --> 01:31:00,250
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk about PAX East with some of the OLR listeners that was there.

1152
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:01,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not ignoring PAX East.

1153
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:04,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I live in California and didn't fly out there this year.

1154
01:31:04,513 --> 01:31:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure there's lots that's going to be said about PAX East.

1155
01:31:07,836 --> 01:31:15,662
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have more news, your Fugle Question of the Week, more phone calls, and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1156
01:31:22,896 --> 01:31:31,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this April the 8th of 2012 with the 453rd episode of our show.

1157
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:37,999
[SPEAKER_10]: A little weird tonight because we're not missing just one but two co-hosts, but we have two fantastic co-hosts sitting in tonight.

1158
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:40,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Alan, of course, and Jason filling in.

1159
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:40,959
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me.

1160
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:47,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I promised you guys could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just co-host here, but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do.

1161
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:49,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, we'll start with you.

1162
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:51,001
[SPEAKER_10]: You mentioned you do an Apple-related thing.

1163
01:31:51,229 --> 01:32:07,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a network of nerd topic goodness called Stack Exchange, and myself, I'm quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called Ask Different, and so myself and two others started up the Ask Different podcast, and we've been going since...

1164
01:32:09,668 --> 01:32:12,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say last summer, but suddenly that feels wrong for some reason.

1165
01:32:12,591 --> 01:32:15,013
[SPEAKER_08]: But AskDifferent podcast, pretty easy to search for.

1166
01:32:15,554 --> 01:32:17,215
[SPEAKER_08]: AskDifferent.com is the site.

1167
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:23,702
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's links to blog, chat, finding us, finding the site itself, and all that content there.

1168
01:32:23,942 --> 01:32:24,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty simple.

1169
01:32:24,822 --> 01:32:27,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming that's a little pun on the think different.

1170
01:32:27,423 --> 01:32:30,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that was the name chosen for the site.

1171
01:32:30,183 --> 01:32:35,385
[SPEAKER_08]: The highest voted name to actually call the site.

1172
01:32:36,305 --> 01:32:40,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I could rant for like 30 minutes on how we came to that name, but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic.

1173
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And you really do have a great radio voice.

1174
01:32:42,386 --> 01:32:44,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not just saying that because you're here, but I mean, it's convenient.

1175
01:32:44,607 --> 01:32:46,407
[SPEAKER_10]: But you do have a great radio voice.

1176
01:32:46,447 --> 01:32:49,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only imagine the Ask Different podcast is great.

1177
01:32:49,628 --> 01:32:50,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1178
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:55,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as exciting and hilarious as this show is, at least 99% of the time.

1179
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:57,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we get in a good pun.

1180
01:32:57,562 --> 01:32:58,182
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1181
01:32:58,222 --> 01:32:59,442
[SPEAKER_10]: This show can be pretty boring, too.

1182
01:32:59,482 --> 01:33:00,042
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1183
01:33:00,062 --> 01:33:01,103
[SPEAKER_10]: This show's always amazing.

1184
01:33:01,183 --> 01:33:01,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Always.

1185
01:33:02,283 --> 01:33:09,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, you now, in the time that you have been your last guest co-hosting on this program, you now have your own podcast, right?

1186
01:33:09,225 --> 01:33:11,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I've branched out of the OLR network.

1187
01:33:11,805 --> 01:33:13,846
[SPEAKER_10]: How very dare I. How very dare you.

1188
01:33:14,807 --> 01:33:17,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised you weren't banned from this program, actually.

1189
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:22,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to sleep on the couch for a week, so don't pretend you didn't make me do that.

1190
01:33:22,855 --> 01:33:27,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I am on a podcast called Fabulous Flames, and it is a World of Warcraft podcast.

1191
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:31,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe, I guess, a competitor of Horde House?

1192
01:33:31,484 --> 01:33:31,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1193
01:33:35,183 --> 01:33:39,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I was invited to be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on Horde House.

1194
01:33:39,885 --> 01:33:40,826
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's three of us.

1195
01:33:41,586 --> 01:33:45,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just, I guess, World of Warcraft from a male point of view.

1196
01:33:45,649 --> 01:33:47,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really know what the gimmick is.

1197
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,811
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a gay WoW podcast.

1198
01:33:49,851 --> 01:33:50,931
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what the gimmick is.

1199
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:56,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And Fabulous Flames is an actual spell from an encounter from this latest expansion.

1200
01:33:57,155 --> 01:34:02,598
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's the gay dragon that was originally supposed to sound like Paul Lynn from Match Game.

1201
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,259
[SPEAKER_12]: and Blizzard cut his voice acting.

1202
01:34:05,619 --> 01:34:07,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Our listeners are too young to get that reference, honey.

1203
01:34:07,899 --> 01:34:10,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So Blizzard cut his voice acting going, no, this is not good.

1204
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:16,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames basking them.

1205
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:23,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at Fabulous Flames on Twitter and FabulousFlames.com or on iTunes.

1206
01:34:23,844 --> 01:34:27,525
[SPEAKER_10]: How very dare you work that tagline into the show.

1207
01:34:27,845 --> 01:34:29,906
[SPEAKER_08]: One gay dragons, two talking dragons?

1208
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:34,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Is my lack of wow biting me somewhere here?

1209
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:36,050
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Twilight Dragon Twins.

1210
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,171
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a brother and sister.

1211
01:34:37,611 --> 01:34:39,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And the brother is on fire.

1212
01:34:40,433 --> 01:34:43,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've often... Obviously, I have a side project.

1213
01:34:43,436 --> 01:34:48,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not just Orange Lawn Studio, but I have a podcast about the World of Warcraft called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

1214
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And our tagline is, it's all things World of Warcraft, but never too seriously.

1215
01:34:53,763 --> 01:34:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, that's what we've got.

1216
01:34:56,465 --> 01:34:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And I often get asked the question...

1217
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:02,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it weird that you and your boyfriend are on competing podcasts?

1218
01:35:03,012 --> 01:35:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, no, because I support all independent podcasts.

1219
01:35:07,837 --> 01:35:10,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I've been preaching on Orange Launch Radio for years.

1220
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:13,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So I fucking love it that he's doing his own show.

1221
01:35:13,944 --> 01:35:14,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

1222
01:35:14,684 --> 01:35:15,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1223
01:35:18,382 --> 01:35:19,083
[SPEAKER_12]: FABULOUS FLAMES

1224
01:35:40,742 --> 01:35:43,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I have all these names for fabulous vibes.

1225
01:35:43,623 --> 01:35:44,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I call them the fabulous flops.

1226
01:35:45,724 --> 01:35:47,526
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my favorite name for them.

1227
01:35:48,586 --> 01:35:50,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, there you go.

1228
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:55,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I really do think it's great.

1229
01:35:55,290 --> 01:36:00,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people I know that listen to podcasts listen at work, and they've got plenty of time to listen to plenty of shows.

1230
01:36:00,853 --> 01:36:07,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I would rather somebody be listening to an independent podcast than some of that crap that certain websites that won't be named produce.

1231
01:36:07,778 --> 01:36:08,298
[SPEAKER_10]: We do try to be funny.

1232
01:36:08,678 --> 01:36:09,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you try.

1233
01:36:09,879 --> 01:36:11,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

1234
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:13,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to dig in one more.

1235
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

1236
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:15,401
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1237
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:16,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, so there you go.

1238
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:19,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I want to do shout-outs for PAX East.

1239
01:36:20,103 --> 01:36:27,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Since we're giving other shows shout-outs, I do want to say I heard little bits and pieces of what the B-Team, which is one of the other shows on the All Games Network, did.

1240
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:29,348
[SPEAKER_10]: They were live at PAX East.

1241
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:31,189
[SPEAKER_10]: and did some good shows.

1242
01:36:31,429 --> 01:36:32,570
[SPEAKER_10]: So check that out.

1243
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:38,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I also know Electric Sisterhood, which is also on the All Games Network, did a show while they were there.

1244
01:36:38,295 --> 01:36:42,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it was live, but maybe it was.

1245
01:36:42,098 --> 01:36:42,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

1246
01:36:42,718 --> 01:36:43,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, girls.

1247
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:48,423
[SPEAKER_10]: But they did one, and it will be on their podcast feed and on the network this week for sure.

1248
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:53,487
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I heard Ranma, who calls in this show all the time and will be on the show tonight, guested on it.

1249
01:36:53,608 --> 01:36:56,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm glad to see the All Games Network, big happy family.

1250
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:57,591
[SPEAKER_10]: getting together at PAX.

1251
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:02,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great year.

1252
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:10,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man, that was like one of my favorite cons ever was that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there and we were broadcasting.

1253
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:11,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a great year.

1254
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:35,594
[SPEAKER_10]: but I did go to PAX East the first year a couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to PAX Prime this year if nothing else all right Rob advertised real far advertising the all games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise

1255
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:38,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no good response to that.

1256
01:37:40,361 --> 01:37:47,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say something bitchy about one of the corporate networks, but I'm not going to go there and I'm just going to ask that we go for some rapid fire news.

1257
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:49,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know what's funny about that?

1258
01:37:50,813 --> 01:37:54,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on a loaner laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out.

1259
01:37:54,637 --> 01:38:00,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can tell you the first story, purely from recollection, is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid-May.

1260
01:38:01,779 --> 01:38:03,719
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the next question for the Great Dungeon Crawl?

1261
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:04,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Torchlight.

1262
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,320
[SPEAKER_08]: When is it?

1263
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,520
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't said yet.

1264
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon.

1265
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:07,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon.

1266
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Shortly after Diablo 3, which is still soon, but not soon enough.

1267
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:14,322
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to give me the headlines of the next two?

1268
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:18,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can... Oh, what?

1269
01:38:18,783 --> 01:38:19,163
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1270
01:38:21,472 --> 01:38:27,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the, what is that, midsummer, July 3rd?

1271
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:29,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1272
01:38:29,376 --> 01:38:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Game was actually completely off my radar, but looking at the screenshots looks fun.

1273
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:46,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get a particular amount of amusement of the fact that Cloudstripe's face was completely obscured in the one screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the, or the note exceeding the target zone, whatever the particular vocabulary is for that.

1274
01:38:46,403 --> 01:38:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1275
01:38:47,923 --> 01:39:09,171
[SPEAKER_10]: and finally Sega says Rhythm Thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody save my poor dead air ass there was they were on the PAX East Sega was at PAX East and there was confirmation that Rhythm Thief is still happening this is despite all the Sega bad news we had last week

1276
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:28,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm Thief was not cancelled so it is still happening it's a 3DS rhythm action game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on disco floors there you go alright some other rapid fire news for you guys Fallout the original not the Fallout 3 which was still really good but the original original game way back in the day

1277
01:39:29,202 --> 01:39:49,856
[SPEAKER_10]: was free I say was because you missed it it was on good old games or gog.com uh it was earlier this week unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free fallout which is a great great pc you're a pc gaming fan I know you know the fallout series um

1278
01:39:50,556 --> 01:40:02,161
[SPEAKER_10]: also it's worth mentioning since we brought up GOG they threw a little shade at Steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give these games away for such a low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I thought was an interesting little dig

1279
01:40:04,395 --> 01:40:07,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but I can't imagine.

1280
01:40:07,517 --> 01:40:14,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, EA fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and only sell things to their own platform.

1281
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:24,790
[SPEAKER_12]: But if a game developer is letting Steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99, I don't think Valve is twisting their arm.

1282
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:25,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1283
01:40:26,131 --> 01:40:31,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Zether's in our chatroom talking about the Sega stuff, saying, I hope to God we get Phantasy Star Online 2 here.

1284
01:40:31,655 --> 01:40:33,496
[SPEAKER_10]: If that gets canned, I will explode.

1285
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear ya.

1286
01:40:34,957 --> 01:40:37,659
[SPEAKER_10]: That character creator came out this week, um, overseas.

1287
01:40:37,759 --> 01:40:40,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, you know, but the game hasn't been announced for the US.

1288
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:46,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Cross your fingers and your toes we get an E3 announcement, because if you don't hear it at E3, it's probably not happening.

1289
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:48,519
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what is happening though?

1290
01:40:48,559 --> 01:40:50,000
[SPEAKER_10]: A Civ 5 expansion.

1291
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Civilization 5 Gods and Kings.

1292
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:57,323
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be coming out on June 19th is the release date for that.

1293
01:40:58,103 --> 01:40:59,623
[SPEAKER_10]: 22nd if you're international.

1294
01:41:00,984 --> 01:41:09,607
[SPEAKER_10]: There was more information announced about this at Game Developers Conference, but in case you forgot, 27 new units, 13 new buildings, 9 new wonders and civilization.

1295
01:41:09,947 --> 01:41:14,669
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to diplomacy.

1296
01:41:15,209 --> 01:41:19,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked in the game to begin with.

1297
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:27,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But if any of my Civ friends are listening, we're going to need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm eager to revisit the game again.

1298
01:41:27,898 --> 01:41:30,459
[SPEAKER_10]: But God, you know how those Civ V matches will go.

1299
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:33,782
[SPEAKER_10]: You start it at 6 o'clock in the evening and then suddenly, oh shit, it's 2 a.m.

1300
01:41:33,822 --> 01:41:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: and we just discovered railroads.

1301
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:48,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Another story this week, Epic Games, you know Epic Games, they make, well, you know, Epic Games, including Unreal and the Gears of War.

1302
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the deal, they have announced, sort of, that they're doing a PC exclusive project.

1303
01:41:55,724 --> 01:41:58,065
[SPEAKER_10]: It was mentioned during a PAX East panel.

1304
01:41:58,806 --> 01:42:01,688
[SPEAKER_10]: The unannounced PC project is under development.

1305
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,670
[SPEAKER_10]: The plans are to keep the game exclusive to the PC.

1306
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:12,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if you were worried that Epic was all about the consoles and, I don't know, iOS games now, because that's the other big thing they did, right?

1307
01:42:12,775 --> 01:42:13,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Infinity Blade.

1308
01:42:14,096 --> 01:42:16,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, a PC exclusive title is in the works.

1309
01:42:17,758 --> 01:42:18,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, could be interesting.

1310
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:20,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan?

1311
01:42:23,499 --> 01:42:35,562
[SPEAKER_12]: There has been an online petition for the game Dark Souls, the sequel to Demon's Souls, otherwise known as one of the hardest console games ever this generation.

1312
01:42:37,082 --> 01:42:50,786
[SPEAKER_12]: The petition's been to bring it on to the PC platform, and Atlas has come out and said, yes, there will be a PC edition of Dark Souls, and it's called the Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition.

1313
01:42:52,346 --> 01:42:56,427
[SPEAKER_12]: to which anyone that's played the game would say very much yes, you will die.

1314
01:42:58,508 --> 01:43:05,750
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of hype in the last few weeks about the game Journey, I believe it is, that sort of has an online element, if that's correct.

1315
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:12,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Demon's Souls was similar in that when you were fighting in these labyrinths, you would fight these ghouls that were actually other players.

1316
01:43:13,652 --> 01:43:18,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic, or sorry, Dark Souls has a similar mechanic

1317
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:38,535
[SPEAKER_12]: so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so

1318
01:43:40,557 --> 01:43:44,139
[SPEAKER_12]: So Dark Souls fans on PC, you're in luck.

1319
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:55,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Skyrim 1.5 patch, which I was surprised when I read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a couple weeks now, is hitting 360 and PS3 this week.

1320
01:43:58,424 --> 01:44:06,646
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's mostly bug fixes at least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests.

1321
01:44:07,727 --> 01:44:24,751
[SPEAKER_12]: The big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's adding kill moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new kill moves for melee weapons.

1322
01:44:25,231 --> 01:44:32,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So now not only can you behead people, you can fry them, you can shoot arrows through their necks, and all that other stuff you saw in Shaky Cam Hunger Games.

1323
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:33,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1324
01:44:34,093 --> 01:44:40,274
[SPEAKER_12]: They fixed what it looks like when you go underwater, and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug.

1325
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:50,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Lydia's the first guard woman that you get, and when you buy a house, if you're wearing an amulet of Mara, you should be able to propose to her.

1326
01:44:51,017 --> 01:44:52,097
[SPEAKER_12]: She's been bugged this whole time.

1327
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:55,140
[SPEAKER_12]: since November or whatever.

1328
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So finally they fixed the Lydia bug.

1329
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:01,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so look for that on Xbox and PS3 this week.

1330
01:45:02,308 --> 01:45:13,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, Sonic 4 Episode 2, the big 2D HD resurgence of the Sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an elevator.

1331
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:16,363
[SPEAKER_12]: is getting its episode two.

1332
01:45:17,364 --> 01:45:18,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's like, it sounds so awesome.

1333
01:45:18,725 --> 01:45:21,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it came out and it's no one care.

1334
01:45:21,787 --> 01:45:26,350
[SPEAKER_12]: It is finally getting its episode two and it will likely be the last episode.

1335
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:29,352
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are wrapping this up really fast.

1336
01:45:29,812 --> 01:45:32,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Episode of content is the way of the future.

1337
01:45:32,814 --> 01:45:35,756
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll give you a part two because no one liked this shit and we don't want to make it anymore.

1338
01:45:36,397 --> 01:45:37,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Gabe Newell.

1339
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:58,122
[SPEAKER_12]: PSN version will be released on May 15th XBLA version of Sonic 4 Episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess confirmed but to be announced later yeah that's all let's go to the Fugle question of the week

1340
01:45:59,179 --> 01:46:03,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, we won't go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1341
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: One quick thing I missed in the theatrhythm story.

1342
01:46:07,002 --> 01:46:09,922
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're at PAX East, you can go check out the... Oh, wait, sorry, never mind.

1343
01:46:10,303 --> 01:46:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over.

1344
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:11,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1345
01:46:12,043 --> 01:46:12,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a joke.

1346
01:46:12,863 --> 01:46:13,884
[SPEAKER_10]: May I do the Fugle now?

1347
01:46:14,104 --> 01:46:14,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1348
01:46:21,932 --> 01:46:25,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week we ask you guys a question over at Facebook or Google+.

1349
01:46:25,273 --> 01:46:27,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook, put them together, that's Google, that's where it comes from.

1350
01:46:27,854 --> 01:46:32,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to like us over there and Google+.

1351
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:36,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio because we don't get short URLs there.

1352
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:42,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start with Google+, because the very first answer on Google+, I need to read this because it has something very important in it.

1353
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I should tell you guys what the question was.

1354
01:46:46,802 --> 01:46:52,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like I forgot to tell you what the question was just then, I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week, so I made it really easy this week.

1355
01:46:52,966 --> 01:46:54,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, how was your gaming week?

1356
01:46:55,288 --> 01:47:00,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, we all say every night how our gaming weeks were, the hosts of the show, so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot?

1357
01:47:00,571 --> 01:47:01,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So how was your gaming week, listeners?

1358
01:47:03,078 --> 01:47:06,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I especially said, what game are you into right now that everybody else should be playing?

1359
01:47:07,039 --> 01:47:10,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So Derek H starts us off on Google+, and this is worth mentioning.

1360
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:17,722
[SPEAKER_10]: He's playing Pinball Arcade on Xbox Live Arcade, but everyone should be playing Joust on MAME as part of The Hunt.

1361
01:47:18,322 --> 01:47:19,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And I totally forgot to mention this.

1362
01:47:20,283 --> 01:47:22,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so bad, and I had notes to myself to mention this.

1363
01:47:23,664 --> 01:47:28,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Partly because I had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week, after last week's show.

1364
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:38,881
[SPEAKER_10]: But DarkTetsuya, who pretty much writes most of the articles on OrangeLaunchRadio.com at this point, it's either him or Actdeft or me publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point.

1365
01:47:39,401 --> 01:47:42,164
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya is doing a little contest and it's called The Hunt.

1366
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:47,548
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's based off of the book Ready Player One where they kind of do something very similar.

1367
01:47:47,588 --> 01:47:49,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to go into all the details.

1368
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:52,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition called The Hunt.

1369
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:58,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And it involves classic video games and being able to get scores that are better than what DarkTetsuya gets.

1370
01:47:58,878 --> 01:48:03,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And he doesn't really try super hard because he makes it beatable.

1371
01:48:03,442 --> 01:48:05,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now the contest he's running is Joust.

1372
01:48:05,544 --> 01:48:18,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can beat a score of 39,000 something, so I think it's 39,800, you take a screen cap of it and either email it to Dark Tetsuya or you post it on Twitter and you're going to get a little copper key and some points that lead you into the next round of the competition.

1373
01:48:18,957 --> 01:48:39,242
[SPEAKER_10]: so Joust is the game that they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping Dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't reading the website you may have missed or seen the Twitter you may have missed this so I'm telling you guys now if you have Joust be it in MAME or Xbox Live or whatever fire it up

1374
01:48:39,822 --> 01:48:50,074
[SPEAKER_10]: get the score and go on to the next round of the competition because as I understand it right now Derek H is in the lead and well we just we can't we have to give this a competition you guys

1375
01:48:51,414 --> 01:48:54,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Derek H is the guy behind the big battle and all that stuff.

1376
01:48:54,056 --> 01:48:57,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to give him a challenge here.

1377
01:48:57,398 --> 01:48:59,119
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to let him just walk away with everything.

1378
01:48:59,179 --> 01:49:00,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So I submitted my entry today.

1379
01:49:02,021 --> 01:49:04,602
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to try to play in future weeks as well.

1380
01:49:04,743 --> 01:49:15,629
[SPEAKER_10]: So more information is available on OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now Derek H also wants to plug You Will Die on Xbox Live Indie Games because I get money when people buy it.

1381
01:49:17,048 --> 01:49:17,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well played.

1382
01:49:17,669 --> 01:49:18,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I see what you did there.

1383
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:20,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, You Will Die is a fun game, though.

1384
01:49:20,632 --> 01:49:22,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you like, you know, your retro shooters.

1385
01:49:22,454 --> 01:49:22,975
[SPEAKER_10]: He did a good job.

1386
01:49:23,095 --> 01:49:23,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I did buy it.

1387
01:49:24,597 --> 01:49:29,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought it, like, two years ago when it first came out, so he's probably long spent the money, but I did buy it.

1388
01:49:30,864 --> 01:49:35,770
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, PWK responded and said, I was at my first PAX this weekend.

1389
01:49:36,633 --> 01:49:37,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

1390
01:49:38,335 --> 01:49:39,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you had fun.

1391
01:49:39,135 --> 01:49:39,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to hear more about it.

1392
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:48,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony M responded and said, this is an oldie, but after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads, I've been playing Persona 3 Portable.

1393
01:49:48,744 --> 01:49:50,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs.

1394
01:49:51,146 --> 01:49:56,631
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Persona is one of the series I hear nothing but good things about, but I just, I personally haven't sat down and played it myself.

1395
01:49:57,031 --> 01:50:01,415
[SPEAKER_10]: But like, I said the same thing about Mass Effect a few months ago on the show.

1396
01:50:01,915 --> 01:50:04,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really played it myself, but I hear a lot of people are really into it.

1397
01:50:04,838 --> 01:50:08,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Persona, one of these days, I'm going to sit down and play it.

1398
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect.

1399
01:50:10,824 --> 01:50:11,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Play Persona.

1400
01:50:11,484 --> 01:50:12,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a series that interests you at all?

1401
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you did play it before, though, didn't you?

1402
01:50:14,707 --> 01:50:20,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I have Persona 3 and 4 for PS2 that I think might still be shrink-wrapped on this show.

1403
01:50:20,893 --> 01:50:21,734
Ha ha ha!

1404
01:50:23,214 --> 01:50:25,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to Facebook and read some of the answers there.

1405
01:50:25,817 --> 01:50:26,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of replies on Facebook.

1406
01:50:26,978 --> 01:50:33,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't possibly read these all, but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these.

1407
01:50:33,805 --> 01:50:34,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, another Persona.

1408
01:50:35,067 --> 01:50:38,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Austin W. says, Right now I'm really into Persona 4 on PlayStation 2.

1409
01:50:38,991 --> 01:50:44,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who is a fan of JRPGs, dungeon crawlers, and the social character interaction aspect of games should check it out.

1410
01:50:45,738 --> 01:50:46,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1411
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:58,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to Stan says, splitting my time between Draw Something, Angry Bird Space, Pushmo on 3DS, and more Soul Calibur 5 online, trying to show off my creative souls.

1412
01:51:00,215 --> 01:51:03,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Chad C responds and says, been playing Realm of the Mad God.

1413
01:51:04,056 --> 01:51:07,597
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an MMORPG shooter with 85 player groups.

1414
01:51:08,297 --> 01:51:08,577
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1415
01:51:09,497 --> 01:51:10,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Free to play on your browser.

1416
01:51:10,857 --> 01:51:11,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Also on Steam.

1417
01:51:11,877 --> 01:51:12,878
[SPEAKER_10]: 35 meg download.

1418
01:51:12,898 --> 01:51:14,138
[SPEAKER_10]: 8-bit graphics.

1419
01:51:14,598 --> 01:51:22,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Permadeath kind of sucks when your guy you logged 30 plus hours on dies, but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing more.

1420
01:51:22,919 --> 01:51:23,120
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1421
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Permadeath in an MMO?

1422
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,220
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

1423
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you hit level 20, you start gaining fame, which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons.

1424
01:51:31,043 --> 01:51:32,284
[SPEAKER_10]: The final boss is Onyx.

1425
01:51:32,424 --> 01:51:37,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests are completed on your realm, and someone kills 2,500 mobs.

1426
01:51:37,967 --> 01:51:43,891
[SPEAKER_10]: The game isn't over when he dies, however, because you can keep gaining fame to unlock harder dungeons and get better loots.

1427
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:46,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know this game, but it sounds crazy.

1428
01:51:47,573 --> 01:51:50,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep bumping into it, but I haven't really taken the plunge myself.

1429
01:51:50,515 --> 01:51:50,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

1430
01:51:51,576 --> 01:52:02,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you knew there were going to be some people talking about Xenoblade this week, so we have Barry M. Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG game, much in the vein of Final Fantasy XII meets White Knight Chronicles.

1431
01:52:02,705 --> 01:52:05,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it, actually.

1432
01:52:06,449 --> 01:52:11,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Also playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita, Kid Icarus Uprising on 3DS, and Tales of Grace's F on PlayStation 3.

1433
01:52:11,673 --> 01:52:13,695
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a great year for RPG fans.

1434
01:52:15,516 --> 01:52:21,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Carlos M says, I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something.

1435
01:52:22,803 --> 01:52:25,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that those two games are like on the same level there.

1436
01:52:25,085 --> 01:52:25,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

1437
01:52:26,506 --> 01:52:28,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Zether simply responds, Xenoblade.

1438
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:30,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone probably knows why.

1439
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:35,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura would kick me if I didn't say, I randomly started playing Portal 2 again.

1440
01:52:36,094 --> 01:52:36,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

1441
01:52:36,755 --> 01:52:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I should be playing Mass Effect.

1442
01:52:38,576 --> 01:52:39,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you should.

1443
01:52:40,711 --> 01:52:42,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to read this comment from Unfolded Raptor.

1444
01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:43,752
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a long one, but it's good.

1445
01:52:44,873 --> 01:52:51,516
[SPEAKER_10]: This past week, the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a liquidation sale and had to sell everything.

1446
01:52:51,836 --> 01:52:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So I found a whole bunch of really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each.

1447
01:52:56,458 --> 01:53:01,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I ended up buying 15 that I never played yet and probably won't for a while.

1448
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:05,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to read all these, but like Twisted Metal, Demon's Souls, Deus Ex, Bulletstorm.

1449
01:53:05,922 --> 01:53:06,703
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a ton in here.

1450
01:53:07,503 --> 01:53:08,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand total of $173.

1451
01:53:09,905 --> 01:53:15,550
[SPEAKER_10]: For those games, it's a steal considering at Walmart and even at the Evil G, the lowest some of these get is around $20.

1452
01:53:16,751 --> 01:53:19,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I highly suggest people play Borderlands if they haven't yet.

1453
01:53:19,673 --> 01:53:20,474
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a ton of fun.

1454
01:53:20,814 --> 01:53:23,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden 3 and have almost finished it.

1455
01:53:24,337 --> 01:53:27,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the hate for it.

1456
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:29,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun.

1457
01:53:30,885 --> 01:53:31,706
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1458
01:53:47,159 --> 01:53:52,662
[SPEAKER_08]: California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse western They all went under already years ago.

1459
01:53:52,762 --> 01:53:54,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Redbox took over years ago here.

1460
01:53:55,283 --> 01:53:58,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only think of where one blockbuster even is.

1461
01:53:58,484 --> 01:54:00,905
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one over on Folsom below that I know of.

1462
01:54:00,965 --> 01:54:02,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep your eye on it for it to go under.

1463
01:54:02,766 --> 01:54:04,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll do that.

1464
01:54:05,789 --> 01:54:07,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It's right next door to Papa Murphy's.

1465
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:10,092
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the only pizza chain I'll eat anymore.

1466
01:54:11,453 --> 01:54:12,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you go.

1467
01:54:12,414 --> 01:54:13,815
[SPEAKER_10]: That was our Fugle Question of the Week.

1468
01:54:14,515 --> 01:54:15,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for responding.

1469
01:54:15,636 --> 01:54:21,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I didn't read them all, but since it was such an easy question, there was more there than ever before.

1470
01:54:22,542 --> 01:54:23,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1471
01:54:23,462 --> 01:54:24,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, more news.

1472
01:54:25,464 --> 01:54:29,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Electronic Arts has been voted the worst American company ever.

1473
01:54:30,008 --> 01:54:31,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, not ever, but just in...

1474
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:35,852
[SPEAKER_08]: 2012.

1475
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:35,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started.

1476
01:54:36,573 --> 01:54:36,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1477
01:54:37,033 --> 01:54:38,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond that.

1478
01:54:38,034 --> 01:54:42,338
[SPEAKER_08]: The Consumers holds an annual tournament to determine the most despised American companies.

1479
01:54:42,778 --> 01:54:47,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Nominations are put to a vote and the ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of the year.

1480
01:54:47,682 --> 01:54:48,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Electronic Arts.

1481
01:54:48,983 --> 01:54:50,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations!

1482
01:54:50,946 --> 01:55:01,118
[SPEAKER_08]: In a poll that took over 250,000 votes, EA beat out the Bank of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead.

1483
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:04,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers.

1484
01:55:05,859 --> 01:55:13,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think EA has ever double withdrawn someone's mortgage payment, and I know people on BFA that have had that happen, so I'm a little skeptical.

1485
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:21,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the study's been going on for a while, but with the timing of the Mass Effect 3 ending, Wank, this seems really...

1486
01:55:21,698 --> 01:55:23,160
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1487
01:55:41,338 --> 01:55:45,180
[SPEAKER_10]: that mostly comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect.

1488
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:47,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And granted, there's the DLC stuff.

1489
01:55:47,901 --> 01:55:54,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not letting EA off easy here, but it's not like they're Capcom.

1490
01:55:55,263 --> 01:56:01,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I think EA's kind of taken the burden for everything that everybody hates with the gaming industry right now.

1491
01:56:01,986 --> 01:56:03,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's kind of said in that statement.

1492
01:56:03,686 --> 01:56:07,728
[SPEAKER_10]: But then what also cracks me up is the people on the consumerist that are like,

1493
01:56:08,308 --> 01:56:09,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking gamers!

1494
01:56:10,111 --> 01:56:12,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking gamers ruining this poll!

1495
01:56:12,575 --> 01:56:17,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company in the world!

1496
01:56:17,382 --> 01:56:19,906
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is wrong with gamers?

1497
01:56:20,127 --> 01:56:23,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously gamers are too poor to own a house, and it's like...

1498
01:56:23,772 --> 01:56:29,456
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, internet polls are really fucking serious business, everybody.

1499
01:56:30,417 --> 01:56:32,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at your lives, look at your choices.

1500
01:56:32,738 --> 01:56:39,143
[SPEAKER_10]: You are all rabble-rabbling over an internet poll on some website.

1501
01:56:41,266 --> 01:56:42,006
[SPEAKER_10]: We ain't done shit.

1502
01:57:08,436 --> 01:57:10,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of this article is a pretty good read.

1503
01:57:10,077 --> 01:57:10,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave it verbatim.

1504
01:57:11,617 --> 01:57:26,482
[SPEAKER_08]: To those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video game company winning the worst company in American vote, it's that exact kind of attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to nickel and dime consumers to death, argues the site.

1505
01:57:26,883 --> 01:57:33,745
[SPEAKER_08]: For years, while movies and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or multiple modes of delivery,

1506
01:57:35,205 --> 01:57:41,451
[SPEAKER_08]: or multiple modes of delivery as added value to entice customers to buy, video games have continued to be priced like premium goods.

1507
01:57:41,912 --> 01:57:48,758
[SPEAKER_08]: For its exploitation of the downloadable content model, the consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy.

1508
01:57:49,118 --> 01:57:56,786
[SPEAKER_08]: The poo is usually presented on a red pillow, but this year the company is sending a choice of colors, mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending.

1509
01:57:58,067 --> 01:57:59,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like the Razzies.

1510
01:57:59,429 --> 01:57:59,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1511
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:11,481
[SPEAKER_08]: As gratuitous as EA's DLC is, I can't help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures or some of the other scummy things the companies in the running did.

1512
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:12,782
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, though.

1513
01:58:13,023 --> 01:58:15,165
[SPEAKER_08]: The internet hath spoken.

1514
01:58:16,266 --> 01:58:17,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, hath was my addition.

1515
01:58:17,808 --> 01:58:19,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It said has, but there you go.

1516
01:58:20,669 --> 01:58:26,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And I loved EA put out some response that was very like, we don't give a fuck.

1517
01:58:26,832 --> 01:58:29,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies.

1518
01:58:30,553 --> 01:58:31,274
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't care.

1519
01:58:31,494 --> 01:58:32,494
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so amazing.

1520
01:58:32,614 --> 01:58:41,558
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was very like, well, I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year.

1521
01:58:42,538 --> 01:59:06,573
[SPEAKER_10]: and then PopCap put out a statement that was like you fucking designed quality games for 30 years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fucking I don't think PopCap would put it that way but it was basically you fucking designed games for 30 years that are quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you but in my opinion that statement as much as I love PopCap I love him a lot but that statement

1522
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:22,285
[SPEAKER_10]: they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this award look at the trends that EA has been starting look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you know

1523
01:59:23,486 --> 01:59:26,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, this whole Mass Effect thing, they're taking some of the brunt on that.

1524
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:31,373
[SPEAKER_08]: EA's... New sports games every year with no discernible difference.

1525
01:59:31,453 --> 01:59:33,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have the exclusive contract for the NFL.

1526
01:59:33,475 --> 01:59:39,501
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably the driving force behind trying to lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle.

1527
01:59:39,561 --> 01:59:40,902
[SPEAKER_10]: You know they want that to happen.

1528
01:59:41,202 --> 01:59:42,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at Origin.

1529
01:59:43,304 --> 01:59:44,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, in Origin.

1530
01:59:45,286 --> 01:59:45,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1531
01:59:46,245 --> 02:00:07,428
[SPEAKER_10]: not wanting to play nice with other gaming companies they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not putting our games out on your system and kind of using that muscle Mass Effect 3 isn't on Steam and you know that it would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your golden poo

1532
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Internet polls are very serious business, clearly.

1533
02:00:11,661 --> 02:00:14,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, there's an interesting follow-up to all this stuff.

1534
02:00:14,282 --> 02:00:22,724
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't directly a follow-up to the same story, but there's always going to be that guy that asks, what about all the good things EA did?

1535
02:00:23,525 --> 02:00:27,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, EA had a couple big stories this week that were some good news.

1536
02:00:27,706 --> 02:00:28,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's cover them.

1537
02:00:29,467 --> 02:00:33,548
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them, which I think all of you have got to be aware of by now, but it is out there,

1538
02:00:34,788 --> 02:00:39,489
[SPEAKER_10]: They have announced that there will be Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut.

1539
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:44,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect 3 DLC Extended Cut is coming out.

1540
02:00:44,931 --> 02:00:46,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be coming out this summer.

1541
02:00:46,992 --> 02:00:51,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans.

1542
02:00:51,933 --> 02:00:54,594
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to bring closure to the ending.

1543
02:00:55,174 --> 02:00:59,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a nice PC way of saying we're going to fix the goddamn ending then?

1544
02:00:59,095 --> 02:00:59,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

1545
02:00:59,995 --> 02:01:02,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the big thing about it that I gotta admit even caught me by surprise.

1546
02:01:03,097 --> 02:01:03,757
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be free.

1547
02:01:04,798 --> 02:01:08,960
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be free through April of 2014 or something like that.

1548
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:20,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And even then, BioWare said they only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it.

1549
02:01:20,672 --> 02:01:43,984
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's free because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's additional content but it's not playable

1550
02:01:45,575 --> 02:01:46,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Wall of Text

1551
02:02:08,634 --> 02:02:08,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1552
02:02:28,789 --> 02:02:32,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not a new ending, which is what people are demanding.

1553
02:02:32,652 --> 02:02:35,073
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, throw the shit that you put in the game out.

1554
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:37,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us something completely different.

1555
02:02:37,535 --> 02:02:38,276
[SPEAKER_10]: But they won't do that.

1556
02:02:38,296 --> 02:02:42,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Bioware's like, no, this is our artistic point of view.

1557
02:02:42,619 --> 02:02:45,861
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not a different ending and it's not any new ending choices.

1558
02:02:45,921 --> 02:02:47,782
[SPEAKER_12]: They are just fleshing out what's already there.

1559
02:02:48,062 --> 02:02:48,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1560
02:02:48,683 --> 02:02:50,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to explain it more or what have you.

1561
02:02:50,888 --> 02:02:58,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So in a way, it's kind of like saying, well, it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it.

1562
02:02:58,591 --> 02:03:02,233
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you didn't get it, then here's we're going to throw you a bone.

1563
02:03:02,573 --> 02:03:04,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do you think about the fact that the Internet got their way?

1564
02:03:07,352 --> 02:03:08,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they did and they didn't.

1565
02:03:08,653 --> 02:03:10,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're getting something else.

1566
02:03:11,014 --> 02:03:13,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm legit surprised they're doing it for free.

1567
02:03:13,455 --> 02:03:18,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said a few weeks ago on the show, I said, if they don't put it out for free, then they're just assholes.

1568
02:03:18,477 --> 02:03:20,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And to my surprise, they're doing it for free.

1569
02:03:20,278 --> 02:03:24,380
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to stand by what I said, and that is that it's hard to complain about this.

1570
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:35,365
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel that they only really did this because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fiscal impact with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective product.

1571
02:03:36,872 --> 02:04:05,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're throwing the fandom a bone but if EA has the final say this is just damage control to say that they attempted something even if fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the fandom was showing so as far as the fact that them getting their way, eh

1572
02:04:07,512 --> 02:04:08,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy VII

1573
02:04:23,314 --> 02:04:49,151
[SPEAKER_12]: right of course no game will ever be as hyped up or as anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal with it it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to Yuffie Yuffie and Vincent what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right

1574
02:04:50,073 --> 02:04:52,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC, though.

1575
02:04:53,316 --> 02:04:54,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have anything to say, Jason?

1576
02:04:55,217 --> 02:05:00,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason doesn't play Mass Effect, so... I will probably get around to the series eventually, but not yet.

1577
02:05:01,342 --> 02:05:01,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Completely missed it.

1578
02:05:02,682 --> 02:05:07,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's something that impacts Mass Effect and some other Bioware games.

1579
02:05:07,603 --> 02:05:09,784
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something Bioware is kind of known for.

1580
02:05:09,904 --> 02:05:16,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bioware obviously tells these very deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories.

1581
02:05:16,166 --> 02:05:21,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bioware has been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want.

1582
02:05:22,087 --> 02:05:25,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning if you want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship.

1583
02:05:26,048 --> 02:05:43,935
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti-gay letter writing campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters objecting to same-sex relationships in their games

1584
02:05:45,315 --> 02:05:52,278
[SPEAKER_10]: The letters are being sent to a variety of senior leaders at EA, threatening to boycott EA games until it changes its policy.

1585
02:05:53,478 --> 02:06:00,561
[SPEAKER_10]: EA is standing by their games, saying they will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options.

1586
02:06:01,341 --> 02:06:07,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Every one of EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors, so it's hard to believe anyone is surprised by the content.

1587
02:06:08,227 --> 02:06:11,529
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't about protecting children, it's about political harassment.

1588
02:06:11,829 --> 02:06:14,932
[SPEAKER_10]: That's from EA's chief spokesperson, Jeff Brown.

1589
02:06:15,492 --> 02:06:22,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man, woman, man, man, woman, woman, woman, alien, shit.

1590
02:06:22,858 --> 02:06:25,260
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do whatever you want in Mass Effect 3.

1591
02:06:26,821 --> 02:06:39,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Mass Effect 1 was originally going to have same gender pairings, but with Dragon Age Origins coming out on the horizon, which had a more involved relationship system, they cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent.

1592
02:06:41,037 --> 02:06:47,664
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mass Effect 1, sorry to interrupt, took a lot of heat from conservative funding groups for having sex at all.

1593
02:06:48,979 --> 02:07:18,685
[SPEAKER_10]: and many people haven't even seen the scene which isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like Nip Tuck or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars The Old Republic is going to be having same sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that Vader ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so

1594
02:07:19,013 --> 02:07:20,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that is complete, right?

1595
02:07:20,854 --> 02:07:22,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that is complete.

1596
02:07:22,555 --> 02:07:23,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Incest is a-okay.

1597
02:07:25,317 --> 02:07:27,739
[SPEAKER_10]: But heaven forbid Vader be a homo.

1598
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:30,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Which isn't even how it works.

1599
02:07:30,841 --> 02:07:35,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars The Old Republic takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that.

1600
02:07:35,563 --> 02:07:36,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It's completely different.

1601
02:07:36,664 --> 02:07:39,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And it should be noted, same-sex relationships aren't in the game yet.

1602
02:07:40,106 --> 02:07:43,569
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game.

1603
02:07:44,669 --> 02:07:51,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the letters are coming from Florida, the, where the Florida Family Association is at.

1604
02:07:52,273 --> 02:07:54,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And, again, EA is standing by it.

1605
02:07:54,534 --> 02:07:57,736
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, they're doing these, it's clearly a form letter.

1606
02:07:58,056 --> 02:08:03,839
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at the form letters, like, people will handwrite messages on them that say, like, remember, like, look at this one.

1607
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:05,520
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a handwritten message here.

1608
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:06,300
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get a kick out of this.

1609
02:08:07,241 --> 02:08:09,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you, remember Sodom.

1610
02:08:09,902 --> 02:08:10,942
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's signed.

1611
02:08:11,122 --> 02:08:13,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a friend who turned into salt last week, so...

1612
02:08:14,665 --> 02:08:17,227
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit is real and you will not minimize that.

1613
02:08:18,528 --> 02:08:20,529
[SPEAKER_12]: That still happens.

1614
02:08:20,589 --> 02:08:21,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I read the hate mail here?

1615
02:08:22,590 --> 02:08:33,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mr. Rickitello, it was troubling to learn that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add LGBT content to Star Wars video games.

1616
02:08:34,518 --> 02:08:35,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Pressured by who?

1617
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:38,901
[SPEAKER_10]: They always announced it was going to be there.

1618
02:08:41,644 --> 02:08:55,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I am also concerned that BioWare employees state in postings at SWOTOR.com that they have been censoring, deleting, and banning forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content in the games children play.

1619
02:08:56,196 --> 02:08:56,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

1620
02:08:57,296 --> 02:09:01,400
[SPEAKER_10]: On a person's private forum, the First Amendment does not exist.

1621
02:09:02,581 --> 02:09:20,778
[SPEAKER_10]: for example if you're a guest in my home and you start talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's our guest we invite Jason over into our house and Jason says you know I really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right

1622
02:09:21,761 --> 02:09:22,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1623
02:09:40,848 --> 02:09:49,417
[SPEAKER_10]: The overwhelming number of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as a captured audience to participate in homosexual content.

1624
02:09:49,437 --> 02:09:51,860
[SPEAKER_08]: 30-year-old children living in their parents' basements.

1625
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1626
02:09:53,722 --> 02:09:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you're letting your child play an MMO unsupervised... They're not getting that $14.99 a month themselves.

1627
02:10:00,148 --> 02:10:01,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone's credit card's involved.

1628
02:10:03,852 --> 02:10:11,580
[SPEAKER_10]: We ask that you please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this type of advocacy representation in your games.

1629
02:10:11,761 --> 02:10:12,101
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1630
02:10:12,962 --> 02:10:14,043
[SPEAKER_10]: EA had a policy?

1631
02:10:14,884 --> 02:10:15,244
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1632
02:10:16,145 --> 02:10:21,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many children.

1633
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1634
02:10:22,272 --> 02:10:23,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Sodom.

1635
02:10:26,357 --> 02:10:29,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the facts are just being distorted terribly.

1636
02:10:30,482 --> 02:10:39,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is... Here's the thing about this, though, is that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games altogether are the goddamn devil.

1637
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:40,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1638
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:44,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no real boycott happening here.

1639
02:10:45,031 --> 02:10:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all for show.

1640
02:10:46,612 --> 02:10:47,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all for press.

1641
02:10:47,752 --> 02:10:48,792
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all for show.

1642
02:10:49,192 --> 02:10:58,115
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fags.

1643
02:10:58,175 --> 02:11:04,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Rogers is burning in hell because America's a fag-loving country and all this.

1644
02:11:04,437 --> 02:11:09,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight, but unfortunately I see it in these protests and things like that.

1645
02:11:10,861 --> 02:11:13,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, they do it what?

1646
02:11:13,088 --> 02:11:13,710
[SPEAKER_10]: For attention.

1647
02:11:15,578 --> 02:11:35,286
[SPEAKER_12]: For those that remember, I know this isn't all that similar, but when Nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl, the FCC came out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got, it was some random group that was made up of 20 icky, old, creepy, old white dudes that just had a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC.

1648
02:11:35,686 --> 02:11:43,149
[SPEAKER_12]: So the fact that they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public feels because these are just

1649
02:11:43,849 --> 02:11:49,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Really isolated groups telling that they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up.

1650
02:11:50,778 --> 02:11:56,125
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to do with their lives.

1651
02:11:56,706 --> 02:12:01,933
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what they choose to do instead of going out into their community and choosing to do some good.

1652
02:12:03,223 --> 02:12:06,685
[SPEAKER_10]: because what Alan and I have is so threatening.

1653
02:12:07,665 --> 02:12:10,846
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the gym.

1654
02:12:10,906 --> 02:12:13,247
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have time to do anything.

1655
02:12:13,407 --> 02:12:14,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop it.

1656
02:12:15,928 --> 02:12:17,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1657
02:12:17,289 --> 02:12:18,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that they scanned this in.

1658
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:19,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It's signed.

1659
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't read that name.

1660
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:21,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Homa Johnson?

1661
02:12:22,211 --> 02:12:25,052
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Homa J. Lorne.

1662
02:12:25,393 --> 02:12:26,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Homa J. Lorne.

1663
02:12:28,194 --> 02:12:30,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Homa J. Lorne, shut the fuck up.

1664
02:12:38,863 --> 02:12:43,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, props to EA at least for standing by this whole thing.

1665
02:12:43,966 --> 02:12:44,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know what?

1666
02:12:44,686 --> 02:12:45,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say this.

1667
02:12:46,827 --> 02:12:51,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet, I spoiled myself and looked at some of the stuff on YouTube.

1668
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:53,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I've looked at all the different Saromat scenes.

1669
02:12:53,631 --> 02:12:58,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I've looked at the female-female, I've looked at the male-female, I've looked at the male-male relationships.

1670
02:12:58,994 --> 02:13:05,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And I gotta tell you, the male-male relationship, one in particular they do in the game, is so...

1671
02:13:06,358 --> 02:13:32,666
[SPEAKER_10]: well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and they they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high

1672
02:13:34,804 --> 02:13:35,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1673
02:13:36,807 --> 02:13:37,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1674
02:13:37,628 --> 02:13:39,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all huffy now after that story.

1675
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:41,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, let's do the mailbag.

1676
02:13:42,073 --> 02:13:44,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's follow that up with some listener emails.

1677
02:13:44,816 --> 02:13:45,116
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1678
02:13:45,136 --> 02:13:46,798
[SPEAKER_10]: The people I like to hear from.

1679
02:13:46,859 --> 02:13:48,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do some listener emails tonight.

1680
02:13:53,892 --> 02:13:56,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week, you guys send us emails.

1681
02:13:56,814 --> 02:14:01,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura opens up the email bag and reads some of her favorites.

1682
02:14:01,757 --> 02:14:05,680
[SPEAKER_10]: But since she's not here tonight, we took a poo in the bag.

1683
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:10,002
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of detrimental to ourselves, isn't it?

1684
02:14:10,022 --> 02:14:11,803
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some good emails in here.

1685
02:14:11,823 --> 02:14:12,184
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not poo.

1686
02:14:12,204 --> 02:14:14,365
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some good emails tonight and Alan's going to read them tonight.

1687
02:14:15,492 --> 02:14:16,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god!

1688
02:14:33,721 --> 02:14:37,764
[SPEAKER_12]: He plays them enough to give a basic review and some history of the title.

1689
02:14:38,184 --> 02:14:40,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Needless to say, it's a massive undertaking and worth checking out.

1690
02:14:41,186 --> 02:14:46,430
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a YouTube channel, but much more content is posted on the Archive.org site.

1691
02:14:46,990 --> 02:14:53,114
[SPEAKER_12]: He also started a Kron Sega series, which is going through all of the Master System titles in order.

1692
02:14:53,835 --> 02:14:55,796
[SPEAKER_12]: The humor is pretty dry, but fun to watch.

1693
02:14:56,456 --> 02:15:02,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look.

1694
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:03,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Signed, Will.

1695
02:15:04,301 --> 02:15:08,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, some people have a lot of time available.

1696
02:15:08,584 --> 02:15:09,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great.

1697
02:15:09,544 --> 02:15:10,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great endeavor, though.

1698
02:15:11,685 --> 02:15:18,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw, someone linked me to, it might have been DarkSakura, actually, a group of Let's Play people on YouTube.

1699
02:15:18,549 --> 02:15:19,329
[SPEAKER_12]: There's four of them.

1700
02:15:19,369 --> 02:15:23,172
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a simultaneous Battletoads, the original.

1701
02:15:23,212 --> 02:15:24,132
[SPEAKER_12]: That game is hard as hell.

1702
02:15:24,212 --> 02:15:30,996
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on YouTube, but it's quad screen competition to see who could reach the end of the game the fastest.

1703
02:15:31,636 --> 02:15:34,517
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's filled with swears because that game is hard and that was very fun.

1704
02:15:35,037 --> 02:15:36,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So look up Battletoads competition for that.

1705
02:15:37,498 --> 02:15:46,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Second email is from Stan who writes, Hi OLR, I have a question for you and anyone listening or this could be a future foogle question.

1706
02:15:46,822 --> 02:15:52,004
[SPEAKER_12]: What video game franchise would you like to see reimagined or translated into another genre?

1707
02:15:52,664 --> 02:15:54,685
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG.

1708
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:06,561
[SPEAKER_12]: My answer would be seeing the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced in a Soul Calibur game.

1709
02:16:08,202 --> 02:16:09,563
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.

1710
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:10,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was Urgeis.

1711
02:16:11,444 --> 02:16:14,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to kind of stretch it a little bit?

1712
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:19,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think it'd be funny to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game.

1713
02:16:21,791 --> 02:16:22,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that's just silly.

1714
02:16:23,272 --> 02:16:24,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Signed, Stan.

1715
02:16:24,433 --> 02:16:25,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Sent from his iPhone.

1716
02:16:25,774 --> 02:16:26,014
Okay.

1717
02:16:27,955 --> 02:16:31,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's very upset about the Instagram news this week.

1718
02:16:31,977 --> 02:16:33,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh, that's a tough one.

1719
02:16:33,878 --> 02:16:36,319
[SPEAKER_10]: What would I like to see cross genres?

1720
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:43,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And Persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from Atlas and I was like, what?

1721
02:16:44,103 --> 02:16:46,224
[SPEAKER_10]: How about an 8-bit version of Demon's Souls?

1722
02:16:48,052 --> 02:16:48,693
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1723
02:17:08,481 --> 02:17:09,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard something about a soundtrack.

1724
02:17:09,982 --> 02:17:11,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Six-player co-op.

1725
02:17:11,903 --> 02:17:12,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that sounds fun.

1726
02:17:12,923 --> 02:17:13,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1727
02:17:13,284 --> 02:17:18,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Not exactly cross-genre, unless you want to say it's Portal being ported to 8-bit side-scroller.

1728
02:17:19,987 --> 02:17:22,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that question is really insanely difficult.

1729
02:17:24,353 --> 02:17:37,565
[SPEAKER_08]: and my mind is just stuck in the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think it might be my very first RPG I ever actually beat.

1730
02:17:37,605 --> 02:17:43,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Superstar Saga was not half bad, Partners in Time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun.

1731
02:17:45,192 --> 02:17:47,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean a Disney RPG, Kingdom Hearts was...

1732
02:17:48,536 --> 02:17:54,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that there's one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre though that I could really pick.

1733
02:17:56,243 --> 02:17:57,203
[SPEAKER_10]: God of War in the style of Mario Party

1734
02:18:18,989 --> 02:18:24,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Kratos is mad because he got max stars, but someone else got a star because they didn't get any stars.

1735
02:18:24,956 --> 02:18:25,978
[SPEAKER_10]: How about... Okay, I got one.

1736
02:18:26,078 --> 02:18:26,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one.

1737
02:18:26,418 --> 02:18:26,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one.

1738
02:18:27,219 --> 02:18:31,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Saints Row as a Pokemon game, but it's hoes.

1739
02:18:33,507 --> 02:19:00,204
[SPEAKER_10]: gotta catch em all or it's diseases cause Saints Row is a fucking hilarious game and I would like to I'd like to see it as kind of like a silly RPG call me crazy any other comments from chat or was that it I'm looking Mario franchise is Call of Duty headshot against Princess Peach

1740
02:19:00,549 --> 02:19:05,391
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Mass Effect as a more fantasy RPG?

1741
02:19:06,372 --> 02:19:09,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Like with hit points and shit instead of the whole like first person.

1742
02:19:09,553 --> 02:19:11,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I got to say, I do, I don't know.

1743
02:19:11,834 --> 02:19:14,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Shepard arrives on the Citadel and pulls out a gun blade.

1744
02:19:15,456 --> 02:19:17,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that crazy, but I don't know.

1745
02:19:18,017 --> 02:19:23,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to admit, I'm not much of a first person shooter type person, but the combat in Mass Effect is pretty darn good.

1746
02:19:23,319 --> 02:19:24,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I really wouldn't change it.

1747
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:29,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I did hear though they were doing that legit first person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would have been kind of fun to play, I think.

1748
02:19:29,962 --> 02:19:30,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1749
02:19:30,782 --> 02:19:32,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust a Move, the music game as an RPG.

1750
02:19:33,525 --> 02:19:34,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of Dance Summit style.

1751
02:19:34,886 --> 02:19:35,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane's suggestion.

1752
02:19:35,547 --> 02:19:38,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, because you've got Kitty Ann and them.

1753
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:39,071
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be fun.

1754
02:19:39,111 --> 02:19:41,473
[SPEAKER_12]: She could cast spells, disco spells.

1755
02:19:41,793 --> 02:19:42,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Disco spells.

1756
02:19:43,095 --> 02:19:44,116
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the name of the game.

1757
02:19:44,836 --> 02:19:45,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Disco spells.

1758
02:19:45,997 --> 02:19:46,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

1759
02:19:46,458 --> 02:19:46,778
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1760
02:19:49,601 --> 02:19:50,302
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

1761
02:19:50,342 --> 02:19:51,343
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the emails tonight.

1762
02:19:52,458 --> 02:20:08,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com My answer to that question also is Ridge Racer, but as a puzzle bobble slash puzzle fighter game where you're dropping cars down.

1763
02:20:09,505 --> 02:20:10,286
[SPEAKER_12]: They just wreck up.

1764
02:20:10,306 --> 02:20:12,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to fill blocks like poyo poyo.

1765
02:20:12,807 --> 02:20:13,387
[SPEAKER_10]: You're weird.

1766
02:20:13,927 --> 02:20:16,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's do the FUs of the week.

1767
02:20:16,428 --> 02:20:18,149
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

1768
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:34,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start tonight.

1769
02:20:35,331 --> 02:20:38,734
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to that people that are sending those letters to EA.

1770
02:20:39,395 --> 02:20:41,976
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many reasons to hate EA, but that's not one of them.

1771
02:20:42,057 --> 02:20:44,318
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the reasons to appreciate what they're doing.

1772
02:20:45,459 --> 02:20:46,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to all of them.

1773
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:47,381
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to sheep.

1774
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:49,802
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to people that are sheep.

1775
02:20:50,163 --> 02:20:53,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's who those type of people are, are sheep.

1776
02:20:54,186 --> 02:20:55,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So think for yourselves.

1777
02:20:57,328 --> 02:20:57,848
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to sheep.

1778
02:20:58,169 --> 02:20:58,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan F.

1779
02:20:59,614 --> 02:21:03,658
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess F you to the fact that I had a job interview two weeks ago and I didn't get it.

1780
02:21:03,918 --> 02:21:04,819
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, shit happens.

1781
02:21:04,899 --> 02:21:06,260
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to have an interview.

1782
02:21:07,121 --> 02:21:16,689
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, while I was trekking home from that interview for the job I didn't get, I was completely done up in a suit, dress shoes, you know, interview attire.

1783
02:21:17,891 --> 02:21:22,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Rolled my ankle on uneven pavement and completely ate shit on the sidewalk.

1784
02:21:23,035 --> 02:21:24,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Hilarious, I'm sure.

1785
02:21:24,655 --> 02:21:26,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Should be on YouTube if anyone had a camera phone out.

1786
02:21:26,936 --> 02:21:32,217
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, F you to, I guess, not getting a job and being a klutz in the middle of public.

1787
02:21:33,038 --> 02:21:36,118
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to not having a job and needing a new pair of pants now.

1788
02:21:36,158 --> 02:21:40,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I had to throw the pants out because the road rash was so bad it ripped a hole in it.

1789
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:42,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have anything, Jason?

1790
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:46,721
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to myself for forgetting how to get out of a door of a car.

1791
02:21:47,472 --> 02:21:48,713
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1792
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:08,594
[SPEAKER_08]: But, anti-FU to immune systems and the ability to recover from that.

1793
02:22:09,394 --> 02:22:18,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there was another thing, something about keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here, but I think the injury made me forget it, so I guess I don't have it right now.

1794
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:19,741
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great story, though.

1795
02:22:20,602 --> 02:22:25,545
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone asks, someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit out of them, and that's the little mark.

1796
02:22:25,786 --> 02:22:27,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Or tell them it's a sex injury.

1797
02:22:27,267 --> 02:22:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1798
02:22:28,027 --> 02:22:29,128
[SPEAKER_12]: and let him try to figure it out.

1799
02:22:29,188 --> 02:22:38,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I was coming up with some kind of, I tried to participate, I was casted for the role of something in Face Off and that was the suspicion mark they tested to see how good my face looked like somebody else's.

1800
02:22:38,936 --> 02:22:39,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Bar fight.

1801
02:22:39,456 --> 02:22:39,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Bar fight.

1802
02:22:40,017 --> 02:22:40,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Bar fight.

1803
02:22:40,457 --> 02:22:40,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Go with that.

1804
02:22:40,777 --> 02:22:43,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that coat, like a beer bottle, could have hit you right there.

1805
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:44,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, easily.

1806
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:44,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Bar fight.

1807
02:22:45,021 --> 02:22:45,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Right position.

1808
02:22:46,842 --> 02:22:48,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there it is, your FU's of the week.

1809
02:22:48,183 --> 02:22:51,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a few more news stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1810
02:22:51,665 --> 02:22:54,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, we're going to hear from some people from PAX East first.

1811
02:22:54,567 --> 02:23:00,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to bump their call in first tonight so we can talk to them about PAX East because we all ignorant because we weren't there.

1812
02:23:01,191 --> 02:23:07,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need the OL Army to help us out, especially the New Yorkers and surrounding areas who did go.

1813
02:23:07,995 --> 02:23:09,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll talk to them in a little bit.

1814
02:23:09,236 --> 02:23:10,657
[SPEAKER_10]: But for now, a few more stories for you guys.

1815
02:23:10,677 --> 02:23:10,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason.

1816
02:23:12,437 --> 02:23:15,718
[SPEAKER_08]: MissSplosionMan is finally making it to iOS.

1817
02:23:15,778 --> 02:23:20,479
[SPEAKER_08]: More specifically, ExplosionMan of any form is finally making it to iOS, which will arrive this summer.

1818
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:34,183
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember a couple months ago, Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Maxplosion that came out on iOS, and there was a little kerfuffle between the two studios, Capcom and TwistedPixel.

1819
02:23:34,504 --> 02:23:38,725
[SPEAKER_08]: TwistedPixel says, well, you know, Capcom made Mega Man, so I guess it's not all that bad, and...

1820
02:23:39,665 --> 02:23:40,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Drama ceased very quickly.

1821
02:23:41,927 --> 02:23:47,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Missplosion Man was obviously the hit sequel to the original Splosion Man, both Xbox Live Arcade titles.

1822
02:23:48,031 --> 02:23:57,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Missplosion Man is heading to the App Store with a version for Steam on the PC, games for Windows Live, another PC gaming service, and Windows Phone 7 as well.

1823
02:23:58,498 --> 02:24:02,160
[SPEAKER_08]: No specific pricing or specific release date, just sometime this summer.

1824
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:07,124
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were at PAX East, maybe you played it, and if the game differs in any way, call in.

1825
02:24:07,324 --> 02:24:07,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us know.

1826
02:24:09,497 --> 02:24:12,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I am legit excited about this game that I'm about to talk about.

1827
02:24:12,638 --> 02:24:18,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of sad when you get more excited about the portable version of a game than the console version of a game.

1828
02:24:18,961 --> 02:24:21,201
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have legit reason for this, guys.

1829
02:24:22,062 --> 02:24:27,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Epic Mickey, of course, is getting Epic Mickey 2 on the consoles, which, you know, is all fine and dandy, whatever.

1830
02:24:27,964 --> 02:24:28,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Still Wii, right?

1831
02:24:29,664 --> 02:24:32,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1832
02:24:32,846 --> 02:24:33,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So good for them, stepping it up.

1833
02:24:34,586 --> 02:24:35,347
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the 3DS...

1834
02:24:37,213 --> 02:24:40,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney Epic Mickey, Power of Illusion.

1835
02:24:41,157 --> 02:24:43,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yes, it's what it sounds like.

1836
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:51,327
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a basic, I don't want to say a sequel to, but heavily inspired by Castle of Illusion.

1837
02:24:52,625 --> 02:24:53,385
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1838
02:25:12,617 --> 02:25:13,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Blah, blah, blah.

1839
02:25:13,798 --> 02:25:19,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But it gets its influence from a lot of modern day Disney movies like Tangled is going to have a level.

1840
02:25:19,364 --> 02:25:22,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I'm so excited about this.

1841
02:25:22,748 --> 02:25:25,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can see.

1842
02:25:25,611 --> 02:25:29,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it.

1843
02:25:30,156 --> 02:25:31,117
[SPEAKER_12]: No Tron, no sale.

1844
02:25:32,378 --> 02:25:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

1845
02:25:33,078 --> 02:25:33,679
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

1846
02:25:33,819 --> 02:25:34,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter Pan.

1847
02:25:34,939 --> 02:25:36,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game coming out.

1848
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream Drop Distance.

1849
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:41,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It just looks gorgeous.

1850
02:25:42,241 --> 02:25:43,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so excited.

1851
02:25:43,342 --> 02:25:45,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I could care less now about the console one.

1852
02:25:45,502 --> 02:25:46,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Just bring me that 3DS game.

1853
02:25:47,043 --> 02:25:48,963
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, it's a 3DS game I'm excited about.

1854
02:25:49,944 --> 02:25:50,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1855
02:25:51,744 --> 02:25:52,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just a port.

1856
02:25:53,105 --> 02:25:55,325
[SPEAKER_08]: A 3D port of a good classic game like Zelda.

1857
02:25:55,805 --> 02:25:57,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Rama in the chat room put it best.

1858
02:25:57,706 --> 02:25:59,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say it any better myself.

1859
02:25:59,687 --> 02:26:00,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up and take my money.

1860
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So this story is a doozy.

1861
02:26:08,483 --> 02:26:10,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, I'm not sure how to report this.

1862
02:26:10,986 --> 02:26:13,029
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted you to do this for a reason.

1863
02:26:13,249 --> 02:26:20,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the state of Arizona just looked at Florida as the worst state in the country and was like, no, we have to do better.

1864
02:26:21,994 --> 02:26:24,037
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the last seven or eight years, they have been.

1865
02:26:24,157 --> 02:26:31,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so this story is about a bill that has passed both sides of the state legislature.

1866
02:26:31,327 --> 02:26:33,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's ready to be signed by the governor.

1867
02:26:34,892 --> 02:26:38,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's the anti-trolling cyberbullying bill.

1868
02:26:38,937 --> 02:26:42,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of remind you of Cruella de Vil?

1869
02:26:43,001 --> 02:26:49,287
[SPEAKER_12]: She's the one who put her finger in the face of Obama, right?

1870
02:26:49,568 --> 02:26:51,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't she remind you of Cruella de Vil a little bit?

1871
02:26:52,210 --> 02:26:53,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to get political or whatever.

1872
02:26:55,233 --> 02:26:57,536
[SPEAKER_10]: She's kind of nasty.

1873
02:26:57,856 --> 02:26:59,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry.

1874
02:26:59,518 --> 02:27:00,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't mean to derail you.

1875
02:27:01,075 --> 02:27:02,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so it passed both houses.

1876
02:27:02,557 --> 02:27:05,220
[SPEAKER_12]: It's waiting for the governor to sign it, Governor Brewer.

1877
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:12,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically, let me read exactly what the statute dictates.

1878
02:27:13,569 --> 02:27:21,617
[SPEAKER_12]: It is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy...

1879
02:27:22,578 --> 02:27:37,961
[SPEAKER_12]: or offend to use any electronic or digital device and use any obscene, lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property of any person.

1880
02:27:38,722 --> 02:27:55,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you, it could be a class one, I think, misdemeanor, which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and up to six months in jail.

1881
02:27:56,145 --> 02:27:58,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the right direction that the receiver has to be in Arizona?

1882
02:27:58,686 --> 02:28:01,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of figured it would have been the sender, the origin.

1883
02:28:01,986 --> 02:28:04,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that is actually addressed here.

1884
02:28:04,347 --> 02:28:05,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me find it.

1885
02:28:05,567 --> 02:28:05,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1886
02:28:05,907 --> 02:28:05,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1887
02:28:06,656 --> 02:28:11,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, come arrest me Arizona sucks, what are you gonna do about it?

1888
02:28:12,743 --> 02:28:20,786
[SPEAKER_12]: There are already exceptions to the First Amendment, which is freedom of speech, which is obscene and obscenity is very vague.

1889
02:28:21,666 --> 02:28:27,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And also inciting violence, like saying, this person should get beat up, let's all meet at a place and time.

1890
02:28:27,489 --> 02:28:28,369
[SPEAKER_12]: That's inciting violence.

1891
02:28:28,549 --> 02:28:33,911
[SPEAKER_12]: But just being an asshole on the internet, you know, think of the Penny Arcade, greater internet theory.

1892
02:28:34,391 --> 02:28:38,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever read the comments to a story on Yahoo News?

1893
02:28:41,478 --> 02:28:44,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight.

1894
02:28:47,123 --> 02:28:48,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fucking serious.

1895
02:28:48,044 --> 02:28:51,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Go read the comments to any story on Yahoo News.

1896
02:28:51,286 --> 02:28:51,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of them.

1897
02:28:51,906 --> 02:28:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the answers on Yahoo Answers for that matter.

1898
02:28:54,128 --> 02:29:02,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be a story about fluffy kitties and dogs and it'll be like, that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama dog because Obama's ugly.

1899
02:29:02,774 --> 02:29:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I gotta go to Yahoo News right now and give you an idea of what I mean here.

1900
02:29:09,378 --> 02:29:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole new level of quality for the show, huh?

1901
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:13,101
[SPEAKER_10]: This is important.

1902
02:29:14,366 --> 02:29:21,470
[SPEAKER_10]: because yes, and this is how it ties into the gaming world because of course, what do gamers love to do more than anything?

1903
02:29:22,151 --> 02:29:22,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Troll.

1904
02:29:24,193 --> 02:29:51,996
[SPEAKER_12]: be shitty to each other with no consequences which I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's constitutional or not for years and eventually goes away so already you know people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is enforceable and blah blah blah

1905
02:29:52,296 --> 02:30:00,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal in this state, but the text of this bill is one of those things.

1906
02:30:00,763 --> 02:30:15,235
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, there have been these weird quirk grammar stories in the news lately, notably talking about the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new iPad.

1907
02:30:15,536 --> 02:30:19,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody says, I want the iPad 3, no, you want the new iPad.

1908
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:34,191
[SPEAKER_08]: But you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me immediately was it is unlawful for any person with intent to use any electronic or digital device.

1909
02:30:35,071 --> 02:30:39,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It is unlawful for any person to use any electric or digital device.

1910
02:30:40,195 --> 02:30:40,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, yes.

1911
02:30:41,748 --> 02:30:42,389
[SPEAKER_08]: One little letter.

1912
02:30:42,409 --> 02:30:50,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't mean to narrow in on this, but it's just kind of like, the language already sucks, but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn sense.

1913
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:52,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, guys.

1914
02:30:54,068 --> 02:30:58,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I write something rude on the side of a toaster, I'm trolling.

1915
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:03,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're trolling.

1916
02:31:03,391 --> 02:31:05,411
[SPEAKER_10]: You are now a wanted criminal in Arizona.

1917
02:31:06,131 --> 02:31:15,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Since the bill stipulates that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil, that basically puts the entire internet on notice, according to this article.

1918
02:31:15,614 --> 02:31:18,695
[SPEAKER_12]: So if the infraction...

1919
02:31:20,015 --> 02:31:27,897
[SPEAKER_12]: allegedly is viewable within Arizona, which, of course, Facebook, last I checked, doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona.

1920
02:31:27,957 --> 02:31:28,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they should now.

1921
02:31:29,638 --> 02:31:31,938
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll make people in Arizona really happy.

1922
02:31:31,959 --> 02:31:34,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Google already block YouTube in Arizona yet?

1923
02:31:34,979 --> 02:31:35,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1924
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:37,720
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll probably be in next week's stories.

1925
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:47,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So if the infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network, then you, I guess, according to this bill, have the right to try and prosecute.

1926
02:31:47,665 --> 02:31:55,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The narrow-mindedness of something that in their dream little world could affect the whole freaking world.

1927
02:31:57,365 --> 02:32:16,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing, if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a person, then that would bring it up to a Class 3 felony and there's a whole additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this.

1928
02:32:18,229 --> 02:32:31,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying, which I do believe kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this page that someone is, you know, a fat slut on Facebook.

1929
02:32:32,043 --> 02:32:34,606
[SPEAKER_12]: That's shitty and parents and teachers should get involved.

1930
02:32:35,006 --> 02:32:40,392
[SPEAKER_12]: So cyberbullying sucks, but an anti-trolling bill is not the way to go about it, at least not the way it's written.

1931
02:32:42,508 --> 02:32:48,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Some sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins, which I guess a lot.

1932
02:32:48,730 --> 02:32:50,170
[SPEAKER_10]: But here, let me give you an example.

1933
02:32:50,571 --> 02:32:57,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a story on President Obama wishes Jews, Christians, Happy Passover, Easter.

1934
02:32:57,533 --> 02:33:02,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's the harm in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe in, right?

1935
02:33:02,634 --> 02:33:03,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing wrong with that, right?

1936
02:33:05,529 --> 02:33:06,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1937
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:10,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack Haynes says, Obama, stop lying.

1938
02:33:10,774 --> 02:33:12,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We know you're a secret Muslim.

1939
02:33:12,675 --> 02:33:21,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob Harvey says, I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I vote for this egotistical, clueless, inept narcissist.

1940
02:33:23,164 --> 02:33:26,087
[SPEAKER_08]: There actually is a story about a dead politician beating an alive one.

1941
02:33:26,287 --> 02:33:30,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack Van Valen says, did he get the okay from the Muslim Brotherhood?

1942
02:33:32,805 --> 02:33:45,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you are Republican, Democrat, whatever, I don't care, Romney, Obama, just don't fucking vote for Rick Santorum.

1943
02:33:45,678 --> 02:33:47,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, oh my god.

1944
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:49,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that, I draw the fucking line at that asshole.

1945
02:33:50,323 --> 02:33:52,365
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, he is the president.

1946
02:33:53,205 --> 02:33:54,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Scroll up, what's the headline again?

1947
02:33:56,132 --> 02:34:01,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Obama wishes... President Obama wishes Jews, Christians, Happy Passover, Easter.

1948
02:34:01,916 --> 02:34:07,419
[SPEAKER_12]: The White House Christmas card from this most recent December was, I think, their cat or their dog.

1949
02:34:07,499 --> 02:34:09,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember what fucking pet they have.

1950
02:34:09,641 --> 02:34:11,322
[SPEAKER_12]: It just said, Happy Holidays.

1951
02:34:12,062 --> 02:34:12,482
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

1952
02:34:12,583 --> 02:34:14,064
[SPEAKER_12]: No Merry Christmas or Hanukkah or anything.

1953
02:34:14,104 --> 02:34:16,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity.

1954
02:34:17,025 --> 02:34:19,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Christians flipped their shit.

1955
02:34:19,407 --> 02:34:25,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover... Some Christians flipped their shit.

1956
02:34:25,291 --> 02:34:25,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1957
02:34:26,091 --> 02:34:27,713
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, yeah.

1958
02:34:29,796 --> 02:34:30,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't win for losing.

1959
02:34:32,299 --> 02:34:32,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

1960
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:37,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay if you're a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew.

1961
02:34:38,266 --> 02:34:39,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't we all just get along?

1962
02:34:39,668 --> 02:34:42,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Holidays of advertising past.

1963
02:34:42,331 --> 02:34:44,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Only if you're in Arizona.

1964
02:34:46,872 --> 02:34:50,995
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, look, less politics, more gaming stories.

1965
02:34:51,375 --> 02:34:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason, help.

1966
02:34:52,216 --> 02:35:03,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess it's not exactly politics, but cute iOS app, Childhood's End, back online after Pedobear mix-up.

1967
02:35:03,964 --> 02:35:07,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple was worried it might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles.

1968
02:35:07,947 --> 02:35:08,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1969
02:35:23,324 --> 02:35:35,135
[SPEAKER_08]: and the developer submitted an update and the one particular app store reviewer got a hold of it and said, why is Pedobear advancing on a childhood game?

1970
02:35:36,015 --> 02:35:50,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And they sent the developer a notice that they will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern and caution over the subject matter.

1971
02:35:51,008 --> 02:35:54,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd never heard of this app before, and I looked at a lot of stuff about it.

1972
02:35:56,914 --> 02:36:01,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps one of the things that doesn't exactly help... Why were you so interested in a Pedobear app?

1973
02:36:01,978 --> 02:36:02,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

1974
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:04,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Researching the story...

1975
02:36:06,022 --> 02:36:07,443
[SPEAKER_08]: The description of the app says,

1976
02:36:29,473 --> 02:36:34,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Not exactly the childish that you would expect, but what's in a name?

1977
02:36:35,477 --> 02:36:39,219
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple things coming out about this article.

1978
02:36:39,299 --> 02:36:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't exactly understood what exactly this is, but there's a screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of Pedobear and saying...

1979
02:36:49,725 --> 02:36:52,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the image is broken now, so I can't recite it off.

1980
02:36:52,187 --> 02:36:55,810
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear.

1981
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:59,493
[SPEAKER_08]: You will see it in almost any American child's home that has stuffed animals.

1982
02:37:00,134 --> 02:37:01,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this a big deal?

1983
02:37:01,955 --> 02:37:05,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we know why it's a big deal, but this particular version just makes no sense.

1984
02:37:07,079 --> 02:37:09,721
[SPEAKER_08]: The game was subtly changed.

1985
02:37:09,741 --> 02:37:11,703
[SPEAKER_08]: The art for the bear was changed a little bit.

1986
02:37:11,743 --> 02:37:16,287
[SPEAKER_08]: The update resubmitted, and I believe it's been approved at this point.

1987
02:37:18,644 --> 02:37:36,733
[SPEAKER_10]: now pita bear free one of those things silly situation for something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so there you go one more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet

1988
02:37:39,210 --> 02:37:47,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this news story is kind of like it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this guy can't be fucking serious.

1989
02:37:47,617 --> 02:37:48,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell Governor Brewer.

1990
02:37:50,099 --> 02:37:51,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, arrest this man.

1991
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:52,781
[SPEAKER_10]: It is... Who did this?

1992
02:37:52,881 --> 02:37:54,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Camille...

1993
02:37:55,143 --> 02:37:56,284
[SPEAKER_10]: and Gurmanprez.

1994
02:37:56,804 --> 02:38:02,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry if I butchered that name, but Camille Gurmanprez talked about Studio Arcados.

1995
02:38:03,288 --> 02:38:05,130
[SPEAKER_10]: They made the game Hell Yeah for Sega.

1996
02:38:05,530 --> 02:38:06,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of their first games to come out.

1997
02:38:07,851 --> 02:38:10,493
[SPEAKER_10]: They're taking a month off and then they're going to come back and do some more games.

1998
02:38:10,553 --> 02:38:21,240
[SPEAKER_10]: But saying it's Sega's PAX East booth, the comment was, quote, we're going to make two games, one game on pee and one game on poo.

1999
02:38:22,361 --> 02:38:22,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right.

2000
02:38:23,122 --> 02:38:27,786
[SPEAKER_10]: One game on P, one game about P, and one game about poo.

2001
02:38:28,647 --> 02:38:30,668
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a Steam game, I think.

2002
02:38:33,010 --> 02:38:34,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2003
02:38:34,952 --> 02:38:36,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God, it's on every game blog.

2004
02:38:36,774 --> 02:38:37,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Go look at any of them.

2005
02:38:38,575 --> 02:38:44,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Presented with no comment?

2006
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:45,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what I just heard?

2007
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:48,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I need to comment on this story?

2008
02:38:48,913 --> 02:38:49,894
[SPEAKER_10]: What is there possibly?

2009
02:38:50,254 --> 02:38:51,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, can we set the bar?

2010
02:38:52,117 --> 02:39:06,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We already had news stories about the urinal games where they were installing games on the urinals for men to play or, you know, women if they want an extra challenge while they relieve themselves.

2011
02:39:09,819 --> 02:39:13,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Women get the Metal Gear Solid version where no one catches them in the bathroom.

2012
02:39:16,602 --> 02:39:18,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that might be kind of awkward.

2013
02:39:22,444 --> 02:39:26,685
[SPEAKER_12]: For my birthday, will you get me the pee and poo plush dolls that are in chat?

2014
02:39:27,006 --> 02:39:28,746
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's what you really want.

2015
02:39:31,127 --> 02:39:32,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this for real?

2016
02:39:32,428 --> 02:39:34,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they were on sale in the castor actually a couple years ago.

2017
02:39:35,169 --> 02:39:35,869
[SPEAKER_10]: You would know that.

2018
02:39:38,672 --> 02:39:42,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an idea what a poo plush doll looks like, but I want to... Oh, God.

2019
02:39:43,737 --> 02:39:44,858
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so cute.

2020
02:39:50,383 --> 02:39:53,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they got licensed to this game or something.

2021
02:39:53,706 --> 02:39:54,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2022
02:39:55,048 --> 02:39:56,029
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a license?

2023
02:39:56,189 --> 02:39:56,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, never mind.

2024
02:39:56,969 --> 02:39:58,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe pee and poo have been licensed.

2025
02:39:58,971 --> 02:40:00,373
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the actual characters.

2026
02:40:00,833 --> 02:40:03,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, can you post Salacious Pops link to the Tumblr?

2027
02:40:05,749 --> 02:40:10,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So the podcast listeners have an idea what we're talking about because I can't.

2028
02:40:11,671 --> 02:40:12,771
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do they want for this?

2029
02:40:12,951 --> 02:40:13,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

2030
02:40:13,432 --> 02:40:16,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this item is discontinued.

2031
02:40:16,413 --> 02:40:18,053
[SPEAKER_10]: No pee and poo for you.

2032
02:40:19,374 --> 02:40:21,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make you a poo for your birthday.

2033
02:40:21,414 --> 02:40:24,735
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go on eBay, you'll find that pee and poo plushies are a collector's item.

2034
02:40:25,315 --> 02:40:26,676
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do they go for?

2035
02:40:26,696 --> 02:40:29,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.

2036
02:40:31,733 --> 02:40:33,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And on that note, we're going to go to the Skype line.

2037
02:40:33,954 --> 02:40:44,178
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to open it up right now and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2038
02:40:44,639 --> 02:40:51,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I do want to make sure our PAX East people get through, so I'm going to kind of wait and let them call in first here because I want to hear from people who went to PAX East.

2039
02:40:52,122 --> 02:40:53,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2040
02:40:53,602 --> 02:40:55,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2041
02:40:56,564 --> 02:40:57,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And here they come.

2042
02:40:58,885 --> 02:40:59,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2043
02:40:59,865 --> 02:41:00,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2044
02:41:00,886 --> 02:41:01,426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ranma.

2045
02:41:01,446 --> 02:41:02,126
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, everyone?

2046
02:41:02,166 --> 02:41:03,127
[SPEAKER_10]: What a surprise.

2047
02:41:03,227 --> 02:41:03,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Ranma.

2048
02:41:03,707 --> 02:41:04,107
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

2049
02:41:04,647 --> 02:41:05,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

2050
02:41:05,427 --> 02:41:06,348
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you?

2051
02:41:06,708 --> 02:41:13,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to think after I've seen the pee and poo plush dolls, but... Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

2052
02:41:14,891 --> 02:41:18,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you literally just got back in the door from PAX East, right?

2053
02:41:18,392 --> 02:41:20,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, about an hour ago, give or take.

2054
02:41:20,773 --> 02:41:22,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've been listening to OLR the whole time, I'm sure.

2055
02:41:23,777 --> 02:41:24,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes.

2056
02:41:24,818 --> 02:41:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Behold the power of smartphones.

2057
02:41:28,060 --> 02:41:29,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So how was PAX East?

2058
02:41:31,522 --> 02:41:31,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun.

2059
02:41:31,842 --> 02:41:32,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed it.

2060
02:41:33,963 --> 02:41:34,304
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2061
02:41:34,324 --> 02:41:35,645
[SPEAKER_05]: There's your PAX East wrap-up.

2062
02:41:35,665 --> 02:41:38,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2063
02:41:38,186 --> 02:41:38,787
[SPEAKER_05]: You're funny.

2064
02:41:39,227 --> 02:41:40,588
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a funny guy.

2065
02:41:40,668 --> 02:41:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been to PAX East before?

2066
02:41:42,429 --> 02:41:43,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is my third PAX East.

2067
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:45,611
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your third PAX East.

2068
02:41:45,651 --> 02:41:46,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Where does this rank?

2069
02:41:47,452 --> 02:41:50,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was reading some negativities on Twitter.

2070
02:41:51,974 --> 02:41:57,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The negativities are probably coming from the people that were complaining about the fact that it was the same weekend as Anime Boston.

2071
02:41:57,857 --> 02:42:04,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, look, people, if you've gone to more than five to six anime conventions in a year, it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming convention, which was a hell of a lot better.

2072
02:42:05,101 --> 02:42:07,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Just please shower while you're at the convention.

2073
02:42:08,003 --> 02:42:08,603
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all we ask.

2074
02:42:09,304 --> 02:42:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, at this one, there was a lot of showering.

2075
02:42:11,905 --> 02:42:13,486
[SPEAKER_05]: There was very little confunk.

2076
02:42:17,143 --> 02:42:21,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm laughing because Actdeft in the chat room.

2077
02:42:22,026 --> 02:42:25,729
[SPEAKER_10]: The Pee and Poo dolls might be out of stock, but now there's an HIV plushie.

2078
02:42:26,609 --> 02:42:29,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, jeez.

2079
02:42:30,452 --> 02:42:34,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in a family with a hepatitis C and a tuberculosis and polio.

2080
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:37,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the internet.

2081
02:42:37,376 --> 02:42:38,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it so much.

2082
02:42:38,277 --> 02:42:40,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, PAX East.

2083
02:42:42,259 --> 02:42:43,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So what was on the show floor?

2084
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:44,100
[SPEAKER_10]: What were they showing?

2085
02:42:44,121 --> 02:42:46,242
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't hear a lot of news news come out of PAX East.

2086
02:42:47,606 --> 02:42:48,226
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

2087
02:42:48,306 --> 02:42:53,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just more... From what I can see, there was a lot of independent developers, especially from the Boston area.

2088
02:42:54,147 --> 02:43:00,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was a big Microsoft display, them really pushing the Kinect games.

2089
02:43:01,449 --> 02:43:02,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in the corner was Nintendo.

2090
02:43:02,909 --> 02:43:08,130
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in the same place they were last year, pimping out the 3DS with one new game, Spirit Camera.

2091
02:43:09,591 --> 02:43:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a nice mention of MMOs.

2092
02:43:11,791 --> 02:43:15,692
[SPEAKER_05]: You had League of Legends all the way towards the back of the Expo Hall, but

2093
02:43:16,272 --> 02:43:18,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Packed all the damn time.

2094
02:43:19,162 --> 02:43:22,815
[SPEAKER_05]: There were people wandering around checking out Lotro and D&D Online.

2095
02:43:25,171 --> 02:43:43,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And one other thing that PAX does a lot of too is that they just have... It's not just about the new games or whatever that's on the show floor, but there's people sitting in the hallways playing card games and people playing D&D in rooms and people playing Magic the Gathering and classic games.

2096
02:43:43,708 --> 02:43:47,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how many freaking games did you see people playing?

2097
02:43:48,652 --> 02:43:49,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many.

2098
02:43:49,333 --> 02:43:50,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was like...

2099
02:43:51,411 --> 02:43:52,192
[SPEAKER_05]: and Catan.

2100
02:43:52,832 --> 02:43:54,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was one booth.

2101
02:43:54,073 --> 02:43:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget the name of it, but you could pick up a game and borrow it and just learn to play it.

2102
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:05,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember early yesterday afternoon, I was coming back from the expo hall.

2103
02:44:05,924 --> 02:44:07,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran into a Daisy cosplayer.

2104
02:44:07,625 --> 02:44:08,626
[SPEAKER_05]: We started talking.

2105
02:44:08,666 --> 02:44:13,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing you know, I'm sitting there with her husband, a couple, and two other people.

2106
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:15,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sitting there playing a round of Cards Against Humanity.

2107
02:44:16,853 --> 02:44:17,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

2108
02:44:17,947 --> 02:44:18,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

2109
02:44:19,148 --> 02:44:19,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, indeed.

2110
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:22,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to any of the panels?

2111
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:25,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know there's a lot of great panels and things that come out of PAX.

2112
02:44:26,033 --> 02:44:27,315
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of announcements come out of the panels.

2113
02:44:27,895 --> 02:44:29,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to one panel the whole weekend.

2114
02:44:29,776 --> 02:44:33,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Nerdcore Hip-Hop panel, which is something I look forward to every year.

2115
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:34,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

2116
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:34,740
[SPEAKER_10]: How was that?

2117
02:44:35,501 --> 02:44:36,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

2118
02:44:36,242 --> 02:44:42,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little bit different from last year's, where it was Frontalot, MegaRan, and Kay Murdoch.

2119
02:44:42,627 --> 02:44:43,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They pretty much discussed...

2120
02:44:44,528 --> 02:44:48,830
[SPEAKER_05]: The history of hip-hop, nerdcore, how it came together.

2121
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:54,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, Megaran discussed more about how he got into it, his backstory.

2122
02:44:54,892 --> 02:44:56,832
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, it was a little bit more about Frontalot.

2123
02:44:56,872 --> 02:44:57,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

2124
02:44:58,833 --> 02:44:59,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Who did the concert this year?

2125
02:44:59,833 --> 02:45:00,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there any concerts?

2126
02:45:00,974 --> 02:45:01,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was a lot of concerts.

2127
02:45:01,954 --> 02:45:07,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday night was Metroid Metal and the Proto Men.

2128
02:45:08,416 --> 02:45:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot who was on the...

2129
02:45:10,197 --> 02:45:11,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Storm Runner.

2130
02:45:11,618 --> 02:45:12,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the first one.

2131
02:45:12,998 --> 02:45:19,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught a part of Metroid Metal and this was my first time listening to them and I was like, wow.

2132
02:45:19,742 --> 02:45:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: The best way I can describe Metroid Metal is this.

2133
02:45:22,463 --> 02:45:26,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Take Metallica in their prime at plus one.

2134
02:45:28,486 --> 02:45:29,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Metroid Metal.

2135
02:45:29,526 --> 02:45:30,867
[SPEAKER_10]: We've played some of their stuff on the show.

2136
02:45:30,907 --> 02:45:31,547
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good stuff.

2137
02:45:32,408 --> 02:45:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up both their albums and we listened to it on the way back.

2138
02:45:36,057 --> 02:45:36,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2139
02:45:37,278 --> 02:45:43,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And Saturday night was Colton, Paul and Storm, Front of Lot, and MegaRam.

2140
02:45:43,799 --> 02:45:44,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, wait.

2141
02:45:44,159 --> 02:45:44,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Look what I found.

2142
02:45:44,699 --> 02:45:45,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Look what I found.

2143
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Metroid Metal.

2144
02:45:48,380 --> 02:45:53,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2145
02:45:54,482 --> 02:45:56,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait for Metroid Screamo.

2146
02:45:58,371 --> 02:46:01,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob, here's a quick story that you'll greatly appreciate.

2147
02:46:02,175 --> 02:46:13,145
[SPEAKER_05]: As me and Jovi were walking into the convention center, I had said to her that I saw somebody with an X-Play pen on their back.

2148
02:46:13,245 --> 02:46:14,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I threw mine in the garbage.

2149
02:46:14,947 --> 02:46:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, why?

2150
02:46:15,528 --> 02:46:16,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, because...

2151
02:46:17,009 --> 02:46:18,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't support G4.

2152
02:46:18,610 --> 02:46:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The person at least six feet in front of me overheard me.

2153
02:46:21,813 --> 02:46:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, I can't stand them either.

2154
02:46:24,394 --> 02:46:29,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing you know, there's about 20 to 30 people going into the convention complaining about how much G4 sucks.

2155
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done, Boston.

2156
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:33,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done.

2157
02:46:33,961 --> 02:46:34,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2158
02:46:34,582 --> 02:46:35,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, indeed.

2159
02:46:36,203 --> 02:46:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2160
02:46:36,643 --> 02:46:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So before I let you go, what else do we need to know about PAX East?

2161
02:46:39,325 --> 02:46:40,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you got to share with us?

2162
02:46:41,278 --> 02:46:53,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check out a couple of games Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm It's a fun game Only Square Enix can take a music rhythm game and make it into an RPG 40 bucks worth?

2163
02:46:54,224 --> 02:46:54,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it worth it?

2164
02:46:55,465 --> 02:47:08,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's definitely a day one purchase Interesting, okay I also checked out Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 2 And is it as shitty as the first one?

2165
02:47:10,245 --> 02:47:14,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the graphics, the controlling, not so much.

2166
02:47:16,128 --> 02:47:18,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd wait on that.

2167
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:22,812
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was something funny because we were talking to one of the people at the booth.

2168
02:47:22,932 --> 02:47:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just had a cry for Sonic.

2169
02:47:26,934 --> 02:47:27,775
That's okay.

2170
02:47:28,215 --> 02:47:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking to one of the guys at the booth and he was saying it's only going to be on 360 and PS3 because...

2171
02:47:35,165 --> 02:47:36,988
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Wii's hardware limitations.

2172
02:47:37,008 --> 02:47:37,909
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't be able to port it.

2173
02:47:38,290 --> 02:47:43,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said to my sister, but yet, I have Sonic 4 Episode 1 on my Android phone.

2174
02:47:44,179 --> 02:47:46,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy's like, yeah, what does that tell you?

2175
02:47:47,564 --> 02:47:48,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2176
02:47:50,809 --> 02:47:53,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ranma, I'm glad to hear you had a good time at PAX East.

2177
02:47:53,491 --> 02:48:00,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could have joined you guys out there, but now it looks like I'll have to do Seattle this year and maybe Boston next year if money looks better.

2178
02:48:00,517 --> 02:48:01,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say 2013, bro.

2179
02:48:01,898 --> 02:48:02,739
[SPEAKER_10]: 2013, OLR suite.

2180
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:04,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Fonamay for your birthday?

2181
02:48:05,021 --> 02:48:05,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2182
02:48:06,762 --> 02:48:07,943
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to have to happen.

2183
02:48:08,123 --> 02:48:10,185
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I see it, everybody's telling me to go to Fonamay.

2184
02:48:10,205 --> 02:48:11,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to go west, young man.

2185
02:48:12,006 --> 02:48:15,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good, because all I was about to hear was excuses, and I'm not having any of that.

2186
02:48:15,709 --> 02:48:16,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So we hope to see you.

2187
02:48:17,522 --> 02:48:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need an angry Rob.

2188
02:48:18,743 --> 02:48:19,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need that.

2189
02:48:20,644 --> 02:48:20,904
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2190
02:48:21,464 --> 02:48:22,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I better let you go, Ranma.

2191
02:48:22,865 --> 02:48:24,805
[SPEAKER_05]: One more thing before I go.

2192
02:48:26,066 --> 02:48:28,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin's Creed, go to their Facebook fan page.

2193
02:48:28,727 --> 02:48:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They're having a contest for the best cosplay.

[SPEAKER_05]: Please vote for my sister, Lady Ava.

2195
02:48:33,209 --> 02:48:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: She made the Heliquin costume from scratch, and it's fucking phenomenal.

2196
02:48:37,571 --> 02:48:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Please vote for her.

2197
02:48:38,552 --> 02:48:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hope it works.

2200
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:17,942
[SPEAKER_10]: This is live radio, boys and girls.

2201
02:49:19,585 --> 02:49:20,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Making a call right now.

2202
02:49:22,389 --> 02:49:23,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying anyway.

2203
02:49:24,352 --> 02:49:24,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2204
02:49:25,213 --> 02:49:26,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, DarkSakura.

2205
02:49:26,435 --> 02:49:27,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2206
02:49:27,857 --> 02:49:28,338
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

2207
02:49:29,574 --> 02:49:31,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the voiceless lender.

2208
02:49:31,837 --> 02:49:33,059
[SPEAKER_10]: See, you do sound like hell.

2209
02:49:33,119 --> 02:49:37,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I told the listeners at the top of the show that you sound like hell, but I'm sorry to hear that.

2210
02:49:38,487 --> 02:49:38,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.

2211
02:49:39,008 --> 02:49:39,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling better.

2212
02:49:39,909 --> 02:49:40,410
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

2213
02:49:40,470 --> 02:49:44,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Listening to OLR with Jason and Alan is making you feel better?

2214
02:49:45,419 --> 02:49:50,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that and exceeding amounts of Robitussin and Sudafed.

2215
02:49:51,602 --> 02:49:52,703
[SPEAKER_12]: She is high as hell right now.

2216
02:49:54,204 --> 02:49:55,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, no way.

2217
02:49:55,244 --> 02:50:04,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take all this stuff with... No, if you want to see me high as hell, you should have seen me when I had pneumonia a few years ago and was on Vicodin and codeine all the time.

2218
02:50:05,710 --> 02:50:09,232
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, is there anything you wanted to say on tonight's news or anything we talked about?

2219
02:50:09,752 --> 02:50:10,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

2220
02:50:10,313 --> 02:50:10,833
[SPEAKER_01]: One comment.

2221
02:50:14,867 --> 02:50:20,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And this, that clearly is a comment on pee and poo games.

2222
02:50:20,871 --> 02:50:23,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Shermie farted too with all the Capcom stuff.

2223
02:50:24,392 --> 02:50:27,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's good to have the comment from Sharmi.

2224
02:50:27,214 --> 02:50:27,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate that.

2225
02:50:28,015 --> 02:50:30,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially since we're not doing the show at your house anymore.

2226
02:50:30,497 --> 02:50:32,959
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have a birthday coming up.

2227
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:34,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

2228
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:39,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we come back in two weeks, because we're not going to be here next week, when we come back in two weeks, it'll be like your birthday show weekend.

2229
02:50:39,224 --> 02:50:40,986
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are we going to do for your birthday?

2230
02:50:42,747 --> 02:50:43,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Cake and pink berry.

2231
02:50:44,709 --> 02:50:45,529
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds doable.

2232
02:50:45,690 --> 02:50:46,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we could do that.

2233
02:50:47,151 --> 02:50:48,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because...

2234
02:50:49,147 --> 02:50:59,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I'm doing something this Friday, but you know me, when I have my birthday, I like to let the party go, you know, for a couple weeks.

2235
02:50:59,273 --> 02:50:59,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

2236
02:50:59,974 --> 02:51:00,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Make it last.

2237
02:51:00,874 --> 02:51:02,936
[SPEAKER_10]: You only get one a year, so make it last for a month.

2238
02:51:03,436 --> 02:51:04,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

2239
02:51:04,517 --> 02:51:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And you remember the beer and cake potluck?

2240
02:51:08,959 --> 02:51:09,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

2241
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:13,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm thinking about having a pie party.

2242
02:51:13,702 --> 02:51:14,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about it.

2243
02:51:14,843 --> 02:51:15,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie is awesome.

2244
02:51:16,164 --> 02:51:17,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you should definitely look into doing that.

2245
02:51:18,516 --> 02:51:18,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2246
02:51:19,316 --> 02:51:23,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Or either that or just Dave and Busters and I drink until I barf or something.

2247
02:51:23,558 --> 02:51:23,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2248
02:51:24,118 --> 02:51:26,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you feel better in time for that to come around.

2249
02:51:26,319 --> 02:51:28,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope this doesn't stick around for a week.

2250
02:51:28,539 --> 02:51:29,760
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's all allergies.

2251
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:38,563
[SPEAKER_01]: On Thursday, I was over at Becky's house playing with her son in the backyard that was very grassy.

2252
02:51:39,063 --> 02:51:40,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very allergic to grass.

2253
02:51:41,284 --> 02:51:41,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And

2254
02:51:42,176 --> 02:51:46,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I started stuffing up like right after that and Friday I was just sniffy.

2255
02:51:46,917 --> 02:51:50,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the sniffy over and then started hacking so that's why I have no voice.

2256
02:51:51,199 --> 02:51:51,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

2257
02:51:51,819 --> 02:51:53,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope you feel better.

2258
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:55,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

2259
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:56,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you feel better.

2260
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:57,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2261
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:57,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

2262
02:51:58,141 --> 02:51:58,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2263
02:51:58,581 --> 02:52:00,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope you're not too mad I changed the classic game of the week.

2264
02:52:01,682 --> 02:52:02,602
[SPEAKER_01]: No, bitch.

2265
02:52:02,942 --> 02:52:03,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2266
02:52:04,891 --> 02:52:10,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of expected it, because honestly, I would have been disappointed if I didn't get to do the one I wanted.

2267
02:52:10,713 --> 02:52:11,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2268
02:52:11,334 --> 02:52:13,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll hear that in two weeks when we come back with OLR.

2269
02:52:14,395 --> 02:52:17,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to let the listeners know before we let you go pass out from Robitussin?

2270
02:52:18,656 --> 02:52:22,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to pass out from Robitussin, not for another hour anyway.

2271
02:52:22,278 --> 02:52:23,518
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then, before I hang up on you.

2272
02:52:25,499 --> 02:52:25,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2273
02:52:27,228 --> 02:52:27,428
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2274
02:52:27,788 --> 02:52:28,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2275
02:52:28,509 --> 02:52:29,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2276
02:52:30,009 --> 02:52:30,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2277
02:52:31,450 --> 02:52:32,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, DarkSakura.

2278
02:52:32,790 --> 02:52:33,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for calling.

2279
02:52:34,151 --> 02:52:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always good to hear, you know, check in.

2280
02:52:37,472 --> 02:52:37,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello.

2281
02:52:37,932 --> 02:52:38,993
[SPEAKER_10]: The phone's ringing off the hook tonight.

2282
02:52:39,013 --> 02:52:39,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

2283
02:52:39,933 --> 02:52:40,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2284
02:52:40,993 --> 02:52:41,674
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Shane.

2285
02:52:41,854 --> 02:52:42,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Shane.

2286
02:52:42,414 --> 02:52:42,734
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2287
02:52:43,374 --> 02:52:44,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm playing World of Warcraft.

2288
02:52:44,435 --> 02:52:45,135
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.

2289
02:52:45,595 --> 02:52:47,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to PAX East this weekend?

2290
02:52:47,616 --> 02:52:49,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally didn't.

2291
02:52:49,597 --> 02:52:50,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So why are you calling?

2292
02:52:51,557 --> 02:52:51,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2293
02:52:51,978 --> 02:52:52,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you calling?

2294
02:52:53,818 --> 02:52:54,438
[SPEAKER_10]: You called us.

2295
02:52:54,478 --> 02:52:55,219
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want?

2296
02:52:55,259 --> 02:52:55,679
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

2297
02:52:56,689 --> 02:53:19,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever I totally, after reading EA's statement that they put out I felt really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because they were just way too loud and they should not have beaten Bank of America of all people

2298
02:53:19,409 --> 02:53:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: You do realize in their statement, like they said, well, at least it wasn't Halliburton or da-da-da.

2299
02:53:24,672 --> 02:53:29,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And they named like three of the prior winners of the contest.

2300
02:53:29,174 --> 02:53:31,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know there were prior winners.

2301
02:53:31,195 --> 02:53:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I don't think they should have even come close to winning.

2302
02:53:35,537 --> 02:53:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw in the like half a picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site.

2303
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:47,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw Best Buy up there, which they deserve to be up there.

2304
02:53:47,422 --> 02:53:51,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw AT&T, which deserve to be up there.

2305
02:53:51,443 --> 02:53:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

2306
02:53:53,064 --> 02:53:54,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it really matter?

2307
02:53:54,645 --> 02:53:55,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the internet.

2308
02:53:56,346 --> 02:53:57,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a poll on the internet.

2309
02:53:57,886 --> 02:54:06,230
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, I guess it's publicity and the whole saying about publicity and stuff and it's never bad, blah, blah, blah.

2310
02:54:06,738 --> 02:54:07,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect 3 Ending

2311
02:54:16,076 --> 02:54:17,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm torn.

2312
02:54:18,057 --> 02:54:19,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate what they're doing.

2313
02:54:19,417 --> 02:54:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still not what I would like.

2314
02:54:21,637 --> 02:54:25,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the writers clarified some things this week on Twitter.

2315
02:54:26,879 --> 02:54:35,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that.

2316
02:54:36,541 --> 02:54:43,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been going.

2317
02:54:44,723 --> 02:55:01,418
[SPEAKER_02]: um so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though

2318
02:55:04,408 --> 02:55:11,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and just make a new story and keep it going.

2319
02:55:11,513 --> 02:55:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I am not done with Shepard or any of my crew members.

2320
02:55:17,077 --> 02:55:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the ones that may or may not have died in 3.

2321
02:55:19,218 --> 02:55:23,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And ones that you're trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with.

2322
02:55:24,182 --> 02:55:26,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, especially Caden.

2323
02:55:26,363 --> 02:55:28,265
[SPEAKER_10]: And you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4.

2324
02:55:28,305 --> 02:55:28,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2325
02:55:29,711 --> 02:55:47,169
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, but better romance scenes would be nice because it's like, you know, maybe a 10-year-old came up with them when they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often.

2326
02:55:47,952 --> 02:55:48,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, wait a minute, though.

2327
02:55:48,853 --> 02:55:54,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's get into the other story, which is about the whole target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign.

2328
02:55:54,377 --> 02:55:58,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've obviously romanced Kaiden with your man, Shep.

2329
02:55:58,060 --> 02:56:03,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game.

2330
02:56:03,964 --> 02:56:08,167
[SPEAKER_10]: A, do you think this campaign means anything?

2331
02:56:09,008 --> 02:56:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just something for that stupid organization to do this week.

2332
02:56:14,127 --> 02:56:15,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they pick something new every week.

2333
02:56:15,988 --> 02:56:25,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And B, well, you kind of like showed me these scenes that, you know, the man-on-man with Kaiden and all that and how well done they were.

2334
02:56:26,095 --> 02:56:27,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're well done.

2335
02:56:28,096 --> 02:56:29,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, wait, wait, let me back up.

2336
02:56:30,197 --> 02:56:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: The romance scene is not well done once you get into the romance part.

2337
02:56:35,119 --> 02:56:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But the date scene and the conversations they have, brilliant.

2338
02:56:39,641 --> 02:56:43,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Bioware, for the most part, can write amazingly well.

2339
02:56:44,282 --> 02:56:48,044
[SPEAKER_02]: But they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes.

2340
02:56:48,064 --> 02:56:50,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dragon Age, that was laughable.

2341
02:56:50,605 --> 02:56:51,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Mass Effect 1.

2342
02:56:52,205 --> 02:56:55,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do anything in 2 because I was saving myself for Kaden.

2343
02:56:55,586 --> 02:56:56,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 3, it's like...

2344
02:56:57,327 --> 02:57:04,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get pushed down on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh, we're under covers now and we're sleeping.

2345
02:57:04,448 --> 02:57:07,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but it's not like they're gonna get porno on you.

2346
02:57:07,769 --> 02:57:13,410
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it was also more like I can't spoil things.

2347
02:57:14,110 --> 02:57:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with another crew member that isn't romantic at all.

2348
02:57:26,453 --> 02:57:26,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Wrestling?

2349
02:57:28,151 --> 02:57:31,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's like a little sparring match.

2350
02:57:32,194 --> 02:57:34,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what it reminded me of, except we had no pants.

2351
02:57:36,257 --> 02:57:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There were pants in the sparring match.

2352
02:57:39,819 --> 02:57:40,180
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2353
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:47,365
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, I mean, it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any other video game, wouldn't you say?

2354
02:57:48,147 --> 02:58:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably more interesting, you know, the male-male or female-female stuff we've seen in other games, which has been remarkably little, but I'm sure in other games there have been better male-female romance scenes, because I assume...

2355
02:58:04,569 --> 02:58:08,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The developers are probably straight and have more experience with that.

2356
02:58:08,292 --> 02:58:11,414
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't just load up a porn website and find gay stuff.

2357
02:58:11,574 --> 02:58:13,756
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a pretty blanket statement to make, though.

2358
02:58:13,856 --> 02:58:16,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's probably hundreds of people that work at BioWare.

2359
02:58:16,318 --> 02:58:20,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's a couple people there that have some first-hand experience.

2360
02:58:20,621 --> 02:58:25,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying the ones that designed the scene, not that worked there, period.

2361
02:58:25,844 --> 02:58:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

2362
02:58:26,205 --> 02:58:27,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are like three.

2363
02:58:27,906 --> 02:58:28,146
Right.

2364
02:58:28,783 --> 02:58:30,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane, I've got to let you go to get some more calls.

2365
02:58:30,864 --> 02:58:32,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have anything else you want to say?

2366
02:58:34,366 --> 02:58:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you should go download the rest of your download content for Mass Effect 2 because the Shadow Broker is what I did today, that $10 one, and it was amazing.

2367
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so, so good.

2368
02:58:43,431 --> 02:58:47,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do that right now, except I spent all my points on that Pinball Arcade game.

2369
02:58:47,814 --> 02:58:49,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, go buy more points.

2370
02:58:49,595 --> 02:58:50,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem solved.

2371
02:58:50,675 --> 02:58:51,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy crap.

2372
02:58:51,856 --> 02:58:52,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to let you go.

2373
02:58:52,656 --> 02:58:53,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye now.

2374
02:58:53,537 --> 02:58:53,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

2375
02:58:58,179 --> 02:59:00,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2376
02:59:02,062 --> 02:59:08,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in Mass Effect 3, but the after romance scene is quite touching.

2377
02:59:10,527 --> 02:59:14,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Bonds006 says, Enchanted Arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

2378
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:16,551
[SPEAKER_10]: That has tons of guy-on-guy action.

2379
02:59:17,091 --> 02:59:20,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember having tons.

2380
02:59:20,073 --> 02:59:21,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I just remember it being one of the first.

2381
02:59:21,454 --> 02:59:23,275
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, we have more calls coming in, so let's get to them.

2382
02:59:23,695 --> 02:59:24,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2383
02:59:24,756 --> 02:59:25,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2384
02:59:28,547 --> 02:59:29,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2385
02:59:29,811 --> 02:59:30,493
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hear you.

2386
02:59:31,977 --> 02:59:32,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2387
02:59:35,366 --> 02:59:36,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard a click.

2388
02:59:36,426 --> 02:59:36,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2389
02:59:36,766 --> 02:59:37,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, did you hear me?

2390
02:59:38,006 --> 02:59:38,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we do now.

2391
02:59:38,767 --> 02:59:38,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2392
02:59:38,827 --> 02:59:39,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2393
02:59:39,547 --> 02:59:40,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, damn, mic switch.

2394
02:59:40,587 --> 02:59:41,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love those.

2395
02:59:41,368 --> 02:59:41,728
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

2396
02:59:41,748 --> 02:59:42,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Xenocore from the OKC.

2397
02:59:42,708 --> 02:59:43,248
[SPEAKER_07]: How you guys doing?

2398
02:59:43,308 --> 02:59:44,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, how you doing, Xenocore?

2399
02:59:44,549 --> 02:59:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I knew you knew how to work your Skype.

2400
02:59:46,049 --> 02:59:47,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It just had to be something like that.

2401
02:59:47,129 --> 02:59:47,390
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2402
02:59:47,690 --> 02:59:48,370
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2403
02:59:49,210 --> 02:59:50,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much of it.

2404
02:59:50,311 --> 02:59:54,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I purchased Arkham City finally because I said, screw it, I'm not going to get any DLC anyway.

2405
02:59:55,612 --> 02:59:57,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's ruined gaming for me now.

2406
02:59:57,333 --> 03:00:00,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't play half the other games because it's not as satisfying.

2407
03:00:02,046 --> 03:00:03,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Arkham City is just that fucking good.

2408
03:00:03,247 --> 03:00:05,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it raised the bar that high that now everything else sucks.

2409
03:00:18,317 --> 03:00:19,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Asylum is better.

2410
03:00:45,868 --> 03:00:50,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess just the way it goes, you actually feel like you're really whooping ass.

2411
03:00:50,812 --> 03:00:53,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, everybody knows this about Arkham City and Arkham Asylum anyway.

2412
03:00:53,734 --> 03:01:03,140
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't new news, but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet is freaking annoying to me.

2413
03:01:03,240 --> 03:01:07,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally upgraded my POS computer to something that's near top of the line.

2414
03:01:07,543 --> 03:01:13,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I play Arkham City, and now I can't play half the other action or RPG games on it because they all suck.

2415
03:01:14,053 --> 03:01:14,373
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

2416
03:01:44,252 --> 03:01:46,253
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2417
03:02:04,348 --> 03:02:05,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not paying attention to those.

2418
03:02:06,189 --> 03:02:06,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2419
03:02:06,770 --> 03:02:08,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But that combat engine is unique.

2420
03:02:08,891 --> 03:02:13,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to work in anything that's that large because it's tied together.

2421
03:02:13,555 --> 03:02:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the combat from way back when, from the game Oni, when that first came out on a PS2, that combat system was amazing.

2422
03:02:21,342 --> 03:02:23,663
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way they built it, you couldn't do anything else with it.

2423
03:02:23,683 --> 03:02:26,446
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no multiplayer or anything because of the way they glued it together.

2424
03:02:26,506 --> 03:02:26,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

2425
03:02:28,009 --> 03:02:32,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Arkham City and Arkham Asylum that style of gameplay is going to be stuck in that.

2426
03:02:33,066 --> 03:02:34,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you checked out any of the DLC yet?

2427
03:02:35,587 --> 03:02:36,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to.

2428
03:02:37,088 --> 03:02:39,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Robin, Nightwing, whatever.

2429
03:02:41,611 --> 03:02:43,472
[SPEAKER_07]: All I need is a big bat and cat woman and I'm good.

2430
03:02:43,733 --> 03:02:44,413
[SPEAKER_10]: That's interesting.

2431
03:02:44,673 --> 03:02:49,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why, but I find that very interesting that even though you love the game so much, you're like, nah, I don't really need to do the DLC.

2432
03:02:50,117 --> 03:02:56,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for me, I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point just because I'm getting so into this.

2433
03:02:58,322 --> 03:02:59,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect DLC.

2434
03:03:01,304 --> 03:03:02,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus, man.

2435
03:03:02,945 --> 03:03:03,946
[SPEAKER_07]: What a racket that was.

2436
03:03:04,046 --> 03:03:05,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played the Mass Effect DLC?

2437
03:03:06,527 --> 03:03:12,189
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because my roomie, he bought the game when it released, and he was going to ruin it for me.

2438
03:03:12,269 --> 03:03:19,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So after seeing what actually rewards you get, it's like beating Rygar, but not doing it in an old school way.

2439
03:03:19,692 --> 03:03:23,753
[SPEAKER_07]: The old school Rygar ending was something you got because you fucking earned it.

2440
03:03:24,233 --> 03:03:28,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can get to the ending in this game, and it's going to be a piece of shit, so why bother?

2441
03:03:28,535 --> 03:03:29,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to pay for it.

2442
03:03:29,795 --> 03:03:32,696
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish.

2443
03:03:32,936 --> 03:03:37,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Vigar was two screens and one of them had some animation on it.

2444
03:03:37,618 --> 03:03:38,098
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2445
03:03:38,298 --> 03:03:43,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But that game was so freaking hard you were glad to see that screen because not many people get to see it.

2446
03:03:43,880 --> 03:03:44,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

2447
03:03:45,241 --> 03:03:50,443
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just going to slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the ending apparently.

2448
03:03:51,703 --> 03:03:58,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to actually make it to where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without making a single choice at the end.

2449
03:03:58,846 --> 03:04:00,388
[SPEAKER_07]: which ruins the whole experience for me.

2450
03:04:00,428 --> 03:04:02,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So, nah, they're not getting any of my money for that series anymore.

2451
03:04:03,811 --> 03:04:04,111
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2452
03:04:04,752 --> 03:04:06,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Any last thoughts before we let you go tonight, Xenocore?

2453
03:04:07,294 --> 03:04:08,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, to DarkSakura.

2454
03:04:08,355 --> 03:04:09,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Let that Tussin soak in there, girl.

2455
03:04:10,317 --> 03:04:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, put some water in it, shake it up, more Tussin.

2456
03:04:13,480 --> 03:04:14,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Tough it out.

2457
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:14,561
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, no.

2458
03:04:15,242 --> 03:04:15,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully she's listening.

2459
03:04:16,002 --> 03:04:16,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope she heard that.

2460
03:04:16,943 --> 03:04:17,203
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2461
03:04:18,064 --> 03:04:18,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

2462
03:04:19,185 --> 03:04:19,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2463
03:04:19,566 --> 03:04:19,946
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bye.

2464
03:04:19,966 --> 03:04:20,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2465
03:04:24,267 --> 03:04:52,488
[SPEAKER_10]: 1877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio I guess we can try and squeeze in one more call we're getting a lot of calls tonight so I'm going to really try and fit in one more call here before we say goodnight meanwhile I need to read tweets I have been totally ignoring the Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR but let me read some tweets for you right now no I'll take a call then we'll do tweets this will be the last call tonight hi who's this

2466
03:04:53,359 --> 03:04:54,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's Legend of Zaku here.

2467
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:55,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Zaku, what's up?

2468
03:04:56,920 --> 03:05:03,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me and Adam, or Ranma, as we would aptly call him, we all went to PAX together.

2469
03:05:03,882 --> 03:05:05,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, we even roomed together.

2470
03:05:06,063 --> 03:05:06,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

2471
03:05:06,703 --> 03:05:07,103
[SPEAKER_10]: How was it?

2472
03:05:07,123 --> 03:05:08,664
[SPEAKER_10]: How did you enjoy PAX East?

2473
03:05:09,284 --> 03:05:10,965
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost a...

2474
03:05:13,336 --> 03:05:13,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

2475
03:05:36,437 --> 03:05:46,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday, when they actually explained the whole process as to how Rock Band Blitz became, actually gone about.

2476
03:05:46,582 --> 03:05:48,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it actually started off as a prototype.

2477
03:05:50,283 --> 03:05:59,908
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, within, this was a prototype that was done within the course of at least three years, even though it didn't pick up full steam until last summer.

2478
03:06:01,004 --> 03:06:26,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So it basically went through several iterations where, for example, they actually did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls, seeing that they proposed so many ideas and solutions that most of them ended up failing until they found the one that worked, which is basically either the joystick using the D-pads and the buttons or the shoulders,

2479
03:06:27,861 --> 03:06:29,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to hit both notes.

2480
03:06:30,622 --> 03:06:39,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole notion of having, whether or not to make it just like frequency and amplitude in terms of shifting you from one instrument to another automatically.

2481
03:06:40,425 --> 03:06:46,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So it deviates from that in the sense that you can just play any, you can stick with one completely.

2482
03:06:47,348 --> 03:06:52,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tried it today and I was pretty much bouncing from one track to the other within the song.

2483
03:06:53,888 --> 03:07:06,941
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, coupled with the fact that you could just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you obviously hit more notes, then it just basically, it's almost like Audiosurf, but in the sense that everything's structured.

2484
03:07:07,541 --> 03:07:12,886
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, everything is, it's just binary in the sense that...

2485
03:07:15,959 --> 03:07:16,881
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

2486
03:07:17,221 --> 03:07:17,862
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't there.

2487
03:07:17,922 --> 03:07:25,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty certain Prime will probably... That depends if the developers get themselves a booth for Prime.

2488
03:07:25,916 --> 03:07:27,739
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to the point, it's like...

2489
03:07:29,509 --> 03:07:55,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the days of Amplitude, it was pretty much the same way, but the fact that the songs themselves are of a rock nature, where it's not like techno, and this is one of the questions that was brought up in the panel, I guess the rationale was it's easier to just release a product in which, on day one, people who are existing rock band users and consumers

2490
03:07:56,127 --> 03:08:01,169
[SPEAKER_00]: could just start playing right away with their current collection.

2491
03:08:01,229 --> 03:08:20,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into that rock band caliber, like a techno trance song that made Frequency and Amplitude pretty much a cult classic, then folks would have to start all over from scratch.

2492
03:08:21,461 --> 03:08:25,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me try to get away from the rock band stuff for a minute because we've seen so much about it on the internet.

2493
03:08:26,063 --> 03:08:27,283
[SPEAKER_10]: What other panels did you get to?

2494
03:08:28,024 --> 03:08:32,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, the other ones... Let me see.

2495
03:08:32,905 --> 03:08:33,886
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kotaku panel.

2496
03:08:33,986 --> 03:08:39,028
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on Friday where everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour.

2497
03:08:39,728 --> 03:08:43,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just threw out one little question in terms of...

2498
03:08:45,010 --> 03:08:47,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku.

2499
03:08:48,213 --> 03:08:55,418
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were really in the site, you would actually know all their sections, how they have their own blocks of stories.

2500
03:08:55,438 --> 03:08:56,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, they let anyone have a panel?

2501
03:08:57,119 --> 03:09:01,603
[SPEAKER_10]: They clearly are letting anyone have a panel, so I want an OLR panel at PAX Prime.

2502
03:09:02,711 --> 03:09:06,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they had folks writing stories within the hour.

2503
03:09:06,793 --> 03:09:08,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a workshop?

2504
03:09:08,514 --> 03:09:17,338
[SPEAKER_00]: They had people actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or actually taking pictures and so forth.

2505
03:09:17,358 --> 03:09:18,919
[SPEAKER_00]: There was even live blogging.

2506
03:09:19,199 --> 03:09:19,960
[SPEAKER_08]: That's productive.

2507
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:24,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Open the floor back up to the people banned from a website.

2508
03:09:24,222 --> 03:09:26,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they suck their own dick in front of all you guys too?

2509
03:09:28,208 --> 03:09:37,300
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like... What happened was the editors, or actually the former editor of Kotaku, was spearheading the panel.

2510
03:09:37,340 --> 03:09:42,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was that folks would just pitch their story ideas.

2511
03:09:42,988 --> 03:09:43,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And the audience...

2512
03:09:45,376 --> 03:09:51,743
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience would actually pick the ones that they would want to hear about.

2513
03:09:52,223 --> 03:09:57,829
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that hour, they would have to actually write an article for it.

2514
03:09:57,869 --> 03:10:01,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they have a big gong and did somebody judge people?

2515
03:10:03,130 --> 03:10:08,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the editors, obviously, the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there.

2516
03:10:08,373 --> 03:10:13,457
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, no disrespect, but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panel, so tell me about another one.

2517
03:10:14,117 --> 03:10:29,567
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the other one caught the tail end of the Epic panel, where Cliffy B basically was just going off for questions in the audience, one of which was a girl actually trolled

2518
03:10:30,492 --> 03:10:34,678
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2519
03:10:45,532 --> 03:10:49,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she was promptly arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel.

2520
03:10:49,114 --> 03:10:49,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It was amazing.

2521
03:10:50,275 --> 03:10:54,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, but the last one I caught was basically a classic arcade panel.

2522
03:10:54,918 --> 03:10:56,739
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you have my interest?

2523
03:10:57,079 --> 03:11:02,182
[SPEAKER_00]: In PAX, they have an actual classic arcade room.

2524
03:11:02,282 --> 03:11:04,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but old arcade machines.

2525
03:11:04,843 --> 03:11:05,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that room.

2526
03:11:06,284 --> 03:11:11,968
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks from ACAM, the American Classic Arcade Museum, actually ran the panel with...

2527
03:11:12,648 --> 03:11:21,679
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original older arcade titles, one of which was Food Fight and Ms.

2528
03:11:21,719 --> 03:11:28,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Pac-Man, and then the third one was a developer for the Cruisin' series.

2529
03:11:29,128 --> 03:11:29,628
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.

2530
03:11:29,648 --> 03:11:32,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were going through how back in the day they were like,

2531
03:11:34,059 --> 03:11:34,740
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2532
03:11:50,871 --> 03:11:51,432
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2533
03:12:09,948 --> 03:12:12,549
[SPEAKER_00]: and to the point where it leads up to the crash.

2534
03:12:12,749 --> 03:12:14,270
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running long here, Zaku.

2535
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:20,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con.

2536
03:12:20,592 --> 03:12:21,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain prizes.

2537
03:12:21,713 --> 03:12:22,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Swag.

2538
03:12:22,553 --> 03:12:23,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Swag.

2539
03:12:24,174 --> 03:12:24,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Free shit.

2540
03:12:24,614 --> 03:12:25,414
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.

2541
03:12:25,494 --> 03:12:31,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Battlefield 3 in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4 gig USB drive.

2542
03:12:31,917 --> 03:12:32,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!

2543
03:12:32,077 --> 03:12:32,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!

2544
03:12:48,328 --> 03:12:50,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just saying me and Adam had ourselves a kick-ass time.

2545
03:12:51,049 --> 03:12:53,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go, but I'm glad you had a great time.

2546
03:12:53,550 --> 03:12:55,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I'm a little jealous, but I guess I'm happy.

2547
03:12:56,250 --> 03:12:57,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, Zaku.

2548
03:12:58,351 --> 03:12:58,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one.

2549
03:12:59,051 --> 03:12:59,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2550
03:13:00,132 --> 03:13:01,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things haven't changed.

2551
03:13:01,252 --> 03:13:04,133
[SPEAKER_08]: All this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms.

2552
03:13:04,993 --> 03:13:05,794
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

2553
03:13:29,409 --> 03:13:37,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment tweeted us saying Bank of America tried to foreclose on homes in a state that they don't have the right to operate in How did EA win worst company?

2554
03:13:38,266 --> 03:13:39,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's the internet

2555
03:13:40,071 --> 03:13:41,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo.

2556
03:13:43,452 --> 03:13:46,153
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, the hunt at OLR is heating up.

2557
03:13:46,534 --> 03:13:48,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Your next challenge starts this week.

2558
03:13:48,274 --> 03:13:50,595
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a little different from what you're expecting.

2559
03:13:51,015 --> 03:13:51,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Go play the hunt.

2560
03:13:51,716 --> 03:13:52,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Go get your score in Joust.

2561
03:13:52,856 --> 03:13:55,017
[SPEAKER_10]: He said he'll extend it to like Tuesday or Wednesday.

2562
03:13:55,157 --> 03:13:56,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what I'm doing on the bus tonight.

2563
03:13:56,418 --> 03:13:56,938
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2564
03:13:57,918 --> 03:13:59,139
[SPEAKER_10]: You can work it on your iPhone.

2565
03:13:59,619 --> 03:13:59,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2566
03:14:00,039 --> 03:14:00,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not restricted.

2567
03:14:00,959 --> 03:14:02,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like an on your honor thing.

2568
03:14:02,540 --> 03:14:04,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you go and Photoshop something, you're just a dick.

2569
03:14:05,021 --> 03:14:07,422
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't play in our competition just to be a dick.

2570
03:14:07,782 --> 03:14:08,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2571
03:14:30,945 --> 03:14:39,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Activision Blizzard has been sued for patent infringement of Virtual Worlds usage due to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty.

2572
03:14:40,248 --> 03:14:42,769
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being sued by Worlds Inc.

2573
03:14:43,469 --> 03:14:44,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Worlds Inc.

2574
03:14:44,429 --> 03:14:47,790
[SPEAKER_10]: claims that World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are violating the patent.

2575
03:14:48,591 --> 03:14:56,073
[SPEAKER_10]: "...technologies created by Worlds have helped the business of Virtual Worlds and gaming and the sale of virtual goods to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry."

2576
03:14:56,573 --> 03:14:57,954
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the second time they've done this.

2577
03:14:57,974 --> 03:15:00,455
[SPEAKER_10]: They filed suit against NCSoft in 2008 for City of Heroes.

2578
03:15:00,475 --> 03:15:02,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It was dismissed after an undisclosed settlement was obtained.

2579
03:15:20,464 --> 03:15:20,884
[SPEAKER_08]: World's Inc.

2580
03:15:20,904 --> 03:15:22,165
[SPEAKER_08]: has been in business since either 99 or 2000.

2581
03:15:22,245 --> 03:15:25,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually know of them.

2582
03:15:25,627 --> 03:15:38,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard the name too, but to say they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, it's kind of like, dude, I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated because things have changed since the Revolutionary War.

2583
03:15:40,116 --> 03:15:40,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Just slightly.

2584
03:15:42,806 --> 03:15:59,675

[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch.

2592
03:16:53,614 --> 03:16:56,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to beat Mass Effect 2 tonight, I think, maybe.

2593

[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2596
03:16:59,480 --> 03:17:00,721
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is...

2597
03:17:02,318 --> 03:17:24,989
[SPEAKER_10]: BRB, Disneyland See you guys in two weeks Thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio Thank you for subscribing to our show Thank you for supporting our show If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio Please tell a friend or two about the show Help spread the word That's all we ask We don't have big advertising dollars behind this We don't have giant PAX panels Where we can sit there and suck our dicks on stage for an hour

2598
03:17:26,149 --> 03:17:27,670
[SPEAKER_10]: to help spread the word about the show.

2599

[SPEAKER_10]: So please tell a friend or two.

2600
03:17:29,831 --> 03:17:32,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe we can get that panel someday.

2601
03:17:32,132 --> 03:17:39,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Although honestly, I would much rather have a panel let some of those guys who founded the way from the classic arcade games of the past sit in.

2602
03:17:39,755 --> 03:17:40,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to hear them talk.
