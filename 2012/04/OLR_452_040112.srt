Please listen to orange lounge radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

66
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,600
And that's a real feat because he's dead I know right it's like from the great beyond

67
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,780
It's like what's that crying under the ground? Did someone buried a baby down there?

68
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Orange lounge radio live

69
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,720
452 for those April the 1st of 2012. I can't help but feel there's something about today like something special

70
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,960
I was supposed to remember but oh well, whatever

71
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,180
So anyhow, we're here in studio

72
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,760
Chilling out to dynamite rave which always makes me think of your freestyle routine Loki. Yes, the one I forgot like

73
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,060
Like fuck it. I'm walking out up on stage. You just fucking froze didn't what did the judge? I didn't freeze

74
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,060
I just like I forgot it about

75
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,660
Halfway through it. I'm like and fuck it. What did the judges score you on that when I remember it was like a three

76
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,360
It's like long ago would have been better if you hadn't used mirror

77
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
probably

78
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,640
Good times. Well, how you doing dark Sakura? I

79
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,920
I want a burrito. Do you instead? I'm going to have tea. I thought you were doing this whole fasting thing

80
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,400
That's why I'm having tea. See Alan is being kind enough

81
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,280
He was gonna miss tonight was gonna be Taco Fest Eva here at Studio

82
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,320
OL are and he's been kind enough to postpone that until the show is over. I

83
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
appreciate it

84
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,620
No problem. We have a very busy schedule of news tonight

85
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,380
There was the Konami press event this week that just came out of the blue

86
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,060
The cannot I don't remember what's called the Konami kissa nieta or something like that

87
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,700
I think they were celebrating the 15th anniversary of something but we are gonna talk about all that another Frogger anniversary cuz goddamn that

88
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,960
No, I mean this we're gonna talk about Frogger on this show. Did you miss the part about it's Bemani? Yeah

89
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,340
I understand I understand that but you know, they like to throw out those Frogger anniversaries

90
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,680
We're celebrating the 23rd anniversary for it's like no fucking care

91
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,340
Maybe there will be a version of DDR

92
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,780
Well little little frogs will show up on the air on the little arrow pads and you can step on them to kill them

93
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,860
That would be it. I play that

94
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
It's like that spider stomp

95
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
exactly

96
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,860
And I have witnessed the spider stomp freestyle routine that was that was interest

97
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,300
How did the spider stop freestyle routine go down? It was it was explicit that did it. I'm I believe and

98
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
It was pretty awesome

99
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,760
No, no was explicit

100
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,680
I don't remember now wasn't an explicit routine because I've seen some of those in my ears of DDR festiva's and so forth

101
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,320
Ah, I don't remember. It was something that it came out when we went to

102
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
we had to play Q's are and

103
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,580
How does the spider stomp freestyle work I don't understand

104
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:24,500
It's just like DDR but spider stomp, you know, I step on the glowing bubbles what?

105
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,900
Nothing. I was just remembering went working in the arcade and having a spider stomp

106
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,120
Did you have a spider stomp it we did in Alabama?

107
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,900
Wherever it was you were when I worked at cyber station. We had a spider a spider shop. Mm-hmm

108
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,540
I was really good at spider stomp to saying no

109
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,420
I remember was now is a prestige routine or prestige. Oh that guy. Yeah, that guy was hilarious

110
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Yeah, good times

111
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,620
All right. Well, we're gonna start off the show us we always do with a little bit of how was your week?

112
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,500
How was your day where we talk about?

113
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,460
Whatever the hell you want from this past week or day and so forth because you know

114
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,460
It is the home of all things Bamani and then some so this is the and then some part of it dark soccer ladies first

115
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,700
so, uh

116
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Friday actually Thursday. I

117
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,460
I called my friend's new boss and said hey, I'd like to work there

118
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,980
Friday I went in for no. No, that was Wednesday because I was at school Thursday. I get a call back

119
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
asking how did you get the number and

120
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,540
Send me a resume then I get a call back after I interviewed for my had my second interview for eHarmony

121
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,100
And they're like, okay. Can you come in tomorrow? So I went in Friday

122
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
They like we like you

123
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:42,420
So now I have a job. I start my day. You got a job. Yay Kermit. Yeah, so eHarmony when they're you know, like for example

124
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,180
Checking out new candidates for job positions. Do they match them up with you know, different levels of compatibility, you know

125
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
They actually go through a recruiting service

126
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,780
Ah, maybe you're 80% compatible for this this job and maybe only 60% are your

127
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,420
Homosexual you cannot apply not true because they have a service called compatible partners now

128
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Because they got sued into it

129
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,140
But yeah, so I got to send them a rejection letter

130
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,420
The eHarmony people how do you go about writing a rejection letter?

131
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,820
Are you really supposed to be talking about what company you said? No to I mean, I don't know

132
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,740
I I'm sure they don't listen to this show if they do. Sorry

133
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,380
I was like, I regret to inform you that I have chosen a more qualified position with another company

134
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:38,220
You know, I said they're paying me more it's it's you know better work more challenging more what I'm looking for. Give me money

135
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm sorry. We're not a match

136
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,620
You stood up eHarmony, that's awesome. I

137
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,260
I mean honestly eHarmony like judging everything

138
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,300
They just seemed like a fantastic company to work for the working-from-home thing would've been cool

139
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
but you know, I have bills I

140
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,860
Need and on top of that I need to get out of the house

141
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,540
And how long how long is the job dry spell been going on now? It's been a little bit, right?

142
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,860
It's been bad. I got laid off November 2010. Oh, wow

143
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
So yeah, it's been a while

144
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,300
Um, but here's the funny thing. I will be working with my BFF Becky. We worked at the same last job

145
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,540
So that's not a recipe for disaster or anything. No, cuz we we know how to behave in a professional environment

146
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,260
We're doing two different jobs on top of that. You know, it's just it's gonna mean, you know nice

147
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,700
So very cool

148
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,500
Loki how was your week? How was your day? Uh

149
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,860
Mainly this week. It was just kind of I don't know

150
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,860
um back to work

151
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,960
Because last week I was off a couple days to watch Josh ball. Nellie was

152
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,060
Going to the doctor and stuff. Um, and then

153
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
What else I do

154
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,300
Slapped nothing. I didn't sleep that much actually. No, it was pretty much

155
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,660
Just always saw the Hunger Games last week, I think I already talked about that though

156
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,340
Uh

157
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Nellie went and saw

158
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:18,340
The bodyguard in theaters what yeah because they had one night it was the 20th anniversary of the bodyguard and

159
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,840
and so she went and saw it in theaters and she said that the sound mix was horrible that they

160
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,580
Then when they I guess remastered it they remastered it in a tin can and so it just sounded very tinny

161
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,500
Does this mean that they're coming out with like a new blu-ray or something? That's yes. It came out on Tuesday actually and she wants that

162
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,180
Of course, she does

163
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,860
So yes, she she went but you wouldn't take her to see it. No forget. No, here's the thing

164
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,860
I had a movie screen to us was to be going to this week

165
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,320
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in in time because I didn't catch the email until a day later

166
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,220
But I had an opportunity to see Ted, but I I missed it

167
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,420
and Ted of course is the new comedy with

168
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,740
Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis

169
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Which is being written by?

170
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,460
Seth MacFarlane, it's about a guy who wishes for his teddy bear to come alive one Christmas and then he does and so he has

171
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,000
This walking talking teddy bear, but now he's grown up. And so there's this teddy bear that's with him

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That it's just like this boozing

173
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Prostitute sleeping with you know, there's still that from an episode of supernatural

174
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,980
I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about that. That sounds kind of scary

175
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,980
So they totally stole that from Supernatural. It sounded sounded funny, but unfortunately didn't get through that

176
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,940
Oh, and of course, you know, I played some DDR. So

177
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,140
That was my week. Absolutely. All right

178
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Okay my week I

179
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,740
Read a book y'all. I read a book. I read a book from start to finish

180
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,980
You can I did I can and I read a book. I read a book in like four days

181
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,980
I think I only took about four days. I read The Hunger Games

182
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,420
Okay

183
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,200
Let me I'm disappointed didn't I give you a copy of?

184
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Ready player one. No

185
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,140
Well, I'm gonna give you a copy of ready player one cuz you want to read that. All right, I'll read ready

186
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,780
I'll give you both a copy of ready player one sweet. No, I I don't know why I read The Hunger Games

187
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,420
I mean, yes, I know it's a movie and all that stuff. Oh my god, I heard

188
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,100
But all my friends are reading it and just raving and raving about it and like won't shut up about what a good book

189
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,020
It is so I'm like fine. I'll check it out. I'll try it

190
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,580
And so I read the whole thing start to finish and it wasn't bad

191
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,900
so what did I do the day after I read The Hunger Games when saw the movie and

192
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,940
seeing the movie with everything so fresh in my mind was

193
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,640
It was easy for me to pick out everything that really bugged me about what they changed from the book and even Alan commented

194
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,440
Like I could tell every time they changed something from the book because I would just hear this deep sigh coming from over where you're at

195
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, but I think according to my wife. She said that actually the movie is better than the book

196
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,280
They're different. I'm not gonna say one is better than the other. I think they were both good

197
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,920
They were both good in their own way, but because they moved the biggest problem

198
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,800
Quote-unquote with the translation is that because the book is first person and the movie's third person

199
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,100
There's a lot they have to do differently because you're not inside her head

200
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,380
So they have to use a lot of these other scenes to kind of explain what's going on because she can't do it in her

201
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,540
Head for you. So seeing these extra scenes was a little weird, but it wasn't bad

202
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,360
I like the visual translation of it all and can we stop can we stop can we stop with the battle royale comparisons?

203
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,140
Seriously, like I get it kids having to play the death to the match thing. Okay. Yes, lol. It's very similar, but

204
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,740
It's the same thing that was done in Stephen King's the long walk. It was the same thing that was done in Logan's run

205
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,340
Heck if you want to go all the way back to ancient Greek mythology

206
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,180
Wasn't the Minotaur maze the same thing like they would offer up kids to go in the Minotaur maze the miniatures of you know

207
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,300
I mean that was I mean it goes way way back

208
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,620
So it's not like like I hate to break it to you guys battle royale wasn't necessarily totally original either

209
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm just a little offended that you would read the book for the Hunger Games, but you didn't read battle royale

210
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,380
I did try to read battle royale, but it was kind of boring

211
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,060
It was good, but I was telling a friend. This is that if I'm not in the exact right mood when I'm reading a book

212
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,660
then I'm gonna a

213
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,940
Squirrel do something else like my ADD so bad. So I'll try to read battle royale. That's because you can't read

214
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,580
I will that's because you weren't reading ready player one

215
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Maybe that maybe that

216
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,660
So but I liked um, of course, I liked battle royale. I'm not dogging on battle royale

217
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,060
I'm not dogging on battle royale. It's a fine movie and hell many years ago on this show

218
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,500
We used to talk about you know, didn't we start off one show with a paper plate battle royale one night?

219
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,260
I seem to remember it was really funny and stupid and you know what I have to say about the movie and it being you

220
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:49,160
Know brought over here in the US the US soundtrack is far superior than the Japanese soundtrack for that movie really

221
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes, it is

222
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,380
far superior interesting. All right, I

223
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I

224
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,420
See what you did there

225
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,900
So I'm trying to think what else is going on my week because dark soccer is not in the room right now

226
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,980
And I want to wait for her to get back so we can do the news. I

227
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,900
Don't know I've been very kind of much a homebody I

228
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,780
Didn't get a new job this week. I've been at the same job for ten years, but I like my jobs. It's okay. So I

229
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:23,400
I we went to the movies just say that we went out to Chinese food, which was good

230
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,620
This is great radio in that. Yeah

231
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,280
Do you think maybe I should do a break song and then we'll come back and we'll talk about what's going on in the news

232
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,740
this week, uh

233
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,460
Yeah, sure. All right, we're gonna do a quick break. We're gonna come back and we'll talk about what is in the news this week

234
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:57,060
There's a lot of stuff. So stay tuned guys. We'll be right back on more of orange launch radio

235
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
Oh

236
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Oh

237
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Hi

238
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,900
We're back dark soccer is all better. She's back joining us

239
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Instinct up the bathroom. Did you know?

240
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Good if you must know I had to pee. Thank you. Ah, la la la la TMI

241
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,640
alright, so news there's lots and lots of Omani news going on this week because

242
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,240
Konami had a surprise key Sanyara event, which surprise we weren't invited to what a shock

243
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,220
You think we're covering bimani this long that you know, we'd be the top of the list but no no no

244
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,800
No, we're award-winning bimani podcast. I know they needed the seats for g4. So what can you do?

245
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,520
Anyhow, so there was lots of news to come out of the event

246
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,760
This is this is crazy to me, but there is a brand new dancing stage game announced

247
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,680
Which as you know is the name for it over in Europe?

248
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,080
But they've also used this in Japan before for artists exclusive games and they're going back to that

249
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,900
Like what was the last dancing stage game? We had dancing stage featuring dreams come true

250
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah, was it I couldn't remember if dreams come true or true kiss destination one of them

251
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,400
It was back in like 99 or 2000 what which for the record? I found my copy of that Wow

252
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,620
Well, you can get it out to celebrate because they've announced dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga is coming

253
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,520
Awesome. I know right? Yeah, it's the first artist exclusive game since dancing stage

254
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,400
the older ones dreams come true and true kiss destination

255
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Lady Gaga songs, of course, they have to be in every single music game ever released, of course, right?

256
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,280
So it just made sense that she's gonna get her own

257
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,160
Dancing stage game now

258
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
We don't know all the songs that are gonna be in it

259
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,560
But we do know bad romances in it because that was the song that they demoed in the trailer which makes sense

260
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,600
Do you think bad romance would be a tough DDR song?

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,020
Do you think that'll be like a seven or an eight or a nine or what? I put it in seven

262
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,680
Yeah, I could see I could see them doing like some runs or the I lots of I remember correctly

263
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,760
I believe the true kiss destination and the dreams come true stuff. Those songs weren't that hard

264
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
I think it was like six and sevens were the highest because it's more of the casual

265
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,560
Casual DDR player kind of that they're targeting there

266
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,360
So you think you think that the Lady Gaga audition is gonna be dumbed down a little bit

267
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,680
I think yeah, it's not gonna be you're not gonna have like, you know paranoia level stuff in there

268
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,480
It's just gonna be kind of you know, sixes and sevens, you know more stuff

269
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,560
That's fun to dance to and less of more of it less of a challenge

270
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,080
I guess unless I did a paranoia remix club para gaga

271
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,400
They're not gonna do that. I I'm so on the board with this idea para gaga

272
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,320
They're not gonna do something like that or how that better game para para gaga

273
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,800
Maybe maybe if this one does very well now

274
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,200
What's weird is that they haven't talked about any home releases for this. So this is like an arcade exclusive thing

275
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,000
But that's usually how it works. You know, they'll have a home release later on

276
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
They'll just dump it into the engine of like a dance dance, you know revolution game or something like that

277
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,680
Yeah, that makes sense

278
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,160
No

279
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
This is really weird because I get did the other

280
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,100
Dancing stage games have like a couple songs from other artists like a couple of Konami originals in it

281
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,900
I don't remember because I found this really weird. There is actually a Katy Perry song in this game to

282
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:28,220
California girls is apparently gonna be playable in this game. It's in the press release, but it's only available in basic mode

283
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,860
Really strange. Yes, something about Katy Perry is only basic. So yeah only available in basic

284
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,080
So I go figure I guess, you know

285
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,340
Be a very casual relaxed on but I could definitely see some freestyle to that

286
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,860
I could definitely see Wendell busting out a California girl

287
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,160
Perhaps they're going even so far as to like say, you know

288
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,560
How they did with kind of some of the other mixes where they'll have a preview of the following mix

289
00:25:53,560 --> 00:26:00,840
Maybe they're they're previewing the Katy Perry version or maybe getting the reception for the Katy Perry version before

290
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,340
They actually come out and put out full release for it. That makes sense. If people hate that then that's right

291
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,800
It's like oh, whoa, whoa, stop if they go like this this chick is too basic. Then they will reject the Katy Perry mix

292
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,920
Yeah, that could possibly come out later

293
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,240
So on a scale of one to ten, how important is the dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga news?

294
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
That's a seven. I

295
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Just don't care

296
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,720
Really? I mean, well, hey more more dancing stage DVR mixes are a good thing, I guess so I'll give it a five

297
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,680
I'll give it an 11 because there's nothing in the world. I love more than DDR and Lady Gaga. So there you go

298
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,580
No, what if it was RuPaul's?

299
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:50,980
Dancing stage featuring RuPaul's Drag Race dancing stage featuring Abba I would so you're right that would that would be a 12 if it was

300
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,740
Dancin say that you would get a ps3 when an Abba game came out and sure enough sing star Abba came out and guess what?

301
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,740
I got did you ever pick up that?

302
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,280
The Abba you can dance. Yes, I did

303
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,460
That was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life if we were hooked up to do it

304
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,360
I would play it live on air tonight, but sadly we're not oh darn darn

305
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,580
Yeah, what a bummer. That was seriously the happiest moment of my life

306
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,800
What watching me play that watching you do the ballet style stuff for?

307
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,340
The winner takes it all. Mm-hmm. That was the best thing I've ever seen. All right, well

308
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
Let's move on to the other big piece of news

309
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,600
from the Konami key scenario event that had to do with the money and

310
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,860
This kind of was a surprise because you guys know we've been saying this on the show for years this

311
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,520
Series was really underrated and a lot of people gave this series a lot of shit

312
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
And it was actually really good if you play it

313
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Yeah

314
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
so the game that is

315
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Announced rock revolution 2 has been announced. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you're talking about good series rock revolution 2

316
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
was announced for consoles and arcade

317
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,920
So there I guess it's kind of like well, I mean if it's arcades and they're probably just renaming

318
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,040
You know guitar freaks germania probably I think they're trying to americanize it a little bit or maybe they ran out of mixed numbers

319
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,160
Could be the what they didn't know and this is Konami. I don't think they'll ever run out of mixed numbers

320
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,360
But this is this is interesting

321
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,380
Konami is actually thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different here rock revolution to the console versions

322
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,360
Will link up to the arcades using Konami's transferring

323
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,000
So you're actually going to be able to take your unlocks your characters and whatever settings you have in the home version

324
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,080
You can take those and transfer them into the arcade

325
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,440
It's got neat. Yeah

326
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,160
Now I'm wondering if like, you know, cuz one thing that you know

327
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
You used to be able to do was the whole edits and you could you know, save your edits down to a memory card

328
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,880
But you never really were able to do that in guitar freaks to draw mania

329
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,440
So maybe maybe this is gonna be like some type of like jam session and you could transfer that into the arcade

330
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,400
Could I play it could would this allow me to play guar in the arcade? Yes or no?

331
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,840
I don't know. Maybe it would probably be something more like

332
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
You know, you could take your

333
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,160
Ranked like say you score something like a high score on a song and you can take that to the arcade and take it home

334
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,800
And that way it's still linked to your you know, Konami profile or whatever

335
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,640
I

336
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,600
Don't know as long as they improve the drum controller for the home version because that was terrible

337
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,720
But I understand why they're doing something like this

338
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,280
I mean if you think about it, there's not really new guitar games coming out aside from you know

339
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,720
Some of the ones actually use real guitars. There's not any plastic instrument games anymore

340
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,400
There's a lot of plastic instruments that people have that are just collecting dust

341
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,120
It's time to you know dust those things off and actually play another music game dark soccer. You're awfully quiet

342
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,820
Does the prospect of a rock revolution to excite you?

343
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
Not really why I didn't play the rock revolution one. I

344
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,080
Was busy. Maybe it's time to catch up. I've been too busy with para para lately

345
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,860
so anything new right now is just sort of like

346
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,640
But but I want to wave my arms and wear pink and you know

347
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
platform boots and who doesn't

348
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,800
You know, I think I think that if they if they keep up with like I like the transferring element to it

349
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,480
That can make it exciting. Mm-hmm, but I still would have to wait for judging the final

350
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Right

351
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,040
All we have are these fluffy press releases and things

352
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,920
So I don't really want to get excited until I see something. Mm-hmm now some folks in our chat room

353
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,160
Which by the way, I still have not plugged the chat room. It is we are no longer on Cali Bamani calm

354
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,560
So don't go there. You want to go to chat that orange on traded calm that changed recently. We're not on Cali Bamani

355
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
It's chat that orange on traded calm

356
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,720
So check that out and Tiger class says will rock revolution to have connect support on the 360

357
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
maybe

358
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,800
It's it's certainly possible. Anything's possible. I

359
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,920
Could see it. I mean, you know economy's done some connect enabled games recently. So why not? Why not exactly now?

360
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,600
I was curious what harmonix was gonna do in response to this and it looks like harmonix is cutting them off

361
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:21,960
Did you notice did you harmonix release this today? Did you guys see this? This is pretty amazing product not yet rated

362
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
It's Rock Band Board Game

363
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
That's

364
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,960
Right Rock Band Board Game is the newest game from harmonix musical system

365
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,880
Featuring all the fun and authenticity of Rock Band without the hassle of big bulky instruments

366
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,400
See that that seems like a dig a little bit at Konami like the whole like you don't need instruments for this

367
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,880
That's dig and board game who who would have thought Konami?

368
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:03,800
Advancing technology with trans faring and all this stuff harmonix scaling back. I really don't understand the direction. They're trying to go there

369
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:10,800
It's I did the whole separation from MTV games. I was worried about that when they announced that but this this is interesting

370
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,720
It's an interesting tactic. They're going after the pen and paper crowd

371
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,200
It is an untapped market. That's true. I mean, you know once this happens what's to say? We can't get you know, Rock Band the RPG

372
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,040
That's very true. You know, actually let me let me did you see the dice?

373
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,520
Rock Band Board Game has a larger song library than any other rhythm action board game

374
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,840
Yeah, set this challenge drop three red song cards

375
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Say it ain't so. Tubular. Say it ain't so. Again. Okay. Say it ain't so.

376
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,400
And what do I do notice say it ain't so I end up playing that an awful lot in Rock Band

377
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,960
That is that is hopefully they'll put out a patch to just you know, it's not that I hate that song

378
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm like really maybe you should pick another song. Yeah, I think you've played this enough. Yeah, exactly

379
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:12,040
The Rock Band features you've come to love the party will never stop rocking features like character creator

380
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,620
See now this that is a direct attack on the pen and paper market. Look at that

381
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,440
They have a calibration character sheets and they're making their own characters

382
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
So it's kind of like, you know

383
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,160
You are only so limited to what you could do on the console versions like there are only so many hats

384
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,560
Yeah, but now you can draw your own damn hat exactly. It's amazing and give it its own stats and everything

385
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,720
It was very interesting watching the different directions these two companies go in

386
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,760
so

387
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,280
So Rock Revolution 2 how amazing is this news on a scale of 1 to 10 Loki?

388
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,000
It all depends on how good it is. I mean cuz

389
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,140
It could be very terrible or it could be very good. I don't know. I'm not ready to radiate yet

390
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,380
All right, fair enough dark Sakura. I'm just gonna say a 6 for my excitement level. I'll wait and see

391
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,180
I'm gonna give it a 9 because I'm just excited that Rock Revolution is coming back

392
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm very excited this whole thing sounds like it's gonna be amazing and push technology forward. All right one more story

393
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,760
We've got to cover tonight. This did not come out of the event. But oh my god

394
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,860
It was like timed at the exact same time or so. It's crazy. I couldn't say anything about it either

395
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:25,380
I know what is up with that? You're supposed to be like our inside scoop to this. I had an NDA. I'm sorry. Yeah, fuck

396
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,220
Yo, NDA and I wanted to go to Las Vegas again. All right. All right, here's the here it is you guys

397
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,380
DDR freak extreme has been announced. That's right a press release j-dog the owner of DDR freak calm

398
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,860
of course put out a press release this week that simply said we are starting over and

399
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,420
They are gonna relaunch DDR freak. It's gonna be DDR freak extreme

400
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,000
Calm there will be an upgraded machine locations database that will have Google Maps integration with it

401
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,600
Which I think is that's smart, right and everything's on Google Maps now

402
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,440
And they're gonna have brand new forums because you're the forums were starting to get be a little bit of a problem

403
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,200
Right dark soccer you were moderate. Yeah, so they're gonna do brand new forums and what they're doing. They're actually gonna let

404
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,120
Random topics have their own sub forums. So the wolf game is now gonna have its own sub forum and

405
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:18,340
And pornography posts will have its own sub forum. Yeah, there's actually a code written into the PHP BB

406
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,800
Yes, that's gonna allow any of those

407
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,260
External sites that like to traffic through forums that they all just go directly there. Oh, that's very own forum

408
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,780
You know because when I think where am I gonna go to get porno links?

409
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:38,300
DDR free and it's also for the goat's-a-pix and the bukkake and everything. That's great lemon party

410
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,500
Well, there would be like a sub sub forum. I mean, I'm sure there will do girls one cup reaction

411
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,560
But we have to have a moderator for that with a very strong stomach. I see

412
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,460
Well, you know, how did you audition people for that who ended up getting that?

413
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,460
Some guy with these initials RJ

414
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,900
He's apparently some overweight old actor

415
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,900
Figure yeah, I don't know. I mean he sent a picture dudes got

416
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,500
anyway

417
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
So anyway, so you're welcome to have it Ron

418
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,180
All right, awesome

419
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,820
So but um, the other thing that is actually gonna be that I finally got the okay to talk about wait

420
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,140
Is this like an exclusive?

421
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,460
It could be an exclusive is DDR freak radio gonna get pissed off because that might be a little weird because you know

422
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
There's the two radio stations. Well

423
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,700
There was a little talk about they wanted to acquire us what?

424
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:38,980
So like we're gonna be the official radio state. What's gonna happen to DDR freak radio? Well, it's gone

425
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,620
They had to start over remember. Oh, okay. I get it. Yeah, so

426
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,820
Well, I

427
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,520
Guess so, but I mean, but all games radios treated us so well over the years

428
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,720
Well, no, they what it is would be like a partnership where they want us to be the official podcaster for DDR news

429
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Okay. Yeah, so with that

430
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,620
So that could work heck. Yeah, so DDR freak extreme. Are you excited to post there again? Loki?

431
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Hell, yeah, I'd be awesome. Yeah

432
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,460
Good idea to get the community back together exactly. There's the other thing too. That is kind of hush-hush. Okay?

433
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,340
Oh, I love it CD our flash. What's this that works with the USB dance pad?

434
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,820
Huh?

435
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,660
So like integrated into the site. Yeah. Oh, can you do like your own music and stuff that I don't know yet

436
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,220
They're still working on licensing. I see. You can actually browse the forums using the dance pad. Ah, it's cool

437
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
I like that idea. I like that idea

438
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,820
Especially especially if you're looking at the porn forums, but they've actually um, very you've actually done a Kinect hack

439
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,820
As well so that you can navigate the site with your Kinect controller

440
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,620
There was the 1.5 release of Kinect on PC and have full integration

441
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
Very cool. Yeah, so

442
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,380
DDR freak extreme let's go around and rate the

443
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,420
Importance of that news on a scale of 1 to 10 a dark Sakura totally a 10 DDR freak was the best time

444
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
I ever had biased biased

445
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,060
Loki, uh

446
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,140
Eight we always need more places for porn links. That's true. That's true

447
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,500
I would normally give it an 8 but the porn forum 9 it's just it's very important. So maybe

448
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,100
Well, and you the other thing too, is it for people who are offended?

449
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,780
They just don't have to click on it. That's right. Don't click it. It's the best thing ever

450
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,220
And they oh, oh, I have to tell you about the other form. They got at it. What a little cat form

451
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:34,780
All little cats how nice that they've evolved with the rest of the internet. I know that's great. Okay. Yeah

452
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,160
I have to shut my mouth before I let out the whole

453
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,340
Grid thing. Well the users that were banned last time still be banned. We're gonna make them their own forum. Oh

454
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:51,740
Oh, like the troll grounds or something. We're gonna call it hall of the band. Hmm. I like that. It's a catchy name

455
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,980
Alright, well don't go anywhere guys. We have plenty more show to come

456
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,780
We have the cage match is coming up in just a little bit F use of the week and we might

457
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,420
Just have to play match game. Yay

458
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:15,100
All right, so we'll be back after this with more of orange lounge radio after a quick break

459
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh

460
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,420
Oh

461
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Oh

462
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,580
All right, one two three

463
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,820
Okay, so obviously everything we just did was bullshit

464
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,700
Actually, well the stuff we did this week. That was all true, right?

465
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Except for the para para

466
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,740
Finding my copy of dreams come true because mine was a burn

467
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,540
All the stories we talked about sadly were fake. I mean really the Konami keys in your event, please

468
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,740
So we made all that shit up and DER freak is people outside, California

469
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,300
Don't know what those are some folks in chat generally got excited that DDR freak was coming back

470
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,580
Sorry

471
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,860
Don't be mad. Don't sue us. I'm thoroughly glad I don't have to moderate

472
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,580
anymore

473
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,340
Because um, you know what? I actually have to tell you about a realization that I had. Hmm. What's that?

474
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,860
I went back and read on one site

475
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,660
The graffiti that they found on the walls in Pompeii. Mm-hmm, and it made me think of the same shit

476
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:55,780
I would see on DDR freak which proves to me that in the last however many thousand years humanity has not grown at all. So

477
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,440
Trolls even back in the olden days. No, there was there was one post that said so and so

478
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,420
like

479
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,220
Did some girl in the ass here and

480
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,340
Ran away with her and ran away with her brother. How naughty

481
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,700
Alright, so anyway, um, yeah everything we just did was bull

482
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,900
But we thought it would be fun for our especially because it's the tenth year of olr and April Fool's happens to be on a Sunday

483
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,400
And look, we're never gonna top the giggling lesbian gaming show that we did in 2006, which will always be the best prank we ever did

484
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,180
We thought we'd do that for our little April Fool's gag. So there you go

485
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:37,060
Anyhow, let's get back into the real show because there's been a lot of stuff going on in the gaming world this week that we want

486
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,260
to touch on big big news

487
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:46,660
Rumor news that I think Loki said might take the whole damn show tonight. So we're gonna talk about that a little bit as well

488
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,200
First though the real version of what we do at the top of the show

489
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,860
How was your gaming week talking about the video games? We've played this week dark soccer

490
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,740
You want to start us off with video games? You've been playing this week

491
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,780
I looked at that copy of Mass Effect and then Dan and I talked about it and then I got too busy to play

492
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,520
Because I was busy getting a job shame on you

493
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,440
Busy getting a job fine. I guess a job will be an acceptable. Excuse me. I did play

494
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,760
Well, of course you did. Of course I did because you have an addiction. Uh-huh dealer

495
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,120
Loki how was your gaming week? My game week was alright. I didn't play a whole lot of play Call of Duty. Yeah, I know

496
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,340
And then I also played

497
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
What was it the

498
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,480
a

499
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
saxophone game I

500
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
posted it's a

501
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
God I can't remember now

502
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Anyways, so little internet game was kind of fun

503
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,400
Is it sax maniacs it was epic sax game

504
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,120
All right, based off of the epic sax guy from oh

505
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:04,440
Oh, yeah, it's hilarious because it's actually use it little music rhythm game and you have to learn how to play that little

506
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Bit of music there and then you keep playing it over and over again

507
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,680
There's a lot of songs out there that have epic sax solos in them so hot sax all night long

508
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,040
Well, this is specifically the epic sax guy. All right

509
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,080
Specifically you've ever seen the original that that came from the original song

510
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,640
No, the original video that the SNL got the idea from it's not SNL

511
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,720
I don't think where the guy bust through the window and the curse

512
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm talking about I'm talking about it's

513
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
It's a epic sax guy from

514
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,080
What the hell was it? I can't remember the group now. I haven't looked at it's all good

515
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:53,560
Eurovision, it was part of this Eurovision thing the

516
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,160
Was that that big competition? That's like American Idol or whatever. Yeah, sort of in manova is oh

517
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,360
I know what you're talking about. Never mind a note

518
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,160
You're talking about the guy wearing, you know

519
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:11,040
The blue pants and the red gloves kind of looks like Duke Nukem hip thrusting to his epic sax solo and hot

520
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,800
It's awesome song

521
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,880
All right. So that it for your gaming week. That is all I play this week

522
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,000
My gaming week was kind of quick to not a whole lot to talk about I got into the mr

523
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,600
Pandaria beta so I was playing that a little bit

524
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,040
But if you're not in there, don't be sad because it's just a giant cluster fuck

525
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,560
It's a big panda orgy in the starting zones. They kind of need more beta servers

526
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,040
But at the same time it's just a beta like people I think often think oh when you're in the mr

527
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,360
Pandaria beta you're getting the real game, but you're not it's a beta

528
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,300
So been playing that a little little bit otherwise on the consoles

529
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,860
I'm still plucking away at Mass Effect 2. I think I'm about halfway through the game from what Shane tells me

530
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,200
I've you know picked up some of my partners and now I've got a few more I did some events on a planet and it

531
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,620
Unlocks some more dossiers for those of you that play the game. You can kind of tell where I'm at

532
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
Still love in the Mass Effect series

533
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,880
The battle system has gotten a little better for me because you might remember last week on the show

534
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,880
I was bitching about the battles in Mass Effect 2 compared to one but I'm liking it a little more now that I have more

535
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,080
Abilities I really like that you can kind of take an ability from one of your loyal

536
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,760
Companions because I have some of the DLC companions

537
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,020
I have Zaid and Kasumi who are some DLC companions

538
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,880
And I really like that I could take because I don't like Zaid as a character

539
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,660
I don't want him in my party ever but that flash or that grenade inferno grenade. He has is awesome

540
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,680
So I took that ability from him. So I've been using that

541
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
But Mass Effect 2 still awesome

542
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,120
Uh, that's really about it. I play. Oh, no one other game. I've got to talk about this is important

543
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,240
I haven't played this a lot, but I played it a little bit. So I'll talk about it a little bit. Ah

544
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,240
Kid Icarus uprising I played some of that actually I got on the 3ds. Yeah, what'd you think? It's cool

545
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,600
Yeah, the 3d actually works. Yeah, the 3d is great. It's a gorgeous game. I was really

546
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,200
Into the way that it's set up like Super Smash Brothers to like the menus and everything will just like Super Smash Brothers

547
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,560
I like the customizing your weapons the thing. Yeah, I mean there's so many little I mean you can tell it's designed

548
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,880
I mean, hello. I'm not stupid

549
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,840
I know it's the same people that did Smash Brothers that did this but

550
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,400
It has all those same minigames like for Smash Brothers like, you know

551
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,320
The machine where you put in coins and you can get like an egg, you know

552
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,480
That has something special in it power up the grid of unlocks

553
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,360
I mean, there's tons and tons and tons of stuff in the game

554
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,640
and

555
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,600
I love the air stages in the game. It is so awesome

556
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,200
Here yes, it's beautiful to look at too and I love it when it's on rails and all this

557
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,640
then it gets to the ground stages and it's not that I dislike the ground stages, but

558
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,320
That's where and I think you know any of you that have been reading reviews about the game

559
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,120
the controls are

560
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,880
Not good for the ground stages because you I mean just the way you have to hold the controller

561
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,200
You have to move with the little circle pad you shoot with the L button and then you flick on the bottom pad

562
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,920
Left and right real quick to spin your character left and right and you use it to move your Targeter

563
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,120
So it's kind of a lot going on with that touchscreen

564
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,080
You have to hold it very awkward and yes Kid Icarus comes with that stand

565
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,640
But that kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable gaming system. We have to kind of like use that stand so

566
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,800
The controls disappoint me a little bit

567
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:41,520
but otherwise it's it's really a shame that something like that really screws the game in the way that it does because I

568
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,640
Love the storytelling and the videos and tutorial videos and all that in it because they break the fourth wall

569
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:56,440
Constantly constantly and all these in jokes like the game was made for people that remember the old Kid Icarus and constantly

570
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,520
They're like you know

571
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh

572
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:04,040
it's been 25 years since we last saw Medusa and then it'll show like it says here's a picture of Medusa and it changes to

573
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,960
That hideous looking thing from the eight big Kid Icarus and somebody writes Medusa in an arrow

574
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,640
And it points at it like all these really dumb things and you know kind of some of those

575
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,500
adult level jokes that kids wouldn't get but adults do and a lot of that is

576
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
really funny

577
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,620
Going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com

578
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:27,620
Game girl says is it worth it was thinking of getting Kid Icarus uprising. It really depends on

579
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:34,180
How how tied you are to this series and all that, you know, I paid 30 bucks for it

580
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:39,140
Which I think is a fair price. I got I think Best Buy had a discount so Amazon price matched it

581
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,140
So I got it for that price. Um

582
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:47,500
40 might be a little steep depending on you know, I wish there was a mode and maybe there will be one at the end

583
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,260
where you could just play the sky stages because the sky stages are where this game is the best because you don't have to

584
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,420
worry about turning pit and you just use the thing to move them and you use the

585
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:03,860
touchpad to move the targeting and the game is fantastic and it's at its best in those stages and the 3d looks great

586
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,780
But otherwise the ground stages kind of take away from the rest of the game for me

587
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,940
But I still think it's a solid 3ds game. I think it's definitely worth

588
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,620
Hopefully they'll put out a demo or something so you can kind of evaluate if it's for you

589
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,100
I want it to do well because I like the idea of the Kid Icarus series coming back

590
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,700
But I'm not gonna sit here and say the game is flawless when it's not

591
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,980
It's bad they couldn't patch it they use the circle pad Pro as you know, well you actually can

592
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:36,940
If you're a lefty because the lefty controls are using the circle pad Pro and then using your left hand for the stylus

593
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,100
I understand that but I meant like, you know the second analog instead of the touchpad. Mm-hmm

594
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,340
Well, I want to say there was customizable controls in there, too

595
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,500
So maybe there's a way you can kind of fix it and maybe kind of do that

596
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,780
But I can't see the problem is if you did that Loki then you'd have nothing to use to target

597
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,460
You'd have to move and then pick up your stylus and target and it would be kind of disjointed

598
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,460
You do you still write analog to target?

599
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:07,460
Mmm, yeah, but then how would you turn your screen you still have to use your stylus to turn the screen that's stupid

600
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,600
Yeah, so that that exact person shooters don't have that problem. Why why does this have to be an issue with?

601
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,960
You know this game. Yes. It's a little little little rough there

602
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,980
Pork chop and chat says I've never played Kid Icarus ever but uprising looks awesome

603
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,980
Let me talk about this real quick because it's a pre-order bonus

604
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:32,400
I got the Kid Icarus 3d classics, which is the 3d version of the regular game and it's actually really good

605
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,300
Like even though it's just the regular Kid Icarus

606
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,940
they put these backgrounds in every level where the 3d is not just the back like the the backgrounds themselves are kind of 3d and

607
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:50,920
I think the game is based off the disk system version and not the cartridge because there's load and save files

608
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,680
Which only existed in the disk version and I want to say the sound effects were slightly different

609
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,920
Which I remember the disk system had a different sound chip than the NES did

610
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,360
So some of the games had slightly different sound effects. So that was kind of cool. You should hear the music in the

611
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,440
Disk version of Castlevania 3. Yeah, I always hear the Castlevania 3. He's got a good little but yeah

612
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,880
Kid Icarus actually had a really good music on the disk one. Hmm and the sound

613
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,920
Shane in our chat room says Kid Icarus used to be worse for the 3ds at e3 the ground stages were timed and you had

614
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,120
To get through checkpoints. So they at least fix that. Oh, thank god, that would have been that would have been really bad

615
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,800
I'm glad they changed that that sounds terrible

616
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,520
But anyway, the 3d classic is actually really good and I wish

617
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,480
Every game got this kind

618
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,480
I wish they would do this for every virtual console game because it's not that much that they did

619
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,400
You know, they added backgrounds and they kind of the 3d is done tastefully. I think that's the best way I can put it

620
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,960
It's not like you've got one sprite layer here and then your background layer. It's not it's more than that

621
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,800
There's multi level of 3d and I think it the effects are really good and it kind of it

622
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,480
You know what?

623
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,260
It feels like to me is it feels like remember how everybody was talking about way back in the day

624
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,400
Kid Icarus on the Super Nintendo and a re-release of Kid Icarus on the Super Nintendo

625
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,000
And there are all these rumors and probably April Fool's Day jokes in the past

626
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
this feels to me like

627
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,680
What Kid Icarus would have been on the Super Nintendo and it's not necessarily that they like upgraded the sprites and all that

628
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,840
but just the way it looks and it's really crisp and

629
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,800
Makes it look like a Super Nintendo version of Kid Icarus

630
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,880
So I was I was a fan of the 3d release quite a bit. So I'm really looking forward to seeing what else

631
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,800
Oh

632
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,120
God, what's the name of the developer that did the 3ds versions called?

633
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,160
It's like it's not Akira, but Acura or something like that did all the

634
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
I'm looking on my 3ds right now

635
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,040
Arika

636
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:52,000
Did the 3d and they've done some good they did the excite bike one as well

637
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,440
Which I wasn't quite as big of a fan of but they did the Kirby one, which is really good, too

638
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,280
So I'm looking forward to seeing what Arika does next because they're kind of starting to get this down

639
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,160
This whole translating the old games into new stuff. So

640
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,520
Alpha kenanagram in our chat room with the tip says just an fYI

641
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,680
To people that do have any 3d classic games on 3ds and didn't notice you can go into options and increase the 3d density

642
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,440
Setting even more if it's not strong enough on max if setting is untouched. Yes, that's true

643
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,680
Not just the 3d density on the slider

644
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,120
But there's a 3d density within the game that you can adjust which I think is a good idea. So

645
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,760
There you go. That was a good idea

646
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,960
So there you go. That was my gaming week. I've talked plenty about that

647
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:44,720
So let's move on then quick housekeeping visit us on twitter twitter.com slash olr our facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

648
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,160
Quickly go answer the frugal question of the week before we get to that a little later here in the show if you're listening live

649
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,920
And of course if you are listening live

650
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,360
Since we didn't get to say it at the top of the show because of our little joke tonight a big thank you as always

651
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,040
To all games radio where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

652
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,680
Although not tonight Bobby's on a little break. He'll be back on the 15th

653
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Let's get into some gaming news. Loki

654
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Alright, so there's a big old

655
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
big old fun rumor

656
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
regarding

657
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,360
The next PlayStation system apparently there is sources that contacted Kotaku or

658
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,840
kotaku

659
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,400
Contacted anyways, they figured out that the working title or possible

660
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,880
name for the system is Orbis and

661
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
That it's being planned for release

662
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:43,880
Sometime next holiday. So 2013 holiday isn't Orbis a travel website. No, that's orbit

663
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,680
Isn't Orbis a drink that has these little gummy things in it. That's it was disgusting. That's that was orbits. Oh

664
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,320
My god, it's like you were drowning herpes

665
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:01,240
Now the name for the actual console is legit because you can pull up the dev website for PlayStation and you know

666
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,380
Typing in Orbis or like, you know slash Orbis or whatever pulls up the actual dev site

667
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,980
It's just it you don't get a 404 from it

668
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:13,640
So they have it built in place, but they just don't have anything there yet kind of like with the Vita

669
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,860
You know when you would you type that in and it would get a page

670
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:25,100
Yeah, Orbis SC done. That's on Sony site. Yes, Orbis SC dev.net their dev site

671
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,300
The name is the name is real. It's a real name or it's a

672
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,100
Okay. Yeah

673
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,180
So that's real at least now some of the specs though

674
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:47,860
they're saying right now that they're planning on it's using an AMD x64 CPU also an AMD Southern Islands GPU and

675
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:54,180
you know what they're saying right now is that supposed to be able to push a 4k HD, which is

676
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:00,200
Way more than most TVs can use although newer TVs do support it. It's a four

677
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,220
4096 by

678
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:08,420
760 it's a resolution far, you know exceeding most HD TVs and

679
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,980
Then also they're saying that's capable of playing 3d games in 1080p

680
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,620
Whereas you know the ps3 can only do that at 720

681
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:25,320
Also, I just want to say so far I can believe it that they're pushing the technical limits because if you think about it when

682
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,380
PlayStation 3 came out not everybody had adopted blu-ray yet or even HD TVs and

683
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,340
That was the technology they went with so I could kind of see that. Here's the problem though

684
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,820
I have well, I'll cover what my issues are with the news in a sec

685
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:47,460
Also, they're saying you right now that select developers have dev kits already which makes sense

686
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,820
I mean, come on if it's a year out, obviously, they're gonna be working on games already

687
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,780
No backwards compatibility whatsoever with any ps3 games

688
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:01,180
Also ps2 games it would be assumed that you know, that stuff would be coming

689
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Via emulators on you know, the PlayStation Network since they have that right now with ps2 and PlayStation 1 games

690
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,540
So why would the dev kits be backwards compatible? Anyway, no, they're talking about the final product not the dev kids, right?

691
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,540
But how would the I mean if this is being leaked from a dev which is what I'm assuming because the dev websites out there

692
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,660
And everything if this is being leaked from a developer then why would their kits have the backwards compatibility?

693
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,220
They wouldn't have that but the thing is those they're telling them what the final specs are what their their specs are

694
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,300
estimated and it makes sense that they would cut out backwards compatibility because one you can still push PlayStation threes and

695
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,540
Two they want to sell those games, you know digitally because they can make money off that and they also don't have to put

696
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,100
Putting the PlayStation 2 chips in there

697
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:48,340
That wasn't too expensive because it was a couple chips putting PlayStation 3 chips in there. That's a little different

698
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,300
I mean, that's a whole nother console slapped into your you know system there

699
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,300
And emulating the PlayStation 3 I can't imagine would be

700
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:02,620
Easy at all then the final doozy, of course much like the Durango or the next Xbox ism

701
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,900
the lube if you will the

702
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:11,100
Rumor is that you will not be able to play used games on the system. What's gonna end up happening?

703
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:17,100
Is they're saying that this the games will be available on blu-ray disc or as a PlayStation Network download much like I guess

704
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,940
What the Vita is right now?

705
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Obviously not on blu-ray disc

706
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,580
You will be able if you buy the disc it will be locked to a single PlayStation Network account

707
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,860
After which you can play the game

708
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:34,100
And save the whole thing to your hard drive or peg it as a download in your account history and download it for free

709
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:40,140
At a later date, however, much like PC games, you know, it's gonna be tied to your system. So

710
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,420
you know you're gonna need to

711
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:49,380
Well first off they're saying that you're in need to have a PlayStation Network account and be online

712
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,380
To even get the game started

713
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:57,220
And then on top of that they're saying that if you decide to trade in your disc or you know

714
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,220
Learn to a friend or sell it or whatever

715
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,940
That the next person that gets it is gonna have basically kind of a limited version of the game

716
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:11,540
either gonna be like a demo form or some sort of you know hindered version kind of think of like I

717
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,820
guess the online passes or something like that, but who knows to what extent and

718
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,500
They're gonna have to pay a fee to unlock or register the full game

719
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,700
so

720
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,700
So there's that

721
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:31,420
So I guess we can talk about that first. We talk about that. Let's talk about that. Okay, so let me

722
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,820
There's a few problems I have with the specs. Okay, first off. Let's talk about the

723
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,100
4k resolution that sounds good and all until you actually look up with 4k

724
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:48,220
Resolutions over HDMI are actually capable of 24 frames a second. That's it

725
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:53,500
So if you're looking for like 60 FPS games, you're not gonna get that on this

726
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,220
Also when you think about that, that's only compatible with HDMI

727
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:02,020
I think 1.4 which most TVs do not have so I mean

728
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,220
I would assume that there's gonna be some backwards compatibility with like 1080p and stuff like that

729
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,920
But let's just assume that maybe there's not okay and say they're gonna be assholes about it

730
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,880
Then you're gonna need to buy a new TV new sound system new cables just to get this fucking thing to work

731
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,520
and

732
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,800
Then on top of that, like I said 24 frames a second is not very I mean that's a video video

733
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,520
That's fine. Like watching the movie and stuff, but playing a game. I think you'd want higher

734
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,800
FPS for that

735
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
That's least I would think so

736
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,440
And then on top of that, I mean, let's see

737
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,320
They're talking about digital downloads for games now that works

738
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:49,040
Okay for like Vita games that are you know a couple gigs, but we're talking fucking PlayStation 4 games

739
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,720
I mean which are gonna be pushing these 4k graphics with textures that are fucking huge

740
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,520
You're talking like I mean PlayStation 3 games right now are upwards to I'd say

741
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,280
I mean, it's possible that they're up to 50 gigabytes on a dual layer blu-ray disc

742
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,400
50 gigabytes most of them don't take up 50 gigs

743
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,520
It's most of them are route like, you know, 10 to 20 something gigs

744
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,640
But still that's a fucking long time to download the game off of the internet

745
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,920
Plus we're talking the all these companies talking about bandwidth caps and stuff like that. You're gonna eat up your bandwidth in

746
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:30,800
No time and they want you completely connected to the internet, you know for some sort of back-ass words, you know

747
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,760
Anti piracy bullshit. So on top of that we're you know

748
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,800
We don't even need to cover why that's a bad idea because look at you know with the whole Ubisoft always on DRM bullshit

749
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,360
You know if their network goes down, you know PlayStation ever goes down for a day or so

750
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,560
Bye. Bye can't play your game system

751
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:54,280
You know for that whole day our service people overseas would not be able to relax with a PlayStation Orbis because they won't be able

752
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,000
To connect to the internet exactly

753
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,920
So I think a lot of this stuff is just kind of bullshit and and honestly they'll use game thing

754
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,200
I can see them still continuing on with the online passes, but I

755
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:14,680
Do not see them. I I just first off GameStop is not gonna let him do this. I mean cuz you think that

756
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,640
Didn't that one analyst who we always kind of tease on? Yes, Michael Patrick, but he made a good point

757
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,880
He said GameStop is not gonna sell these consoles

758
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:29,920
Yeah, it's basically if they're if we'll get into why that they wouldn't carry these consoles

759
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,760
Okay, so basically if you're you know offering a system that has no use games whatsoever

760
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,360
It's impossible to sell it be basically like a demo disc or something. Let's just say worst case scenario

761
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,680
It just you can't play anything other than a small demo on this

762
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,760
You know, first of all, I think that's gonna be huge

763
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,240
Huge huge incentive for hackers to try to fix that cuz they're gonna like oh, wait a second, you know

764
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,200
It's your fucking this can do whatever we want. Plus tying it to one accounts also kind of lame

765
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,820
But you know at the same time it's just like why

766
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,880
The first if they're not gonna have any use game sales or whatever

767
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,060
Then they're not gonna carry it in their store much like they did carry a little bit of the PSP go

768
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,800
Because you know some people might have wanted it but that offered really no sales for them because other than PlayStation Network cards

769
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,720
This is all digital. So I just don't see them doing that. But let's talk a little bit real quick

770
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,680
Why are you trying to say that GameStop had a hand in that? Why the PSP go failed?

771
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,780
No, that just it was stupid PSP go was dumb

772
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,760
There's a system of digital only that was priced higher than the current model out already. Why would you buy it?

773
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,280
Let me read some quick comments in our chat room at chat dot orange launch radio comm gamer girl says I have a feeling the ps4

774
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,420
Is gonna tank technus says I doubt the game will run at 4k maybe for full motion videos

775
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:54,080
But the games will probably run at 1080p at 60 frames per second. Well, yeah, remember last remember

776
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,960
I mean a lot of these specs could be really overblown remember back when they were talking the specs of ps3 how they're saying

777
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,000
Oh 1080p and 120 frames per second for all games. Yeah

778
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,000
And no 1080p for all games and 120 frames per second

779
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,240
We're just gonna go crazy with you know, that's up and that never fucking happened

780
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,680
I mean whatever it and it's very possible that you know

781
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,520
This stuff could be patched in later on because remember the original well

782
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,240
The Xbox 360 didn't always used to have 1080p

783
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,600
It was 1080 I was and then it got patched in later on so they could add it later on

784
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,680
It's that's possible. So it on this used game thing. Is it possible that we're

785
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:38,700
Misinterpreting a system similar to what the Vita has to prevent trophy exploitation

786
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,820
No possible that it's tied to an account, but you can easily remove it. I

787
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,580
I don't think it's like that. I think it's just because

788
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,620
Well, I don't know. I'm just going off what they say

789
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:57,540
Speculation but you know because they said it's just limited so and you maybe it is where you can remove it off of your system

790
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:01,260
When you're done with it, and then it becomes, you know free to use for somebody else

791
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,540
I would hope that that would be kind of like what it is. I I have to express big

792
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:12,300
Reservations about this and the next Xbox whatever it is if the rumors are true about that as well that

793
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:18,340
Microsoft and Sony have joined together for some sort of dark pact where both these systems are not play used games

794
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:22,440
Well, let me let me cover real quick. Okay. So first off and I got a

795
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:29,480
This is Dennis dynek and now not a lot of you may be familiar with Dennis dyack

796
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:36,260
But he's the head of developments to use at Silicon Knights, you know, Silicon Knights the company put at to human

797
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,660
to human

798
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:46,140
Tank, right? Okay. So this guy, you know, he is making some comments regarding used game sales

799
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,660
I saw because there are no used

800
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:56,060
Basically saying, you know, the the day has come and gone where you know used games should be allowed basically

801
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:00,320
You know because they're you know, he's talking about world without used games

802
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,840
You know and this is new consoles because there are no used games

803
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:08,060
You could actually sell a game for a long time and get reoccurring revenue for quite a while

804
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,440
Reoccurring revenue is very key now. There is no tail

805
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,880
Literally, you will get most of your sales within the three months of launch which have created this really healthy

806
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:24,920
Or literally you get most of your sales within three months of launch, which has created this really unhealthy extreme

807
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,360
Where you have to sell it really fast, and then you could then you have to do anything else to get money

808
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:38,760
And then also says I would argue and I've said this before that used games are cannibalizing the industry if developers and publishers

809
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,440
Don't see revenue from that. It's no matter

810
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:46,880
Of hey, we're trying to increase the price of games to consumers and we want more

811
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,840
We're just trying to survive in an industry if used games continue the way they are. It's going to cannibalize

812
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,880
um

813
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,880
There's not gonna be an industry

814
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,800
People won't make these kind of games

815
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,960
Basically saying the really high price games

816
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:08,200
So I think it's inflated the prices of games and I think the prices will have to come down if there's a longer tail

817
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
But there isn't okay. So

818
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:15,200
First off this guy's so full of bullshit me. I mean really he has nothing to go off because his games suck

819
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,640
It wasn't because of used games. It was because your games suck that it didn't sell but

820
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,920
Besides that he doesn't understand how the fucking industry works and sad

821
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,000
Considering a guy that is in the industry doesn't understand how it works

822
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,480
If you get rid of used games, you're gonna get rid of the game specialty market

823
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:38,960
Which is basically your game stops any game specific store retailers that deal in multiple things like you know

824
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,440
Like a Best Buy or something like that a department store that can you know carries everything?

825
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,240
They're not necessarily gonna be affected by that because well first off

826
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,880
they don't really deal and use to begin with but

827
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,320
They use game market

828
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,800
There is not a lot of margin in games new game margins are about 20% and that's from you know

829
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,800
The cost from the publisher itself and now well 20% may sound like a lot to everybody. They're like, well shit, you know

830
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:10,480
That's quite a markup. It's actually not in other retail markets. The market is a lot more and

831
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:11,680
Really?

832
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:17,040
They can't make you can't run a business with a 20% margin you because you're also have to pay your employees

833
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,040
you're renting till these and all that stuff and

834
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,080
It there's a lot of factors that go into it

835
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,160
So they make up their money by used games trade-ins and sales

836
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,480
Well, the trade-ins obviously are also gonna drive new game sales because you're getting people that you know

837
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,240
take their 2012 copy of Tiger Woods and they trade in for their 2013 copy of Tiger Woods and

838
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:43,640
You turn around and you sell the Tiger Woods or whatever game it is at, you know, an increased margin

839
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,580
basically, you're buying it for 20 and you're selling it for 40 and so instead of a you know,

840
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:55,120
20% margin you have like a hundred percent margin now. It's a lot healthier for these companies and now yes

841
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,520
I understand the game stop makes a lot of money in use but you know what?

842
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,740
That's how they run their business and that's how any game store is gonna run their business. They can't make

843
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,920
They can't survive on just new games. I

844
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,080
I think

845
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:13,680
Honestly, if if they're the dark pact is true and these companies are gonna move towards used games

846
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:20,400
And I think one of two things is happening aim. They just get their handing Nintendo the crown watch

847
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,260
Watch when those soccer moms go to the store in 2013

848
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,400
What system are they gonna pick up the system that they don't really have the TVs to run anyway?

849
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,640
And the systems where they won't be able to get used games or or that the retailer might tell them you can't play

850
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,620
Used games on this you can't rent and rent games of this system or they're gonna get a Wii U

851
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:45,240
They're gonna get a Wii U wake up call. Well, there's that's the same reason the Nintendo Wii succeeded the first time

852
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,040
There's and then well, there's a lot of people

853
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:55,260
Let me finish because if if the Wii U somehow did this too, we don't know

854
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,500
Nintendo could be a part of this dark pact. We don't know the final specs of the Wii U

855
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:07,220
Let's hypothesize and yes, this is being a little tinfoil Hattie, but let's hypothesize that all three game companies are taking a stand against used games

856
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:15,700
I call video game market crash of 83 all over again. It will be that serious. The video game market will crash

857
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,820
Absolutely will crash and they've been wondering how long is it gonna take for it to crash again?

858
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:27,540
This type of greed is going to cause it. Absolutely. I I think actually I don't think it's gonna crash

859
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:32,180
What why would I buy the system Loki but I but that's the thing though it here

860
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,940
Here's what I think is gonna happen is it's not necessarily gonna crash. It's just they won't buy those new systems

861
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,580
No one's gonna buy the new systems and then what's gonna happen?

862
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,020
well

863
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:46,220
there's still tons of there's still plenty of people out there with you know, the Xbox 360s and the PlayStation threes and

864
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,300
stuff like that, so

865
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:53,740
That's still a crash because Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft would lose so much money from putting those consoles

866
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:59,060
Well, I hope it's a big wake-up call then if that's the case and I mean at first I'm sorry

867
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:03,720
It's really just not only the used games too. I mean the fact that you know

868
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,140
What are these consoles really have to offer? I mean, yeah, okay

869
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,180
It's the technical edge, but a lot of us don't even have that technology yet

870
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:15,780
I myself did not buy a PlayStation 3 until they were already out for like two years. I just I

871
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:22,120
Really worry. I mean granted I have to take this all with a big-ass grain of salt because this is all rumors

872
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,560
All of it all of its rumors until it's on the show 43, right?

873
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:31,140
So maybe we're just getting a little bit carried away with the hysterics, but I hope to hell

874
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:36,080
These game companies are looking at the reaction on what they're seeing on the reddit

875
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,980
You know forums and and you know various internets and podcasts and so forth

876
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,780
We don't want this. You can't have your cake and eat it, too

877
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:53,540
You can't charge $60 for a new game and 20 bucks for all this download content and this and then block out used game sales

878
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,100
You can't there's a moment with especially in this economy

879
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:03,420
Which isn't gonna be fully recovered next by next year where the consumers are gonna say enough you have taken our money

880
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:09,140
We're not gonna give it to you anymore and on top of fine with our PlayStation 3s and Xbox and on top of it

881
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:13,540
They're not even really claiming that you own the disc. It's your licensing content from them

882
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:21,060
Anyways, no fucking there is no industry out there that doesn't have like used as part of it use car sales

883
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:27,120
Do we see car sales suffering because if you use car sales, no, it's never fucking happening

884
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,580
So why do you fucking think that you need money?

885
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:37,840
Mr. Developer of to human for use game sales. You don't deserve any of my money then that's the case

886
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:45,180
I mean, here's what how it's gonna work. Mr. Dynek or whatever our dyack. I don't even fucking pronounce your last name

887
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:49,700
Whatever Dennis dyack. Here's how it's gonna fucking work. Okay, let's cut out use game sales

888
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,420
$60 for your shitty game to human three or whatever for two or

889
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,700
more human is gonna come out and it's gonna suck balls because it's silicon Knights and

890
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,500
it comes out and it doesn't fucking sell and

891
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,040
And no one's buying it new and there's no use game market anymore

892
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:14,520
So, you know, no one's buying it and then turning it over and saying oh fuck it. I'm not gonna you know play this

893
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,960
So what's gonna happen your game?

894
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,740
your brand new game is gonna have to drop in price in order to push some sales and

895
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:26,040
It's gonna keep dropping in price until it gets it gets down to the use game price

896
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,040
That would have been they people are gonna buy it new

897
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,680
So, I mean there's no use games

898
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:36,200
People just wait till the fucking new games to get to the price of what the use games used to be before and guess what?

899
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:41,600
They get all the full, you know benefit. You can't justify a $60 game if there's no resale value

900
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,640
You're literally taking all of the value out of the game and and here's another fun fun fact here

901
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,400
Dennis dyack if your game system or the game system that you're putting your content on doesn't support use games

902
01:14:54,280 --> 01:15:00,360
I'm gonna be willing to bet that companies that make their money off of use games aren't gonna fucking carry that system

903
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,600
So good luck pushing your product in all just Walmart's and stuff like that

904
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,160
You know considering that GameStop has the biggest chunk in the industry they can command

905
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:15,160
Companies to pay them for retail shelf space. I think that they have enough control to where they can say

906
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,560
Yeah, you're gonna not put use games on your system

907
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,080
Yeah, we're just not gonna carry it and they probably will listen

908
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,680
I mean, why would they just stop listening to them all of a sudden? I mean, come on

909
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,200
let me um, I know we want to wrap up this topic to move on to other things, but I want to check in with

910
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,360
Jamie because we haven't heard from her in a little bit and as a collector, how do you feel about no use game market?

911
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,360
I think that's freaking ridiculous

912
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:46,320
Cuz I mean I was just saying earlier in chat that I bought a PlayStation game two weeks ago a PlayStation game

913
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,640
you know, I

914
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,240
Still have PlayStations, you know, I'm just saying that

915
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,960
That there's people out there that will still keep holding on to the older systems

916
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,960
like say they may have an Xbox and not a 360 because all they buy is used games and

917
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:10,240
You know, that's that's their prerogative. They could do that. I think that if you take out

918
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,040
the ability to

919
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,820
Sell the game back get a little money back in their pocket so they can go out and afford to buy a new game

920
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:25,140
That they're basically gonna be cutting out. Let's just say at least a good 25% of their market

921
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:31,260
Just just in the people that basically resell games so that they can buy a new game, right?

922
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:36,620
I mean when you think about it that disc will be worth nothing by the time you take it out of the shrink wrap

923
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,500
It is now worth nothing

924
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,500
They're literally saying though that you can pop it in your system mark it as a oh

925
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,860
I own this and then then you can literally throw the disc away

926
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:52,860
But who has the bandwidth from Comcast or whatever your provider is to support that you get all you have a 250 gig cap?

927
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,540
These games are gonna be 17 gig. That's the other thing too is okay

928
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:02,060
Let's another point that I brought up because I actually responded to that article is

929
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,220
Okay, let's assume that you can dump this game to your hard drive

930
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,220
How fucking big is that hard drive gonna be and how much is it gonna fucking cost?

931
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:16,660
because you know these price the prices of these hard drives from I understand heart data storage is cheap, but

932
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:23,260
Data storage is not cheap when it's sold by a company in a proprietary format, you know, for example, you know, you could buy a

933
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,740
320 gigabyte hard drive or whatever from

934
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,680
Microsoft and it's gonna run you like 200 bucks and I can get like a 2 terabyte drive for about the same price

935
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,300
You know if I bought it for my PC, so

936
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:41,200
You know unless they open that shit up like they do at the ps3 props to them for that. I

937
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,180
Mean, why wouldn't they do that?

938
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:48,580
I mean after all these guys are so fucking hungry for money that of course they're gonna take the opportunity to you know

939
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:53,180
Oh, hey, you need that 2 terabyte drive because you're gonna have to store all those games that we're gonna make you those this

940
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,380
And you know, you can't take without giving back

941
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,820
Um, I stand by my earlier statement that this this is going to cause a video game crash

942
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,820
It's gonna drive the game market underground

943
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,860
I mean not like, you know, not like oh the back alleys or whatever

944
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:11,860
but it's gonna be it's the games will be sold at flea markets and GameStops will sell nothing but used games because

945
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,740
People don't want new games anymore and also not worth shit

946
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:17,960
And also when you think about you know technology getting the way it is right now

947
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:23,420
And how expensive consoles are getting you know, maybe people will actually go to PCs

948
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:28,620
Hey, look at that PCs, you know where you can get games and actually own stuff and you know

949
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,620
you don't have to worry about use game sales because

950
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,700
there's just sales on video games and

951
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,740
You know, there's steam and that kind of stuff

952
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,260
All right in the interest of time we're gonna go ahead and move on but I'm sure some of you guys have comments

953
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:47,140
We will have the skype line open a little later as always in our show and you can also send us an email mailbag

954
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:52,780
At orange lounge radio.com and if it wasn't April Fool's Day, we probably would ask a question about this on the Facebook tonight

955
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:58,860
But we did something different. So maybe next week. We'll see what you guys think about this on the show where every gamer has a voice

956
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:06,220
Meanwhile, let's talk about those hard drives because this is a disturbing rumor going around this week the rumor that

957
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:12,980
The Xbox 360 hard drives actually retained credit card information

958
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,460
Even if you wipe the drive

959
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:21,300
Even if you sell it back kind of that whole thing about like you have to delete from a partition seven times until the information

960
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:27,700
Is truly gone. This was a report from Drexel University that made this claim that you know

961
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:31,500
Your credit card information was not really wiped from the drive when you would sell it back

962
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,700
Could this be how the hacks are happening?

963
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:40,500
I'm no I say no because I've never sold a hard drive back and I was hacked and have all my drives

964
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,800
I've ever had and on top of that. I don't think it stores the actual credit card information on your hard drive

965
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:51,540
It's it's tied to your network account or your Xbox Live account and it's downloaded from there, but is it possible?

966
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,540
It's ever written it to the drive ever

967
01:19:53,540 --> 01:20:00,260
It's possible that it might be in a cache file or something like that. Maybe maybe that is possible

968
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:06,900
But now Microsoft responded to the whole thing. So let me read Microsoft's response because obviously this is important quote

969
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,820
We are conducting a thorough investigation into the researchers claims

970
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:16,860
We have requested information that will allow us to investigate the console in question and have still not received the information needed to replicate the researchers

971
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:21,140
Claims so they're deflecting a little bit in the opening like we don't have the information yet

972
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:26,460
Xbox is not designed to store credit card data locally on the console and

973
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,940
As such seems unlikely credit card data was recovered by the method described

974
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:38,820
Additionally when Microsoft refurbishes used consoles, we have processes in place to wipe the local hard drives of any other user data

975
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:44,260
We can assure Xbox owners. We take the privacy and security of their personal data very seriously

976
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:49,360
I somehow doubt that they actually wipe the drive with like zero byte writing, but I think it's just like

977
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:56,120
Format that was not a 100% denial either. Did you notice that that was not a firm?

978
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:03,560
No, this is crap. That was a we haven't been able to investigate it and it's unlikely but that wasn't a no. I

979
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:12,640
Mean maybe for legal reasons they can't say no because if they do say no and it ends up they were wrong

980
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:19,200
Now we can class-action lawsuit them Xbox live agreement be damned because this is on the actual hardware itself

981
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,620
Right. So is that why they have to be vague with the language? That's my assumption

982
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,120
It's with any business you have to basically cover room to see why a

983
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,840
Still very scary a very scary report and I'm not scared God. I I

984
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:44,520
I know I'm a total hypocrite saying this because my credit card info is on my xbox, but

985
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,600
If you haven't put it on there yet

986
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,600
I would advise you just don't don't ever give those damn things your credit card use the cards that you buy in stores

987
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,680
It's the only safe way to do it

988
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:59,400
Sad, but true. All right. Meanwhile dark soccer. What do you got for us?

989
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,880
Well, actually I was answering a question from niche I guess mm-hmm asking what my favorite console is of all time

990
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:12,240
From our chat room. Yeah. Yeah, I'd probably say the PC Engine duo

991
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,800
Turbo duo. Why is that?

992
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
Dracula X

993
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:20,640
Super Nintendo for me easy Super Nintendo was the best console they ever did I think

994
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,300
so anyway, um

995
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:29,760
You remember we'd actually mentioned a rumor about zipper being closed zipper interactive that created

996
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,400
So calm the developer so it was last week. Yeah. Well, I'm Sony confirmed it

997
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:41,160
they said they said that it was a result of a normal cycle of resource realignment and

998
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,360
Basically, like they did their shit. We're done

999
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,960
said pretty much like

1000
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,800
they said that

1001
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,160
They completed work on unit 13 and now they're done and that

1002
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:58,320
They're still gonna be support for mag. So come for in unit 13 and there will be new daily challenges on unit 13

1003
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:05,000
But other than that, bye. Bye. Well, I mean

1004
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:11,920
I guess most of us kind of assumed last week's was probably true anyway, but it's unfortunate that it was confirmed, but

1005
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,440
It doesn't when you say a rumor, you should always give us some closure. Sure. Yeah, they got the closure

1006
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
All right, if it's true

1007
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:27,360
That these new consoles are gonna lock out use games. I bet this this is gonna get a lot more frequent. It's gonna be

1008
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,760
If your company doesn't develop for PC, you're gonna be in trouble. That's all I have to say. Oh

1009
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,520
Wonder what the project was though that was cancelled so calm five

1010
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,200
maybe maybe

1011
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,560
Just so calm on the Vita. Who knows? Yeah, probably

1012
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,120
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you soon

1013
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,200
Oh, well, the drought has begun again

1014
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:56,400
So not a whole lot this week Titanic mystery on Nintendo DS and on the Wii

1015
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,440
To celebrate the release of the movie all over again

1016
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,120
It's talking about the Titanic 2 and now it there's a bomb on Titanic. I think we talked about this now

1017
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,840
Yeah, it sounds like the plot of speed 2

1018
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,960
There's also of course

1019
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,880
funky barn from Ubisoft

1020
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,720
3ds game

1021
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:23,000
Fallout and oblivion are getting a double pack on Xbox 360 and PC

1022
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:30,160
Connect Star Wars out this week as well as the Kinect Star Wars limited-edition Kinect Star Wars. Oh, that's finally out bundle

1023
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,680
Yes, I'll be damned next ours is finally out

1024
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,960
If you happen to shop at GameStop or Nintendo

1025
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,880
Online Xenoblade Chronicles is out on the Wii this week

1026
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
and

1027
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
And

1028
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,680
That's it finally Xenoblade Chronicles, that's when a lot of people are looking forward to

1029
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,760
Yeah, gotta gotta say that. Oh and I did

1030
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,780
Originally, it was gonna be a double may cry HD collection this week on ps3 and 360

1031
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:05,920
However, Capcom dropped the street date on that so it just it's out now like canceled or just they they're no longer street dating it

1032
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,520
So it was basically before it was okay. You have to hold your copies until Tuesday

1033
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,720
They're like, I just sell it. Maybe it got leaked or something. Who knows. I don't yeah, it got leaked years ago

1034
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,000
Devils may cry HD edition. It's not like one of those games like people have to have right now

1035
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,600
It's like you already played it before you can and look all that HD there. Hmm. Just saying. All right, let's go to Japan in Japan

1036
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:31,080
Not a whole lot coming out, but there are a few things on the Nintendo 3ds

1037
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,200
Puyo Puyo

1038
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:39,920
Kansatsu Nikki that is not Puyo Puyo. It's big difference Puyo Puyo, which looks like this big fat cat. Yeah

1039
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,520
But it's not really Nintendogs or Nintendcats. Although I guess it does actually look a little similar to that

1040
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,140
I've seen that cat a bunch of places before so

1041
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:52,560
It's like from a manga like a character or something. Actually. It does look a lot like Nintendogs or

1042
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,200
Looks like Shermie

1043
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,200
Shermie

1044
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Shermie is not that fat

1045
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,240
And she's not orange a plus. All right going to

1046
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Let's check out the Vita. See what's coming out on the Vita this week over in Japan

1047
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,000
There we go

1048
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,960
Nothing, unless you want a portable charger. It's an official first party portable charger. Hey

1049
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,640
On the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. Let's go to the 360 first

1050
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,880
They're also getting Star Wars this week and the console so it's not just America

That's getting that Japan is getting their version as well. And lastly on the PlayStation 3

Yay, is that tying in with like dream club? I the anime it looks like it actually

Yeah, yeah chicks. Actually it is. Oh, yeah. Oh god. This is why

1056

It's ladies in swimsuits if you would like with big ol boobies playing mahjong. Yes

1058
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,000

01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,520
Well, you know what more people might be into mahjong if that's true

1060
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,040
That's the sound the eyes make mahjong

1061
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,480
How about the UK dar soccer on the third we have Star Wars connect

We have devil a cry HD collection and wheels of destruction on the fourth diabolical pitch

The fifth rhythm thief and the Emperor's treasure and on the sixth shoot many robots

1065
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,620
Many robots shoot them. Yep. All right. All right

1066
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:39,260
Well, we're gonna take a moment to go in the gaming archive and find a game the dark soccer things

1067
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,620
Hey, you ungrateful little brats

1068
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:47,620
Although tonight we were reminiscing about old times a little bit. So everybody was reminiscing tonight a bit

1069
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,200
But we're gonna reminisce again not with an old version of our show

1070
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,200
With a classic game of the week

1071
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,960
Dark soccer. What did you pick from the archives this week is the classic game of the week Street Fighter and that's no joke

1072
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:05,160
Although the truth, although Capcom fighting games have become a bit of a joke in recent years

1073
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:10,680
Well, I figured with everything happening. I may as well just go right to the source. Let's talk about Street Fighter

1074
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,960
So, yeah, it came out in 1987, of course by Capcom and it was their first

1075
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,760
fighting game that they put out and

1076
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,120
It

1077
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:31,640
Had it was actually one of the first ones that had a six button controller and had commands that had special moves

1078
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,760
So this basically started the whole big thing for us

1079
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:44,040
The version that came out on the turbo graphics CD was called fighting street in 1988 and that actually came out on the virtual console

1080
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,640
in November 2009 and

1081
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,960
the

1082
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,960
same for UK

1083
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,120
So basically the

1084
01:28:53,120 --> 01:29:00,700
You have one-on-one matches against the computer opponent and then each matches three rounds and you have to defeat each

1085
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:06,160
Opponent in less than 30 seconds if the match ends before the fighter is knocked out

1086
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:13,440
Then they will get whoever has the most energy will you know, make it to the next round basically the way fighting games do today

1087
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:19,560
You have to win two rounds to win and move forward and if the third round is a tie then

1088
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,960
The computer wins by default

1089
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:31,520
So, I mean basically this started the whole thing this you know having the moves and everything having

1090
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:40,000
Also started the computer cheating every time because that's bullshit that if it's still a tie that's not just win

1091
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,120
Well, yeah, but actually that case that's actually somebody playing for you. So

1092
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:53,440
There were there was a deluxe version of the game that had an 8-way joystick and then two large

1093
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,040
mechatronic pads for punches and kicks

1094
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,160
So it was basically

1095
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:04,840
The harder you hit the harder your punch or your kick was and then the later version came out with the six attack buttons

1096
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:10,680
You know the three heavy punches and three of the three punches and the three kicks so

1097
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:17,320
There were all kinds of you know, the different moves basically you had

1098
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,240
The psycho fire which was the hadoken and the dragon punch and a hurricane kick I mean

1099
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,320
It they were all the same moves that followed over

1100
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
So for the characters in this one

1101
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,600
um, basically you play as Ryu and

1102
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,200
If you have a second player then you play as Ken. That's why they had the same

1103
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,720
And

1104
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:48,600
He also, you know, basically the two-player mode is basically versus Ken

1105
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,160
So you had different

1106
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,920
opponents in

1107
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,280
Single-player mode you had Retsu who was a Kenpo instructor

1108
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,000
gecky who had a claw and

1109
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,280
Joe who was a

1110
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,480
Another karate guide Mike who from what I understand became Mike

1111
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:15,720
I think was actually if I'm right he became Mike bison in Street Fighter 2 which as

1112
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,800
We know over here. He was called Balrog

1113
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,440
which was

1114
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:27,080
Vegas name and Vega was who was bison over here and I've gone across side

1115
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,680
Yeah

1116
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,280
Yeah, that's how it worked

1117
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,840
So we had a Lee who was

1118
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:40,640
Chinese boxing and Gen who was a professional killer and Gen came back in Street Fighter alpha or Street Fighter zero

1119
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,120
and so did birdie

1120
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:49,960
who was the wrestler slash boxer he also was in there and then there was one named Eagle who was a bodyguard and

1121
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,160
then you had your

1122
01:31:53,160 --> 01:32:00,920
Your last two opponents you had a Don who was Muay Thai and he actually came back for Street Fighter alpha as well

1123
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:06,660
He was the one with the very interesting here and Sagat who was the boss and now

1124
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,120
So it came out it was

1125
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:20,200
Produced by Takashi Nishiyama who we've seen as piston Takashi

1126
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,200
I

1127
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,640
Was just looking at that because the other video ran out so I went and looked at some other matches

1128
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:36,960
It was also um it was planned by um Hiroshi Matsumoto and the two of them actually went on

1129
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,240
to do a bunch of games for SNK including fatal fury and art of fighting and

1130
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,880
Then they came back to work on Street Fighter 4

1131
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:50,360
So uh and we all know Imani occasion, right?

1132
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:57,600
Basically he also designed the character portraits in Street Fighter and

1133
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,280
So we've got like I said there were two different versions in the arcade there was the regular version

1134
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,800
That has a six button and the deluxe one that had the pressure sensitive pads

1135
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,880
So you can basically hit pad here as hard as the pad did

1136
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:17,320
Basically in the US version well, I'd say in the any non-japanese version I should say

1137
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:24,280
Ken and Ryu were dubbed in English so that their moves were like Psycho, Fire, Dragon Punch and Hurricane Kick and

1138
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,640
Then later versions just left the voices in Japanese

1139
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,320
So you know basically when you get into Street Fighter 4 it actually has both versions of it

1140
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,360
So yeah the home versions there was like I said earlier

1141
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:42,120
Fighting Street for the TurboGrafx that had an arranged soundtrack and

1142
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:50,440
The this was interesting too the because it didn't have a six button controller your

1143
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:58,120
Strength of your moves were determined by how long you held the subsequent kick or punch button because it just had like

1144
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,280
They later did six button controllers though when it's a for TurboGrafx

1145
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:10,200
But anyway, did you know Rob that there was a Commodore 64 version?

1146
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:16,120
Actually, I did isn't that sad, but yes, I didn't know about the Commodore 64 version. I think I had it

1147
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:23,560
Well, um there was also one from the X Spectrum. It didn't play that great by the way because the Commodore 64 only has one button

1148
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,760
this MS-DOS Amiga and Atari ST that came out by US Gold and

1149
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,760
And

1150
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,080
They were

1151
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:40,960
I believe published by Tiertex, and they said that they actually came out with their with an unofficial sequel called human killing machine

1152
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:51,260
Kind of interesting huh of course of US Gold also was the one that published by my commando in 1943 so now

1153
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:57,160
The

1154
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,240
I mean it was as far as this. I mean it was considered to be

1155
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,960
one of the games of the year as stated by Sinclair user and

1156
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,800
C plus VG said it had no lasting appeal whatsoever

1157
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,960
Well

1158
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:21,200
How did that last lucky that somebody felt differently and gave it a sequel? Huh seriously?

1159
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,800
But I mean the sequel is so much better though. I mean it

1160
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:26,840
is

1161
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,200
Yeah, yeah, but I mean so we can see the roots of it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely

1162
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:38,480
And I mean there is an emulation of the arcade version that's available in Capcom arcade hits volume one

1163
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:44,980
but also of course a Street Fighter 2 champion edition and that's available for a Windows PC and the

1164
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:51,880
Capcom classics collection remix for PSP and Capcom classics volume 2 for ps2 and Xbox

1165
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,880
All

1166
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:59,160
Right that it that's it your classic game of the week Street Fighter or

1167
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,880
Fighting Street, I guess right depending on where you are

1168
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,920
For a variety of systems doing nothing apparently, but shorty you can over

1169
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:16,120
All right, we're going to move right into some rapid-fire news tonight if things seem a little bit compressed

1170
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:20,880
That's because we compressed our regular show because the April Fool's thing we did at the beginning so yes

1171
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:25,480
It is moving at a different pace tonight, so let's just go right into rapid-fire news Loki

1172
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,560
All right

1173
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,560
Let's talk a little bit about

1174
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,920
Some Easter eggs, and this is kind of funny

1175
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:39,440
There was actually an Easter egg that was found on the Nintendo 64 version of Goldeneye

1176
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,560
It was actually an emulator for the ZX spectrum

1177
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:48,420
Complete with ten games, and it was on that cartridge of course

1178
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:52,500
you know it was something that was kind of locked out a little bit, but

1179
01:36:53,100 --> 01:37:00,220
Thanks to a patch if you are running it in an emulator. You can actually access all ten of those games and

1180
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:05,480
That's kind of neat that they did that apparently the company well rare

1181
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:12,220
They had also I guess developed games for the ZX spectrum

1182
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:17,940
Back in the day, so that's kind of interesting that that was on there

1183
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:26,940
And then this is kind of disappointing news Kid Icarus uprising actually began as a Wii game

1184
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,700
And it was being developed on PC as well

1185
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:35,540
I imagined the dev kits or PCs, but as a Wii game. I yes exactly

1186
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,820
I kind of think it should have stayed a Wii game, too

1187
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:38,100
Yeah

1188
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:42,700
It would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game not the saying that they couldn't bring it the consoles later on

1189
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:48,220
But it would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game not so now that I'm playing it and thinking about the controls, too

1190
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:51,420
Like I can see how it totally was a Wii game

1191
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:56,180
And it would have been because you could use the little thumb stick to move and you aim at the TV

1192
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,380
Like it actually makes a lot more sense as a Wii game

1193
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:03,740
Although the 3d the 3d is beautiful in it though. I mean it is

1194
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,580
Here's the thing here's the thing that's really disappointing though

1195
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:10,980
They actually have video from the game running on the Wii version

1196
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,820
It's gorgeous it still looks oh wow I didn't see the video. That's awesome. Yeah, it's just

1197
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:23,500
Is it on the story here? It's on the story. Yeah, they actually show it looks like I mean

1198
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:29,020
It's basically what you see in the 3ds version. Just minus any enemies and stuff like that, but I mean

1199
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,620
I've been an awesome. This is the first level

1200
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:37,500
This is this looks like it could just be the screen from the 3ds one, but

1201
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:42,380
But yeah, that's the dev the prototype version that they had all right. I mean

1202
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:48,340
So sad that it could have been you know they should still do it as a PC game

1203
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:52,860
We're still time to put it out as a Wii game. That's right. Yeah, that's true. You are we you

1204
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,740
You never know

1205
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,260
So yeah

1206
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:05,220
This point very disappointing less disappointing is the success of journey, which is a PlayStation Network game?

1207
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:07,680
I really didn't talk enough about because it came out at the time

1208
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,860
I was getting back into Mass Effect, but this is a great experience on the PlayStation 3 and and again

1209
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:15,260
I really suggest you guys check it out however

1210
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:20,780
It sounds like a lot of you already have a journey is now the fastest selling Sony Computer Entertainment

1211
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:25,540
America region PSN game in all of recorded history so check that out

1212
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:30,180
the honor before that was infamous to festival of blood so

1213
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:38,700
Anyhow, so journey has been doing very very very well online and April 10th is when the soundtrack is coming out

1214
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:42,380
You can get that either on the PlayStation Store, or you can do it in iTunes

1215
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:46,480
So that's gonna be coming on April 10th, and it does have a gorgeous soundtrack with it, too

1216
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,660
So again journey on PlayStation Network is it's it's trip

1217
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:56,500
I like it a lot and the end they're gonna be doing a little big planet stuff for journey as well

1218
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,580
So I did read about someone needs to get it for me

1219
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:04,060
Maybe for your birthday, maybe all right

1220
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:11,060
If PC games are more your thing audio surf especially if you like music games is probably one that you've checked out before

1221
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,580
Well guess what they're not gonna stop there

1222
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:16,700
There's a website for a little something called audio surf air

1223
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:22,400
air who knows what that is it could be a mobile version of the game, but it sounds like it's more likely a

1224
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:28,600
Sequel to the original audio surf there is some screenshots on the website of course everything is subject to change

1225
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,280
But it does look like I don't know the the little machine looks a little more like a boat or something now

1226
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,360
So it is definitely possible. They've changed some things up

1227
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:40,560
I think they are recruiting for beta signups right now, so you can check that out on their website, which is

1228
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,760
It's air dot audio dash surf calm air that

1229
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:53,580
Down there air dot audio dash surf calm. That's a lot of punctuation. So there you go audio surf air dark Sarah

1230
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:57,240
Well in other news Rob

1231
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:02,560
Playing with your me game. I got a swap note. I had to check it. It's a cat

1232
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,640
No, well I said I sent a swap note earlier, so and it's my little April Fool's joke now

1233
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,640
Did you get the one from Reggie I?

1234
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:16,480
I did get the one from Reggie, and you can use him as a level 5 guy in find me or whatever

1235
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,280
But he got scared off by the monster

1236
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:23,760
And I didn't get to use him at all and that pissed me the fucking asshole. I know right so news I

1237
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,520
Had to give you a hard time Rob

1238
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,200
Mortal Kombat Vita has a release date. It's

1239
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,760
going to be coming out in Europe on May 4th and

1240
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:40,120
And I don't see what the American data us is May 1st first right yeah, yeah

1241
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:48,980
So basically it's gonna have touchscreen enabled fatalities and a challenge tower whoo and a hundred and fifty Vita exclusive missions

1242
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,080
The Vita challenge tower could be neat. I mean they're gonna incorporate a lot of the Vita stuff into it, so

1243
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,200
I'm interested, but I don't really want to pay 40 bucks or whatever

1244
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,240
It's gonna cost to play it new when I already have the old one. You know exactly well

1245
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:07,920
There's another game and really I'm only reporting on this because I like the name of it awesome not

1246
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,080
It's a multiplayer arena beat-em-up

1247
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:19,100
That's going to be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live arcade on May 2nd put out by Ronimo games

1248
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:26,120
so you basically beat people up in teams of three online or via splits screen locally and

1249
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,320
There's no price tag on it yet

1250
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:36,240
It's a Ronimo is a Dutch developer nice. They put out a swords and soldiers

1251
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,000
alrighty

1252
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,920
We're gonna get into the frugal question of the week actually though. I think I want to do an

1253
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:46,800
Unscripted break just because the recording is starting to get a little long

1254
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,320
So I need to save the recording so we don't lose it so I get the temp space back

1255
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,920
So we're gonna do a little technical break and when we come back

1256
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,740
I'm gonna do just a two-minute song here when we come back

1257
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:59,640
We will do more of orange launch radio including the frugal question of the week F use of the week

1258
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:05,480
Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and your phone calls at one eight seven seven game

1259
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,380
Oh, LR will get to those right after a quick impromptu break here

1260
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:20,080
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this April Fool's Day edition

1261
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,500
episode number 452 of our show

1262
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,800
And if you tuned in late tonight you list missed a little bit of retro

1263
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,120
Oh, LR at the top of the show so check it out when it hits the podcast feed yes

1264
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,360
It will all be in the somebody was asking if they could get a recording of

1265
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:34,820
The beginning of the show tonight, and I was like it it'll be in the podcast

1266
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:41,520
So it'll be all there songs and all because we very intentionally pick songs that were from the games themselves

1267
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,320
So they're like licensed a little differently so we can

1268
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,620
Probably get away with putting those in the podcast a little easier than if we had done some of the licensed DDR music

1269
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:55,040
I don't know Konami might not like the fact that you put the unedited version of dynamite Raven there

1270
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,040
You know the one that was actually good enough the newer one that they

1271
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:03,040
Felt that they need to go and tweak kind of like George Lucas tweaks his movie

1272
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:06,200
Hey, we were helping to promote dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga, so

1273
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,160
How can they be mad all right anyhow? Let's get back into the show?

1274
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:21,000
A frugal question of the week, it's where we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google plus, and we call it frugal all

1275
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:31,080
Right so nope no bites on Google this week, which has me convinced nobody is on Google plus however to be fair

1276
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:37,060
I kind of forgot about the segment till a few hours before the show so I will try to remember to post these on Saturday

1277
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,060
So you have a full day to answer the question?

1278
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:43,420
Whether it be on Google plus if you'd search for orange lounge radio

1279
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:49,800
I also also I should say this I saw a commercial for Google plus at the movies yesterday before Hunger Games

1280
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,940
they're really trying they're trying to get people to make the switch to Google plus and

1281
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:59,540
Since I'm being forced to move to this stupid timeline thing on Facebook

1282
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:04,760
I like it Google plus doesn't seem so bad and our page is now the timeline you can get in

1283
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:09,400
Oh for that by the way. I think I will I hate the way time looks I hate it. I hate the left

1284
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,400
And the right side stuff. It's I love it

1285
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,720
Well, I hate it

1286
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,940
All right here. It is the frugal question of the week

1287
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:23,760
What is your favorite urban legend or April Fool's joke in the gaming community that turned out to be fake or perhaps even real?

1288
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,680
Years later for example, Shang Long Sonic and Super Smash Brothers melee and so forth

1289
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,280
Be sure to sign your comments. Oh

1290
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,520
Obviously if you wrote on Facebook, then you already did

1291
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:42,520
Dark Tetsuya writes, honestly, I don't think anything could top Shang Long from EGM April 92

1292
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
Wow, even quoted the magazine in the date

1293
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,120
Keep in mind that this was even before we had the internet much less as big as it is today

1294
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:56,200
And you have to give the editors credit for sticking the find the AFD joke contest right underneath it

1295
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,680
I agree that was a pretty epic troll on behalf of that magazine

1296
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:04,260
I remember they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year, and they've kind of set the benchmark

1297
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,000
But I loved when their jokes would become realities like Ermac in

1298
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:13,120
Mortal Kombat 1 like ended up being a really real thing that was kind of funny, so

1299
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:21,640
Alright, Cody T. Writes us and says one that happened just recently Assassin's Creed connect, and there's a video trailer for it and everything

1300
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:27,360
It's actually pretty hilarious, and he linked us to the video trailer there, so yeah, I didn't see this I watched it

1301
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:32,480
And it's you know looks like the normal connect videos, and you see this guy do like this backflip

1302
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:39,260
You know in in his living room and stuff, and it just it just gets more and more ridiculous

1303
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:46,840
Pork Chop writes and says how about the Final Fantasy 7 tech demo for PlayStation 3 that had everybody lose their minds and assume there'd

1304
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:51,800
Be a remake ultimate fanboy troll well to be fair that wasn't an April Fool's joke

1305
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:57,160
But I get we did say urban legend or April Fool's joke, so that was a huge troll on

1306
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,240
Somebody's part you have to wonder if they didn't consider. Can I add mine in here sure of course yeah?

1307
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,240
You get to answer to remember when they were

1308
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,680
Going to do Megaman Legends 3

1309
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:11,960
And then they said they're gonna put out a demo for it and that you'd have to pay for the demo

1310
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,200
And then they said fuck you we're not gonna do it. Haha. Yeah, that was that wasn't a troll

1311
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,700
That was just fucking mean is what that was

1312
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:27,680
Which by the way, and I do follow them on Facebook still you know 10,000 or 100,000 strong for Megaman Legends

1313
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:31,500
3 to return or whatever that is they're up to 80,000

1314
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:37,020
Likes so that's more than a million moms right yeah, so I mean

1315
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:41,180
You know hey if you haven't liked them yet, maybe you should

1316
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:46,820
This just in there are more Megaman fans than moms

1317
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:50,420
Apparently go figure all right moving on I

1318
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:52,500
Kid I kid

1319
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,240
Tyler M says Goken in Street Fighter 2 I don't remember that one

1320
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:01,160
I do cuz that was it was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, and now he's in Street Fighter 4

1321
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:06,260
Oh, how funny I forgot that one that must have been a little later after the Shang Long ordeal

1322
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:11,620
Phil G. Writes, I'm still not convinced the Diablo 3 release date is real

1323
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:15,820
That's a very valid concern sir, but we have people who are already playing the beta

1324
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:21,060
I mean the beta has been out for a while now though. Oh, yeah, I mean so it's got to be sometime soon

1325
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:23,460
Well, you know that it was practically done in October

1326
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:29,540
Well, yes, you know there are some people are concerned that the Gran Turismo 5 release date isn't accurate either

1327
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:39,420
Also a legitimate concern yes, um let's see unfolded raptor writes and says when I was in third grade back in 2000 I

1328
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:44,700
I feel so old

1329
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:55,440
That was it that was a great troll from unfolded raptor right there good job, sir all right I

1330
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,440
Used to tell my friend at school that if he threw flares in the corner of a certain room in Tomb Raider the last

1331
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:04,660
Revelation that it would skip him to the end of the game well

1332
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:09,620
He kept doing that and it ticked him off that he had to restart the level again and again and waste his flares

1333
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:14,700
So he comes back and tells me the next day that if I went through the whole game of Star Fox 64

1334
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:19,660
Without doing a barrel roll that at the end and Ross would come out and shake his butt I

1335
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:24,900
Have to remember there in third grade, so this is funny

1336
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:29,900
I played Star Fox 64 over and over for about a week before I was convinced that no such thing existed

1337
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:35,620
Years later my friend told me he lied about and Ross and it served me right, but deep down in my heart

1338
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:43,460
I want to believe that such a secret ending actually exists. This is an April Fool's prank that is stuck with me throughout the years I

1339
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:52,020
Feel like this needs an animated gif file of and Ross shaking his butt with I want to believe

1340
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:55,020
That's

1341
01:49:57,180 --> 01:50:01,540
A good story what I like about that story is it really has nothing to do with gaming magazines or press

1342
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:06,300
But it's just like people trolling each other, and that's that's great all right lastly Hunter are rights

1343
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:11,740
It says I remember last year this game that claimed to be Duke Nukem forever came out except

1344
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:16,380
It was totally lame there are people who are still convinced that shit is real ha ha I

1345
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:23,060
See what you did there. I see what you did there all right. That's it for our frugal question

1346
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:26,980
It's even funnier. There's developers that think that the critics went too hard on them

1347
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:35,820
By the way those are like those are like the 9-eleven conspiracy

1348
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:40,660
There's thousand strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3 they're up to eighty one thousand six hundred forty two

1349
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,660
Yeah, that's actually been going up quite a bit

1350
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:47,700
So they keep that up you may be able to hit that before June

1351
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:50,940
I I would go like the page, but I'm over it

1352
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:54,740
That's just where I'm at. I'm over it

1353
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:57,260
All right, let's get back into some more news Loki

1354
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:04,740
All right, well unfortunately something that may not be coming back quite as soon as Mega Man Legends 3

1355
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:09,520
To PSP games which

1356
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:11,660
had

1357
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:16,580
Problems with their save files or you know that they could be exploited to launch

1358
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,220
homebrew emulator on

1359
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:22,740
the PlayStation Vita basically through the PSP

1360
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:26,100
Emulation or the emulator on there

1361
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:32,780
And allow them to run unsigned code so before we knew about motorstorm

1362
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:39,940
Arctic rift that was taken off and now hotshots tennis or everybody's tennis in Europe has also been taken down

1363
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:44,300
Because it was also being used in exploits to run

1364
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:47,380
homebrew on the Vita

1365
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:48,780
so

1366
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:53,900
That's what happens is these people release. You know a method that requires one of these games and

1367
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:56,620
Then it goes away

1368
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:59,540
What they should do is tell people to buy those games first

1369
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:03,480
And then release the exploit so that people have a chance to actually use it

1370
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:10,120
Of course it's only a matter of time before they patch this out, and then you know now what's interesting about this again

1371
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:16,400
These are PlayStation P portable games that are allowing the PlayStation Vita to be hacked

1372
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:19,920
I found that to be interesting, but they were using the old games to do it

1373
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,440
It's only hacked within the emulator

1374
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:26,440
But the emulator isn't as strapped as it was on the PSP you can still do a little bit more

1375
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,720
You have a little bit more memory and stuff to work with

1376
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,200
But it's still within the emulator you don't actually have access to the whole vita stuff yet

1377
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,320
But it allowed you to install Linux on the Vita

1378
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:43,440
I would allow you to run the emulators, and maybe isos. I don't know about that, but at least emulators

1379
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:51,800
And those are surprised you didn't get in on this before it got shut down. I don't download PSP games

1380
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,600
You know other than the ones I got for free so and honestly

1381
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:01,360
I'm kind of over playing emulators on stuff right now. I mean if I want to play emulators

1382
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,800
I have my PSP still I have

1383
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:07,600
Fuck I have a dingoo that only plays emulators

1384
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:14,360
I mean, I don't really need another system to run. You know homebrew stuff on right now

1385
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:18,880
All right, well this is one game that you may not ever get to play again

1386
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,920
After this whole well no it sounds like not a lot of people played it in the first place

1387
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,900
But now there's a big lawsuit going on you remember Def Jam rap star. Oh, God

1388
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:33,100
Well, here's the thing about it though try not to as well you guys as silly of a game as it looked

1389
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,620
This is the thing it wasn't that bad

1390
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:40,100
It was actually a pretty slick music game like I know a lot of had a really cool community feature to it like the whole

1391
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:43,940
YouTube sharing stuff like I know there's a lot of people that are like I'm not into rap music

1392
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:48,580
But if you actually kind of look at the way this game was built and everything it actually was a pretty solid music game

1393
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:53,620
I have to say but because it is you know it's it's a specific audience

1394
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:58,860
You know some people aren't into rap they'd rather have a rock game or something so because you know it was an audience

1395
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:05,900
That had to be in the rap and not everybody wants to like rap in their own house or whatever it didn't really do too

1396
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:06,980
well

1397
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:11,300
Unfortunately it you know it went came and went real quick, but here's the weird thing

1398
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,220
There's a lawsuit going on right now for big money

1399
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:18,500
EMI is suing for millimeter games and terminal reality

1400
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:23,300
Saying that songs were used in the game that they weren't entitled to

1401
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:30,340
Rap star apparently got some songs from labels like Def Jam and so forth EMI says though it owned small

1402
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:36,620
percentages of other tracks that were nominally owned by other labels some of the weird yeah

1403
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:40,300
I know right some of the examples include DJ Khalid's. I'm so hood

1404
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:49,820
Lil Wayne's got money, which EMI said they own 10% of one of them and 30% of the other I know right but apparently

1405
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,380
This is me that multiple publishers

1406
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:59,060
You know the way these things get bought and who finances it and so forth I can kind of see where this happens

1407
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:04,480
But EMI says 54 tracks infringe on their rights. They're going after eight million dollars in damages

1408
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:11,880
But the weird thing to me is that this game is a few years old now. I think it's 2010

1409
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:17,400
Yeah, or nine. I don't know how ice it was that same e3 was October

1410
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,560
It was in October

1411
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:24,200
I remember seeing it at e3 and I want to say it was the same year that game room had come out so what year

1412
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:27,640
Was game room was that 2009? I think was 2009

1413
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,960
So yeah

1414
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,800
Interesting it was

1415
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:40,560
2010 actually really all right 2010 and

1416
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:48,080
Yeah, and they shut down the community site in 2011 don't

1417
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:53,240
All right, let's move on to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails

1418
01:55:54,440 --> 01:56:00,000
Mail bag at orange long trader calm dark soccer is gonna dive in head first to pick a few of her favorite emails and read

1419
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,960
them now

1420
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,400
Okay, Kermit

1421
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,520
He's something vaguely Kermit. Hi whoa Kermit the frog here

1422
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,920
Okay

1423
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,560
This one comes from pikaruna. You know that's long

1424
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,400
Something stuck my cheek

1425
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,640
Hey guys glad to hear on last week's show that epic Mickey will be getting a sequel

1426
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,400
Although I have a day

1427
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,560
Although I haven't played the original yet the concepts always attracted me. I'm sure Rob knows why

1428
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,240
And it'll be good to see the game on a console that I regularly play

1429
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:30,920
I

1430
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:34,920
Remember you made some comments about how epic Mickey was meant to be this dark more adult game

1431
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,200
And how it didn't really live up to that promise and it got me thinking

1432
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,360
There is one branch of Disney

1433
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,000
I'd like to see handle a project like this and that would be Disney Italy

1434
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:49,640
They've always had free artistic reign producing tons of exclusive comics and characters that never really gained traction elsewhere

1435
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:55,160
At the end of the 90s Disney Italy decided to launch a couple of experiments unsuccessful some less

1436
01:56:55,160 --> 01:57:02,320
So but all quite surprising these included pkna a Marvel slash DC style comic and featuring paper

1437
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:10,120
Paper-y Nick Donald Duck superhero alter ego as he fought aliens time travelers and mutants featured violence and actual character deaths

1438
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:14,320
The most successful the experiments this even got its own video game

1439
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:19,040
Although that was based on the shitty third series that fans like to forget ever happened

1440
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:24,880
Can I say real quick the whole epic Mickey thing? I it's nowhere else in our show row

1441
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,360
I don't think we've covered it here. There's that awesome new I don't know if you heard but with epic Mickey 2

1442
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,280
They're also doing the 3ds game

1443
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:37,240
Well, the 3ds isn't a port of epic Mickey to the 3ds game is a new casual of illusion game

1444
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:40,160
Oh, right, and they're doing like stages like

1445
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:46,040
Classic stages, but they're doing stuff like Tangled and you know, it's a bunch of new Disney movies in it, too

1446
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,040
It's cool. I'm like sold

1447
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,880
Thank you very much

1448
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:51,880
Sounds better than the console one to me

1449
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:55,440
Okay, well to continue. Yes, ma'am

1450
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:00,720
There's witch a shoujo manga style comic this one also ran for quite a long time

1451
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:06,200
Also getting its own TV show and being turned into a real manga in Japan not to be confused with Winx Club

1452
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
Which was a cheap and nasty knockoff of this

1453
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:15,500
Riddhi Topolino, which is what you get when you cross Disney with Monty Python short-lived but hilarious things

1454
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:18,520
They did include publishing their Christmas issue in July

1455
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:25,640
And certain deliberate mistakes into the comic strip and one memorable feature celebrated the Olympics by having Mickey compete against a garden gnome

1456
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:29,880
The inanimate gnome not only one but the end of many also dumps Mickey for it

1457
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:37,960
There's Mickey Mouse mystery magazine the darkest of the bunch Mickey is a hard-boiled detective in his own noir comic solving mysteries and dealing with bad

1458
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,200
Guys, this was so dark

1459
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:45,840
later issues tried to soften the story by making it look like Mickey was just watching the episode as a film rather than him being

1460
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,480
the actual protagonist

1461
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,320
Then in early 2000s Disney Italy got a new director

1462
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:55,000
They decided all this awesome teen oriented stuff was too bold and basically killed off every one of these projects

1463
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,560
Which is a great shame. They all deserved a lot more recognition

1464
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:02,040
Unfortunately PKNA and MMMM never made it to the States

1465
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:08,240
So your only chance of reading these fine series is to learn Italian or look for fan translated scans on the net

1466
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,000
But yeah, I would love to see some of the edgier characters in epic Mickey too

1467
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,960
But since they're virtually unknown outside of Italy not much chance of that aye

1468
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:22,480
Anyway, let's and take care of pikaruno. Thank you for the email pikaruno and just for you since you know, you brought it up

1469
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,160
The health

1470
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:36,400
Yeah, I remember rolling my eyes when they were showing that shit my god, what is this bullshit

1471
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:42,460
Next email and this is actually from rubber

1472
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,320
There was

1473
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:53,560
Link from the Star Tribune last year Best Buy it lost a staggering 1.2 billion as it was deeply discounted merchandise to keep pace

1474
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:55,680
with rivals Amazon and Walmart

1475
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:59,240
All in all Best Buy hopes to shed 800 million

1476
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:03,300
Over the next three years saving the company plans to use

1477
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:09,700
You know savings the company plans to use to fund its new connected store remodels international expansion and digital service

1478
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:15,560
But even CEO Brian Dunn admits the company's efforts to remake itself are fraught with frustration and uncertainty

1479
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:21,120
So well, it's tough because a lot of people are going into Best Buy and then they'll figure out what they want

1480
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:28,220
Then they go buy it on Amazon because it's cheaper. Yeah, so I mean it's it's gonna fries because Amazon

1481
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,700
Doesn't have to staff a store

1482
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:33,420
I mean they have to staff a warehouse, but they don't have to staff a store

1483
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:36,220
So they're kind of able to make cuts that Best Buy can't make as easy

1484
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:39,180
But yeah Best Buy is gonna have to be aggressive if they want to stay competitive

1485
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:44,700
It will probably help that more states are forcing Amazon charge sales tax

1486
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:48,380
Yeah, because there's a lot of people that use Amazon simply because they don't have to pay tax and they buy an Amazon

1487
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,380
But that's gonna be changing

1488
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:54,940
Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it. Okay, um next email

1489
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:58,500
I have a neighbor of mine who owns a fairly large pasture on this pasture

1490
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,580
He allows a number of animals to freely graze

1491
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:07,100
Horses cows sheep whatever on the fence that lines the property is a series of signs that all say the same thing

1492
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,220
Free manure inquire at the house

1493
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:16,000
By now manure. He means bullshit fresh new high quality bullshit. My neighbor's bullshit is free to anyone

1494
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:21,540
You just have to haul it away yourself as I looked at my Twitter feed on Wednesday

1495
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:24,540
I began to wonder why people aren't all a Twitter about my neighbor's bullshit

1496
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:29,980
Sure, the bullshit that came out on Wednesday that related to the PlayStation 4 is hotly anticipated

1497
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:35,960
But the recent bullshit about the Xbox lube is frequently and abundantly deposited, but my neighbor's bullshit is actually real

1498
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:42,780
My neighbor's bullshit isn't as an actually tangible thing as opposed to the PlayStation bullshit and the Xbox lube bullshit

1499
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:46,640
Perhaps you can figure out this quandary while I simply cannot stay black entertainment

1500
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:50,120
This message has been brought to you by a big juicy tender succulent steak

1501
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,900
YUM

1502
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:58,860
Mainly because no one actually cares about actual bullshit. Did you see the ad today for the chick-fil-a steak sandwich?

1503
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:00,960
Yes, I did. That was pretty funny

1504
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,740
Is that it for emails or we have one more?

1505
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:09,980
Yeah one more but I've wondered if you had a rebuttal for why does why is real bullshit not as talked about as

1506
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,700
the bullshit people actually care about

1507
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:17,780
Because your neighbor's not famous and doesn't make video game systems the end

1508
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:23,140
I um, there's a lot of game sites that run with bullshit or else they'd have nothing else to publish

1509
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:29,620
Speaking of shit. EA is still up for grabs for worst company in America

1510
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:34,620
So if you go to consumerist calm and vote I believe tomorrow is when they're having I don't know

1511
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:37,420
It's tomorrow or maybe they're really part next week. They're actually

1512
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,220
voting

1513
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:45,700
For the semi-finals so they can they can do it and this year. They're also giving away three different

1514
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:47,220
Uh

1515
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:51,260
Golden poos, they're gonna have the golden poo the silver poo and the bronze poo this year Wow

1516
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:55,440
So they still have a chance as long as they win next round, you know, well

1517
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:58,880
Congratulations. Yeah two emails left

1518
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,460
Excuse me

1519
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,860
Thank you

1520
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:05,740
Yes, I had to burp. Oh, well, dear olr today

1521
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:10,420
I was cleaning up the garage while listening to last night's podcast two hours and a lot of packing later

1522
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:13,700
I unearthed an unexpected surprise a slim ps1

1523
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:19,380
Apparently it once belonged to my uncle who scrapped it years ago. I immediately began to wipe the dust and chemicals away

1524
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:22,420
Hoping to restore it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any game

1525
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:26,980
So I decided to test the lens with an audio CD after browsing through my uncle's CD collection

1526
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:29,820
I knew what album I had to choose Queen greatest hits

1527
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:35,260
Good pick after anxiously connecting all of the cables and the single controller

1528
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:39,000
I was relieved to find the ps1 was still kicking and better yet. I jammed it

1529
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,720
Don't stop me now as a celebration anthem. That's long as great

1530
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:45,500
I love the scene in Shaun of the Dead where they're beating up the zombie to that song. That's the best

1531
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:49,940
I haven't touched a ps1 since 2000 back when I was nine. Shut up

1532
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:56,500
The nostalgia began to return to me. I'm not enjoying all this age of our listeners this week

1533
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,940
I remember being blown away by games like Ein Hunderr

1534
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:07,580
Gran Turismo and Twisted Metal my question to you guys is this with my first ever ps1. What game should I immediately own?

1535
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:12,780
Also were the seminal titles the ps1. What were the seminal titles the ps1 era?

1536
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:18,660
I like all types of games RPGs platformers horror sports fighting rhythm you name it also

1537
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:22,060
Where can I even find ps1 games anymore? Thanks in advance. Love the show

1538
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:27,100
Keep up the good work Randy from Texas flea markets. You can find a lot of PlayStation 1 games that still Amazon

1539
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:31,620
Oh, really? They still sell PlayStation 1 games people still stuff in them as long as oh, yeah

1543
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:51,360
Think they changed the whole import thing on the old on the PS slim didn't they?

1544
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:56,960
Yeah, because yeah, that was the one that you had to use the memory card thing

1545
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:02,400
I never had slim. I just had the old one that we have the like the

1546
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:07,400
Cartridge in the back. Yeah. Yeah, you might as well get a file pass at Final Fantasy 7 copy too. Cuz that was

1547
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:12,680
I'm Honda, of course, you mentioned it. Mm-hmm

1548
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:14,680

1552
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:34,080
I bought a jog con and I was like wow, this is crap, you know, you need wipe out with the neg con

1553
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,080
What if I have a jog console?

1554
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:39,880
Course Ridge Racer I was r4 Oh

02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,960
Herp derp Ridge Racer revolution

1556
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:48,160
But um wipe out with an egg con is possibly a revolution

1557
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:52,520
God what else? Well, I mean I just picked up

1558
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:58,420
Um bus to move to arcade edition, which is literally the best version of bus to move you can find

1559
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:01,960
Chrono cross Chrono cross

1560
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:08,200
Chrono trigger re-release you got to get bubsy because that was such a high quality. I don't roll. Don't roll

1561
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:31,000
All right. So good luck finding your PlayStation game and just for you just for you

1562
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:36,960
Maybe you should just go get a PlayStation 3 and get a Sing Star Queen or a rock band and all the Queen songs

1563
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:43,560
How about the last email? All right. How about it? Okay. Greetings. Olr. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle question of the week

1564
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:49,600
What game are you looking forward to most this year not including January through March also a comment on Skyrim. I

1565
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:52,280
almost never buy games

1566
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,800
Day one because of cost which I believe are too high

1567
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:59,220
But I did buy Skyrim sunk 40 hours into it in two weeks and haven't touched it until today

1568
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:02,480
Thanks to seem constantly advertising the latest mods

1569
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:06,760
I decided to give it another go but only after spending two hours respecting my character

1570
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:11,900
Being able to respect plus the sky UI has made the game playable again

1571
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,760
By the way, the HD graphics pack made the game look that much better

1572
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:20,960
Anywho, keep up the good work and I'll listen to your answer tomorrow your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle

1573
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,440
I kind of want to play it on my PC. So do I I don't know if my PC can run it though

1574
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,440
I think it can I'm sure my

1575
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:29,720
Games, I'm looking forward to this year

1576
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:34,560
Kingdom heart dream drop distance. Yes, which is out in Japan, but it's not out here yet

1577
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,280
Um

1578
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:39,920
The new Tomb Raider looks really good. Still. I'm interested in that

1579
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,760
I kind of think there's gonna be stuff at e3 that we don't know about yet

1580
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:46,400
That will be very exciting especially with the Wii U and everything

1581
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,140
Also, it's looking very very very good that I'm gonna be able to go to e3 this year

1582
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:55,880
So I'm very excited about that because I didn't go last year. Really. I sat in the lobby last year

1583
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:00,840
But hopefully this year I'll get to get say hi missy three I do it is fun

1584
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:07,560
I I do miss it, but I can't you have a baby. Yeah separate the kids when the kids 18, then you go to e3

1585
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,600
or

1586
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,680
You can't take kids under 18

1587
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:23,320
By four hopefully he'll he'll understand that daddy goes away sometimes. Yeah, he's just at the point now where it's just like

1588
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,200
You know, he's very clingy

1589
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:31,400
I understand understand. I in fact, I got to miss out a trip to a resort in Monterey Bay

1590
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:37,400
Yeah, there are companies doing I I get the stay back at work and work

1591
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,500

1592
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,720
Who's I'm gonna work though when they leave?

1593
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,600

1596
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,120
Thank you guys. Let's get to the F use of the making me work the F use of the week

1597
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:07,000
Here we go. And some special April Fool's F you music has picked by Loki tonight

1598
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:20,200
You know, I tried to find the whole video for that song just cuz I needed to hear it in context it's awesome anyway

1599
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,720
Really well looped I

1600
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:28,040
Was I'm just mesmerized for a second

1601
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:30,320
anyway, um

1602
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:32,920
God, Rob, you need to stop that because that's too distracting

1603
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:40,080
I thought if I get the sax guy off the screen, this is the music is too distracting. I played saxophone. So I'm like

1604
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:48,520
So anyway, um, my if he goes to this music and to spilling coffee all over my wallet

1605
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,980
Didn't do that in my kitchen. Did you know I did it at Starbucks

1606
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:56,440
a

1607
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:59,940
Few to having to go to bed early tonight because I'm starting a job tomorrow

1608
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:05,240
I mean, I'm happy to be working. I mean, I would like to just get paid for doing nothing. That would be great

1609
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,880
but

1610
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,120
it's gonna be nice to be productive again and

1611
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:12,640
Damn it. Yeah

1612
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:17,960
But well, you know what sucks about it is it what sacks about it

1613
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:26,760
It what sucks is that I have a class that's on during my work shift

1614
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:30,980
So, uh, I'm basically gonna have to miss the rest of the semester that class

1615
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:34,840
But I've already told the teacher that if I got a job job comes first

1616
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,360
There you go. Mookie

1617
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:44,560
McDonald's for not being able to make food correctly. I mean, it's not that hard. Seriously. You're calling that food

1618
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:49,800
Well, it's hardly food. But like I said, there's few McDonald's on the way here

1619
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:52,520
No, Burger Kings that are right on the way here. So

1620
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:58,720
It's like well, I could drive way the fuck out of the way to go to Burger King or I could just be quick and getting

1621
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:04,040
Gone, so I was quick. I was actually almost gonna get their fish McBites that they have now

1622
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:09,080
Although I think that would be poison. So I'm not really sure if I should do that. I'm not

1623
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:15,640
that's it if you do the people that keep wanting to compare about a royale the Hunger Games get over it and

1624
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:18,360
F you to

1625
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:25,580
F you to Jelly Belly, I am so mad. I am no longer gonna be able to eat Jelly Bellies anymore

1626
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:28,880
What happened? I'm boycotting Jelly Bellies. They had

1627
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:35,680
Rick Santorum at their factory giving a speech and then did this whole

1628
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:41,340
$1,000 a plate fundraiser dinner at Jelly Belly because I never knew this they contribute to all these causes

1629
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:46,040
Which I don't you know, I I'm not mad at like

1630
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:50,840
I'm not the person who usually get up there and say F you to all Republicans and all this because I don't feel that way

1631
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:57,200
He's evil. There's a lot of Republicans I do like and there's some progressive ideas within Republicanism that it's cool

1632
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:03,840
And you know, I'm fine with that. It's Rick Santorum. I have a fucking problem with he's he's just he's evil. He's vile

1633
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:10,360
He's gross and racist if you saw that thing this week, so he's just a walking festering pile of shit

1634
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:16,200
It's just he's he's the village idiot of this country and deserves to be pointed and laughed out wherever he goes

1635
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:22,520
And I'm just sad that the tainted he is tainted the Jelly Belly factory and I can no longer support that company

1636
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:28,520
And I urge all of you to so I was I was hoping that maybe it was all like they were gonna do a Bernie's

1637
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:35,160
Bots for Santorum flavored jelly beans, but that didn't end up being the case. Unfortunately, why did they all taste like shit?

1638
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,400
and Luper kid I

1639
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,320
Don't understand

1640
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:46,000
so F you to Rick Santorum if you do the fact that people actually are voting for him for president and

1641
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
There you go. That's the F use of the week

1642
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,920
moving on

1643
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:52,920
Loki, all right

1644
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,440
So moving on let's talk a little bit about

1645
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,360
changes and

1646
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,360
Sega unfortunately

1647
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:07,000
changing for the worst they are canceling games cutting jobs and restructuring and

1648
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,040
Of course, they're expected net incomes down almost 50%

1649
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,520
And of course, they're gonna make some changes regarding that

1650
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:18,960
They're streamlining the operations of Sega both in the United States and Europe

1651
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:28,380
They're gonna focus on key franchises including Sonic Football Manager total war and aliens

1652
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:31,960
So

1653
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:38,520
Yeah, it's interesting funny enough though, they're actually still doing an Olympics game in June so

1654
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:41,600
Maybe they're restructuring after that

1655
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:48,680
But uh, oh no that um, Sonic and Mario Olympic game did crazy good on the Wii. No, I'm not talking about that

1656
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:52,840
I'm talking about the actual Olympic games, you know the sports game that's on

1657
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,200
ps3 and 360

1658
02:13:55,200 --> 02:14:00,080
But maybe for that same reason they're doing that. I mean, that'd be you know, every cool

1659
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:04,680
But yeah, I can understand they try a lot of experimental stuff and it doesn't always work out

1660
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:06,680
If only they'd release Shenmue 3

1661
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:13,920
If only well, I think they kind of do that stuff though the a little bit more experimental stuff though on Xbox Live Arcade

1662
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,760
So I don't know necessarily we're gonna see the end of that kind of stuff, you know

1663
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,400
Cuz after all they're gonna be doing, you know jet set radio here. So I

1664
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,520
It's very possible that they'll still do Shenmue

1665
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:28,920
All right

1666
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:32,120
I'm kind of sad to hear about this obviously because it's Sega

1667
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:37,200
I'm also sad because that means less of a chance that Phantasy Star Online 2 will come out in America

1668
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:42,560
Which I was really looking forward to hope it will I'm still hoping it will too and maybe we'll hear something about it

1669
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,720
83 but just the whole you know

1670
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:51,840
Sega not doing so hot is kind of depressing and humbling news dark soccer

1671
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,760
I know you've got to be feeling a little sad about the changes at Sega. Yeah

1672
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:01,360
I'm also pissed off at my laptop, but that's another thing. Did Sega build your laptop? No, it's a piece of shit. Oh, I'm sorry

1673
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:09,080
Niche in our chat room is wondering the same thing. What's gonna have our Nietzsche probably what's gonna happen to my PlayStation online to Sega

1674
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:12,240
What about PSO to you bastards? That's how I feel

1675
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,800
Huh, we'll see just stop putting out the crappy Sonic games and maybe it'll be better

1676
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,440
Who knows all right moving on

1677
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:29,960
It's a bummer Sega didn't have this because I'm sure there's a bunch of fans that would be really excited about this game

1678
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:31,960
but that would be

1679
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:36,240
Firefly the arcade game that is not a joke is it um

1680
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:41,520
I don't know because here's the thing the story was published March 31st

1681
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:48,040
So I'm kind of like it kind of could go either way. So I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt

1682
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:54,840
And some people in the comments are saying it's April Fool's which if it is an April Fool's joke

1683
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:57,240
Your April Fool's jokes are supposed to go up April 1st

1684
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:01,920
What time does it say? It doesn't say it just says March 31st 2012

1685
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,520
So I'm gonna take it with a grain of salt is probably as a joke

1686
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:11,640
But let's entertain let's entertain the idea that it's real for a minute. Let's entertain if it could be realistic or not

1687
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:19,520
Apparently because of the 10th anniversary of the show Firefly even though it had a you know short life on television

1688
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,720
It's very cult and now they're talking about a Firefly

1689
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:27,920
Arcade game see the thing about this is the screenshot does look really fake to me

1690
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:36,760
The whole thing looks very it does it's a whole like first-person shooter and all that and that cabinet too just doesn't look no

1691
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:39,440
Let's assume it could be real though

1692
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:44,840
Let's or you know, like, you know, somebody was really thinking about this would this be something worth doing?

1693
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,560
Because it is a bit of a cultish franchise

1694
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:52,840
But I could you know a lot of stuff come from kind of back of the day ends up coming full circle again

1695
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:58,480
I don't even know necessarily. It's an arcade game, but like a pinball game. I could totally see a Firefly pinball game

1696
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:05,040
Yeah, couldn't you I really don't think it would happen. I mean then again, I'm I'm sure Joss would like the money

1697
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:12,200
They wouldn't make an arcade game based on a property that's niche like that, especially since arcade games nowadays

1698
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:17,560
It's just like you've got to have some sort of gimmick to get people to come to the arcades to play the game

1699
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,540
They're not gonna spend the money to make cabinets for an arcade game like that

1700
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:27,560
But hey April Fool's haha. Yeah, you can actually this is totally Photoshop

1701
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:31,120
Because if you look at the edges of this graphic that's supposed to be the side of the cabinet

1702
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,060
It's not like a pic. It just looks bad. So F you to

1703
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:39,400
People that do their April Fool's jokes on March 31st arcade heroes. Yep

1704
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:45,560
It's probably just said, you know, they probably did it on April 1st to them

1705
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:52,080
But it probably time-stamped on their server perhaps or they just didn't in March 31st. So people are well, maybe maybe

1706
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,760
All right moving on

1707
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:58,280
Oh, yeah, that would be me wouldn't it?

1708
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:01,560
Yes, ma'am. How about Tesco? Do you know what Tesco is? Uh,

1709
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:07,600
They are a big grocery store in Britain, right? Yes. Did you know that they've opened markets in the United States?

1710
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:09,640
Yes, because they're fresh and easy. That's how I knew that

1711
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:15,360
Yep, and they're being protested how the new stores that open here really I guess Tesco is very anti-union

1712
02:18:15,560 --> 02:18:21,080
So some of the union grocers in the area are protesting when I drove by there was actually an ambulance in front of it

1713
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:25,960
Maybe they started fighting each other. Who knows maybe maybe well at any rate

1714
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:31,800
Um, the supermarket has now say are they are the home of gaming in the advertisement over in the UK?

1715
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:38,880
Well, I guess since game UK went under they've there's an opening actually game. There's no more game store closures. Oh, really?

1716
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:44,880
Yeah, there's an article on that on a Eurogamer. Oh, I did. I didn't hear that follow-up. They didn't close any more stores

1717
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:48,240
huh, um, so basically they're saying that

1718
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,240
They have more gaming stores in the UK than any other retailers

1719
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,680
so that's three hundred and ninety three open at midnight for new releases and

1720
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:05,800
That there will have over ten thousand titles available online for UK delivery and day one pre-order shipping

1721
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:14,120
So I have no idea what to say about that. This reminds me of when 7-eleven got into gaming for a hot minute

1722
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:16,840
They stopped doing that right? I

1723
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:25,440
I Dan is friends with somebody who managed that was a big flop. Well, of course, it was a big flop

1724
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:27,240
What about this though?

1725
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:27,640
I mean

1726
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:34,640
I remember back in the day a lot of grocery stores had like video rentals shops in it and

1727
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:37,860
You could also rent games there too. So like

1728
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:44,180
Integrating and a lot of them still sell DVDs. It's not a bad idea considering that you know, the

1729
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:49,720
Video rental markets getting it's coming back because there's not a lot of you know

1730
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:53,480
There will blockbusters have kind of closed down Hollywood's closed down

1731
02:19:53,800 --> 02:20:00,200
Most of your mom-and-pop shops have closed down now they're starting to kind of reopen back up. Although kiosks are kind of popular nowadays

1732
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,280
Well, I found the thing about game by the way

1733
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:10,660
Yeah that um, it was up capita. That's the parent company of comet

1734
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,120
is bidding for game again and

1735
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:20,800
And there's three hundred and thirty three stores still open two hundred eleven of them being game and one hundred and twenty-two being game station and

1736
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,920
Basically

1737
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:33,120
They were initially blocked by the lending syndicate that owned them including the Royal Bank of Scotland. So

1738
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:41,440
That was what stopped them before so could video games at the grocery store work. I think especially the cheaper

1739
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,680
Market could work because you see a lot of that at Target

1740
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:47,560
I mean yes Target sells new games and all that too

1741
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:52,320
But they also like up by the registers usually have the $20 Wii games and those seem to do

1742
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:55,560
All right, like they sell more there than they probably would at a GameStop or something

1743
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:58,540
well, Tesco is pretty big too, and I think they are like a

1744
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:06,240
Wide very broad in their services and markets. So sure probably like a Safeway here. You know, it's got a lot of stuff

1745
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,240
It's not necessarily just the store

1746
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:13,280
But usually the full-service deli and China, you know a lot of places I've I'm sorry go ahead

1747
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:17,360
Well, as far as I understand it, it actually is a bit more like a super target. Oh

1748
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:20,860
Okay, you know Tesco's I mean, but it was big supermarket

1749
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:27,640
But like you can get or maybe like a what's that thing? That's um, they had in Washington that uh, Fred Meyer higher. Yeah

1750
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:30,360
The sum of everything, okay

1751
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:35,320
All right. Well, uh, Loki if you don't have any comments and let's go to the next story

1752
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:40,640
Let's um, let's talk about something of kind of a really cool piece of technology

1753
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:47,320
browser quest it was an MMO tech demo built by Mozilla and

1754
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:57,280
It's basically an MMO that works in browsers and they've got this little kind of almost looks like a 16-bit MMO that they're

1755
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:03,200
They can play and it actually will kind of work in any browser

1756
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:05,840
I guess that supports HTML 5 and

1757
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:13,420
They even have the full source available on github if you want to create your own MMO based off that

1758
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:18,540
Which is pretty cool. And if you want to check it out, you can go to

1759
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:22,080
Mozilla

1760
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,400
Org

1761
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:32,800
a future of MMOs possibly sounds like just another like

1762
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:39,080
Yeah, I mean how many browser-based games do we have these days it's a lot

1763
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:44,120
I think in the Ultima one that EA had but I mean something that runs in HTML 5 though

1764
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:49,680
That would be compatible with you know, like iOS and stuff like that. Oh, I get where they're going with that then

1765
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:56,000
Okay, like on mobile devices and stuff. It's not or like all games radio is compatible with HTML 5 and you can get on your

1766
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
iDevice and all games.com

1767
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,780
Yeah, so they're saying yeah, it's written in HTML 5 in JavaScript and can be played in Firefox Chrome Safari

1768
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:10,280
with web sockets enabled also in Opera and

1769
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:13,580
They say of course iOS devices and stuff like that

1770
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:20,740
If you want to play the game, it's browserquest.mozilla.org is the URL to go on

1771
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:23,380
Alright one more story for you guys

1772
02:23:23,380 --> 02:23:30,220

Zork sales remember Zork

1774
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:41,260
That series was awesome. It was started as a bunch of text-based adventure games, but then turned into some PC CD-ROM games

1775
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:45,740
I remember one of the first CD-ROM games that ever came out was return to Zork

1776
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:52,000
But there's also Zork Grand Inquisitor Zork nemesis all these games came out and then of course the text adventure games Zork

1777
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:59,820

1778
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:03,380
They're half off right now along with some other games such as Caesar 3

02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:06,700
Vampire the Masquerade redemption and so forth

1780
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:13,860
So yeah pretty cool if you're a Zork fan, and I remember oh god. I remember the accomplish 64 text adventure really well

1781
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:18,140
That's when games were hard like you had to know exactly what to type into that game

1782
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:24,820
Don't run out of matches or torches exactly you might get eaten by a grew

Slash olr and see what tweets are in store for us

1799
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:34,340
Gamer girl tweets us saying is PlayStation Plus really worth the money

1800
02:25:34,340 --> 02:25:37,700
I was thinking about getting a subscription, but I want to know if it's worth the money

1801
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:42,700
I think I'm the only one that actually has PlayStation Plus here

1802
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:48,940
I'll tell you this if you use your PlayStation a lot and especially if you buy from the store a lot then yes

1803
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:55,040
There's you know so many discounts and things and a lot of freebies that you get with PlayStation as well

1804
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:57,900
So if you think you'd kind of be into some of those freebies

1805
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,620
You want to get like one arcade game every couple weeks or so?

1806
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:04,500
I think it's a pretty good deal and getting journey early was really nice as well

1807
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:07,940
so I think there's a lot of good stuff there, but

1808
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:13,340
It really depends on how much you love your PlayStation meanwhile the phones are ringing

1809
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:15,420
So let's go to the phones higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1810
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:20,300
Hi, this is ds lover. Hey, what's your name again?

1811
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:24,540
ds lover ds lover what's on your mind I

1812
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:27,620
not much and to

1813
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:32,300
Talk about something that happened last night on the cartoon networks

1814
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:40,900
I don't know if the rest of you and the rest of the anime community ever caught this but Konami was on instead usual

1815
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:46,580
Adult swim bumpers yes, I I heard because I have a bunch of anime fans on my facebook

1816
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:51,960
Who are flipping the fuck out that to nami was doing this? I guess usually there are years past. They've been showing the room

1817
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,540
But they didn't do that this year

1818
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:56,580
so yeah, and

1819
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:58,580
to nami came back and

1820
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:01,180
Hopefully this and I'm not

1821
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:08,860
You know how I sent you guys that you know yeah, how you guys have written above a podcast it just pretty much kicked it

1822
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:13,260
But well, I'm gonna steal that podcast name right here now

1823
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:17,700
Games and more entertainment radio like they've just pretty much ceased

1824
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:25,420
They're not doing anything anymore, and just like I mean like any news fix on the weekly basis. We're also still left

1825
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:32,020
Well is that another yeah, is that another indie show or is that a corporate bat back show?

1826
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:35,420
No, it's another indie show well

1827
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:39,460
I don't I don't like to throw shade at the other indie shows because they all work hard at what they do

1828
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:42,000
but everybody's got different preferences, so

1829
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:45,060
yeah, and I

1830
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:48,740
Will say here um you know with the factor that?

1831
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:52,860
16th Empress beat me with the last one the ps2

1832
02:27:53,500 --> 02:28:01,000
Has anyone heard any announcements or the PlayStation 3 versions at all nope we kind of think that Konami may have just given up

1833
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:01,900
On the whole damn series

1834
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:08,180
Which is a darn shame because I think I think there's opportunity there for them to do like a massive collection on the PlayStation 3

1835
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:12,380
But that would require them investing in another controller or at least a converter for the old ones

1836
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:15,420
Which I would think would be easy to do, but I mean they don't want to do it

1837
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:21,940
There are there are controller converters for the PlayStation 2 controllers. I mean they already work for the guitar hero stuff

1838
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:27,620
I mean it shouldn't be that hard. I think they should be able to work on the beat me

1839
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:32,080
a controller it's if anyone in the club would like to test that out

1840
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:35,820
It's possibly not be willing to import there could be lag

1841
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:39,020
I don't know especially with the music game lag could kill it

1842
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:42,580
But I mean if they did it with the guitars and so forth and I don't see why it is impossible

1843
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:47,200
But I think it's just an investment on Konami's part, and they have to know that the sales would be there

1844
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:48,200
I'm kind of surprised

1845
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:49,340
They wouldn't do something

1846
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:54,800
Akin to what they did when 2d x7 style came out where they were like all right if a hundred thousand people pre-order it

1847
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:59,300
Then we'll make it otherwise. We're not going to which is kind of the early if you think about it

1848
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:05,240
That's like Kickstarter circa seven years ago, so maybe Konami needs a Kickstarter

1849
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:10,520
Which is kind of sad because it's not like they're hurting that bad, but I I don't know

1850
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:16,800
I they've got to see that the fans are there for 2dx to sell on the PlayStation 3 and then maybe they'll do it

1851
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:20,380
But certainly in America beat mania didn't sell

1852
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:27,340
Oh, yeah, and I think it was because the setlist was halfway the problem, and that's what I've heard from many

1853
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:29,340
Imani fans of that place

1854
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:33,660
But it's one of the problems on top of well. It's way too easy

1855
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:40,020
Yeah, I think what they did that was very unfortunate is that they just waited too long

1856
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:41,720
They were very naive that

1857
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:45,140
Bemani fans wouldn't just import the game and play it over here

1858
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:49,460
And I think a lot of people got there fixed that way so by the time they released a game here

1859
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:52,080
It was old news to the Bemani fans

1860
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:59,300
And it was too too obscure for regular people what if they were fucking serious about it what they should have done is release the

1861
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:04,340
Games in parody they should have put out 2dx night style in Japan and then put it out over here

1862
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:11,380
And maybe change whatever licenses you have to change, but keep every single Konami original so at least you got about 90%

1863
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:13,380
The same game you know

1864
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:16,220
Yeah, which is why I'm currently on the search

1865
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:22,700
For you know something like bm 98 for the Macintosh or some of the equivalent because

1866
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:28,780
I'm thinking about them to get one of those joy to to you for a one of those ps2 to usd

1867
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:32,620
Adapters my computer just so I can play beat me yeah well

1868
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:38,860
You're gonna get similar. You know what you need to do you need to write a letter to Konami

1869
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:43,940
You need to say I am a concerned fan, and that's you know once Konami hears voices

1870
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:50,220
But anything is possible at e3. I mean would it be cool if it may be the Wii U could become a controller somehow

1871
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:55,200
Hey, what about Twitter? I'm sure it's well. They have a Twitter

1872
02:30:55,820 --> 02:31:01,940
Tweet them the money clear the body fans of the world tweet Konami to bring beat me to the ps3

1873
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:04,540
It works with president

1874
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:12,720
So we can import it all right all right well DS. What would DS fan? I gotta let you go and take more calls, but thanks to the call

1875
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:17,020
Yeah, peace out and keep the shows rocking. We will buy

1876
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:23,980
1 8 7 7 game olr us name on skype is orange launch right a tweet Konami tell them you are a concerned fan

1877
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:32,840
Have they done at that I think they're still putting them out the arcades in Japan though right there's they just announced a test locating

1878
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:38,500
Another one so it's weird. They're still doing it in arcades, but it's kind of like Konami is saying this only is working in arcades

1879
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,220
It's not really working on home

1880
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:41,740
It's weird

1881
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:45,660
1 8 7 7 game olr username on Skype is orange lounge radio

1882
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:51,600
Going to some Tweety tweets here dark Tetsuya says coming to the site this week

1883
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:55,960
I've got something planned for the listeners to participate in so stay tuned

1884
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:58,620
That doesn't sound like an April Fool's joke

1885
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:01,420
Stay tuned

1886
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:04,200
Moving on s2100 Matt tweets us

1887
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:08,600
I know it's a video game show, but I played cards against humanity the card game

1888
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:11,200
It's apples to apples, but M rated well

1889
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:16,920
You've never heard of this now Loki have you of course and hunt tell so you you're very familiar with cards against humanity, right?

1890
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:24,660
Yes, cards against humanity is very inappropriate apples apples a game. What makes it so great. Just its level of inappropriateness. Yes

1891
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:28,040
All right

1892
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:35,320
Going to watch dragon who tweets us mr.. Pandaria is great. Just finished the starting area. How did you get past?

1893
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:40,240
All of those freaking pandas and some of those quests that must have taken a lot of patience

1894
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:43,840
So the art styles neat though. I do like the way pandaria looks

1895
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,080
It's cute if you want to see it later dark soccer

1896
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:50,160
We can fire it up on the computer before you go peek sure be fun

1897
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:53,960
All right going to some tweets from Tiger claw

1898
02:32:53,960 --> 02:33:02,120
1877 game olr or a username on Skype is orange laundry you tiger claw says why Soulcalibur 5 only had

1899
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:08,240
1-4th of a full story mode I did feel like story mode and Soulcalibur 5 seemed to be lacking a little bit

1900
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:15,760
But what happened was Soulcalibur 5 apparently it's an interview that was on train to game with the producer daishi odomasha

1901
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:23,000
Odashima, sorry says the story mode shipped with the game was a fourth of what they had planned quote

1902
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,320
Our first plan on the storyboard was that that we had every character story and actually we do have it in the studio

1903
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:34,160
But time wise manpower wise we weren't able to do it and only one-fourth of what we plan to do is in the game

1904
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:39,400
That was a dumb thing for them to admit. We could we can do it. If only we had the DLC

1905
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:40,440
Yeah, that's why I'm thinking

1906
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:45,160
I just think that was a dumb thing for them to say I mean they shouldn't I think they should have kept those cards closer

1907
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:47,160
Or their chest sorry to say

1908
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:53,960
But it did feel to me that story mode and Soulcalibur 5 was a little bit lacking

1909
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:55,920
so

1910
02:33:55,920 --> 02:34:00,120
Tiger claw sends us another tweet Warhammer 40k dark millennium

1911
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:06,720
It's going single-player because layoffs have hit relic and vigil more layoffs man. This is a bummer

1912
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:11,660
So Warhammer 40k dark millennium. It's now a single-player action game

1913
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:17,600
It will have multiplayer elements the president and CEO of thq Brian Farrell put out a press release

1914
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:22,960
Saying quote as previously announced we have been actively looking for a business partner for the game as MMO

1915
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:27,980
However based on changing market dynamics and the additional investment required to complete the game as an MMO

1916
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:34,320
We believe the right direction for us is to shift the title from an MMO to a premium experience with single and multiplayer gameplay

1917
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:39,760
robust digital content and community features so shit tons of DLC y'all

1918
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:41,760
Actually

1919
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:43,360
As

1920
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:47,560
Much as it sucks that these studios got closed and so forth this makes sense

1921
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:52,760
I think the MMO market is really volatile right now, and it's really tough to make a showing

1922
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:55,640
I mean look at where Star Wars is at there

1923
02:34:55,640 --> 02:35:01,720
They've come the second best probably to getting Wow and even they're starting to lose some people who are getting kind of bored of the

1924
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,480
game so

1925
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:05,480
MMOs are hard to do

1926
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:10,100
Phone calls are a lot easier to do we have a phone call coming in now higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1927
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:14,100
Hey, it's pork chop pork chop. What's on your mind, buddy? Hello?

1928
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:15,700
Well, it's good

1929
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:21,580
Did you start a talk about the whole Soul Calibur thing because I was really let down by that that pissed me off something serious

1930
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:23,900
Pork chop, where are you from?

1931
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:26,320
Ireland actually I could tell

1932
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:31,900
Yeah, love it. You guys stay up late to listen to the show over there, so yeah

1933
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:37,340
Well, I do yeah what wasn't that a dumb thing for them to say that they they purposely you know

1934
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:40,620
They only finished a quarter of it. I was so pissed off

1935
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:44,180
I mean I remember playing through the story mode okay, and it was it took me a day

1936
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:48,340
I played it in one fucking day, and I played that I paid like

1937
02:35:48,860 --> 02:35:55,380
It'd be about what 40 or 50 euros something like that be about 50 60 dollars something like that in the exchange

1938
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:57,820
I went and played that it took me like

1939
02:35:57,820 --> 02:36:04,180
To maybe not even an hour. I played it, and I said fuck this. I'm really disappointed

1940
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:08,580
So what I did was I brought it back. I got Arkham City, and I was much happier

1941
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:14,380
Thank God the creative character modes at least still fun and the fighting core game is still really fun

1942
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:18,260
But yeah, the story mode was a little a little bit disappointing there, so right

1943
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:22,020
I mean if you finish it in an hour. It's not worth buying for that price. I mean come on

1944
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:26,180
I mean, I don't even buy full-price games anymore never mind anything like nowadays

1945
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:29,260
I just look in GameStop for games that are like two to three years old

1946
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:35,020
Like I just picked up Final Fantasy 13 for what six six years is oh god. It was cheap

1947
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:37,780
You know I'm clapping yeah

1948
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:43,420
I've been waiting ten years for an angry Irishman rant on this show and it had to happen on April Fool's Day

1949
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:48,480
You should really see the look on Rob's face right now. He just looks like he's won the lottery

1950
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:56,240
Yeah, well, I'm glad I can fulfill your fantasy or whatever the hell is going on. That was Rob's final fantasy

1951
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:05,440
I mean full-price games nowadays really aren't worth it. That's that's the fact that a matter. I weigh it like for

1952
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:08,440
Ages, so I just look at trawling through games

1953
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:13,160
I'm looking at games that are really old and fucking nobody wants to play them anymore

1954
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:16,920
They've gone down to like I got Duke Nukem forever. Sorry to tell you that

1955
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:19,880
I had to play that because I was a fan back in the day

1956
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:21,520
Oh

1957
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:25,280
God like why not I mean I'm never gonna pay for the price for a game again

1958
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:28,200
That's pretty much how I'm looking at it at this stage. Port Chop

1959
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:31,240
Let me ask you this then and maybe I'm baiting you for another rant here

1960
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:37,300
But it certainly begs worth asking when you kind of are sick of only buying these new games that are so expensive and so forth

1961
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:39,000
How do you feel about this story?

1962
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:45,240
We were talking about earlier that by the time the PlayStation 4 and whatever's next on Xbox are out or Orbis or whatever it's called

1963
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:49,280
The used games aren't gonna happen. They're gonna block use games

1964
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:54,440
Pain in the fucking ass. I mean I as I said I said in chapter

1965
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:57,600
There was always I always favored hard copies over digital anyway

1966
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:01,160
I mean I still buy CDs and I'm never gonna use iTunes or any of that shit

1967
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:05,120
I'm still doing that to this day is like CDs are my vinyl in a way

1968
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:10,040
So I'm just gonna keep doing that and pray to fuck that you know Sony can cop

1969
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:17,400
I mean Steam's really successful. I kind of favor those guys because they aren't kind of overcharging the fans or anything me and my best friend

1970
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:18,800
He kind of works in the industry

1971
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:24,000
And he was telling me Steam are basically the daddy at this stage and they look to be like some sort of Messiah

1972
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:27,040
So it's looking good on their end, but Sony are

1973
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:30,880
Overcharging people way too fucking much as far as I'm concerned

1974
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:31,360
Yeah

1975
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,800
you know and

1976
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:37,200
What's funny what you made me think about while you were talking about steam and the way that they're viewed in the industry

1977
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:42,520
There was a rumor a couple weeks ago, or maybe even last week on this show about the whole steam box

1978
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:48,640
And although Val was quick to shoot that down that that's not actually happening. You can't help but think holy shit

1979
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:56,080
What if you have the PlayStation Orbis which doesn't play used games and you have the Xbox 360 or excuse me 720 or lube?

1980
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:57,640
Or whatever it's called that doesn't play used games

1981
02:38:57,640 --> 02:38:59,920
And then you have the steam box

1982
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:05,280
That will have all these sales all the time and what-have-you and kind of give the gamers

1983
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:09,720
The value that they're looking for to pay for games. It could be a bloodbath

1984
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:15,240
Yeah, I think while steam would definitely come out on top if you're gonna say that I mean, you know

1985
02:39:15,240 --> 02:39:20,560
The the offers to come out but like my friend actually showed me all of the receipts he had for the past

1986
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:24,880
Couple of months and I looked at and I compared PlayStation store

1987
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:30,600
I was like what the fuck am I doing with a ps3 if I can get all these games all the same games

1988
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:38,480
Nearly every single title I have he had a receipt for and it was like oh god the sales that were on he picked up

1989
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:44,660
Like 50 games within the space of three months and he taught it it up and he showed me that the end total

1990
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:47,920
Which would have been if they weren't on sale was around

1991
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:54,560
400 and I was like wow and he actually said I never paid that much for it and I was like, holy shit

1992
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,560
I want a steam account

1993
02:39:56,560 --> 02:40:02,520
Fantastic, could that be a regional thing though? Because most of it here in the u.s. It seems like especially when new games come out

1994
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:06,640
It's about the same you'd play on the PlayStation Network that you would on

1995
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:12,600
You know steam or whatever getting it on PC part of me wonders if PlayStation doesn't jack up the price even more

1996
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:18,080
overseas in other countries and maybe it's that that pain of the

1997
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:22,640
Whatever you want to call it translation of the cost or whatever is

1998
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:28,040
Is truly causing the difference I still see it wouldn't surprise me

1999
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:33,920
I mean even he said like games in America are way cheaper. I mean as far as I know I think they are anyway

2000
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:40,520
Yeah, it's it's true. I'm not gonna sound like I'm bragging but it's true when I see how much you guys pay

2001
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:46,200
You know in in you know euros or whatever currency we're looking at over there. It's it's

2002
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:51,080
It's pretty crazy how much you guys are paying for stuff over there that we are

2003
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:55,040
We're paying like on average like 10 to 15 percent less. Oh, I'm sure no

2004
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:58,840
I mean when you look at the exchange rate, you can see it that but even the prices

2005
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:05,400
I'm sure like, you know you in in terms of you know denominations of notes or money with bills as you call them

2006
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:07,440
You know, I'm sure you could pay

2007
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:12,400
Use two 20s to buy a good handful of games. Whereas that wouldn't even get you

2008
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:15,560
Well, they get you close to one which is fucking ridiculous

2009
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:21,760
I mean Ireland apparently the the capital of Ireland Dublin is one of the most expensive cities in Europe at this stage

2010
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,320
You know, so it's fucking ridiculous

2011
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:30,280
and that's why I have to go wait a couple of years for these games to come out and I have to go looking and

2012
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:35,560
I'll be like, okay. I'm two or three. I just finished Deus Ex and that's like year two years

2013
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:40,120
I finished Assassin's Creed a couple of days ago or a couple of months ago, pardon me

2014
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:46,640
And you know, I'm playing catch-up at this stage, but you know what? I don't care. I'm not paying full price. It's fucking ridiculous

2015
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:49,440
As long as you've got fun stuff to play now anyway

2016
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,160
That's that's it

2017
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:51,440
I mean

2018
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:55,320
I'll have a good I have a good collection as it is and I've kept some of the really old ones and

2019
02:41:55,360 --> 02:42:00,920
Hope to play through and buy the rest of the sequels in the next you do five five years something like that

2020
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:05,080
You could spend your entire life playing classic games and be totally satisfied

2021
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:09,200
I mean look at the classic game of the week segment we do here on olr. We've been doing yeah

2022
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:14,440
I was actually pleased you actually brought up Street Fighter because I'm a big fan and I got the Capcom classics collection

2023
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:17,520
I played the shit out of that. So yeah, thanks for bringing that up this

2024
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,440
We started that episode what 250 because it replaced your website of the week that we used to do

2025
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,360
So that was about 250 and now it's 452

2026
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:32,180
So you've done at least covered at least 200 and then some classic games and I still have plenty to go still plenty to go

2027
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:37,480
I mean if you there's a wall of shelves behind my desk at home

2028
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:42,680
That is literally loaded with video games and that's not even all of it brag brag brag

2029
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:51,320
Have you actually got through most of them or are you waiting to play through them and kind of use one as game of the

2030
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:54,160
Week at some stage. We've we've actually gone through most of them

2031
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:56,280
I mean a lot of the games that my husband and I picked up

2032
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:01,960
Our games that we knew played when we were younger. He was a big Sega guy and I was a big Nintendo girl

2033
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:05,440
So when we got together we both had those that you know

2034
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:07,720
The love of our systems and brought them together

2035
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:14,460
So we go back and now though we have like staples that we play but we'll pick up something every so often

2036
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:19,380
Just because we've just had the biggest boner to play it like yeah

2037
02:43:19,380 --> 02:43:25,960
I went on a mad buzz about maybe two three years ago, and I decided fuck this. I have a dream cast

2038
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:31,520
I'm gonna buy games for I got Jet Set Radio and Shenmue and I was like, okay, I don't regret this one

2039
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,120
But I mean, I thought it was gonna be like oh god these games

2040
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:37,040
Why did I buy these but I actually enjoyed them and I love play

2041
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:41,400
I played them again and again and again every time I visit my mom's house where she keep all that

2042
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:45,960
She keeps my old room and I have all the dreamcast. I still have some ps2 games in there

2043
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:48,600
So it's like a little a little fucking

2044
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:52,320
Hermit's cave where I go back and just play games for the weekend or whatever

2045
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:55,920
I've been tempted to hook up the dreamcast because I actually want to finish grandia too

2046
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:00,000
Wow, that's a fun RPG

2047
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:06,480
Well pork chop. I have I have absolutely loved having you on the show because I love accents

2048
02:44:06,480 --> 02:44:10,480
So I appreciate you calling in but it's it's it's going over a little bit

2049
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:14,080
So I got to wrap up to get some more calls. Do you quickly have any other final thoughts?

2050
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:18,320
Just basically all I love the station. I love all games

Thanks guys all this. All right. Take care

2055
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:37,840
Love it the international orange lounge radio and I'm even being asked in our chat room

2056
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:40,720
I think I'm saying this name right delighter in our term says

2057
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:47,280
Rob is very fond of the Irish. I take it. It's I get mistaken as Irish all the time

2058
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:50,920
I can't do that red hair. Well, it's look at that that little get-up

2059
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:57,480
I wore to whom loud with a hat and everything. I did look kind of Irish even I'll admit that I am actually by heritage

2060
02:44:57,480 --> 02:45:02,440
I am half Scottish. So I look very Scottish. Am I that means that you greet people by head-butting them

2061
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:06,840
My real name is Dutch. So I have a little more in common with sill

2062
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:10,040
girls gone Wow

2063
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:16,460
Dutch ancestry you did your husband has a very it's funny that you have a Dutch name now

2064
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:22,080
I have a Dutch name, but none of my blood kin are remotely Dutch. All right, we got another call on the line

2065
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,120
So let's go to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2066
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:30,000
Hi, this is Stan. Hey Stan, what's up, buddy? Hey, I was just calling about

2067
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:38,120
This intimate evening with Nobuo Matsu that I had a couple nights ago. Wait. Wait now, we don't need to hear about your

2068
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:40,880
romantic

2069
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:46,880
That's actually the name. Well, that was the name of the little concert that he had. It was kind of dirty. Yeah, yeah. Shut up.

2070
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:51,680
Hey, don't tell me to shut up. It's my show. All right. Yeah, okay

2071
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:56,560
No, but it was just this really small concert with there was just 150 people

2072
02:45:57,200 --> 02:46:03,520
It was Nobuo Matsu and Arne Roth who's this conductor in Chicago and it had this string quartet playing

2073
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:09,520
uh dark world from final fantasy 6 and this new string quartet arrangement of

2074
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:16,400
Fight with Seymour from final fantasy 10 and it sounded really good and I really I was really excited about it

2075
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:19,760
So, of course, I I had my phone on me and I tried, you know

2076
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:23,840
Sneaking my my camera on and I recorded the whole concert and I tried

2077
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:26,480
on YouTube

2078
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:30,320
Actually that sounds like you know what it was no it was worth it

2079
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:35,680
I'm, sorry, it was the piracy the jail time was where it is going to be worth it because it was so good

2080
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:40,640
I need to know but you know what? No, well the when the the songs were done I turned around to see you know

2081
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:44,640
You know people climbing and stuff and the people had their camera right in front of their face

2082
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:48,000
They were being very obvious about us. I was like whatever I was gonna say

2083
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,840
I don't feel bad anymore an intimate evening in cell block five with stan

2084
02:46:55,280 --> 02:47:00,400
Here's the thing though, uh, how did you get into this concert if it's only 150 people

2085
02:47:00,400 --> 02:47:06,960
Um, it was being advertised I don't remember where it was being advertised but a friend of mine posted this this link on facebook

2086
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:13,760
And I saw it said intimate evening with nobel mozzo. I read the description about how there's a limited seating and you get this

2087
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:17,920
There's a meet and greet. Actually. This is what happened with the what do you get with the concert you get?

2088
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:22,800
Well, he came out arnie roth came out and introduced and said hi and everything

2089
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:28,160
Then he had nobel mozzo came out and then the orchestra came and played and then you know

2090
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:30,960
the orchestra came and played and then there was a

2091
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:34,880
Q&A session and then the whole audience got to do a meet and greet

2092
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:40,560
Yeah, that's what you got with the concert. It was actually really good. That's awesome. So you got to get stuff signed and everything too

2093
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:47,200
Hello, did you get to get yes, I think

2094
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:52,640
I got my 3ds signed by nobel and arnie. It's really cool. That's awesome

2095
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:58,000
So I think there's there's a little bit of lag going on. Yes. Hold on, please. Nope. Oh

2096
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:02,480
Anyway, okay. I'm sorry. Hello. That's it. Hi you with us

2097
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:09,840
Yeah, i'm so sorry. I'm on my phone. Oh, that's all right. I didn't get I didn't get to do that test number thing

2098
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:15,920
I couldn't remember it. It's all good echo one, two, three, but that's okay. You're cool. Uh, oh, yeah, that's right. Okay 3ds

2099
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:20,080
So yeah, I got to meet you got your 3ds. Oh, yeah, he signed my 3ds. Mm-hmm

2100
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:23,920
Mm-hmm. So now I got to take a picture with him

2101
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,560
Oh cool, and then I asked

2102
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:28,800
I asked arnie roth

2103
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,440
If he would ever consider having an amateur musician sit down session

2104
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:42,080
Reading the actual orchestral music being able to experience the orchestra feel by being inside it

2105
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:45,920
By paying like a small fee and he was actually really interested in the idea. Well

2106
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:52,080
That's what he told me, but it sounded really cool because I really wanted to play, you know, final fantasy music

2107
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:59,120
In an orchestral setting with arnie roth and nobu playing or conducting. I figured that'd be really really cool

2108
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:04,400
That sounds like a heck of an experience and there's obviously lots of band nerds who are video game

2109
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:06,960
And I say that endearingly because I was a band nerd in high school

2110
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:09,120
There's lots of band nerds and video game nerds

2111
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:14,080
Uh that you know are kind of into both those worlds that I think would just get the ultimate kick out of that

2112
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:16,800
But now i'm gonna have to ask you. What do you what do you play in the orchestra?

2113
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:20,660
Oh, um, actually nothing I play saxophone

2114
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:24,480
So I wouldn't even be able to do this. So does dark soccer

2115
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,040
Dark soccer is a

2116
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:36,480
So, well, you know even okay, here's the thing though, even if you couldn't uh play the final fantasy music as part of the jam

2117
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:40,800
What you could do is when the time's right you could just be there in the back and you can just bust out with this

2118
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,800
This

2119
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,800
There you go do your nice be the epic sax guy

2120
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:53,440
All right, sweet

2121
02:49:53,440 --> 02:49:55,440
beatbox guy

2122
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,080
All right, stan i'm gonna have to let you go because the connection's a little bit shit, but that's not your fault

2123
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:06,640
Don't worry about it. Uh, thank you for sharing your experience. Um, please share the pictures online on twitter's or something so we can see them

2125
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:13,280
And I would like to see the bootlegs. I'd like to see the bootlegs very much

2126
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:20,080

Take care. I think we're breaking up. Have a good one. Good night. Thank you. Bye. Bye

2128
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:31,440
All right bummer about the connection, but hey it happens. What can you do? All right

2129
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:34,960
Um, let's see if I can wrap up these twitter topics. I'm gonna go ahead and close skype for the night

2130
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:38,080
Thank you guys so much for calling in. I really appreciate it

2131
02:50:38,320 --> 02:50:43,440
Sorry to those that didn't get through but uh, try again next week or of course you can always send us an email

2132
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:47,060
Again, that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

2133
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:52,080
Uh, oh shit, I was actually out of tweets. I guess I could do one more

2134
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:54,560
I'll let tiger claw have one more because this is pretty good

2135
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:58,160
Uh, so we'll do this other link from tiger claw here who sent us a link

2136
02:50:58,700 --> 02:51:03,520
Retired nfl players are getting the green light for a lawsuit against ea

2137
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:04,560
Okay

2138
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:09,520
Maybe you didn't hear but retired nfl players actually filed a lawsuit against ea

2139
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:13,120
a california judge rejected ea's, uh

2140
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:20,960
Case to have the whole thing dismissed. Um, they want to turn this into a class action lawsuit. So six thousand

2141
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:29,700
Various retired players can be represented the alleged lawsuit here is that ea through ea sports brand used the likenesses

2142
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:34,420
Without consent in multiple madden nfl games over the years

2143
02:51:34,820 --> 02:51:39,860
Ea says it was basically fair use and real names were never used

2144
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:41,700
hmm

2145
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:47,860
Uh ea's madden games though. They have a lot of historic teams that use stats attributes and other factors for fantasy players

2146
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:52,820
They're close to the real life counterparts, but uh not exact

2147
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:55,620
Or so ea claims

2148
02:51:55,620 --> 02:52:00,980
So I don't play these games. So it's hard for me to take an opinion on this one way or the other

2149
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:06,820
But uh, the judge certainly felt they had a case so it could be very interesting to see how this plays out

2150
02:52:08,180 --> 02:52:10,680
That's it for our tweets tonight twitter.com

2151
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:15,780
Olr, but that also brings us to the end of the show

2152
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:20,820
Uh, but not before I ask for any last minute stories from loki or dark sakura. I'm good

2153
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:25,780
Good meh. All right. Well shit. We're done then we're out. Let's uh do a last minute

2154
02:52:25,940 --> 02:52:28,340
Uh, let me do my last minute kind of plea here

2155
02:52:28,660 --> 02:52:32,900
We are of course a free show and uh, we do this every week for nothing

2156
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:36,340
We don't charge you guys. We don't have ads in the show or ads on our website

2157
02:52:36,660 --> 02:52:40,580
All we ask is that you tell a friend or two or 50 about the show

2158
02:52:40,980 --> 02:52:47,080
Help us spread the word by leaving a nice review on a website such as itunes or wherever you found this podcast

2159
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:54,440
Or help tell people and spread the word about olr because you'll help our little olr me grow and we really appreciate it

2160
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:00,760
Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight loki. Why don't you start us off? I think it's ironic that

2161
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:08,120
Volition or thq or saints rose, uh, april fool's show was for new new thing a dlc

2162
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:10,520
That actually sounded cooler than a dlc that they put out

2163
02:53:10,520 --> 02:53:17,640
Uh, haha, if joke's on you your dlc sucked and I didn't buy the last two bits of it also read ready player one

2164
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:21,080
You can do it. You won't you won't be able to put it down

2165
02:53:22,040 --> 02:53:25,960
Uh, my final thought for tonight is uh, i'm excited that it's taco night

2166
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:29,880
Uh, because it's sure to be better than that shit taco. I had at chevy's on monday

2167
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:34,440
Just saying that was a pretty who puts fucking mayonnaise on a taco what?

2168
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:36,280
Right

2169
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:41,480
Right. It was cilantro mayonnaise is gross hated it

2170
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Dark sakura, how about your final thought?

2171
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:46,200
um

2172
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:48,200
I really have to give uh

2173
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,520
the uh

2174
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:52,520
April fool's award to uh google

2175
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:56,920
For google quest. Yeah, we didn't even bring that up tonight, but that was amazing

2176
02:53:57,160 --> 02:54:01,160
That was great. And I love the little commercial blowing in the cartridge and everything

2177
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:08,680
I loved the easter eggs of like the little landmarks being and there's a whole list on reddit of like all the different

2178
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,760
Hidden landmarks. It's great

2179
02:54:11,160 --> 02:54:15,720
I loved it. They used all the dragon quest art in it. Yeah, it was awesome and um

2180
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:18,840
the youtube collection

2181
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:21,240
Oh, yes, I saw that. That was great

2182
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,400
All right. Well, that's it guys. Thank you so much for tuning in to orange laundry

2183
02:54:25,400 --> 02:54:29,400
We'll be back another week and next week. It won't be april fools anymore

2184
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:31,400
So it'll be a little more serious

2185
02:54:31,960 --> 02:54:35,000
But uh, we can still be a little silly tonight, right?

2186
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:37,000
Have a good night

2187
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:41,800

2191
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:02,620
Duh, god damn

2192
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:09,100
Ow my foot. Why did I shoot myself in my foot? Oh my god, it hurts so bad

2193
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:14,460
No my foot I need that for walking

2194
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:19,900
Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like giving birth sucks and i'm never going to do it

2195
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:24,940
Wait, that's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell's the point?

2196
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:29,420
It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there

2197
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:35,100
I mean

2198
02:55:35,100 --> 02:55:37,100
I don't see the point

2199
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:43,020
