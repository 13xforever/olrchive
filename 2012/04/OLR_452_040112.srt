39
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I already ate it, and unfortunately the burger was non-edible.

40
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,854

41
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:49,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it was non-edible.

42
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,557
[SPEAKER_13]: I only ate about a quarter of it, and it was terrible.

43
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:54,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to hear that.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

70
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

71
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:37,003
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a real feat because he's dead.

72
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, right?

73
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,765
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like from the great beyond.

74
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,707
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, what's that crying under the ground?

75
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Did someone bury a baby down there?

76
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 452.

77
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:56,858
[SPEAKER_14]: For those April the 1st of 2012, I can't help but feel there's something about today, like something special I was supposed to remember.

78
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,139
[SPEAKER_14]: But, oh well, whatever.

79
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:05,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyhow, we're here in studio, chilling out to Dynamite Rave, which always makes me think of your freestyle routine, Loki.

80
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the one I forgot.

81
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, ah, fuck it, I'm walking off.

82
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,907
[SPEAKER_14]: You got up on stage, you just fucking froze.

83
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:18,892
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I didn't freeze, I just like, I forgot it about halfway through, and I'm like, eh, fuck it.

84
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,333
[SPEAKER_13]: What did the judges score you on that, when you did that?

85
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:21,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even remember.

86
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:22,694
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like a three.

87
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:23,835
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like long ago.

88
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Would have been better if you hadn't used Mirror.

89
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:26,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

90
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:27,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

91
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

92
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, how are you doing, DarkSakura?

93
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a burrito.

94
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:36,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you?

95
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, I'm going to have tea.

96
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you were doing this whole fasting thing.

97
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I'm having tea.

98
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,550
[SPEAKER_14]: See, Alan is being kind enough.

99
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:51,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight was going to be Taco Festiva here at Studio OLR, and he's been kind enough to postpone that until the show's over.

100
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

101
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:55,118
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

102
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,820
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,654
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I mean, we're not going to talk about Frogger on this show.

104
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you miss the part about it's Bomani?

105
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:22,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I understand that, but, you know, they like to throw out those Frogger anniversaries.

106
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,823
[SPEAKER_13]: We're celebrating the 23rd anniversary of Frogger.

107
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:25,804
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, no one fucking cares.

108
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:32,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe there will be a version of DDR where little frogs will show up on the little arrow pads and you can step on them to kill them.

109
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,932
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be... I'd play that.

110
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:36,814
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like that spider stomp.

111
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:38,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

112
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,110
[SPEAKER_13]: and I have witnessed the spider stomp freestyle routine.

113
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,152
[SPEAKER_13]: That was interesting.

114
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:48,054
[SPEAKER_14]: How did the spider stomp freestyle routine go down?

115
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,936
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Explicit that did it, I believe.

116
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,898
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty awesome.

117
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:55,799
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

118
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it Explicit?

119
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:57,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember now.

120
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it an explicit routine?

121
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I've seen some of those in my years of DDR festivas and so forth.

122
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:05,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.

123
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:09,214
[SPEAKER_13]: It was something that came out when we went to play QZAR.

124
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:14,499
[SPEAKER_14]: How does a spider stomp freestyle work?

125
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:15,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand.

126
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,362
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like DDR, but spider stomp.

127
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Step on the glowing bubbles.

128
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,609
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

129
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:25,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

130
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just remembering working in the arcade and having a spider stomp.

131
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a spider stomp at... We did.

132
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:32,273
[SPEAKER_10]: In Alabama?

133
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:33,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever it was you were?

134
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,515
[SPEAKER_10]: When I worked at Cyber Station, we had a spider stomp.

135
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really good at spider stomp.

136
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:39,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

137
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:41,439
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, ladies first

138
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:12,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, Friday, actually Thursday, I called my friend's new boss and said, hey, I'd like to work there.

[SPEAKER_10]: and send me your resume.

00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:50,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they match them up with different levels of compatibility?

152
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Ironically, they actually go through a recruiting service.

153
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:00,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you're 80% compatible for this job and maybe only 60%.

154
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, you're homosexual.

155
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:03,394
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot apply.

156
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:08,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Not true because they have a service called Compatible Partners now because they got sued into it.

157
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:13,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, so I got to send them a rejection letter.

158
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,080
[SPEAKER_10]: The eHarmony people.

159
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,521
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you go about writing a rejection letter?

160
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you really supposed to be talking about what company you said no to?

161
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:19,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.

162
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure they don't listen to this show.

163
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:23,927
[SPEAKER_10]: If they do, sorry.

164
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:29,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I regret to inform you that I have chosen a more qualified position with another company.

165
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,114
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I said, they're paying me more.

166
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:37,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, better work, more challenging, more what I'm looking for.

167
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me money.

168
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, we're not a match.

169
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:39,880
Bye.

170
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,411
[SPEAKER_14]: You stood up, eHarmony.

171
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,451
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

172
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:51,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, honestly, eHarmony, judging everything, they just seemed like a fantastic company to work for.

173
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:54,677
[SPEAKER_10]: The working from home thing would have been cool, but I have bills.

174
00:13:55,798 --> 00:14:00,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, I need to get out of the house.

175
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,701
[SPEAKER_14]: How long has the job dry spell been going on now?

176
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,622
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a little bit, right?

177
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:32,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been bad for a lot of people I got laid off November 2010 Oh wow So yeah, it's been a while But here's the funny thing I will be working with my BFF Becky We worked at the same last job That's not a recipe for disaster or anything No, because we know how to behave in a professional environment We're doing two different jobs on top of that It's going to be nice Very cool Loki, how was your week?

178
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:33,322
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

179
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:39,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Mainly this week, it was just kind of, I don't know, back to work.

180
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:46,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Because last week I was off a couple days to watch Josh while Nellie was going to the doctor and stuff.

181
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:50,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, what else did I do?

182
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Slept.

183
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

184
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,193
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't sleep that much, actually.

185
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,514
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was pretty much...

186
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:03,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we saw the Hunger Games last week.

187
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I already talked about that, though.

188
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:12,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelly went and saw the Bodyguard in theaters.

189
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,410
[SPEAKER_13]: What?! !

190
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:30,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because they had one night, it was the 20th anniversary of The Bodyguard, and so she went and saw it in theaters, and she said that the sound mix was horrible, that when they, I guess, remastered it, they remastered it in a tin can, and so it just sounded very tinny.

191
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Does this mean that they're coming out with a new Blu-ray or something?

192
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it came out on Tuesday, actually, and she wants that.

193
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:38,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis

194
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:23,675
[SPEAKER_13]: which is being written by Seth MacFarlane it's about a guy who wishes for his teddy bear to come alive on Christmas and then he does and so he has this walking talking teddy bear but now he's grown up and so there's this teddy bear that's with him that's just like this boozing prostitute sleeping with you know druggy teddy bear I'm like I'm not sure how I feel about

195
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:24,635
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

196
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:40,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I read a book, y'all.

197
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:42,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I read a book.

198
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I read a book from start to finish.

199
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,720
[SPEAKER_14]: You can read?

200
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

201
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:47,061
[SPEAKER_14]: I can.

202
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:48,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And I read a book.

203
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I read a book in like four days.

204
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51,226
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it only took me about four days.

205
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I read The Hunger Games.

206
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

207
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:56,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm disappointed.

208
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't I give you a copy of Ready Player One?

209
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:00,896
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

210
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:04,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then I'm going to give you a copy of Ready Player One.

211
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to read that.

212
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,401
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'll read Ready Player One.

213
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,062
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you both a copy of Ready Player One.

214
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:08,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet.

215
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,944
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't know why I read The Hunger Games.

216
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yes, I know it's a movie and all that stuff.

217
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God, I heard.

218
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:19,391
[SPEAKER_14]: But all my friends are reading it and just raving and raving about it and won't shut up about what a good book it is.

219
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:20,613
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm like, fine, I'll check it out.

220
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:21,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try it.

221
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I read the whole thing start to finish and it wasn't bad.

222
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:26,477
[SPEAKER_14]: So what did I do the day after I read The Hunger Games?

223
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:27,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Went and saw the movie.

224
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:50,525
[SPEAKER_14]: and seeing the movie with everything so fresh in my mind was it was easy for me to pick out everything that really bugged me about what they changed from the book and even Alan commented like I could tell every time they changed something from the book because I would just hear this deep sigh coming from over where you're at yeah but I think according to my wife she said that actually the movie is better than the book

225
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, they're different.

226
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:54,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to say one is better than the other.

227
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:55,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they were both good.

228
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:56,839
[SPEAKER_14]: They were both good in their own way.

229
00:17:56,939 --> 00:18:10,185
[SPEAKER_14]: But because they moved, the biggest problem, quote unquote, with the translation is that because the book is first person and the movie's third person, there's a lot they have to do differently because you're not inside her head.

230
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:16,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have to use a lot of these other scenes to kind of explain what's going on because she can't do it in her head for you.

231
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,209
[SPEAKER_14]: So seeing these extra scenes was a little weird.

232
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:20,630
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Battle Royale wasn't necessarily totally original either!

234
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:43,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh!

235
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:03,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just a little offended that you would read the book for the Hunger Games, but you didn't read Battle Royale.

236
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I did try to read Battle Royale, but it was kind of boring.

237
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:06,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

238
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:14,683
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was telling a friend this, is that if I'm not in the exact right mood when I'm reading a book, then I'm going to squirrel, do something else.

239
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Like my ADD is so bad.

240
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,284
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll try to read Battle Royale.

241
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,485
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because you can't read.

242
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,086
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because you weren't reading Ready Player One.

243
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:22,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that.

244
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:23,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that.

245
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:39,334
[SPEAKER_14]: so but I liked um of course I liked Battle Royale I'm not dogging on Battle Royale it's a fine movie and hell many years ago on this show we used to talk about you know didn't we start off one show with a paper plate Battle Royale one night I seem to remember it was really funny and stupid

246
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,816
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura is not in the room right now and I want to wait for her to get back so we can do the news.

247
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:44,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

248
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:27,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know I've been very kind of much a homebody I didn't get a new job this week I've been at the same job for 10 years but I like my jobs it's okay so I we went to the movies yesterday then we went out to Chinese food which was good this is great radio in that yeah

249
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:32,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think maybe I should do a break song and then we'll come back and we'll talk about what's going on in the news this week?

250
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:34,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

251
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,755
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to do a quick break.

252
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:39,598
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to come back and we'll talk about what is in the news this week.

253
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,579
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of stuff, so stay tuned, guys.

254
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,960
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

255
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:04,761
[SPEAKER_04]: In the city where the sound sign shines, that person left a shadow and disappeared.

256
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:07,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly, goodbye, I loved you, I realized at that time.

257
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:11,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Memories are in dreams, I wake up when I forget them.

258
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

259
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:33,478
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

260
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, we're back.

261
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,661
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's all better.

262
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:18,961
[SPEAKER_14]: She's back joining us.

263
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:21,682
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't stink up the bathroom, did you?

264
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:22,302
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

265
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:24,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

266
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,792
[SPEAKER_10]: If you must know, iPad2P, thank you.

267
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, la la la la, TMI.

268
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:32,015
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so news.

269
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:39,281
[SPEAKER_14]: There's lots and lots of Bomani news going on this week because Konami had a surprise Kisanera event, which, surprise, we weren't invited to.

270
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:40,382
[SPEAKER_14]: What a shock.

271
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:41,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

272
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

273
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:22,877
[SPEAKER_14]: which as you know is the name for it over in Europe but they've also used this in Japan before for artist exclusive games and they're going back to that like when was the last Dancing Stage game we had Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True yeah was it I couldn't remember if Dreams Come True or True Kiss Destination one of them was back in like 99 or 2000 what which for the record I found my copy of that

274
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,978
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:23:45,410 --> 00:24:01,734
[SPEAKER_14]: of course right so it just made sense that she's gonna get her own dancing stage game now we don't know all the songs that are gonna be in it but we do know Bad Romance is in it because that was the song that they demoed in the trailer which makes sense do you think Bad Romance would be a tough DDR song do you think that'll be like a seven or an eight or a nine or what

276
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:17,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I put it at a 7 I could see them doing some runs If I remember correctly, I believe the True Kiss, Destination, and the Dreams Come True stuff Those songs weren't that hard I think it was like 6 and 7 were the highest Because it's more of the casual

277
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:19,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Paragaga

278
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:42,089
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to do that.

279
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:43,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so on board with this idea.

280
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Paragaga, come on.

281
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:47,175
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to do something like that.

282
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:49,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Or how about the other game, Paraparagaga.

283
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:50,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

284
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if this one does very well.

285
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:55,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Now what's weird is that they haven't talked about any home releases for this.

286
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,352
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is like an arcade exclusive thing.

287
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,534
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's usually how it works.

288
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,116
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll have a home release later on.

289
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:02,337
[SPEAKER_13]: True.

290
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:06,881
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll just dump it into the engine of a Dance Dance Revolution game or something like that.

291
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:07,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that makes sense.

292
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:16,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Now this is really weird because did the other Dancing Stage games have a couple songs from other artists, like a couple Konami originals in it?

293
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:28,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember because I found this really weird there is actually a Katy Perry song in this game too California Girls is apparently going to be playable in this game it's in the press release but it's only available in basic mode

294
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:30,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

295
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Something about Katy Perry is only basic.

296
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,891
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only available in basic.

297
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:37,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Go figure.

298
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:42,435
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be a very casual, relaxed song, but I could definitely see some freestyle to that.

299
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:45,977
[SPEAKER_14]: I could definitely see Wendell busting out a California Girl.

300
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:53,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps they're going even so far as to say, you know how they did with some of the other mixes where they'll have a preview of the following mix?

301
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:57,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they're previewing the Katy Perry version or

302
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:58,103
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd say seven.

303
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:26,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't care.

304
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:27,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really?

305
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:32,937
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hey, more Dancing Stage DDR mixes are a good thing, I guess, so I'll give it a 5.

306
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:39,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give it an 11, because there's nothing in the world I love more than DDR and Lady Gaga, so there you go.

307
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:42,862
[SPEAKER_13]: What if it was RuPaul's?

308
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:46,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Dancing Stage featuring RuPaul's Drag Race.

309
00:26:46,844 --> 00:26:48,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Dancing Stage featuring ABBA.

310
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:49,406
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.

311
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:51,427
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a 12 if it was Dancing Stage featuring ABBA.

312
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:54,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, didn't you say that you would get a PS3 when an ABBA game came out?

313
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:57,071
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure enough, SingStar ABBA came out and guess what I got?

314
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:57,571
[SPEAKER_14]: PS3.

315
00:26:57,831 --> 00:27:01,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you ever pick up the ABBA You Can Dance?

316
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:02,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did.

317
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,436
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

318
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,817
[SPEAKER_14]: If we were hooked up to do it, I would play it live on air tonight.

319
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,038
[SPEAKER_14]: But sadly, we're not.

320
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:10,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, darn.

321
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,640
[SPEAKER_14]: What a bummer.

322
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,862
[SPEAKER_10]: That was seriously the happiest moment of my life.

323
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:14,983
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

324
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:16,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Watching me play that?

325
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:21,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Watching you do the ballet-style stuff for The Winner Takes It All.

326
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,531
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the best thing I've ever seen.

327
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,151
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

328
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:31,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's move on to the other big piece of news from the Konami Kisanera event that had to do with Bomani.

329
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:35,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And this kind of was a surprise because you guys know we've been saying this on the show for years.

330
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,940
[SPEAKER_14]: This...

331
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Series was really underrated.

332
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:40,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of people gave this series a lot of shit.

333
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:42,364
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was actually really good if you play it.

334
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right.

335
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:51,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the game that is announced, Rock Revolution 2 has been announced.

336
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:51,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

337
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were talking about a good series.

338
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:57,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Rock Revolution 2 was announced for consoles and arcade.

339
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:00,235
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I guess it's kind of like a reboot.

340
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:04,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, if it's arcades, then they're probably just renaming Guitar Freaks to Armenia.

341
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:04,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

342
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:05,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

343
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're trying to Americanize it a little bit, or maybe they ran out of mixed numbers.

344
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be what they did.

345
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:11,514
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Konami.

346
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:13,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they'll ever run out of mixed numbers.

347
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:14,536
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is interesting.

348
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami is actually thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different here.

349
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:24,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Rock Revolution 2, the console versions, will link up to the arcades using Konami's transferring.

350
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're actually going to be able to take your unlocks...

351
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:28,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

352
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:55,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Could I play, would this allow me to play GWAR in the arcade, yes or no?

353
00:28:55,716 --> 00:29:11,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, maybe, it would probably be something more like, you know, you could take your ranked, like say you score something, like a high score on a song and you can take that to the arcade and take it home and that way it's still linked to your, you know, Konami profile or whatever.

354
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:14,574
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, you're awfully quiet.

355
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Does the prospect of a Rock Revolution 2 excite you?

356
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:43,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

357
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:43,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

358
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I didn't play the Rock Revolution 1.

359
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:47,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I was too busy.

360
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's time to catch up.

361
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been too busy with Parapara lately.

362
00:29:53,464 --> 00:30:01,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So anything new right now is just sort of like, but I want to wave my arms and wear pink and, you know, platform boots.

363
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:02,652
[SPEAKER_14]: And who doesn't?

364
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:12,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if they keep up with... I like the transferring element to it.

365
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:14,829
[SPEAKER_10]: That can make it exciting.

366
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,453
[SPEAKER_10]: But I still would have to wait for judging the final...

367
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:27,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All we have are these fluffy press releases and things to go off of.

368
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't really want to get excited until I see something.

369
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, some folks in our chat room, which, by the way, I still have not plugged the chat room.

370
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:37,407
[SPEAKER_14]: We are no longer on Calibamani.com, so don't go there.

371
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:39,749
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to go to chat.orangelandreda.com.

372
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:40,689
[SPEAKER_14]: That changed recently.

373
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,650
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not on Calibamani.

374
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,212
[SPEAKER_14]: It's chat.orangelandreda.com, so check that out.

375
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:48,175
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tigerclaw says, will Rock Revolution 2 have Kinect support on the 360?

376
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:48,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

377
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:49,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

378
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,762
[SPEAKER_14]: It's certainly possible.

379
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:52,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything's possible.

380
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:54,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see it.

381
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Konami's done some Kinect-enabled games recently, so why not?

382
00:30:59,387 --> 00:30:59,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

383
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:00,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

384
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:06,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I was curious what Harmonix was going to do in response to this, and it looks like Harmonix is cutting them off.

385
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:07,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you notice this?

386
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Harmonix released this today.

387
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you guys see this?

388
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:11,694
[SPEAKER_14]: This is pretty amazing.

389
00:31:11,754 --> 00:31:12,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Product not yet rated.

390
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:16,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for our rock band party.

391
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

392
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:19,099
[SPEAKER_02]: No way, guys!

393
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got something brand new!

394
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,100
Woo!

395
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rock Band Board Game!

396
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:37,252
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right!

397
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:41,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Rock Band Board Game is the newest game from Harmonix Musical Systems.

398
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:46,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Featuring all the fun and authenticity of rock band without the hassle of big bulky instruments.

399
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:50,181
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that seems like a dig a little bit at Konami.

400
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the whole, like, you don't need instruments for this.

401
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:53,364
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a dig.

402
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And Board Game, who would have thought?

403
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:59,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami advancing technology with transferring and all this stuff.

404
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Harmonix scaling back.

405
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,211
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

406
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:22,989
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very true.

407
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,410
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, actually, let me explain.

408
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see the dice?

409
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I got face screwed!

410
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:32,755
[SPEAKER_18]: The Rock Band board game has a larger song library than any other rhythm action board game!

411
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:37,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

412
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:38,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Setlist challenge!

413
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Draw three random song cards.

414
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it ain't so!

415
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:43,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Tubular!

416
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it ain't so!

417
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:46,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Again!

418
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:47,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

419
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:49,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it ain't so!

420
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:56,219
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I do notice Say It Ain't So, I end up playing that an awful lot in Rock Band.

421
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully they'll put out a patch to just, you know, it's not that I hate that song.

422
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you should pick another song.

423
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:04,366
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you've played this enough.

424
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

425
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:07,549
[SPEAKER_18]: The Rock Band features you've come to love.

426
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,891
[SPEAKER_18]: The party will never stop rocking.

427
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Features like Character Creator.

428
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:14,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Auto-calibration!

429
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:39,039
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very interesting watching the different directions these two companies go in.

430
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So Rock Revolution 2, how amazing is this news on a scale of 1 to 10?

431
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:44,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

432
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It all depends on how good it is.

433
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:52,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because it could be very terrible or it could be very good.

434
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:53,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

435
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:55,264
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not ready to rate it yet.

436
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:56,184
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

437
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:56,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

438
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:57,144
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura?

439
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to say a 6 for my excitement level.

440
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll wait and see.

441
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:06,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to give it a nine because I'm just excited that Rock Revolution is coming back.

442
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:07,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited.

443
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:10,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And this whole thing sounds like it's going to be amazing and push technology forward.

444
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,590
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, one more story we've got to cover tonight.

445
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,774
[SPEAKER_14]: This did not come out of the event, but oh my God, it was like timed at the exact same time.

446
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:17,534
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.

447
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't say anything about it either.

448
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:19,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

449
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:20,316
[SPEAKER_14]: What is up with that?

450
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You're supposed to be like our inside scoop to this.

451
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:23,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I had an NDA.

452
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

453
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:26,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck your NDA.

454
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:27,824
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to go to Las Vegas again.

455
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:28,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, alright.

456
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:29,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is, you guys.

457
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:33,010
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Freak Extreme has been announced.

458
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:33,551
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

459
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:34,292
[SPEAKER_14]: A press release.

460
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:40,659
[SPEAKER_14]: J-Dog, the owner of DDRFreak.com, of course, put out a press release this week that simply said, we are starting over.

461
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,581
[SPEAKER_14]: and they are going to relaunch DDR Freak.

462
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,622
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be DDRFreakExtreme.com.

463
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:53,325
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be an upgraded Machine Locations database that will have Google Maps integration with it, which I think that's smart, right?

464
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:54,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything's on Google Maps now.

465
00:34:55,146 --> 00:35:00,188
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're going to have brand new forums because the forums were starting to be a little bit of a problem, right, DarkSakura?

466
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,008
[SPEAKER_14]: You were a moderate, yeah?

467
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:08,843
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're going to do brand new forums, and what they're doing, they're actually going to let random topics have their own sub-forums.

468
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:15,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Wolf Game is now going to have its own sub-forum, and Pornography Post will have its own sub-forum.

469
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:24,587
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a code written into the PHPBB that's going to allow any of those external sites that like to traffic through forums.

470
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:26,228
[SPEAKER_10]: They all just go directly there.

471
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:27,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's great.

472
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:28,329
[SPEAKER_14]: It's their own forum.

473
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,812
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, because when I think, where am I going to go to get porno links?

474
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:33,213
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR free.

475
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:37,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's also for the Goat's Apex and the Bukkake and everything.

476
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:37,797
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

477
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:38,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Lemon Party?

478
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:39,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Will there be like a sub-sub forum?

479
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there will be.

480
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:43,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Two girls, one cup reaction videos?

481
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:47,025
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have to have a moderator for that with a very strong stomach.

482
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:47,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

483
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, how did you audition people for that?

484
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Who ended up getting that?

485
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,550
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

486
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:11,270
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, awesome.

487
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other thing that is actually going to be that I finally got the okay to talk about.

488
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:19,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, is this like an exclusive?

489
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,937
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be an exclusive.

490
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:25,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Is DDR Freak Radio going to get pissed off because that might be a little weird because, you know, there's the two radio stations.

491
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:31,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was a little talk about they wanted to acquire us.

492
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:32,926
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

493
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:36,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like, we're going to be the official radio station?

494
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:37,670
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going to happen to DDR Freak Radio?

495
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's gone.

496
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:39,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Gone.

497
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:41,930
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

498
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:07,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell yeah, that'd be awesome.

499
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Good idea to get the community back together.

500
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:10,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

501
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,850
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the other thing, too, that is kind of hush-hush.

502
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, ooh, I love exclusives.

503
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:15,072
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Flash.

504
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:16,053
[SPEAKER_14]: What's this?

505
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:17,434
[SPEAKER_10]: That works with a USB dance pad.

506
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:21,794
[SPEAKER_14]: So like integrated into the site?

507
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:22,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

508
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:24,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you do like your own music and stuff?

509
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:25,737
[SPEAKER_10]: That I don't know yet.

510
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:26,758
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still working on licensing.

511
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:27,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

512
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:29,840
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually browse the forums using the dance pad.

513
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:31,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's cool.

514
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,162
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that idea.

515
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:33,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that idea.

516
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:36,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially if you're looking at the porn forums.

517
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:43,950
[SPEAKER_10]: But they've actually done a Kinect hack as well so that you can navigate the site with your Kinect controller.

518
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,292
[SPEAKER_14]: There was the 1.5 release of Kinect on PC.

519
00:37:46,452 --> 00:37:47,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And have full integration.

520
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:55,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So, DDR Freak Extreme, let's go around and rate the importance of that news on a scale of 1 to 10.

521
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,830
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura?

522
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally a 10.

523
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,371
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Freak was the best time I ever had.

524
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:02,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Biased, biased, biased.

525
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:03,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

526
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:03,292
8.

527
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:06,954
[SPEAKER_14]: We always need more places for porn links.

528
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,194
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true, that's true.

529
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:10,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I would normally give it an 8, but the porn forum?

530
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:10,875
9.

531
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,316
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very important, so 9.

532
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:13,776
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

533
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:19,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and you know the other thing, too, is that for people who are offended, they just don't have to click on it.

534
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:20,184
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

535
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:20,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't click it.

536
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:21,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the best thing ever.

537
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And they, oh, oh, I have to tell you about the other form that got added.

538
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:26,455
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

539
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:27,216
[SPEAKER_10]: A lolcat form.

540
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:29,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All little cats.

541
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,327
[SPEAKER_14]: How nice that they've evolved with the rest of the internet.

542
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:32,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

543
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:33,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's great.

544
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:34,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

545
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:35,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm so happy.

546
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to shut my mouth before I let out the whole grid thing.

547
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Will the users that were banned last time still be banned?

548
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,218
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to make them their own forum.

549
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:45,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

550
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:47,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the troll grounds or something.

551
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:48,962
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to call it Hall of the Band.

552
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:49,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

553
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:51,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.

554
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:52,619
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a catchy name.

555
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,801
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, don't go anywhere, guys.

556
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,103
[SPEAKER_14]: We have plenty more show to come.

557
00:38:56,143 --> 00:39:01,588
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the cage match that's coming up in just a little bit, FUs of the Week, and we might just have to play match game.

558
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

559
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,634
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so we'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break.

560
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: April Fools

561
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,724
[SPEAKER_14]: All the stories we talked about, sadly, were fake.

562
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:14,645
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, really, the Konami Kissing Era event, please.

563
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:16,505
[SPEAKER_14]: So we made all that shit up.

564
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:19,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And DDR Freak is... People outside California don't know what those are.

565
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:23,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks in chat generally got excited that DDR Freak was coming back.

566
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

567
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:26,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be mad.

568
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:27,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't sue us.

569
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thoroughly glad I don't have to moderate DDR Freak anymore.

570
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know what?

571
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:37,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have to tell you about a realization that I had.

572
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:38,352
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

573
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:44,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I went back and read on one site the graffiti that they found on the walls in Pompeii.

574
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:54,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And it made me think of the same shit I would see on DDR Freak, which proves to me that in the last however many thousand years, humanity has not grown at all.

575
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,946
[SPEAKER_14]: There were trolls even back in the olden days.

576
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:02,050
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there was one post that said, so and so, like...

577
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Did some girl in the ass here.

578
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And ran away with her brother.

579
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:10,391
[SPEAKER_14]: How naughty.

580
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:13,773
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so anyway, yeah, everything we just did was bull.

581
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:19,936
[SPEAKER_14]: But we thought it would be fun for our... Especially because it's the 10th year of OLR and April Fool's happens to be on a Sunday.

582
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:25,399
[SPEAKER_14]: And look, we're never going to top the giggling lesbian gaming show that we did in 2006, which will always be the best prank we ever did.

583
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,541
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought we'd do that for our little April Fool's gag.

584
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:29,201
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

585
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:37,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, let's get back into the real show because there's been a lot of stuff going on in the gaming world this week that we want to touch on.

586
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:39,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Big, big news.

587
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Rumor news that I think Loki said might take the whole damn show tonight.

588
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:46,775
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to talk about that a little bit as well.

589
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:50,318
[SPEAKER_14]: First, though, the real version of what we do at the top of the show.

590
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:51,859
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your gaming week?

591
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Talking about the video games we've played this week.

592
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:55,542
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, you want to start us off?

593
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:56,763
[SPEAKER_14]: What video games have you been playing this week?

594
00:42:56,803 --> 00:43:02,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at that copy of Mass Effect and then Dan and I talked about it and then I got too busy to play because I was busy getting a job.

595
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:03,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Shame on you.

596
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:04,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I was busy getting a job.

597
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:05,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine.

598
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:08,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess a job will be an acceptable excuse maybe.

599
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play well.

600
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:11,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course you did.

601
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:12,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course I did.

602
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:14,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you have an addiction.

603
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:14,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Dealer.

604
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:16,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

605
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:18,970
[SPEAKER_13]: My gaming week was alright.

606
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't play a whole lot.

607
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Call of Duty.

608
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

609
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:30,099
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I also played... What was it?

610
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:35,023
[SPEAKER_13]: The saxophone game that I posted.

611
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:39,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It's... God, I can't remember now.

612
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:40,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

613
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:45,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so a little internet game.

614
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:48,126
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of fun.

615
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Sax Maniacs?

616
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:52,529
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Epic Sax Game.

617
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,010
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

618
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Based off of the Epic Sax guy from...

619
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

620
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:10,724
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hilarious because it's actually a little music rhythm game and you have to learn how to play that little bit of music there and then you keep playing it over and over and over again.

621
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:12,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, it's fun.

622
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:17,808
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of songs out there that have epic sax solos in them, so hot sax all night long.

623
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:21,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this is specifically the epic sax guy.

624
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,130
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

625
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Specifically.

626
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever seen the original that that came from?

627
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,198
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

628
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:49,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Eurovision.

629
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:53,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It was part of this Eurovision thing.

630
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that that big competition they do that's like American Idol or whatever?

631
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:57,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sort of.

632
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

633
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:01,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind, I know what you're talking about.

634
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:07,287
[SPEAKER_13]: The guy wearing the blue pants and the red gloves who kind of looks like Duke Nukem.

635
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:10,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Hip thrusting to his Epic Sax solo.

636
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:12,070
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an awesome song.

637
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:15,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so that it for your gaming week?

638
00:45:15,658 --> 00:45:16,939
[SPEAKER_13]: That is all I played this week.

639
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been playing that a little, little bit.

640
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise on the consoles, I'm still plucking away at Mass Effect 2.

641
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:49,892
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm about halfway through the game from what Shane tells me.

642
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:54,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I've picked up some of my partners and now I've got a few more.

643
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:57,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I did some events on a planet and it unlocked some more dossiers.

644
00:45:57,736 --> 00:45:59,697
[SPEAKER_14]: For those of you that have played the game, you can kind of tell where I'm at.

645
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:18,316
[SPEAKER_14]: still loving the Mass Effect series the battle system has gotten a little better for me because you might remember last week on the show I was bitching about the battles in Mass Effect 2 compared to 1 but I'm liking it a little more now that I have more abilities I really like that you can kind of take an ability from one of your loyal friends

646
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:19,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

647
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:39,229
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been using that, but Mass Effect 2 is still awesome.

648
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,892
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really about it.

649
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:44,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I play, oh, no, one other game I've got to talk about.

650
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:45,136
[SPEAKER_14]: This is important.

651
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:49,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played this a lot, but I played it a little bit, so I'll talk about it a little bit.

652
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:50,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Kid Icarus Uprising.

653
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:52,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I played some of that, actually.

654
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:52,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I got on the 3DS.

655
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:53,305
[SPEAKER_14]: On my friends.

656
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:53,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

657
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:54,447
[SPEAKER_14]: What'd you think?

658
00:46:54,987 --> 00:46:55,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool.

659
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: The 3D actually works.

660
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:58,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the 3D is great.

661
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,549
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a gorgeous game.

662
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:04,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I was really into the way that it's set up like Super Smash Bros.

663
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:04,831
[SPEAKER_14]: too.

664
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:07,272
[SPEAKER_14]: The menus and everything look just like Super Smash Bros.

665
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the customizing your weapons thing.

666
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:14,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, there's so many little... I mean, you can tell it's designed... I mean, hello, I'm not stupid.

667
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:15,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's the same people that did Smash Bros.

668
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:16,215
[SPEAKER_14]: that did this.

669
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:19,416
[SPEAKER_14]: But it has all those same mini-games.

670
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:48,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Like for Smash Brothers Like, you know, the machine where you put in coins And you can get like an egg You know, that has something special in it The grid of unlocks I mean, there's tons and tons and tons of stuff in the game And I love the air stages in the game It is so awesome It makes me think of Space Harrier Yes, it's beautiful to look at too And I love it when it's on rails and all this Then it gets to the ground stages And it's

671
00:47:49,020 --> 00:48:17,947
[SPEAKER_14]: it's not that I dislike the ground stages but that's where and I think you know any of you that have been reading reviews about the game the controls are not good for the ground stages because you I mean just the way you have to hold the controller you have to move with the little circle pad you shoot with the L button and then you flick on the bottom pad left and right real quick to spin your character left and right and you use it to move your targeter

672
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:21,434
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of a lot going on with that touchscreen.

673
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:23,015
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to hold it very awkward.

674
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:28,599
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, Kid Icarus comes with that stand, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable gaming system.

675
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:30,019
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to kind of like use that stand.

676
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So the controls disappoint me a little bit.

677
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:49,686
[SPEAKER_14]: But otherwise, it's really a shame that something like that really screws the game in the way that it does because I love the storytelling and the videos and tutorial videos and all that in it because they break the fourth wall constantly.

678
00:48:50,546 --> 00:49:17,917
[SPEAKER_14]: and all these in jokes like the game was made for people that remember the old Kid Icarus and constantly they're like you know oh it's been 25 years since we last saw Medusa and then it'll show like it says here's a picture of Medusa and it changes to that hideous looking thing from the eight big Kid Icarus and somebody writes Medusa in an arrow and it points at it like all these really dumb things and you know kind of some of those adult level jokes that kids wouldn't get but adults do and a lot of that is really funny.

679
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:23,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Game Girl says, is it worth it?

680
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:25,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Was thinking of getting Kid Icarus Uprising.

681
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:32,233
[SPEAKER_14]: It really depends on how tied you are to this series and all that.

682
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:35,395
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I paid $30 for it, which I think is a fair price.

683
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:39,178
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Best Buy had a discount, so Amazon price matched it.

684
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,559
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got it for that price.

685
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,723
[SPEAKER_14]: $40 might be a little steep, depending on, you know...

686
00:49:45,143 --> 00:50:08,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish there was a mode and maybe there will be one at the end where you could just play the sky stages because the sky stages are where this game is the best because you don't have to worry about turning pit and you just use the thing to move them and you use the touchpad to move the targeting and the game is fantastic and it's at its best in those stages and the 3D looks great but otherwise the ground stages kind of take away from the rest of the game for me

687
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:24,859
[SPEAKER_14]: but I still think it's a solid 3DS game I think it's definitely worth hopefully they'll put out a demo or something so you can kind of evaluate if it's for you I want it to do well because I like the idea of the Kid Icarus series coming back but I'm not going to sit here and say the game is flawless when it's not

688
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:32,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It's bad they couldn't patch it to use the Circle Pad Pro as, you know... Well, you actually can if you're a lefty.

689
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:37,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the lefty controls are using the Circle Pad Pro and then using your left hand for the stylus.

690
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:41,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that, but I meant, like, you know, the second analog instead of the touchpad.

691
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:49,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I want to say there was customizable controls in there too, so maybe there's a way you can kind of fix it and maybe kind of do that.

692
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:50,705
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can't see.

693
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:53,987
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is if you did that, Loki, then you'd have nothing to use to target.

694
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:58,489
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd have to move and then pick up your stylus and target, and it would be kind of disjointed.

695
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:00,190
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd use the right analog to target.

696
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but then how would you turn your screen?

697
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,421
[SPEAKER_14]: You still have to use your stylus to turn the screen.

698
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:07,482
[SPEAKER_13]: That's stupid.

699
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,964
[SPEAKER_13]: First person shooters don't have that problem.

700
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:14,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Why does this have to be an issue with this game?

701
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:15,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so it's a little rough there.

702
00:51:17,587 --> 00:51:22,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Porkchop in chat says, I've never played Kid Icarus ever, but Uprising looks awesome.

703
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:32,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me talk about this real quick, because as a pre-order bonus, I got the Kid Icarus 3D Classics, which is the 3D version of the regular game, and it's actually really good.

704
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:42,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, even though it's just the regular Kid Icarus, they put these backgrounds in every level, where the 3D is not just the back, like, the backgrounds themselves are kind of 3D, and

705
00:51:43,590 --> 00:52:03,572
[SPEAKER_14]: and I think the game is based off the disc system version and not the cartridge because there's load and save files which only existed in the disc version and I want to say the sound effects were slightly different which I remember the disc system had a different sound chip than the NES did so some of the games had slightly different sound effects so that was kind of cool

706
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:07,520
[SPEAKER_10]: You should hear the music in the disc version of Castlevania 3.

707
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I always hear that Castlevania 3's got a neat little... But yeah, Kid Icarus actually had a really good music on the disc one.

708
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:15,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sound.

709
00:52:16,124 --> 00:52:19,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane in our chatroom says, Kid Icarus used to be worse for the 3DS.

710
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:24,128
[SPEAKER_14]: At E3, the ground stages were timed and you had to get through checkpoints so they at least fixed that.

711
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:24,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank God.

712
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:26,249
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been really bad.

713
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:28,970
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad they changed that because that sounds terrible.

714
00:52:30,832 --> 00:52:33,798
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, the 3D Classic is actually really good.

715
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:37,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish every game got this kind.

716
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:40,349
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish they would do this for every virtual console game.

717
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not that much that they did.

718
00:52:43,615 --> 00:52:48,039
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they added backgrounds and the 3D is done tastefully.

719
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:49,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the best way I can put it.

720
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,883
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like you've got one sprite layer here and then your background layer.

721
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more than that.

722
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:00,088
[SPEAKER_14]: There's multi-level of 3D and I think the effects are really good.

723
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:00,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And it kind of...

724
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:02,630
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

725
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:38,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm really looking forward to seeing what else... Oh God, what's the name of the developer that did the 3DS versions called?

726
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,471
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like... It's not Akira, but... Akira or something like that?

727
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:44,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Did all the...

728
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

729
00:54:09,075 --> 00:54:25,246
[SPEAKER_14]: AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom with a tip says, just an FYI, to people that have any 3D classic games on 3DS and didn't notice, you can go into options and increase the 3D density setting even more if it's not strong enough on max if setting is untouched.

730
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:25,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's true.

731
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:32,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just the 3D density on the slider, but there's a 3D density within the game that you can adjust, which I think is a good idea.

732
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:32,851
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

733
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:35,194
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

734
00:54:52,296 --> 00:55:03,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we didn't get to say it at the top of the show because of our little joke tonight, a big thank you as always to All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, although not tonight.

735
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:05,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Bobby's on a little break.

736
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:06,767
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll be back on the 15th.

737
00:55:08,148 --> 00:55:09,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get into some gaming news.

738
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:09,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

739
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:20,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so there's a big ol' fun rumor regarding the next PlayStation system.

740
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:26,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, there's sources that contacted Kotaku, or Kotaku contacted...

741
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:41,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, they figured out that the working title or possible name for the system is Orbis and that it's being planned for release sometime next holiday, so 2013 holiday.

742
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:42,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't Orbis a travel website?

743
00:55:43,057 --> 00:55:43,937
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's Orbit.

744
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:49,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't Orbis a drink that has these little gummy things in it that's the most disgusting?

745
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:51,460
[SPEAKER_14]: That was Orbit's?

746
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it's like you were drinking herpes.

747
00:55:54,641 --> 00:56:06,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the name for the actual console is legit because you can pull up the dev website for PlayStation and typing in Orbis or slash Orbis or whatever pulls up the actual dev site.

748
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:09,004
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just you don't get a 404 from it.

749
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,525
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have it built in place, but they just don't have anything there yet.

750
00:56:12,845 --> 00:56:13,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of like with the Vita.

751
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:15,746
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's on Sony's site.

752
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:17,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, orbis.scdev.net, their dev site.

753
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:17,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, man.

754
00:56:17,729 --> 00:56:19,370
[SPEAKER_13]: The name is real.

755
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,972
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a working name or it's a...

756
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:31,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

757
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:33,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

758
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:36,305
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's real, at least.

759
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:38,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, some of the specs, though.

760
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:46,468
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying right now that they're planning on using an AMD x64 CPU, also an AMD Southern Islands GPU.

761
00:56:47,408 --> 00:56:54,351
[SPEAKER_13]: And what they're saying right now is that it's supposed to be able to push a 4K HD, which is...

762
00:56:55,578 --> 00:57:01,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Way more than most TVs can use, although newer TVs do support it.

763
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,826
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a 4096x2160.

764
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,871
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a resolution far exceeding most HDTVs.

765
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:16,099
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also they're saying it's capable of playing 3D games in 1080p, whereas the PS3 can only do that at 720p.

766
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:30,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I just want to say so far, I can believe it that they're pushing the technical limits because if you think about it, when PlayStation 3 came out, not everybody had adopted Blu-ray yet or even HD TVs.

767
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:32,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the technology they went with.

768
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:34,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So I could kind of see that.

769
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:35,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the problem, though.

770
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll cover what my issues are with the news in a sec.

771
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:47,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, they're saying right now that select developers have dev kits already, which makes sense.

772
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:48,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, come on.

773
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:50,940
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's a year out, obviously they're going to be working on games already.

774
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:58,207
[SPEAKER_13]: No backwards compatibility whatsoever with any PS3 games, also PS2 games.

775
00:57:58,988 --> 00:58:07,857
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be assumed that stuff would be coming via emulators on the PlayStation Network since they have that right now with PS2 and PlayStation 1 games.

776
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:10,160
[SPEAKER_14]: But why would the dev kits be backwards compatible anyway?

777
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,023
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they're talking about the final product, not the dev kits.

778
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:23,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but how would the... I mean, if this is being leaked from a dev, which is what I'm assuming because the dev website's out there and everything, if this is being leaked from a developer, then why would their kits have the backwards compatibility?

779
00:58:23,776 --> 00:58:28,939
[SPEAKER_13]: They wouldn't have that, but the thing is they're telling them what the final specs are, what their specs are estimating.

780
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:42,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And it makes sense that they would cut out backwards compatibility because, one, you can still push PlayStation 3s, and two, they want to sell those games digitally because they can make money off that, and they also don't have to put... Putting the PlayStation 2 chips in there...

781
00:58:43,328 --> 00:58:43,628
[SPEAKER_13]: and so on.

782
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:06,745
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

783
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:51,360
[SPEAKER_13]: However, much like PC games, it's going to be tied to your system, so you're going to need to have a PlayStation Network account and be online to even get the game started.

784
00:59:52,360 --> 01:00:19,581
[SPEAKER_13]: um and then on top of that they're saying that if you decide to trade in your disc or you know loan to a friend or sell it or whatever um that the next person that gets it is going to have basically kind of a limited version of the game uh either going to be like a demo form or some sort of you know hindered version kind of think of like uh I guess the online passes or something like that but who knows to what extent and they're going to pay a fee to unlock or register the full game

785
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:23,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's that.

786
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess we can talk about that first.

787
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:28,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we talk about that?

788
01:00:28,954 --> 01:00:29,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about that.

789
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:34,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so there's a few problems I have with the specs.

790
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:38,856
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, let's talk about the 4K resolution.

791
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:45,558
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds good and all until you actually look up what 4K resolutions over HDMI are actually capable of.

792
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,399
[SPEAKER_13]: 24 frames a second.

793
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,260
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

794
01:00:48,901 --> 01:00:53,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're looking for like 60 FPS games, you're not going to get that on this.

795
01:00:54,006 --> 01:01:00,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, when you think about that, that's only compatible with HDMI, I think 1.4, which most TVs do not have.

796
01:01:01,052 --> 01:01:06,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I would assume that there's going to be some backwards compatibility with like 1080p and stuff like that.

797
01:01:06,377 --> 01:01:09,160
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's just assume that maybe there's not.

798
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:09,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

799
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And say they're going to be assholes about it.

800
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:17,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you're going to need to buy a new TV, new sound system, new cables, just to get this fucking thing to work.

801
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:24,134
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on top of that, like I said, 24 frames a second is not very... I mean, that's video.

802
01:01:24,554 --> 01:01:27,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Video, that's fine, like watching the movie and stuff.

803
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:30,976
[SPEAKER_13]: But playing a game, I think you'd want higher FPS for that.

804
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,737
[SPEAKER_13]: At least I would think so.

805
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:37,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on top of that, I mean, let's see.

806
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:40,359
[SPEAKER_13]: They're talking about digital downloads for games.

807
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:45,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, that works okay for Vita games that are a couple gigs long.

808
01:01:45,980 --> 01:02:10,272
[SPEAKER_13]: but we're talking fucking PlayStation 4 games I mean which are going to be pushing these 4k graphics with textures that are fucking huge you're talking like I mean PlayStation 3 games right now are upwards to I'd say I mean it's possible that they're up to 50 gigabytes on a dual layer blu-ray disc 50 gigabytes most of them don't take up 50 gigs it's most of them are about like you know

809
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:12,635
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 to 20 something gigs.

810
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:17,744
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, that's a fucking long time to download the game off of the internet.

811
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:21,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus we're talking, you know, all these companies talking about bandwidth caps and stuff like that.

812
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:22,651
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to eat up your bandwidth.

813
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:24,594
[SPEAKER_13]: in no time.

814
01:02:24,894 --> 01:02:33,038
[SPEAKER_13]: And they want you completely connected to the internet for some sort of back-ass words anti-piracy bullshit.

815
01:02:33,578 --> 01:02:41,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So on top of that, we don't even need to cover why that's a bad idea because look at with the whole Ubisoft always on DRM bullshit.

816
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:49,766
[SPEAKER_13]: If their network goes down, PlayStation Network goes down for a day or so, bye-bye, can't play your game system for that whole day.

817
01:02:50,006 --> 01:02:50,507
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

818
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not see them.

819
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:11,861
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, GameStop is not going to let them do this.

820
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:19,207
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because you think that... Didn't that one analyst who we always kind of tease on this show?

821
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:19,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Michael Patrick.

822
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:20,768
[SPEAKER_14]: But he made a good point.

823
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:23,971
[SPEAKER_14]: He said GameStop is not going to sell these consoles.

824
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, if basically, if they're...

825
01:03:27,173 --> 01:03:30,794
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get into why they wouldn't carry these consoles.

826
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:39,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, if you're offering a system that has no used games whatsoever, it's impossible to sell a demo disc.

827
01:03:39,476 --> 01:03:46,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just say, worst case scenario, you can't play anything other than a small demo on this console.

828
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:52,981
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I think that's going to be a huge, huge incentive for hackers to try to fix that.

829
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're going to be like, oh, wait a second.

830
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:56,042
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your fucking disk.

831
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:56,782
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do whatever you want.

832
01:03:57,123 --> 01:03:59,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, tying it to one account is also kind of lame.

833
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:05,486
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, it's just like, why?

834
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:09,628
[SPEAKER_13]: If they're not going to have any used game sales or whatever, then they're not going to carry it in their store.

835
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:13,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Much like they did carry a little bit of the PSP Go stuff.

836
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:15,727
[SPEAKER_13]: because some people might have wanted it.

837
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:19,809
[SPEAKER_13]: But that offered really no sales for them other than PlayStation Network cards because it was all digital.

838
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:22,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just don't see them doing that.

839
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,791
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's talk a little bit real quick.

840
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:27,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you trying to say that GameStop had a hand in why the PSP Go failed?

841
01:04:28,253 --> 01:04:29,674
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was stupid.

842
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:30,875
[SPEAKER_13]: The PSP Go was dumb.

843
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:35,757
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a system that was digital only that was priced higher than the current model out already.

844
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:36,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would you buy it?

845
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:42,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me read some quick comments in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com GamerGirl says, I have a feeling the PS4 is going to tank.

846
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:52,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Technus says, I doubt the game will run at 4K, maybe for full motion videos, but the games will probably run at 1080p at 60 frames per second.

847
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:56,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, a lot of these specs could be really overblown.

848
01:04:56,241 --> 01:05:02,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember back when they were talking about the specs of PS3, how they were saying, oh, 1080p and 120 frames per second for all games.

849
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:04,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

850
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, 1080p for all games and 120 frames per second.

851
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,088
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to go crazy with that stuff.

852
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And that never fucking happened.

853
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:11,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, whatever.

854
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:16,310
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very possible that this stuff could be patched in later on.

855
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:21,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Because remember, the original, well, the Xbox 360 didn't always used to have 1080p.

856
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,591
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 1080i.

857
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:24,771
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it got patched in later on.

858
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:26,732
[SPEAKER_13]: So they could add it later on.

859
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:28,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's possible.

860
01:05:28,812 --> 01:05:38,754
[SPEAKER_14]: On this used game thing, is it possible that we're misinterpreting a system similar to what the Vita has to prevent trophy exploitation?

861
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:40,235
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

862
01:05:40,255 --> 01:05:43,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible that it's tied to an account but you can easily remove it?

863
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:46,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's like that.

864
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:49,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just because... Well...

865
01:05:50,205 --> 01:05:50,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

866
01:05:50,665 --> 01:05:51,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going off what they said.

867
01:05:51,726 --> 01:05:52,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all speculation.

868
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:54,467
[SPEAKER_13]: They said it's just limited.

869
01:05:55,147 --> 01:06:01,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it is where you can remove it off of your system when you're done with it and then it becomes free to use for somebody else.

870
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope that that would be kind of like what it is.

871
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:18,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to express big reservations about this and the next Xbox, whatever it is, if the rumors are true about that as well, that Microsoft and Sony have joined together for some sort of dark pact where both these systems do not play used games.

872
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:18,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Well,

873
01:06:19,157 --> 01:06:20,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me cover real quick.

874
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:25,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so first off, and I gotta, this is Dennis Dyack.

875
01:06:25,779 --> 01:06:33,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, not a lot of you may be familiar with Dennis Dyack, but he's the head of development studios at Silicon Knights.

876
01:06:33,742 --> 01:06:36,243
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Silicon Knights, the company that put out 2Human?

877
01:06:38,089 --> 01:06:40,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

878
01:06:58,121 --> 01:07:01,664
[SPEAKER_13]: He's talking about a world without used games, new consoles.

879
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:08,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there are no used games, you could actually sell a game for a long time and get reoccurring revenue for quite a while.

880
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Reoccurring revenue is very key.

881
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:11,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there is no tail.

882
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:25,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Literally, you will get most of your sales within the three months of launch, which have created this really healthy... Literally, you'll get most of your sales within three months of launch, which has created this really unhealthy extreme...

883
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:31,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Where you have to sell it really fast and then you have to do anything else to get money.

884
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:37,596
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it also says, I would argue, and I've said this before, that used games are cannibalizing the industry.

885
01:07:37,997 --> 01:07:47,046
[SPEAKER_13]: If developers and publishers don't see revenue from that, it's no matter of, hey, we're trying to increase the price of games to consumers and we want more.

886
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:49,648
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just trying to survive in an industry.

887
01:07:49,748 --> 01:07:53,090
[SPEAKER_13]: If used games continue the way they are, it's going to cannibalize.

888
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:56,072
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not going to be an industry.

889
01:07:56,933 --> 01:08:01,976
[SPEAKER_13]: People won't make these kind of games, basically saying the really high price games.

890
01:08:02,256 --> 01:08:08,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's inflated the prices of games, and I think the prices will have to come down if there's a longer tail, but there isn't.

891
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:12,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so first off, this guy's so full of bullshit.

892
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:15,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really, he has nothing to go off because his games suck.

893
01:08:15,664 --> 01:08:17,025
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't because of used games.

894
01:08:17,085 --> 01:08:18,926
[SPEAKER_13]: It was because your games sucked that it didn't sell.

895
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:23,469
[SPEAKER_13]: But besides that, he doesn't understand how the fucking industry works.

896
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:28,151
[SPEAKER_13]: And sad considering a guy that is in the industry doesn't understand how it works.

897
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:35,815
[SPEAKER_13]: If you get rid of used games, you're going to get rid of the game specialty market, which is basically your game stops any game-specific store.

898
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Retailers that deal in multiple things like...

899
01:08:38,797 --> 01:08:43,483
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like a Best Buy or something like that, an apartment store that carries everything.

900
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:46,366
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not necessarily going to be affected by that.

901
01:08:46,646 --> 01:08:49,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first off, they don't really deal and use to begin with, but...

902
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:51,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

903
01:09:11,136 --> 01:09:18,880
[SPEAKER_13]: and really they can't make, you can't run a business with a 20% margin because you also have to pay your employees, your rent and utilities and all that stuff.

904
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of factors that go into it.

905
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:26,284
[SPEAKER_13]: So they make up their money by used games, trade-ins and sales.

906
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:37,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the trade-ins obviously are also gonna drive new game sales because you're getting people that take their 2012 copy of Tiger Woods and they trade in for their 2013 copy of Tiger Woods.

907
01:09:37,849 --> 01:10:05,746
[SPEAKER_13]: and you turn around and you sell the Tiger Woods or whatever game it is at an increased margin basically you're buying it for $20 and you're selling it for $40 and so instead of a 20% margin you have like a 100% margin now it's a lot healthier for these companies and now yes I understand that GameStop makes a lot of money in use but you know what that's how they run their business and that's how any game store is going to run their business they can't make they can't survive on just new games

908
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:16,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, honestly, if the Dark Pact is true and these companies are going to move towards used games, I think one of two things is happening.

909
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:19,841
[SPEAKER_14]: A, they're handing Nintendo the crown.

910
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:20,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Watch.

911
01:10:21,063 --> 01:10:21,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Watch.

912
01:10:21,223 --> 01:10:21,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Watch.

913
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:26,026
[SPEAKER_14]: When those soccer moms go to the store in 2013, what system are they going to pick up?

914
01:10:26,406 --> 01:10:29,528
[SPEAKER_14]: The system that they don't really have the TVs to run anyway?

915
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:32,010
[SPEAKER_14]: And the systems where they won't be able to get used games?

916
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:35,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Or that the retailer might tell them you can't play used games on this?

917
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:37,573
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't rent games to this system?

918
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:38,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are they going to get a Wii U?

919
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,156
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to get a Wii U. Wake up call.

920
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:46,877
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the same reason the Nintendo Wii succeeded the first time.

921
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:49,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me finish.

922
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:55,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if the Wii U somehow did this too, we don't know.

923
01:10:56,259 --> 01:10:58,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo could be a part of this dark pact.

924
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:07,321
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know the final specs of the Wii U. Let's hypothesize, and yes, this is being a little tinfoil hattie, but let's hypothesize that all three game companies are taking this stand against used games.

925
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I call video game market crash of 83 all over again.

926
01:11:11,923 --> 01:11:13,284
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be that serious.

927
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,865
[SPEAKER_14]: The video game market will crash.

928
01:11:17,546 --> 01:11:18,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely will crash.

929
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:21,868
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've been wondering how long is it going to take for it to crash again.

930
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:24,309
[SPEAKER_14]: This type of greed is going to cause it.

931
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:25,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

932
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I think actually, I don't think it's going to crash.

933
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:29,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would I buy this system, Loki?

934
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:30,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

935
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,213
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the thing though.

936
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:34,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's what I think is going to happen is it's not necessarily going to crash.

937
01:11:34,974 --> 01:11:36,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just they won't buy those new systems.

938
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:38,856
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's going to buy the new systems.

939
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:40,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And then what's going to happen?

940
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:47,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's still plenty of people out there with the Xbox 360s and the PlayStation 3s and stuff like that.

941
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:54,382
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's still a crash because Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft would lose so much money from putting those consoles on the shelves that no one buys.

942
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:56,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I hope that's a big wake-up call then if that's the case.

943
01:11:57,423 --> 01:12:02,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, first... Sorry, it's really just not only the used games too.

944
01:12:02,345 --> 01:12:03,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the fact that...

945
01:12:04,566 --> 01:12:06,428
[SPEAKER_14]: What do these consoles really have to offer?

946
01:12:06,468 --> 01:12:10,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, okay, it's the technical edge, but a lot of us don't even have that technology yet.

947
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:14,534
[SPEAKER_14]: I myself did not buy a PlayStation 3 until they were already out for like two years.

948
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:17,456
[SPEAKER_14]: I just... I really worry.

949
01:12:17,757 --> 01:12:22,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, I have to take this all with a big-ass grain of salt because this is all rumors.

950
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:22,721
[SPEAKER_14]: All of it.

951
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:25,022
[SPEAKER_14]: All of it's rumors until it's on the show floor at E3.

952
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:25,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

953
01:12:26,424 --> 01:12:30,267
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe we're just getting a little bit carried away with the hysterics.

954
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,287
[SPEAKER_14]: But I hope to hell...

955
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:32,748
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:53,664
[SPEAKER_14]: for a new game, and $20 for all this download content, and then block out used game sales.

957
01:12:54,104 --> 01:13:00,953
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a moment, especially in this economy, which isn't going to be fully recovered by next year, where the consumers are going to say, enough.

958
01:13:01,553 --> 01:13:03,616
[SPEAKER_14]: You have taken our money.

959
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:05,699
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to give it to you anymore.

960
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:06,900
[SPEAKER_14]: We're fine with

961
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of it, they're not even really claiming that you own the disc.

962
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,505
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your licensing content from them anyways.

963
01:13:15,366 --> 01:13:21,189
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no industry out there that doesn't have used car sales.

964
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we see car sales suffering because of used car sales?

965
01:13:25,332 --> 01:13:25,612
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

966
01:13:25,953 --> 01:13:27,173
[SPEAKER_13]: It's never fucking happening.

967
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:32,117
[SPEAKER_13]: So why do you fucking think that you need money, Mr. Developer of Too Human...

968
01:13:32,877 --> 01:13:34,118
[SPEAKER_13]: for used game sales.

969
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:37,221
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't deserve any of my money then.

970
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:37,962
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the case?

971
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:43,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, here's how it's going to work, Mr. Dynak or whatever, or Dyak.

972
01:13:43,728 --> 01:13:45,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even fucking pronounce your last name.

973
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever, Dennis Dyak.

974
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:47,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's how it's going to fucking work.

975
01:13:47,912 --> 01:13:49,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's cut out used game sales.

976
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:52,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

977
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:27,483
[SPEAKER_13]: and no one's buying it new and there's no used game market anymore so you know no one's buying it and then turning it over and saying oh fuck it I'm not gonna you know play this so what's gonna happen your game your brand new game is gonna have to drop in price in order to push some sales and it's gonna keep dropping in price until it gets gets down to the used game price that would have been then people are gonna buy new

978
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,034
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, there's no used games.

979
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:35,618
[SPEAKER_13]: People just wait till the fucking new games to get to the price of what the used games used to be before.

980
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:36,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And guess what?

981
01:14:36,298 --> 01:14:38,300
[SPEAKER_13]: They get all the full benefit of it.

982
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,683
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't justify a $60 game if there's no resale value.

983
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,945
[SPEAKER_14]: You're literally taking all of the value out of the game.

984
01:14:44,405 --> 01:14:48,128
[SPEAKER_13]: And here's another fun fact here, Dennis Dyack.

985
01:14:48,769 --> 01:14:53,533
[SPEAKER_13]: If your game system or the game system that you're putting your content on doesn't support used games...

986
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:55,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

987
01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:21,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're just not going to carry it.

988
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:22,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And they probably will listen.

989
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:25,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, why would they just stop listening to them all of a sudden?

990
01:15:25,508 --> 01:15:26,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, come on.

991
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:32,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we want to wrap up this topic to move on to other things, but I want to check in with Jamie because we haven't heard from her in a little bit.

992
01:15:32,976 --> 01:15:36,419
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a collector, how do you feel about no used game markets?

993
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:39,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's freaking ridiculous.

994
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:44,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just saying earlier in chat that I bought a PlayStation game two weeks ago.

995
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:47,408
[SPEAKER_10]: A PlayStation game.

996
01:15:48,308 --> 01:15:50,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have PlayStations.

997
01:15:51,510 --> 01:16:02,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying that there's people out there that will still keep holding on to the older systems, like say they may have an Xbox and not a 360, because all they buy is used games.

998
01:16:03,898 --> 01:16:24,683
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know that's that's their prerogative they can do that I think that if you take out the ability to sell the game back get a little money back in their pocket so they can go out and afford to buy a new game that they're basically going to be cutting out let's just say at least a good 25% of their market

999
01:16:27,105 --> 01:16:30,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in the people that basically resell games so that they can buy a new game.

1000
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:31,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1001
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:36,736
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, when you think about it, that disc will be worth nothing by the time you take it out of the shrink wrap.

1002
01:16:36,816 --> 01:16:37,737
[SPEAKER_14]: It is now worth nothing.

1003
01:16:37,777 --> 01:16:45,125
[SPEAKER_13]: They're literally saying, though, that you can pop it in your system, mark it as, oh, I own this, and then you can literally throw the disc away.

1004
01:16:46,243 --> 01:16:50,869
[SPEAKER_14]: But who has the bandwidth from Comcast or whatever your provider is to support that?

1005
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:52,991
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a 250 gig cap.

1006
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:54,573
[SPEAKER_14]: These games are going to be 17 gigs each.

1007
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:55,634
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the other thing too.

1008
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:06,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Another point that I brought up because I actually responded to that article is, okay, let's assume that you can dump this game to your hard drive.

1009
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:08,748
[SPEAKER_13]: How fucking big is that hard drive going to be?

1010
01:17:08,848 --> 01:17:10,369
[SPEAKER_13]: And how much is it going to fucking cost?

1011
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:16,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, the prices of these hard drives from... I understand, data storage is cheap.

1012
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:21,534
[SPEAKER_13]: But data storage is not cheap when it's sold by a company in a proprietary format.

1013
01:17:21,994 --> 01:17:29,717
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, you could buy a 320 gigabyte hard drive or whatever from Microsoft and it's going to run you like 200 bucks.

1014
01:17:29,837 --> 01:17:34,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can get like a 2 terabyte drive for about the same price if I bought it for my PC.

1015
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:35,480
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1016
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless they open that shit up like they do with the PS3, props to them for that.

1017
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:43,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, why wouldn't they do that?

1018
01:17:43,363 --> 01:17:52,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, after all, these guys are so fucking hungry for money that, of course, they're going to take the opportunity to, you know, oh, hey, you need that two terabyte drive because you're going to have to store all those games that we're going to make.

1019
01:17:54,227 --> 01:17:55,488
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't take without giving back.

1020
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:02,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I stand by my earlier statement that this is going to cause a video game crash, and it's going to drive the game market underground.

1021
01:18:04,464 --> 01:18:13,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, not like, you know, not like, oh, the back alleys and whatever, but it's going to be, games will be sold at flea markets, and GameStops will sell nothing but used games, because people don't want new games anymore.

1022
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:14,869
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth shit.

1023
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:21,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, when you think about, you know, technology getting the way it is right now, and how expensive consoles are getting, you know, meh.

1024
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:23,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe people will actually go to PCs.

1025
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:24,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, look at that.

1026
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:25,614
[SPEAKER_13]: PCs.

1027
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Where you can get games and actually own stuff.

1028
01:18:28,515 --> 01:18:34,277
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to worry about used game sales because there's just sales on video games.

1029
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:37,758
[SPEAKER_13]: There's Steam and that kind of stuff.

1030
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:39,279
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1031
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:03,738
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1032
01:19:32,937 --> 01:19:34,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Could this be how the hacks are happening?

1033
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:39,281
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I say no because I've never sold a hard drive back and I was hacked.

1034
01:19:39,661 --> 01:19:41,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I have all my drives I've ever had.

1035
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:44,864
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of that, I don't think it stores the actual credit card information on your hard drive.

1036
01:19:44,924 --> 01:19:50,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's tied to your network account or your Xbox Live account and it's downloaded from there.

1037
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,909
[SPEAKER_14]: But is it possible it's ever written it to the drive?

1038
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:53,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Ever?

1039
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:57,612
[SPEAKER_13]: It's possible that it might be in a cache file or something like that.

1040
01:19:57,712 --> 01:20:00,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that is possible, but

1041
01:20:00,814 --> 01:20:03,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Now Microsoft responded to the whole thing.

1042
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:06,259
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me read Microsoft's response because obviously this is important.

1043
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Quote, we are conducting a thorough investigation into the researchers' claims.

1044
01:20:10,002 --> 01:20:17,308
[SPEAKER_14]: We have requested information that will allow us to investigate the console in question and have still not received the information needed to replicate the researchers' claims.

1045
01:20:17,368 --> 01:20:21,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're deflecting a little bit in the opening like we don't have the information yet.

1046
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:26,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I somehow doubt that they actually wipe the drive with like zero byte writing but I think it's just like format

1047
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:53,771
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not a 100% denial either.

1048
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you notice that?

1049
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:57,434
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not a firm, no, this is crap.

1050
01:20:57,855 --> 01:21:01,798
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a, we haven't been able to investigate it and it's unlikely.

1051
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:03,399
[SPEAKER_14]: But that wasn't a no.

1052
01:21:08,344 --> 01:21:19,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, maybe for legal reasons they can't say no because if they do say no and it ends up they were wrong, now we can class action lawsuit them, Xbox Live agreement be damned because this is on the actual hardware itself.

1053
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:22,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not scared God, I...

1054
01:21:40,537 --> 01:21:49,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I'm a total hypocrite saying this because my credit card info is on my Xbox, but if you haven't put it on there yet, I would advise you just don't.

1055
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:51,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't ever give those damn things your credit card.

1056
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:52,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Use the cards that you buy in stores.

1057
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:54,504
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the only safe way to do it.

1058
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:56,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad, but true.

1059
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:59,467
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, meanwhile, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1060
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:08,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, I was answering a question from Nish, I guess, asking what my favorite console is of all time.

1061
01:22:08,806 --> 01:22:09,647
[SPEAKER_14]: from our chat room, yeah?

1062
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:13,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd probably say the PC Engine Duo, Turbo Duo.

1063
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:14,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is that?

1064
01:22:14,832 --> 01:22:18,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Dracula X. Super Nintendo for me, easy.

1065
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:20,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Nintendo was the best console they ever did, I think.

1066
01:22:21,999 --> 01:22:31,088
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, you remember we had actually mentioned a rumor about Zipper being closed, Zipper Interactive, that created SOCOM, the developer of SOCOM?

1067
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:31,908
[SPEAKER_10]: That was last week, yeah.

1068
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:33,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Sony confirmed it.

1069
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:36,191
[SPEAKER_10]: but other than that, bye bye

1070
01:23:04,304 --> 01:23:17,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, I guess most of us kind of assumed last week's was probably true anyway, but it's unfortunate that it was confirmed, but... It doesn't... When you say a rumor, you should always give it some closure.

1071
01:23:17,175 --> 01:23:17,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1072
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:18,916
[SPEAKER_10]: They got the closure all right.

1073
01:23:19,117 --> 01:23:26,643
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's true that these new consoles are gonna lock out used games, I bet this is gonna get a lot more frequent.

1074
01:23:26,863 --> 01:23:31,447
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be... If your company doesn't develop for PC, you're gonna be in trouble.

1075
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:32,568
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I have to say.

1076
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:36,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what the project was that was cancelled.

1077
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,620
[SPEAKER_14]: SOCOM 5?

1078
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1079
01:23:39,121 --> 01:23:39,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe?

1080
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:42,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Just SOCOM on the Vita?

1081
01:23:42,244 --> 01:23:42,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

1082
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:43,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh.

1083
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:43,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

1084
01:23:44,345 --> 01:23:48,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you soon.

1085
01:23:49,143 --> 01:23:52,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the drought has begun again, so not a whole lot this week.

1086
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:57,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Titanic Mystery on Nintendo DS and on the Wii.

1087
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, to celebrate the release of the movie all over again.

1088
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:05,180
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it's talking about the Titanic 2 and how there's a bomb on the Titanic.

1089
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we talked about this.

1090
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:08,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like the plot of Speed 2.

1091
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:15,151
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also, of course, Funky Barn from Ubisoft.

1092
01:24:16,392 --> 01:24:16,933
[SPEAKER_13]: 3DS game.

1093
01:24:18,114 --> 01:24:21,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Fallout and Oblivion are getting a double pack on Xbox 360 and PC.

1094
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:30,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Connect Star Wars out this week as well as the Connect Star Wars Limited Edition Connect Star Wars Oh, that's finally out?

1095
01:24:30,244 --> 01:24:30,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1096
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:31,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be damned.

1097
01:24:31,424 --> 01:24:32,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Connect Star Wars is finally out.

1098
01:24:34,006 --> 01:24:40,929
[SPEAKER_13]: If you happen to shop at GameStop or Nintendo online, Xenoblade Chronicles is out on the Wii this week.

1099
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:46,653
[SPEAKER_14]: And... That's it.

1100
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, Xenoblade Chronicles.

1101
01:24:48,294 --> 01:24:49,855
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one a lot of people are looking forward to.

1102
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:52,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, gotta say that.

1103
01:24:52,216 --> 01:24:57,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and originally it was going to be a Devil May Cry HD collection this week on PS3 and 360.

1104
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,183
[SPEAKER_13]: However, Capcom dropped the street date on that, so it's out now.

1105
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:03,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, canceled?

1106
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:05,985
[SPEAKER_13]: They're no longer street dating it.

1107
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:11,209
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was basically, before it was, okay, you have to hold your copies until Tuesday, then they're like, ah, just sell it.

1108
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:12,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it got leaked or something?

1109
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:13,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

1110
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:13,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't.

1111
01:25:14,273 --> 01:25:15,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it got leaked years ago.

1112
01:25:16,076 --> 01:25:19,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Devil's May Cry HD Edition is not like one of those games like people have to have right now.

1113
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:21,124
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like you already played it before.

1114
01:25:21,164 --> 01:25:23,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it doesn't look all that HD either.

1115
01:25:24,109 --> 01:25:24,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Just saying.

1116
01:25:24,969 --> 01:25:26,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go to Japan.

1117
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:30,113
[SPEAKER_14]: In Japan, not a whole lot coming out, but there are a few things.

1118
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:34,737
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Nintendo 3DS, Puyo Puyo Kansatsu Niki.

1119
01:25:34,837 --> 01:25:36,539
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not Puyo Puyo, there's a big difference.

1120
01:25:36,599 --> 01:25:39,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Puyo Puyo, which looks like this big fat cat.

1121
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:40,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1122
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:45,666
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not really Nintendogs or Nintendcats, although I guess it does actually look a little similar to that.

1123
01:25:45,786 --> 01:25:49,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen that cat a bunch of places before, so I think it's like from a manga.

1124
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:50,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a character or something.

1125
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it does look a lot like Nintendogs or...

1126
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:54,372
[SPEAKER_14]: That looks like Shermie.

1127
01:25:54,392 --> 01:25:56,633
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not look like Shermie.

1128
01:25:57,553 --> 01:25:58,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Shermie is not that fat.

1129
01:25:59,974 --> 01:26:00,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's not orange.

1130
01:26:01,054 --> 01:26:01,534
[SPEAKER_14]: A plus.

1131
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:02,454
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1132
01:26:02,954 --> 01:26:05,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to... Let's check out the Vita.

1133
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:08,156
[SPEAKER_14]: See what's coming out on the Vita this week over in Japan.

1134
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:10,416
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

1135
01:26:11,216 --> 01:26:11,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

1136
01:26:11,937 --> 01:26:13,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless you want a portable charger.

1137
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:16,138
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an official first party portable charger.

1138
01:26:16,858 --> 01:26:17,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, hey.

1139
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:21,960
[SPEAKER_14]: on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1140
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to the 360 first.

1141
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:26,943
[SPEAKER_14]: They're also getting Star Wars this week and the console.

1142
01:26:27,003 --> 01:26:28,464
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not just America that's getting that.

1143
01:26:28,544 --> 01:26:30,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Japan is getting their version as well.

1144
01:26:30,805 --> 01:26:37,829
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly on the PlayStation 3, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition comes out in Japan and Mahjong Dream Club.

1145
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:39,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay?

1146
01:26:40,451 --> 01:26:42,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that tying in with like Dream Club?

1147
01:26:43,813 --> 01:26:44,333
[SPEAKER_14]: The anime?

1148
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:45,414
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it, actually.

1149
01:26:45,554 --> 01:26:46,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the chicks?

1150
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:47,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it is.

1151
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:48,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

1152
01:26:49,154 --> 01:26:51,955
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why you knew about this, Loki.

1153
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:52,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Classy.

1154
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:59,657
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ladies in swimsuits, if you would like, with big old boobies playing mahjong.

1155
01:26:59,817 --> 01:27:00,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1156
01:27:01,598 --> 01:27:02,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Titty-jong.

1157
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:04,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what?

1158
01:27:04,438 --> 01:27:05,899
[SPEAKER_13]: More people might be into mahjong.

1159
01:27:06,019 --> 01:27:06,719
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

1160
01:27:07,999 --> 01:27:09,380
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sound the eyes make.

1161
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Mahjong!

1162
01:27:13,755 --> 01:27:15,157
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1163
01:27:15,732 --> 01:27:17,614
[SPEAKER_10]: On the third, we have Star Wars Connect.

1164
01:27:17,754 --> 01:27:20,436
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Devil May Cry HD Collection and Wheels of Destruction.

1165
01:27:20,996 --> 01:27:22,437
[SPEAKER_10]: On the fourth, Diabolical Pitch.

1166
01:27:23,558 --> 01:27:26,060
[SPEAKER_10]: On the fifth, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure.

1167
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,122
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the sixth, Shoot Many Robots.

1168
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:30,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Many Robots.

1169
01:27:30,844 --> 01:27:31,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Shoot them.

1170
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:31,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1171
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:32,786
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1172
01:27:32,806 --> 01:27:33,126
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1173
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:33,686
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1174
01:27:34,327 --> 01:27:41,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to take a moment to go in the gaming archive and find a game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brats.

1175
01:27:43,587 --> 01:27:47,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Although tonight we were reminiscing about old times a little bit, so everybody was reminiscing tonight a bit.

1176
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:52,289
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're going to reminisce again, not with an old version of our show, but with the classic game of the week.

1177
01:27:53,469 --> 01:27:56,929
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what did you pick from the archives this week as the classic game of the week?

1178
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:57,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter.

1179
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,070
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's no joke.

1180
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:01,390
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's true for the truth.

1181
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:05,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Although Capcom fighting games have become a bit of a joke in recent years.

1182
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:09,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I figured with everything happening, I may as well just go right to the source.

1183
01:28:09,411 --> 01:28:10,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk about Street Fighter.

1184
01:28:10,892 --> 01:28:11,752
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1185
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:21,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it came out in 1987, of course by Capcom, and it was their first fighting game that they put out.

1186
01:28:22,605 --> 01:28:31,770
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was actually one of the first ones that had a six-button controller and had commands that had special moves.

1187
01:28:32,471 --> 01:28:34,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So this basically started the whole big thing for us.

1188
01:28:36,653 --> 01:28:40,715
[SPEAKER_10]: The version that came out on the TurboGrafx CD was called Fighting Street in 1988.

1189
01:28:42,336 --> 01:28:49,821
[SPEAKER_10]: And that actually came out on the Virtual Console in November 2009, and the same for the UK.

1190
01:28:51,662 --> 01:29:02,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, you have one-on-one matches against the computer opponent, and then each matches three rounds, and you have to defeat each opponent in less than 30 seconds.

1191
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:11,696
[SPEAKER_10]: If the match ends before the fighter is knocked out, then whoever has the most energy will make it to the next round, basically.

1192
01:29:12,516 --> 01:29:13,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Fighting Games do today.

1193
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:17,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to win two rounds to win and move forward.

1194
01:29:17,622 --> 01:29:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the third round is a tie, then the computer wins by default.

1195
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:27,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, basically, this started the whole thing.

1196
01:29:28,228 --> 01:29:33,854
[SPEAKER_10]: This, you know, having the moves and everything, having... See, look, it's the Shoryuken, and he's fighting Sagat.

1197
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:40,121
[SPEAKER_14]: And that also started the computer cheating every time, because that's bullshit, that if it's still a tie, the computer just wins.

1198
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but actually in that case, that's actually somebody playing Ryu.

1199
01:29:44,405 --> 01:29:55,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... So there were, um... There was a deluxe version of the game that had an 8-way joystick and then two large mechatronic pads for punches and kicks.

1200
01:29:56,752 --> 01:30:00,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was basically, um... The harder you hit, the harder your punch or your kick was.

1201
01:30:01,415 --> 01:30:04,937
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the later version came out with the six attack buttons.

1202
01:30:04,957 --> 01:30:09,160
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the three heavy punches and three... Oh, the three punches and the three kicks.

1203
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um...

1204
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:15,970
[SPEAKER_10]: There were all kinds of different moves.

1205
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:17,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, you had...

1206
01:30:19,626 --> 01:30:23,970
[SPEAKER_10]: The Psycho Fire, which was the Hadouken, and the Dragon Punch and the Hurricane Kick.

1207
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:28,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they were all the same moves that followed over.

1208
01:30:30,254 --> 01:30:34,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So for the characters in this one, basically, you play as Ryu.

1209
01:30:35,578 --> 01:30:38,341
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have a second player, then you play as Ken.

1210
01:30:38,361 --> 01:30:40,482
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why they had the same moves and everything.

1211
01:30:41,843 --> 01:30:48,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And he also, basically, the two-player mode is basically Ryu versus Ken.

1212
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:54,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So you had different opponents in single-player mode.

1213
01:30:55,499 --> 01:31:15,516
[SPEAKER_10]: You had Retsu, who was a Kenpo instructor, Geki, who had a claw, and Joe, who was another karate guy, Mike, who, from what I understand, became Mike... I think was actually, if I'm right, he became Mike Bison in Street Fighter II, which...

1214
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:29,900
[SPEAKER_10]: as we know over here he was called Balrog which was Vega's name and Vega was who was Bison over here and I've gone across side yeah that's how it works

1215
01:31:30,689 --> 01:31:37,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had Lee, who was Chinese boxing, and Gen, who was a professional killer.

1216
01:31:38,016 --> 01:31:40,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gen came back in Street Fighter Alpha, or Street Fighter Zero.

1217
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And so did Birdie, who was the wrestler slash boxer.

1218
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:47,446
[SPEAKER_10]: He also was in there.

1219
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:49,828
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was one named Eagle, who was a bodyguard.

1220
01:31:50,889 --> 01:31:52,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you had your...

1221
01:31:53,912 --> 01:32:01,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Your last two opponents you had, Adon, who was Muay Thai, and he actually came back for Street Fighter Alpha as well.

1222
01:32:01,755 --> 01:32:03,756
[SPEAKER_10]: He was the one with the very interesting hair.

1223
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:06,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sagat, who was the boss.

1224
01:32:06,497 --> 01:32:08,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And now Sagat, of course, came back for just about every version.

1225
01:32:11,366 --> 01:32:20,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So it came out, it was produced by Takashi Nishiyama, who we've seen as Piston Takashi.

1226
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:23,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you seeing a two player?

1227
01:32:24,454 --> 01:32:30,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was just looking at that because the other video ran out, so I went and looked at some other matches.

1228
01:32:31,804 --> 01:32:41,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It was planned by Hiroshi Matsumoto, and the two of them actually went on to do a bunch of games for SNK, including Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting.

1229
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:47,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they came back to work on Street Fighter IV.

1230
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:50,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all know Inafune, Keiji, right?

1231
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:52,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Megaman.

1232
01:32:53,512 --> 01:32:57,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he also designed the character portraits in Street Fighter.

1233
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:03,146
[SPEAKER_10]: and, uh, so we've got, like I said, there were two different versions in the arcade.

1234
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:08,968
[SPEAKER_10]: There was the regular version, um, that had the six button and the deluxe one that had the pressure-sensitive pads.

1235
01:33:09,309 --> 01:33:11,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could basically hit the pad and you hit it as hard as the pad did.

1236
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:13,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1237
01:33:15,302 --> 01:33:16,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, in the U.S.

1238
01:33:16,443 --> 01:33:27,490
[SPEAKER_10]: version, well, I'd say in any non-Japanese version, I should say, Ken and Ryu were dubbed in English so that their moves were like Psycho Fire, Dragon Punch, and Hurricane Kick.

1239
01:33:28,371 --> 01:33:31,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And then later versions just left the voices in Japanese.

1240
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:36,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So, basically, when you get into Street Fighter IV, it actually has both versions of it.

1241
01:33:37,837 --> 01:33:37,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1242
01:33:39,904 --> 01:33:40,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, the home versions.

1243
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:43,392
[SPEAKER_10]: There was, like I said, Fighting Street for the TurboGrafx.

1244
01:33:43,753 --> 01:33:44,896
[SPEAKER_10]: They had an arranged soundtrack.

1245
01:33:45,818 --> 01:33:45,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1246
01:33:49,095 --> 01:33:50,196
[SPEAKER_10]: This was interesting, too.

1247
01:33:52,076 --> 01:34:00,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it didn't have a six-button controller, your strength of your moves were determined by how long you held the subsequent kick or punch button.

1248
01:34:01,339 --> 01:34:06,181
[SPEAKER_10]: They later did six-button controllers, though, when it's saved for TurboGrafx.

1249
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:09,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, did you know, Rob, that there was a Commodore 64 version?

1250
01:34:11,332 --> 01:34:12,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I did.

1251
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:13,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that sad?

1252
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:15,276
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, I did know about the Commodore 64 version.

1253
01:34:15,336 --> 01:34:16,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I had it.

1254
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was also one for the ZX Spectrum.

1255
01:34:20,682 --> 01:34:23,625
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't play that great, by the way, because the Commodore 64 only has one button.

1256
01:34:24,486 --> 01:34:27,970
[SPEAKER_10]: There's MS-DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST that came out by U.S.

1257
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:28,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold.

1258
01:34:29,491 --> 01:34:41,261
[SPEAKER_10]: and, um, they were, uh, I believe published by Tiertex and they said that they actually came out with their, um, with an unofficial sequel called Human Killing Machines.

1259
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:44,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting, huh?

1260
01:34:45,484 --> 01:34:46,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, um, U.S.

1261
01:34:46,345 --> 01:34:48,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold also was the one that published by Commando in 1943, so.

1262
01:34:48,587 --> 01:34:48,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, um...

1263
01:34:55,575 --> 01:35:06,282
[SPEAKER_10]: The, uh, as far as this, I mean, it was considered to be one of the games of the year, as stated by Sinclair User.

1264
01:35:08,183 --> 01:35:12,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And C++VG said it had no lasting appeal whatsoever.

1265
01:35:15,027 --> 01:35:17,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how did that last?

1266
01:35:17,668 --> 01:35:20,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Lucky that somebody felt differently and gave it a sequel, huh?

1267
01:35:20,523 --> 01:35:23,045
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1268
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:53,051
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's available for Windows PC and the Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP and Capcom Classics Volume 2 for PS2 and Xbox.

1269
01:35:54,432 --> 01:35:54,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1270
01:35:54,793 --> 01:35:55,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it?

1271
01:35:56,394 --> 01:35:56,834
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1272
01:35:56,874 --> 01:36:02,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Your classic game of the week, Street Fighter or Fighting Street, I guess, right?

1273
01:36:02,138 --> 01:36:02,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Depending on where you are.

1274
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,141
[SPEAKER_14]: For a variety of systems.

1275
01:36:05,161 --> 01:36:09,084
[SPEAKER_10]: You could just be doing nothing apparently but shorty again over and over and over and over.

1276
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:14,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to move right into some rapid fire news tonight.

1277
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:20,259
[SPEAKER_14]: If things seem a little bit compressed, that's because we compressed our regular show because of the April Fool's thing we did at the beginning.

1278
01:36:20,339 --> 01:36:22,482
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, it is moving at a different pace tonight.

1279
01:36:22,963 --> 01:36:25,246
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's just go right into rapid fire news.

1280
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:25,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1281
01:36:26,528 --> 01:36:31,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about some Easter eggs.

1282
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,050
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is kind of funny.

1283
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:39,632
[SPEAKER_13]: There was actually an Easter egg that was found on the Nintendo 64 version of GoldenEye.

1284
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:44,614
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually an emulator for the ZX Spectrum.

1285
01:36:45,094 --> 01:36:45,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1286
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:14,852
[SPEAKER_13]: The company, well, Rare, they had also, I guess, developed games for the ZX Spectrum back in the day.

1287
01:37:15,013 --> 01:37:18,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of interesting that that was on there.

1288
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:23,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then this is kind of disappointing news.

1289
01:37:23,361 --> 01:37:27,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Kid Icarus Uprising actually began as a Wii game.

1290
01:37:27,622 --> 01:37:30,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and it was being developed on PC as well.

1291
01:37:31,363 --> 01:37:36,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I would imagine it's the dev kits or PCs, but as a Wii game, I, yes, exactly.

1292
01:37:36,084 --> 01:37:37,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of think it should have stayed a Wii game too.

1293
01:37:38,065 --> 01:37:38,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1294
01:37:38,405 --> 01:37:40,286
[SPEAKER_13]: It would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game.

1295
01:37:40,586 --> 01:37:45,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to say that they couldn't bring it to consoles later on, but it would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game.

1296
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:56,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that I'm playing it and thinking about the controls too, I can see how it totally was a Wii game and it would have been because you could use the little thumb stick to move and you aim at the TV.

1297
01:37:56,815 --> 01:37:59,516
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually makes a lot more sense as a Wii game.

1298
01:38:00,677 --> 01:38:02,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Although the 3D is beautiful in it though.

1299
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing that's really disappointing though.

1300
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:11,865
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually have video from the game running on the Wii version and

1301
01:38:13,005 --> 01:38:13,706
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gorgeous.

1302
01:38:13,826 --> 01:38:14,987
[SPEAKER_13]: It still looks gorgeous.

1303
01:38:15,007 --> 01:38:15,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.

1304
01:38:15,407 --> 01:38:16,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see the video.

1305
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:16,848
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

1306
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:20,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's just... Wait, is it on the story here?

1307
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:20,911
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the story.

1308
01:38:21,191 --> 01:38:28,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they actually show... It looks like... I mean, it's basically what you see in the 3DS version, just minus any enemies and stuff like that.

1309
01:38:28,576 --> 01:38:31,358
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I mean, wouldn't that have been awesome?

1310
01:38:31,438 --> 01:38:32,798
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the first level.

1311
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:41,624
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks like it could just be the screen from the 3DS one, but... But, yeah, that's the prototype version that they had.

1312
01:38:41,644 --> 01:38:42,245
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, cool.

1313
01:38:44,227 --> 01:38:48,591
[SPEAKER_13]: So sad that it could have been... They should still do it as a PC game.

1314
01:38:49,412 --> 01:38:51,094
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still time to put it out as a Wii game.

1315
01:38:51,114 --> 01:38:51,514
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

1316
01:38:51,534 --> 01:38:53,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Wii U game.

1317
01:38:54,217 --> 01:38:54,617
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.

1318
01:38:56,679 --> 01:38:57,981
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah.

1319
01:38:58,902 --> 01:38:59,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Disappointing.

1320
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:00,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Very disappointing.

1321
01:39:01,544 --> 01:39:30,251
[SPEAKER_14]: less disappointing is the success of Journey which is a PlayStation Network game I really didn't talk enough about because it came out at the time I was getting back into Mass Effect but this is a great experience on the PlayStation 3 and again I really suggest you guys check it out however it sounds like a lot of you already have Journey is now the fastest selling Sony Computer Entertainment America region PSN game in all of recorded history so check that out the honor before that was Infamous 2 Festival of Blood so

1322
01:39:31,692 --> 01:39:38,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, so Journey has been doing very, very, very well online and April 10th is when the soundtrack is coming out.

1323
01:39:38,817 --> 01:39:42,560
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get that either on the PlayStation Store or you can do it in iTunes.

1324
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:46,584
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's going to be coming out on April 10th and it does have a gorgeous soundtrack with it too.

1325
01:39:46,684 --> 01:39:50,727
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, Journey on PlayStation Network is, it's a trip.

1326
01:39:50,927 --> 01:39:51,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it a lot.

1327
01:39:51,868 --> 01:39:56,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're going to be doing LittleBigPlanet stuff for Journey as well.

1328
01:39:56,852 --> 01:39:58,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did read about that.

1329
01:39:58,273 --> 01:39:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone needs to get it for me.

1330
01:40:01,536 --> 01:40:02,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe for your birthday.

1331
01:40:03,016 --> 01:40:04,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1332
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:11,381
[SPEAKER_14]: If PC games are more your thing, Audiosurf, especially if you like music games, is probably one that you've checked out before.

1333
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:12,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, guess what?

1334
01:40:12,622 --> 01:40:13,683
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to stop there.

1335
01:40:13,783 --> 01:40:17,025
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a website for a little something called Audiosurf Air.

1336
01:40:17,705 --> 01:40:18,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows what that is?

1337
01:40:18,786 --> 01:40:24,731
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be a mobile version of the game, but it sounds like it's more likely a sequel to the original AudioSurf.

1338
01:40:25,091 --> 01:40:27,073
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some screenshots on the website.

1339
01:40:27,293 --> 01:40:33,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, everything is subject to change, but it does look like, I don't know, the little machine looks a little more like a boat or something now.

1340
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:35,440
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is definitely possible they've changed some things up.

1341
01:40:36,341 --> 01:40:40,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they are recruiting for beta signups right now, so you can check that out on their website, which is...

1342
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:51,170
[SPEAKER_14]: It's air.audio-surf.com air.audio-surf.com That's a lot of punctuation.

1343
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:52,190
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

1344
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:52,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Audio Surf Air.

1345
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:53,671
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura?

1346
01:40:54,771 --> 01:41:00,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other news, Rob, playing with your game.

1347
01:41:00,314 --> 01:41:01,234
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a swap note.

1348
01:41:01,274 --> 01:41:01,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to check it.

1349
01:41:02,075 --> 01:41:02,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it Kat?

1350
01:41:03,984 --> 01:41:08,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I sent a swap note earlier, and it's my little April Fool's joke.

1351
01:41:08,587 --> 01:41:10,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, did you get the one from Reggie?

1352
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:20,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I did get the one from Reggie, and you can use him as a level 5 guy in Find Me or whatever, but he got scared off by the monster, and I didn't get to use him at all, and that pissed me the fuck off.

1353
01:41:20,614 --> 01:41:21,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking asshole.

1354
01:41:21,535 --> 01:41:22,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, right?

1355
01:41:22,696 --> 01:41:23,556
[SPEAKER_10]: So, news.

1356
01:41:24,897 --> 01:41:25,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to give you a hard time, Rob.

1357
01:41:26,778 --> 01:41:28,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Mortal Kombat Vita has a release date.

1358
01:41:29,339 --> 01:41:33,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be coming out in Europe on May 4th.

1359
01:41:35,382 --> 01:41:37,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't see what the American date is.

1360
01:41:37,963 --> 01:41:38,183
[SPEAKER_13]: U.S.

1361
01:41:38,263 --> 01:41:39,063
[SPEAKER_13]: is May 1st.

1362
01:41:39,103 --> 01:41:39,743
[SPEAKER_13]: May 1st, right?

1363
01:41:39,784 --> 01:41:40,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1364
01:41:40,824 --> 01:41:45,806
[SPEAKER_10]: So, basically, it's going to have touchscreen-enabled fatalities and a challenge tower.

1365
01:41:46,306 --> 01:41:47,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

1366
01:41:47,407 --> 01:41:49,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And 150 Vita-exclusive missions.

1367
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:50,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

1368
01:41:50,748 --> 01:41:52,309
[SPEAKER_14]: The Vita challenge tower could be neat.

1369
01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:55,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they're going to incorporate a lot of the Vita stuff into it, so...

1370
01:41:55,603 --> 01:41:56,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome Knots

1371
01:42:10,654 --> 01:42:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a multiplayer arena beat-em-up that's going to be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on May 2nd, put out by Ranamo Games.

1372
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:29,044
[SPEAKER_10]: So you basically beat people up in teams of three online or via split-screen locally, and there's no price tag on it yet.

1373
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:33,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranamo is a Dutch developer.

1374
01:42:33,927 --> 01:42:34,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

1375
01:42:34,947 --> 01:42:36,268
[SPEAKER_10]: They put out Swords and Soldiers.

1376
01:42:37,703 --> 01:42:39,304
[SPEAKER_14]: All righty.

1377
01:42:39,384 --> 01:42:41,386
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get into the Fugle Question of the Week.

1378
01:42:41,586 --> 01:42:46,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, though, I think I want to do an unscripted break just because the recording is starting to get a little long.

1379
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:50,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to save the recording so we don't lose it so I get the temp space back.

1380
01:42:50,812 --> 01:42:52,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to do a little technical break.

1381
01:42:53,313 --> 01:42:55,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we come back, I'm going to do just a two-minute song here.

1382
01:42:55,295 --> 01:43:03,340
[SPEAKER_14]: When we come back, we will do more of Orange Launch Radio, including the Fugle Question of the Week, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR, and...

1383
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:09,387
[SPEAKER_14]: your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR we'll get to those right after a quick impromptu break here

1384
01:43:15,945 --> 01:43:22,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this April Fool's Day edition, episode number 452 of our show.

1385
01:43:23,169 --> 01:43:28,953
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you tuned in late tonight, you missed a little bit of retro OLR at the top of the show, so check it out when it hits the podcast feed.

1386
01:43:28,993 --> 01:43:36,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it will all be in the... Somebody was asking if they could get a recording of the beginning of the show tonight, and I was like, it'll be in the podcast, so it'll be all there.

1387
01:43:36,477 --> 01:43:44,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Songs and all, because we very intentionally pick songs that were from the games themselves, so they're licensed a little differently, so we can...

1388
01:43:44,782 --> 01:43:45,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know

1389
01:44:08,786 --> 01:44:12,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyhow, let's get back into the show.

1390
01:44:13,012 --> 01:44:13,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Fugle Question of the Week!

1391
01:44:14,173 --> 01:44:17,778
[SPEAKER_14]: It's where we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google+, and we call it Fugle.

1392
01:44:26,533 --> 01:44:29,855
[SPEAKER_14]: No Bites on Google this week, which has me convinced nobody is on Google+.

1393
01:44:54,850 --> 01:45:13,153
[SPEAKER_14]: and since I'm being forced to move to this stupid timeline thing on Facebook I like it Google Plus doesn't seem so bad and our page is now timeline you can get an ad for that by the way I think I will I hate the way timeline looks I hate it I hate the left and the right side stuff I love it well I hate it

1394
01:45:14,178 --> 01:45:16,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is, the FUVO question of the week.

1395
01:45:16,861 --> 01:45:24,549
[SPEAKER_14]: What is your favorite urban legend or April Fool's joke in the gaming community that turned out to be fake or perhaps even real years later?

1396
01:45:24,929 --> 01:45:28,733
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, Shang Long, Sonic and Super Smash Brothers, Melee, and so forth.

1397
01:45:29,734 --> 01:45:31,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Be sure to sign your comments.

1398
01:45:32,638 --> 01:45:34,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, if you wrote on Facebook, then you already did.

1399
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:41,802
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkTetsuya writes, honestly, I don't think anything could top Shang Long from EGM April 92.

1400
01:45:42,482 --> 01:45:44,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, he even quoted the magazine and the date.

1401
01:45:45,363 --> 01:45:50,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep in mind that this was even before we had the internet, much less as big as it is today.

1402
01:45:51,165 --> 01:45:56,267
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to give the editors credit for sticking the find the AFD joke contest right underneath it.

1403
01:45:56,987 --> 01:46:23,085
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree, that was a pretty epic troll on behalf of that magazine I remember they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year and they kind of set the benchmark but I loved when their jokes would become realities like Ermac in Mortal Kombat 1 ended up being a real thing that was kind of funny Cody T writes us and says one that happened just recently, Assassin's Creed Connect and there's a video trailer for it and everything it's actually pretty hilarious

1404
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,032
[SPEAKER_14]: and he linked us to the video trailer there.

1405
01:46:25,813 --> 01:46:26,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see this.

1406
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:27,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched it.

1407
01:46:28,738 --> 01:46:36,089
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like the normal Kinect videos and you see this guy do this backflip in his living room and stuff.

1408
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:39,334
[SPEAKER_13]: It just gets more and more ridiculous.

1409
01:46:40,397 --> 01:46:47,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Porkchop writes and says, how about the Final Fantasy VII tech demo for PlayStation 3 that had everybody lose their minds and assume there'd be a remake?

1410
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimate fanboy troll.

1411
01:46:49,421 --> 01:46:58,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, to be fair, that wasn't an April Fool's joke, but we did say urban legend or April Fool's joke, so that was a huge troll on somebody's part.

1412
01:46:59,385 --> 01:47:00,846
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to wonder if they didn't consider it.

1413
01:47:00,866 --> 01:47:02,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I add mine in here real quick?

1414
01:47:02,486 --> 01:47:02,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, of course.

1415
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:03,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you get to answer two.

1416
01:47:04,147 --> 01:47:12,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember when they were going to do Mega Man Legends 3 and then they said they were going to put out a demo for it and that you'd have to pay for the demo?

1417
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:14,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they said, fuck you, we're not going to do it.

1418
01:47:14,692 --> 01:47:15,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha ha.

1419
01:47:15,692 --> 01:47:17,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was a... That wasn't a troll.

1420
01:47:17,353 --> 01:47:18,553
[SPEAKER_14]: That was just fucking mean.

1421
01:47:19,054 --> 01:47:19,854
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what that was.

1422
01:47:20,578 --> 01:47:29,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, by the way, and I do follow them on Facebook still, 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends 3 to return or whatever that is.

1423
01:47:30,304 --> 01:47:32,626
[SPEAKER_13]: They're up to 80,000 likes.

1424
01:47:33,506 --> 01:47:35,347
[SPEAKER_14]: That's more than a million moms, right?

1425
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:36,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1426
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:41,251
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, hey, if you haven't liked them yet, maybe you should.

1427
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:48,036
[SPEAKER_14]: This just in, there are more Mega Man fans than moms, apparently.

1428
01:47:48,136 --> 01:47:48,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Go figure.

1429
01:47:49,237 --> 01:47:50,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

1430
01:47:51,258 --> 01:47:51,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I kid, I kid.

1431
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:55,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Tyler M says, Goken in Street Fighter 2.

1432
01:47:55,341 --> 01:47:56,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember that one.

1433
01:47:56,561 --> 01:48:01,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, because it was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, and now he's in Street Fighter 4.

1434
01:48:01,924 --> 01:48:02,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, how funny.

1435
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:03,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot that one.

1436
01:48:03,885 --> 01:48:06,327
[SPEAKER_14]: That must have been a little later after the Shang Long ordeal.

1437
01:48:07,354 --> 01:48:11,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Phil G writes, I'm still not convinced the Diablo 3 release date is real.

1438
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:13,958
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very valid concern, sir.

1439
01:48:14,298 --> 01:48:15,959
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have people who are already playing the beta.

1440
01:48:16,899 --> 01:48:19,381
[SPEAKER_14]: The beta's been out for a while now, though.

1441
01:48:19,921 --> 01:48:21,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to be sometime soon.

1442
01:48:21,882 --> 01:48:23,503
[SPEAKER_14]: It was practically done in October.

1443
01:48:24,944 --> 01:48:29,746
[SPEAKER_13]: You know there are some people that are concerned that the Gran Turismo 5 release date isn't accurate either.

1444
01:48:31,587 --> 01:48:32,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Also a legitimate concern.

1445
01:48:32,868 --> 01:48:32,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1446
01:48:34,616 --> 01:48:45,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, UnfoldedRaptor writes and says, when I was in third grade back in 2000, I feel so old.

1447
01:48:45,672 --> 01:48:46,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up.

1448
01:48:47,214 --> 01:48:47,735
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1449
01:48:48,155 --> 01:48:48,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Shush.

1450
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:54,041
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a great troll from Unfolded Raptor right there.

1451
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:54,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, sir.

1452
01:48:54,942 --> 01:48:55,222
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1453
01:48:56,423 --> 01:49:04,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to tell my friend at school that if he threw flares in the corner of a certain room in Tomb Raider The Last Revelation, that it would skip him to the end of the game.

1454
01:49:04,548 --> 01:49:09,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he kept doing that, and it ticked him off that he had to restart the level again and again and waste his flares.

1455
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:19,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So he comes back and tells me the next day that if I went through the whole game of Star Fox 64 without doing a barrel roll, that at the end, Andross would come out and shake his butt.

1456
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to remember they're in third grade, so this is funny.

1457
01:49:25,412 --> 01:49:30,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Star Fox 64 over and over for about a week before I was convinced that no such thing existed.

1458
01:49:30,795 --> 01:49:34,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Years later, my friend told me he lied about Andross, and it served me right.

1459
01:49:34,618 --> 01:49:39,301
[SPEAKER_14]: But deep down in my heart, I want to believe that such a secret ending actually exists.

1460
01:49:39,961 --> 01:49:43,264
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an April Fool's prank that has stuck with me throughout the years.

1461
01:49:45,385 --> 01:49:52,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like this needs an animated GIF file of Andross shaking his butt with, I want to believe.

1462
01:49:57,431 --> 01:50:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: that's a good story what I like about that story is it really has nothing to do with gaming magazines or press but it's just like people trolling each other and that's that's great all right lastly uh Hunter R writes and says I remember last year this game that claimed to be Duke Nukem Forever came out except it was totally lame there are people who are still convinced that shit is real haha

1463
01:50:18,089 --> 01:50:18,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I see what you did there.

1464
01:50:20,233 --> 01:50:21,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I see what you did there.

1465
01:50:21,496 --> 01:50:23,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's it for our Fugle question of the week.

1466
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:27,047
[SPEAKER_13]: There's developers that think that the critics went too hard on them.

1467
01:50:33,254 --> 01:50:36,496
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, those are like the 9-11 conspiracy theories.

1468
01:50:36,516 --> 01:50:38,378
[SPEAKER_13]: 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3.

1469
01:50:38,678 --> 01:50:39,438
[SPEAKER_13]: They're up to 81,642.

1470
01:50:39,478 --> 01:50:42,941
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually been going up quite a bit.

1471
01:50:43,801 --> 01:50:45,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So they keep that up.

1472
01:50:45,843 --> 01:50:47,884
[SPEAKER_13]: You may be able to hit that before June.

1473
01:50:48,585 --> 01:50:51,046
[SPEAKER_14]: I would go like the page, but I'm over it.

1474
01:50:53,228 --> 01:50:54,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just where I'm at.

1475
01:50:54,168 --> 01:50:54,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm over it.

1476
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:57,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's get back into some more news, Loki.

1477
01:50:58,311 --> 01:51:04,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, unfortunately something that may not be coming back quite as soon as Mega Man Legends 3.

1478
01:51:07,486 --> 01:51:25,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Two PSP games which had problems with their save files or they could be exploited to launch a homebrew emulator on the PlayStation Vita, basically through the PSP emulator on there.

1479
01:51:28,209 --> 01:51:30,110
[SPEAKER_13]: and allow them to run unsigned code.

1480
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:47,038
[SPEAKER_13]: So before we knew about Motorstorm Arctic Rift that was taken off and now Hotshots Tennis or Everybody's Tennis in Europe has also been taken down because it was also being used in exploits to run homebrew on the Vita.

1481
01:51:48,059 --> 01:51:56,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what happens is these people release a method that requires one of these games and then it goes away.

1482
01:51:57,028 --> 01:51:57,549
[SPEAKER_13]: PlayStation Vita Hacked

1483
01:52:17,066 --> 01:52:19,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I found that to be interesting, that they were using the old games to do it.

1484
01:52:19,947 --> 01:52:21,547
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's only hacked within the emulator.

1485
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:25,008
[SPEAKER_13]: But the emulator isn't as strapped as it was on the PSP.

1486
01:52:25,168 --> 01:52:26,608
[SPEAKER_13]: You can still do a little bit more.

1487
01:52:26,928 --> 01:52:28,889
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a little bit more memory and stuff to work with.

1488
01:52:29,469 --> 01:52:30,889
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's still within the emulator.

1489
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:33,330
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't actually have access to the whole Vita stuff yet.

1490
01:52:33,470 --> 01:52:35,450
[SPEAKER_14]: But it allowed you to install Linux on the Vita?

1491
01:52:36,230 --> 01:52:40,751
[SPEAKER_13]: It would allow you to run emulators and maybe ISOs.

1492
01:52:40,851 --> 01:52:43,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know about that, but at least emulators.

1493
01:52:46,522 --> 01:53:14,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised you didn't get in on this before it got shut down I don't download PSP games other than the ones I got for free and honestly I'm kind of over playing emulators on stuff right now if I want to play emulators I have my PSP still I have a Dingu that only plays emulators I don't really need another system to run homebrew stuff on right now

1494
01:53:15,053 --> 01:53:17,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar

1495
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:30,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I try not to.

1496
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,761
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1497
01:54:15,079 --> 01:54:23,604
[SPEAKER_14]: EMI is suing 4mm Games and Terminal Reality saying that songs were used in the game that they weren't entitled to.

1498
01:54:24,564 --> 01:54:28,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Rapstar apparently got some songs from labels like Def Jam and so forth.

1499
01:54:28,387 --> 01:54:35,130
[SPEAKER_14]: EMI says though it owned small percentages of other tracks that were nominally owned by other labels.

1500
01:54:35,811 --> 01:54:36,351
[SPEAKER_14]: That's weird.

1501
01:54:36,511 --> 01:54:37,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know, right?

1502
01:54:37,511 --> 01:54:47,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the examples include DJ Khaled's I'm So Hood, Lil Wayne's Got Money, which EMI said they own 10% of one of them and 30% of the other.

1503
01:54:48,693 --> 01:54:49,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, right?

1504
01:54:49,433 --> 01:54:59,095
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just me that multiple publishers... The way these things get bought and who finances it and so forth, I can kind of see where this happens.

1505
01:54:59,135 --> 01:55:01,816
[SPEAKER_14]: But EMI says 54 tracks infringe on their rights.

1506
01:55:02,216 --> 01:55:04,476
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going after $8 million in damages.

1507
01:55:05,970 --> 01:55:10,514
[SPEAKER_14]: But the weird thing to me is that this game is kind of old now.

1508
01:55:10,634 --> 01:55:12,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was 2010 or 9.

1509
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:13,898
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1510
01:55:15,339 --> 01:55:16,120
[SPEAKER_14]: It was that same E3.

1511
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,461
[SPEAKER_13]: It was October.

1512
01:55:18,802 --> 01:55:19,623
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in October.

1513
01:55:19,883 --> 01:55:23,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember seeing it at E3, and I want to say it was the same year that Game Room had come out.

1514
01:55:23,907 --> 01:55:24,868
[SPEAKER_14]: So what year was Game Room?

1515
01:55:25,609 --> 01:55:25,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that 2009?

1516
01:55:25,889 --> 01:55:26,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was 2009.

1517
01:55:26,409 --> 01:55:26,990
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

1518
01:55:27,010 --> 01:55:27,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1519
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:32,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1520
01:55:33,591 --> 01:55:38,596
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 2010, actually.

1521
01:55:38,696 --> 01:55:39,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

1522
01:55:39,937 --> 01:55:40,397
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1523
01:55:40,417 --> 01:55:44,201
[SPEAKER_13]: 2010, and yeah.

1524
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:46,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And they shut down the community site in 2011.

1525
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:47,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Dope.

1526
01:55:49,786 --> 01:55:50,086
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1527
01:55:50,766 --> 01:55:51,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on to the mailbag.

1528
01:55:52,108 --> 01:55:53,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Every week you guys send us e-mails.

1529
01:55:54,858 --> 01:55:56,960
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1530
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:19,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1531
01:56:19,818 --> 01:56:19,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1532
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:49,694
[SPEAKER_10]: They've always had free artistic reign, producing tons of exclusive comics and characters that never really gained traction elsewhere.

1533
01:56:50,734 --> 01:56:57,056
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the 90s, Disney Italy decided to launch a couple of experiments, some successful, some less so, but all quite surprising.

1534
01:56:57,096 --> 01:57:03,518
[SPEAKER_10]: These included P.K.N.A., a Marvel-slash-DC-style comic featuring Paper... Paper-y Nick?

1535
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:10,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Donald Duck's superhero alter ego as he fought aliens, time travelers, and mutants, featured violence and actual character deaths.

1536
01:57:11,241 --> 01:57:12,642
[SPEAKER_10]: The most successful of the experiments.

1537
01:57:13,002 --> 01:57:19,046
[SPEAKER_10]: This even got its own video game although that was based on the shitty third series that fans like to forget ever happened.

1538
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:20,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I say real quick?

1539
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:26,112
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole Epic Mickey thing, since it's nowhere else in our show row, I don't think we've covered it here.

1540
01:57:26,452 --> 01:57:32,333
[SPEAKER_14]: There's that awesome new, I don't know if you heard, but with Epic Mickey 2, they're also doing the 3DS game.

1541
01:57:32,353 --> 01:57:34,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the 3DS isn't a port of Epic Mickey 2.

1542
01:57:34,954 --> 01:57:37,315
[SPEAKER_14]: The 3DS game is a new Castle of Illusion game.

1543
01:57:37,775 --> 01:57:38,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

1544
01:57:38,355 --> 01:57:38,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

1545
01:57:38,735 --> 01:57:45,997
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're doing stages like classic stages, but they're doing stuff like Tangled, and it's a bunch of new Disney movies in it too.

1546
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:46,257
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.

1547
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:47,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, sold!

1548
01:57:48,398 --> 01:57:48,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1549
01:57:50,178 --> 01:57:51,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds better than the console one to me.

1550
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:53,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to continue?

1551
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:55,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, ma'am.

1552
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:58,861
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Witch, a shoujo manga-style comic.

1553
01:57:59,241 --> 01:58:03,903
[SPEAKER_10]: This one also ran for quite a long time, also getting its own TV show and being turned into a real manga in Japan.

1554
01:58:04,403 --> 01:58:08,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to be confused with Winx Club, which was a cheap and nasty knockoff of this.

1555
01:58:09,978 --> 01:58:13,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Ritty Topolino, which is what you get when you cross Disney with Monty Python.

1556
01:58:14,121 --> 01:58:25,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Short-lived but hilarious, things they did included publishing their Christmas issue in July, inserting deliberate mistakes into the comic strip, and one memorable feature celebrated the Olympics by having Mickey compete against a garden gnome.

1557
01:58:26,751 --> 01:58:29,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The inanimate gnome not only won, but the end of many also dumps Mickey for it.

1558
01:58:31,152 --> 01:58:33,475
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, the darkest of the bunch.

1559
01:58:33,936 --> 01:58:38,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Mickey is a hard-boiled detective in his own noir comic, solving mysteries and dealing with bad guys.

1560
01:58:39,103 --> 01:58:46,833
[SPEAKER_10]: This was so dark later, issues tried to soften the story by making it look like Mickey was just watching the episode as a film rather than him being the actual protagonist.

1561
01:58:47,894 --> 01:58:56,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Then in the early 2000s, Disney Italy got a new director who decided all this awesome teen-oriented stuff was too bold and basically killed off every one of these projects, which is a great shame.

1562
01:58:56,538 --> 01:58:57,999
[SPEAKER_10]: They all deserved a lot more recognition.

1563
01:58:58,579 --> 01:59:08,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, PQNA and MMMM never made it to the States, so your only chance of reading these fine series is to learn Italian or look for fan-translated scans on the net.

1564
01:59:08,644 --> 01:59:15,027
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I would love to see some of the edgier characters in Epic Mickey, too, but since they're virtually unknown outside of Italy, not much chance of that, eh?

1565
01:59:16,147 --> 01:59:18,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, late and take care, Picaruno.

1566
01:59:19,229 --> 01:59:22,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the email, Picaruno, and just for you, since you brought it up.

1567
01:59:39,477 --> 01:59:40,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

1568
01:59:41,519 --> 01:59:47,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is actually from... There was a link from the Star Tribune.

1569
01:59:48,525 --> 01:59:55,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, Best Buy lost a staggering $1.2 billion as it was deeply discounted merchandise to keep pace with rivals Amazon and Walmart.

1570
01:59:56,711 --> 02:00:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: All in all, Best Buy hopes to shed $800 million over the next three years, saving the company plans to use...

1571
02:00:04,759 --> 02:00:04,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So, wow.

1572
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:19,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy

1573
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:39,441
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, Best Buy is going to have to be aggressive if they want to stay competitive.

1574
02:00:40,282 --> 02:00:52,588
[SPEAKER_14]: It will probably help that more states are forcing Amazon to charge sales tax because there's a lot of people that use Amazon simply because they don't have to pay tax when they buy on Amazon, but that's going to be changing, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it.

1575
02:00:54,524 --> 02:01:09,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email I have a neighbor of mine who owns a fairly large pasture On this pasture he allows a number of animals to freely graze Horses, cows, sheep, whatever On the fence that lines the property is a series of signs that all say the same thing Free manure, inquire at the house

1576
02:01:10,046 --> 02:01:11,588
[SPEAKER_10]: By now manure, he means bullshit.

1577
02:01:11,988 --> 02:01:14,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh new, high quality bullshit.

1578
02:01:14,491 --> 02:01:16,293
[SPEAKER_10]: My neighbor's bullshit is free to anyone.

1579
02:01:17,774 --> 02:01:19,496
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to haul it away yourself.

1580
02:01:20,137 --> 02:01:24,541
[SPEAKER_10]: As I looked at my Twitter feed on Wednesday, I began to wonder why people aren't all a Twitter about my neighbor's bullshit.

1581
02:01:25,462 --> 02:01:25,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Yum!

1582
02:01:53,394 --> 02:01:58,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Mainly because no one actually cares about actual bullshit Did you see the ad today for the Chick-fil-A steak sandwich?

1583
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:03,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did That was pretty funny Is that it for emails or we have one more?

1584
02:02:04,004 --> 02:02:12,312
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more, but I wondered if you had a rebuttal for Why is real bullshit not as talked about as the bullshit people actually care about?

1585
02:02:14,932 --> 02:02:17,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Because your neighbor's not famous and doesn't make video game systems.

1586
02:02:17,574 --> 02:02:19,015
[SPEAKER_14]: The end.

1587
02:02:19,235 --> 02:02:23,418
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of game sites that run with bullshit or else they'd have nothing else to publish.

1588
02:02:24,178 --> 02:02:29,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of shit, EA is still up for grabs for Worst Company in America.

1589
02:02:29,702 --> 02:02:40,869
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you go to Consumerist.com and vote, I believe tomorrow is when they're having... I don't know if it's tomorrow or maybe the early part of next week that they're actually voting for the semifinals.

1590
02:02:41,209 --> 02:02:41,370
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1591
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:43,311
[SPEAKER_13]: They can do it.

1592
02:02:43,572 --> 02:02:47,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And this year, they're also giving away three different golden poos.

1593
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:50,840
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have the golden poo, the silver poo, and the bronze poo this year.

1594
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:51,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

1595
02:02:51,701 --> 02:02:54,824
[SPEAKER_13]: So they still have a chance as long as they win next round.

1596
02:02:55,325 --> 02:02:57,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, congratulations.

1597
02:02:57,627 --> 02:02:57,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1598
02:02:58,368 --> 02:02:59,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Two emails left.

1599
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:00,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me?

1600
02:03:03,206 --> 02:03:03,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I had to burp.

1601
02:03:04,086 --> 02:03:04,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

1602
02:03:30,872 --> 02:03:31,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Good pick.

1603
02:03:32,454 --> 02:03:37,498
[SPEAKER_10]: After anxiously connecting all of the cables and the single controller, I was relieved to find the PS1 was still kicking.

1604
02:03:37,878 --> 02:03:40,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And better yet, I jammed to Don't Stop Me Now as a celebration anthem.

1605
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:41,762
[SPEAKER_10]: That song is great.

1606
02:03:42,062 --> 02:03:44,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the scene in Shaun of the Dead where they're beating up the zombie to that song.

1607
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:45,665
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best.

1608
02:03:46,506 --> 02:03:49,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't touched a PS1 since 2000, back when I was nine.

1609
02:03:49,648 --> 02:03:50,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1610
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:53,372
[SPEAKER_14]: The nostalgia began to return to me.

1611
02:03:53,432 --> 02:03:56,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not enjoying all this age of our listeners this week.

1612
02:03:57,575 --> 02:04:07,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember being blown away by games like Einhander, Gran Turismo, and Twisted Metal My question to you guys is this With my first ever PS1, what game should I immediately own?

1613
02:04:08,465 --> 02:04:12,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, what were the seminal titles of the PS1 era?

1614
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:20,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I like all types of games, RPGs, platformers, horror, sports, fighting rhythm, you name it Also, where can I even find PS1 games anymore?

1615
02:04:20,916 --> 02:04:23,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks in advance, love the show, keep up the good work, Randy from Texas

1616
02:04:24,178 --> 02:04:27,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Flea Markets, you can find a lot of PlayStation 1 games that still... Amazon.

1617
02:04:28,141 --> 02:04:28,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?

1618
02:04:28,741 --> 02:04:29,882
[SPEAKER_14]: They still sell PlayStation 1 games?

1619
02:04:30,122 --> 02:04:31,543
[SPEAKER_10]: People sell stuff on Amazon all the time.

1620
02:04:31,623 --> 02:04:32,103
[SPEAKER_10]: eBay.

1621
02:04:32,844 --> 02:04:33,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Half.

1622
02:04:33,584 --> 02:04:36,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you should own right now.

1623
02:04:36,226 --> 02:04:37,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you definitely should own that one.

1624
02:04:37,967 --> 02:04:38,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Jumping Flash.

1625
02:04:39,048 --> 02:04:43,831
[SPEAKER_14]: If you enjoy music games at all, Parappa the Rapper and its sequel, Um Jam Malami.

1626
02:04:45,694 --> 02:04:51,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I also... They changed the whole import thing on the PS Slim, didn't they?

1627
02:04:52,176 --> 02:04:52,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1628
02:04:52,476 --> 02:04:57,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, yeah, that was the one that you had to use the memory card thing.

1629
02:04:59,197 --> 02:04:59,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I never had a Slim.

1630
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:03,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had the old one that we had the... The thing that plugs in the back?

1631
02:05:03,418 --> 02:05:03,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1632
02:05:04,519 --> 02:05:07,739
[SPEAKER_14]: You might as well get a Final Fantasy VII copy, too, because that was a must.

1633
02:05:07,779 --> 02:05:09,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Get Final Fantasy VII.

1634
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:09,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1635
02:05:10,228 --> 02:05:13,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Einhander, of course, you mentioned it.

1636
02:05:13,810 --> 02:05:15,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Even Ergeis.

1637
02:05:16,571 --> 02:05:20,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking loved Ergeis because of the RPG mode in Ergeis.

1638
02:05:21,174 --> 02:05:21,274
[SPEAKER_13]: R4.

1639
02:05:22,555 --> 02:05:22,975
[SPEAKER_10]: R4, yes.

1640
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:24,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And get a JogCon.

1641
02:05:25,476 --> 02:05:26,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get a JogCon.

1642
02:05:27,217 --> 02:05:28,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Really not worth it.

1643
02:05:28,838 --> 02:05:31,900
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought a JogCon and I was like, wow, this is crap.

1644
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:32,680
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what you need?

1645
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Wipe out with the NegCon.

1646
02:05:34,321 --> 02:05:35,742
[SPEAKER_13]: What if I have a JogCon still?

1647
02:05:36,122 --> 02:05:37,083
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got two of them.

1648
02:05:37,323 --> 02:05:38,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, Ridge Racer.

1649
02:05:39,164 --> 02:05:39,384
[SPEAKER_10]: That was R4.

1650
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:41,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Herp Derp.

1651
02:05:41,651 --> 02:05:42,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridge Racer Revolution.

1652
02:05:43,992 --> 02:05:46,733
[SPEAKER_10]: But Wipeout with an egg con is probably one of the best experiences.

1653
02:05:46,753 --> 02:05:48,193
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was thinking of was Ridge Racer Revolution.

1654
02:05:50,434 --> 02:05:51,055
[SPEAKER_10]: God, what else?

1655
02:05:51,515 --> 02:05:58,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, I just picked up Bust a Move 2 Arcade Edition, which is literally the best version of Bust a Move you can find.

1656
02:06:00,279 --> 02:06:00,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Chrono Cross?

1657
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:01,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Chrono Cross.

1658
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Chrono Trigger re-release.

1659
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:06,521
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta get Bubsy because that was such a high quality game.

1660
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:07,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, don't troll.

1661
02:06:07,802 --> 02:06:08,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't troll.

1662
02:06:09,437 --> 02:06:11,359
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so good luck finding your PlayStation game.

1663
02:06:11,459 --> 02:06:13,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And just for you, just for you.

1664
02:06:31,374 --> 02:06:37,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you should just go get a PlayStation 3 and get a SingStar Queen or a rock band and all the Queen songs.

1665
02:06:37,358 --> 02:06:38,459
[SPEAKER_10]: How about The Last Demon?

1666
02:06:38,599 --> 02:06:39,220
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, how about it?

1667
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Greetings, OLR.

1668
02:06:41,041 --> 02:06:42,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1669
02:06:42,821 --> 02:06:43,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Question of the week.

1670
02:06:43,802 --> 02:06:47,343
[SPEAKER_10]: What game are you looking forward to most this year, not including January through March?

1671
02:06:48,063 --> 02:06:49,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, a comment on Skyrim.

1672
02:06:50,504 --> 02:06:59,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost never buy games day one because of costs, which I believe are too high, but I did buy Skyrim, sunk 40 hours into it in two weeks, and haven't touched it until today.

1673
02:07:00,188 --> 02:07:06,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to Steam constantly advertising the latest mods, I decided to give it another go, but only after spending two hours respeccing my character.

1674
02:07:07,450 --> 02:07:11,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Being able to respec plus the sky UI has made the game playable again.

1675
02:07:12,575 --> 02:07:16,139
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the HD graphics pack made the game look that much better.

1676
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:20,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Anywho, keep up the good work and I'll listen to your answer tomorrow, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

1677
02:07:21,604 --> 02:07:22,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to play it on my PC.

1678
02:07:23,625 --> 02:07:25,485
[SPEAKER_13]: So do I. I don't know if my PC can run it, though.

1679
02:07:25,665 --> 02:07:26,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it can.

1680
02:07:26,606 --> 02:07:28,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure mine can.

1681
02:07:28,086 --> 02:07:29,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Games I'm looking forward to this year.

1682
02:07:30,827 --> 02:07:32,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Heart, Dream Drop Distance.

1683
02:07:32,267 --> 02:07:32,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1684
02:07:32,728 --> 02:07:34,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is out in Japan, but it's not out here yet.

1685
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:38,749
[SPEAKER_14]: The new Tomb Raider looks really good still.

1686
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:39,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm interested in that.

1687
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:46,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of think there's going to be stuff at E3 that we don't know about yet that will be very exciting, especially with the Wii U and everything.

1688
02:07:48,095 --> 02:07:54,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, it's looking very, very, very good that I'm going to be able to go to E3 this year, so I'm very excited about that because I didn't go last year, really.

1689
02:07:54,859 --> 02:07:55,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I sat in the lobby last year.

1690
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:59,482
[SPEAKER_14]: But hopefully this year I'll get to get some hands on that.

1691
02:07:59,502 --> 02:08:00,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I miss E3.

1692
02:08:00,302 --> 02:08:00,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

1693
02:08:00,462 --> 02:08:00,923
[SPEAKER_13]: It is fun.

1694
02:08:01,423 --> 02:08:02,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I do miss it, but I can't.

1695
02:08:03,393 --> 02:08:03,953
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a baby.

1696
02:08:04,293 --> 02:08:05,654
[SPEAKER_13]: He has separation anxiety.

1697
02:08:05,754 --> 02:08:07,375
[SPEAKER_14]: When the kid's 18, then he can go to E3.

1698
02:08:07,395 --> 02:08:09,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not that old.

1699
02:08:11,116 --> 02:08:12,417
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can't take kids under 18.

1700
02:08:12,877 --> 02:08:15,558
[SPEAKER_10]: You can take him.

1701
02:08:16,739 --> 02:08:20,781
[SPEAKER_10]: By four, hopefully he'll understand that daddy goes away sometimes.

1702
02:08:21,461 --> 02:08:26,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he's just at the point now where it's just like, you know, he's very clingy.

1703
02:08:26,724 --> 02:08:27,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Understand, understand.

1704
02:08:28,115 --> 02:08:33,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I get to stay back at work and work while everybody goes and drives down to Monterey.

1705
02:08:33,022 --> 02:08:33,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Rough life.

1706
02:08:43,168 --> 02:08:44,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Who said I'm going to work though when they leave?

1707
02:08:44,529 --> 02:08:46,709
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kicking back.

1708
02:08:47,790 --> 02:08:49,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet all day, every day.

1709
02:08:49,431 --> 02:08:49,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's it.

1710
02:08:50,551 --> 02:08:54,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us some emails in the future.

1711
02:08:54,873 --> 02:08:57,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1712
02:08:57,074 --> 02:08:57,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Good emails this week.

1713
02:08:57,934 --> 02:08:58,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys.

1714
02:08:58,814 --> 02:08:59,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1715
02:09:00,015 --> 02:09:00,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Making me work.

1716
02:09:01,496 --> 02:09:02,296
[SPEAKER_14]: The FUs of the week.

1717
02:09:02,436 --> 02:09:02,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1718
02:09:03,116 --> 02:09:07,098
[SPEAKER_14]: And some special April Fool's FU music as picked by Loki tonight.

1719
02:09:13,806 --> 02:09:17,807
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I tried to find the whole video for that song just because I needed to hear it in context.

1720
02:09:18,207 --> 02:09:18,688
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

1721
02:09:19,968 --> 02:09:20,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1722
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:24,929
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually really well looped.

1723
02:09:26,190 --> 02:09:28,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just mesmerized for a second.

1724
02:09:28,891 --> 02:09:29,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1725
02:09:29,251 --> 02:09:32,952
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to stop that because that's too distracting.

1726
02:09:32,972 --> 02:09:36,293
[SPEAKER_14]: How about if I get the sax guy off the screen?

1727
02:09:36,892 --> 02:09:37,332
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1728
02:09:54,069 --> 02:09:57,671
[SPEAKER_10]: What sucks about it?

1729
02:09:57,711 --> 02:09:57,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch.

1730
02:10:22,959 --> 02:10:26,880
[SPEAKER_10]: What sucks is that I have a class that's on during my work shift.

1731
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:31,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm basically going to have to miss the rest of the semester of that class.

1732
02:10:31,561 --> 02:10:35,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've already told the teacher that if I got a job, job comes first.

1733
02:10:35,762 --> 02:10:36,243
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1734
02:10:36,843 --> 02:10:37,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

1735
02:10:37,643 --> 02:10:41,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you, McDonald's, for not being able to make food correctly.

1736
02:10:41,724 --> 02:10:42,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not that hard.

1737
02:10:42,904 --> 02:10:43,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

1738
02:10:43,685 --> 02:10:44,765
[SPEAKER_10]: You're calling that food?

1739
02:10:45,805 --> 02:10:52,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's Harley food, but like I said, there's a few McDonald's on the way here and no Burger Kings that are right on the way here.

1740
02:10:52,448 --> 02:10:59,071
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's like, well, I could drive way the fuck out of the way to go to Burger King or I could just be quick and get McDonald's.

1741
02:10:59,131 --> 02:10:59,871
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I was quick.

1742
02:11:00,411 --> 02:11:04,193
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually almost going to get their Fish McBites that they have now.

1743
02:11:04,713 --> 02:11:06,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, I think that would be poison.

1744
02:11:06,274 --> 02:11:08,454
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm not really sure if I should do that.

1745
02:11:08,835 --> 02:11:09,175
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not.

1746
02:11:10,798 --> 02:11:11,578
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1747
02:11:11,778 --> 02:11:14,799
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the people that keep wanting to compare Battle Royale to Hunger Games.

1748
02:11:14,919 --> 02:11:15,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Get over it.

1749
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:21,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And F you to F you to Jelly Belly.

1750
02:11:22,122 --> 02:11:23,302
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so mad.

1751
02:11:23,442 --> 02:11:25,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I am no longer going to be able to eat Jelly Bellies anymore.

1752
02:11:25,703 --> 02:11:26,123
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened?

1753
02:11:26,423 --> 02:11:27,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm boycotting Jelly Bellies.

1754
02:11:27,703 --> 02:11:28,163
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened?

1755
02:11:28,183 --> 02:11:40,006
[SPEAKER_14]: They had Rick Santorum at their factory giving a speech and then did this whole thousand dollar a plate fundraiser dinner at Jelly Belly because I never knew this.

1756
02:11:40,026 --> 02:11:50,889
[SPEAKER_14]: They contribute to all these causes which I don't, you know, I'm not mad at, like I'm not the person to usually get up there and say F you to all Republicans and all this because I don't feel that way.

1757
02:11:50,909 --> 02:11:51,509
[SPEAKER_09]: But he's evil.

1758
02:11:51,529 --> 02:11:55,130
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of Republicans I do like and there's some progressive ideas that

1759
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:55,871
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

1760
02:12:11,812 --> 02:12:16,413
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the village idiot of this country and deserves to be pointed and laughed at wherever he goes.

1761
02:12:16,773 --> 02:12:22,555
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just sad that he has tainted the Jelly Belly Factory and I can no longer support that company.

1762
02:12:22,595 --> 02:12:23,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And I urge all of you to.

1763
02:12:24,555 --> 02:12:30,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I was hoping that maybe it was all like they were going to do a Bernie's Bots for Santorum flavored jelly beans.

1764
02:12:31,437 --> 02:12:31,677
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

1765
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:32,557
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

1766
02:12:52,427 --> 02:12:52,767
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1767
02:12:54,509 --> 02:12:58,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So moving on, let's talk a little bit about changes.

1768
02:12:58,932 --> 02:13:02,815
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sega, unfortunately, changing for the worst.

1769
02:13:03,175 --> 02:13:06,858
[SPEAKER_13]: They are canceling games, cutting jobs, and restructuring.

1770
02:13:07,798 --> 02:13:11,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, their expected net income is down almost 50%.

1771
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:14,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, they're going to make some changes regarding that.

1772
02:13:14,623 --> 02:13:19,447
[SPEAKER_13]: They're streamlining the operations of Sega, both in the United States and Europe.

1773
02:13:20,368 --> 02:13:28,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they're gonna focus on key franchises, including Sonic, Football Manager, Total War, and Aliens.

1774
02:13:30,342 --> 02:13:31,304
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um...

1775
02:13:33,243 --> 02:13:34,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's interesting.

1776
02:13:34,444 --> 02:13:41,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Funny enough, though, they're actually still doing an Olympics game in June, so maybe they're restructuring after that.

1777
02:13:43,551 --> 02:13:47,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, that Sonic and Mario Olympic game did crazy good on the Wii.

1778
02:13:47,835 --> 02:13:48,796
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not talking about that.

1779
02:13:48,956 --> 02:13:54,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about the actual Olympic games, the sports game that's on PS3 and 360.

1780
02:13:55,641 --> 02:13:57,383
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe for that same reason they're doing that.

1781
02:13:57,443 --> 02:14:00,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that'd be pretty cool.

1782
02:14:00,345 --> 02:14:28,091
[SPEAKER_13]: but yeah I can understand they try a lot of experimental stuff and it doesn't always work out if only they'd release Shenmue 3 if only well I think they kind of do that stuff though a little bit more experimental stuff though on Xbox Live Arcade so I don't know necessarily we're going to see the end of that kind of stuff because after all they're going to be doing Jet Set Radio here so it's very possible that they'll still do Shenmue alright

1783
02:14:29,417 --> 02:14:32,259
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, I know you've got to be feeling a little sad about the changes at Sega.

1784
02:14:55,669 --> 02:14:58,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm also pissed off at my laptop, but that's another thing.

1785
02:14:58,251 --> 02:14:59,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Sega build your laptop?

1786
02:14:59,752 --> 02:15:00,733
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's a piece of shit.

1787
02:15:00,953 --> 02:15:01,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1788
02:15:02,834 --> 02:15:04,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Nietzsche in our chatroom is wondering the same thing.

1789
02:15:05,296 --> 02:15:09,279
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going to happen to my PlayStation Online 2 Sega?

1790
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:11,240
[SPEAKER_14]: What about PSO2, you bastards?

1791
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,381
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I feel.

1792
02:15:15,503 --> 02:15:15,864
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1793
02:15:15,964 --> 02:15:18,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Just stop putting out the crappy Sonic games and maybe it'll be better.

1794
02:15:21,923 --> 02:15:22,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Firefly the Arcade Game

1795
02:15:49,803 --> 02:15:50,183
[SPEAKER_14]: April Fools' Joke

1796
02:15:58,163 --> 02:15:59,464
[SPEAKER_10]: What time does it say?

1797
02:15:59,544 --> 02:16:00,164
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't say.

1798
02:16:00,184 --> 02:16:01,425
[SPEAKER_14]: It just says March 31st, 2012.

1799
02:16:02,146 --> 02:16:04,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to take it with a grain of salt.

1800
02:16:04,267 --> 02:16:05,648
[SPEAKER_14]: This probably is a joke.

1801
02:16:06,028 --> 02:16:09,170
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's entertain the idea that it's real for a minute.

1802
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:11,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's entertain if it could be realistic or not.

1803
02:16:12,973 --> 02:16:20,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, because of the 10th anniversary of the show Firefly, even though it had a short life on television, it's very cult.

1804
02:16:21,218 --> 02:16:24,361
[SPEAKER_14]: And now they're talking about a Firefly arcade game.

1805
02:16:24,701 --> 02:16:27,943
[SPEAKER_14]: See, the thing about this is the screenshot does look really fake to me.

1806
02:16:29,778 --> 02:16:30,859
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole thing looks very fake.

1807
02:16:30,879 --> 02:16:31,219
[SPEAKER_14]: It does.

1808
02:16:31,299 --> 02:16:33,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a whole first-person shooter and all this.

1809
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:36,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and that cabinet, too, just doesn't look... No.

1810
02:16:37,682 --> 02:16:40,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's assume it could be real, though.

1811
02:16:41,884 --> 02:16:43,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody was really thinking about this.

1812
02:16:43,345 --> 02:16:45,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Would this be something worth doing?

1813
02:16:45,866 --> 02:16:48,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is a bit of a cultish franchise, but I...

1814
02:16:49,148 --> 02:17:05,147
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of stuff from kind of back of the day ends up coming full circle again I don't even know necessarily it's an arcade game but like a pinball game I could totally see a Firefly pinball game I really don't think it would happen I mean then again I'm sure Joss would like the money

1815
02:17:05,367 --> 02:17:21,581
[SPEAKER_13]: they wouldn't make an arcade game based on a property that's niche like that especially since arcade games nowadays it's just like you've got to have some sort of gimmick to get people to come to the arcades to play the game they're not going to spend the money to make cabinets for an arcade game like that

1816
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,681
[SPEAKER_13]: April Fools, haha April Fools, haha

1817
02:17:54,269 --> 02:17:54,929
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, moving on.

1818
02:17:56,970 --> 02:17:58,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that would be me, wouldn't it?

1819
02:17:59,251 --> 02:17:59,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, ma'am.

1820
02:17:59,932 --> 02:18:00,552
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Tesco?

1821
02:18:00,592 --> 02:18:01,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what Tesco is?

1822
02:18:02,593 --> 02:18:04,754
[SPEAKER_14]: They are a big grocery store in Britain, right?

1823
02:18:04,974 --> 02:18:07,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, did you know that they've opened markets in the United States?

1824
02:18:07,775 --> 02:18:09,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, because they're fresh and easy.

1825
02:18:09,116 --> 02:18:09,876
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I knew that.

1826
02:18:10,036 --> 02:18:10,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1827
02:18:10,377 --> 02:18:13,158
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're being protested, hella, the new stores that open here.

1828
02:18:13,478 --> 02:18:13,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1829
02:18:13,618 --> 02:18:15,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I guess Tesco is very anti-union.

1830
02:18:15,979 --> 02:18:18,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of the union grocers in the area are protesting.

1831
02:18:19,001 --> 02:18:21,082
[SPEAKER_10]: When I drove by, there was actually an ambulance in front of it.

1832
02:18:22,202 --> 02:18:24,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they started fighting each other, who knows?

1833
02:18:24,224 --> 02:18:24,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1834
02:18:24,885 --> 02:18:25,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1835
02:18:25,265 --> 02:18:31,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, the supermarket has now said they are the home of gaming in the advertisement over in the UK.

1836
02:18:32,012 --> 02:18:34,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess since Game UK went under, there's an opening.

1837
02:18:35,556 --> 02:18:37,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there's no more game store closures.

1838
02:18:38,579 --> 02:18:38,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?

1839
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there was an article on that on Eurogamer.

1840
02:18:41,802 --> 02:18:43,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I didn't hear that follow-up.

1841
02:18:43,884 --> 02:18:44,965
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't close any more stores.

1842
02:18:45,146 --> 02:18:45,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

1843
02:18:46,187 --> 02:19:05,844
[SPEAKER_10]: so basically they're saying that they have more gaming stores in the UK than any other retailers so that's 393 open at midnight for new releases and that they will have over 10,000 titles available online free UK delivery and day one pre-order shipping

1844
02:19:07,347 --> 02:19:08,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have no idea what to say about that.

1845
02:19:09,388 --> 02:19:14,350
[SPEAKER_14]: This reminds me of when 7-Eleven got into gaming for a hot minute.

1846
02:19:15,271 --> 02:19:17,512
[SPEAKER_14]: They stopped doing that, right?

1847
02:19:18,873 --> 02:19:21,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan is friends with somebody who managed.

1848
02:19:22,014 --> 02:19:23,935
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a big flop.

1849
02:19:24,275 --> 02:19:25,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, of course it was a big flop.

1850
02:19:26,545 --> 02:19:27,306
[SPEAKER_14]: What about this though?

1851
02:19:27,406 --> 02:19:34,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I remember back in the day, a lot of grocery stores had like video rental shops in it.

1852
02:19:35,136 --> 02:19:36,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And you could also rent games there too.

1853
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:41,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So like integrating, and a lot of them still sell DVDs.

1854
02:19:41,384 --> 02:19:43,307
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a bad idea considering that

1855
02:19:44,067 --> 02:19:55,973
[SPEAKER_13]: The video rental market is coming back because blockbusters have closed down, Hollywood has closed down, most of your mom and pop shops have closed down.

1856
02:19:56,073 --> 02:20:00,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're starting to reopen back up, although kiosks are popular nowadays.

1857
02:20:01,669 --> 02:20:12,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I found the thing about game, by the way, that it was OpCapita, that's a parent company of Comet, is bidding for game again.

1858
02:20:13,522 --> 02:20:16,546
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's 333 stores still open, 211 of them being game and 122 being game station.

1859
02:20:21,631 --> 02:20:32,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically they were initially blocked by the lending syndicate that owned them including the Royal Bank of Scotland.

1860
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:35,721
[SPEAKER_10]: That was what stopped them before.

1861
02:20:36,501 --> 02:20:39,143
[SPEAKER_14]: So could video games at the grocery store work?

1862
02:20:39,744 --> 02:20:44,747
[SPEAKER_14]: I think especially the cheaper market could work because you see a lot of that at Target.

1863
02:20:45,247 --> 02:20:52,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yes, Target sells new games and all that too, but they also like up by the registers usually have the $20 Wii games and those seem to do all right.

1864
02:20:52,892 --> 02:20:55,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they sell more there than they probably would at a GameStop or something.

1865
02:20:55,634 --> 02:21:03,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Tesco's pretty big too and I think they are like a wide, very broad in their services and markets, so...

1866
02:21:03,619 --> 02:21:03,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1867
02:21:04,019 --> 02:21:05,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably like a Safeway here.

1868
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:06,340
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's got a lot of stuff.

1869
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:11,222
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not necessarily just the store, but usually the full-service deli in China, you know, a lot of places.

1870
02:21:12,563 --> 02:21:12,843
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1871
02:21:13,143 --> 02:21:13,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1872
02:21:13,823 --> 02:21:17,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as far as I understand it, it actually is a bit more like a Super Target.

1873
02:21:18,005 --> 02:21:18,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

1874
02:21:18,745 --> 02:21:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: You know.

1875
02:21:18,985 --> 02:21:19,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So Tesco is really big.

1876
02:21:19,566 --> 02:21:26,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but it was a big supermarket, but like you can get, or maybe like a, oh, what's that thing that they had in Washington that Fred Meyer.

1877
02:21:26,969 --> 02:21:27,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Fred Meyer.

1878
02:21:27,509 --> 02:21:27,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1879
02:21:28,809 --> 02:21:29,710
[SPEAKER_10]: The sum of everything.

1880
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:30,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1881
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:30,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1882
02:21:31,843 --> 02:21:35,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, Loki, if you don't have any comments, then let's go to the next story

1883
02:21:37,681 --> 02:21:42,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about something, kind of a really cool piece of technology, BrowserQuest.

1884
02:21:43,104 --> 02:21:47,167
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an MMO tech demo built by Mozilla.

1885
02:21:47,887 --> 02:21:52,390
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's basically an MMO that works in browsers.

1886
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:59,274
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've got this little, kind of almost looks like a 16-bit MMO that you can play.

1887
02:21:59,954 --> 02:22:04,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And it actually will kind of work in any browser, I guess, that supports HTML5.

1888
02:22:06,739 --> 02:22:22,351
[SPEAKER_13]: and they even have the full source available on github if you want to create your own MMO based off that which is pretty cool and if you want to check it out you can go to mozilla.org future of MMOs

1889
02:22:30,222 --> 02:22:30,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibly?

1890
02:22:31,763 --> 02:22:35,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like just another, like, oh, yay, free, MM, you know, type of thing.

1891
02:22:35,646 --> 02:22:38,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean... I mean, how many browser-based games do we have these days?

1892
02:22:38,728 --> 02:22:39,209
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot.

1893
02:22:39,609 --> 02:22:47,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but the Ultima one that EA had... But, I mean, something that runs in HTML5, though, that would be compatible with, you know, like, iOS and stuff like that.

1894
02:22:48,316 --> 02:22:49,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I get where you're going with that, then.

1895
02:22:50,037 --> 02:22:50,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1896
02:22:50,297 --> 02:22:58,403
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like, on mobile devices and stuff, it's not just... Or, like, All Games Radio is compatible with HTML5, and you can get it on your iDevice at allgames.com.

1897
02:22:58,584 --> 02:22:58,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1898
02:22:59,384 --> 02:23:10,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so they're saying, yeah, it's written in HTML5 and JavaScript and can be played in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, with WebSockets enabled, also in Opera.

1899
02:23:10,934 --> 02:23:13,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're saying, of course, iOS devices and stuff like that.

1900
02:23:15,237 --> 02:23:20,762
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to play the game, it's browserquest.mozilla.org is the URL to go in.

1901
02:23:22,216 --> 02:23:23,637
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1902
02:23:46,378 --> 02:23:49,919
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also Zork Grand Inquisitor, Zork Nemesis, all these games came out.

1903
02:23:49,939 --> 02:23:54,861
[SPEAKER_14]: And then of course the text adventure games, Zork Anthology, Zork 1 through 3, Beyond Zork, Zork 0.

1904
02:23:55,701 --> 02:24:00,043
[SPEAKER_14]: All of these games are on sale right now at the website Good Old Games.

1905
02:24:00,103 --> 02:24:06,725
[SPEAKER_14]: They're half off right now along with some other games such as Caesar 3, Vampire the Masquerade, Redemption, and so forth.

1906
02:24:07,185 --> 02:24:09,986
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, pretty cool if you're a Zork fan.

1907
02:24:11,106 --> 02:24:13,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh God, I remember the Commodore 64 text adventure really well.

1908
02:24:14,247 --> 02:24:16,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when games were hard.

1909
02:24:16,248 --> 02:24:18,289
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to know exactly what to type into that game.

1910
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:23,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't run out of matches or torches.

1911
02:24:23,431 --> 02:24:23,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1912
02:24:23,871 --> 02:24:24,931
[SPEAKER_14]: You might get eaten by a Groo.

1913
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:32,714
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want to get your Groos half off, get your Groove on at GOG.com.

1914
02:24:34,281 --> 02:24:40,683
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a much better April Fool's thing than what they did a few years ago with the whole we're going to shut down unless you give... I don't remember what it was.

1915
02:24:40,703 --> 02:24:41,403
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really terrible.

1916
02:24:41,943 --> 02:24:42,143
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1917
02:24:42,163 --> 02:24:44,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, let's get into some Twitter topics.

1918
02:24:44,744 --> 02:24:49,065
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to open the Skype line right now because it's not open yet.

1919
02:24:49,265 --> 02:24:50,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And I should do that.

1920
02:24:50,185 --> 02:24:51,845
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1921
02:24:52,406 --> 02:24:56,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1922
02:24:57,607 --> 02:25:00,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And Skype is signing into the wrong account right now.

1923
02:25:00,628 --> 02:25:02,028
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really convenient, isn't it?

1924
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,262
[SPEAKER_14]: You can call and talk about whatever.

1925
02:25:07,282 --> 02:25:13,407
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to take it back to the Bimani stuff, that's fine too since that was part of our fun tonight.

1926
02:25:13,427 --> 02:25:18,911
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or again our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1927
02:25:19,051 --> 02:25:19,631
[SPEAKER_14]: All one word.

1928
02:25:20,592 --> 02:25:28,797
[SPEAKER_14]: While we wait for some calls, let's go to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and see what tweets are in store for us.

1929
02:25:29,998 --> 02:25:34,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Gamer Girl tweets us saying, Is PlayStation Plus really worth the money?

1930
02:25:35,021 --> 02:25:37,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking about getting a subscription, but I want to know if it's worth the money.

1931
02:25:39,143 --> 02:26:08,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm the only one that actually has PlayStation Plus here I'll tell you this if you use your PlayStation a lot and especially if you buy from the store a lot then yes there's you know so many discounts and things and a lot of freebies that you get with PlayStation as well so if you think you'd kind of be into some of those freebies you want to get like one arcade game every couple weeks or so I think it's a pretty good deal and getting Journey early was really nice as well so I think there's a lot of good stuff there but um

1932
02:26:09,662 --> 02:26:11,582
[SPEAKER_14]: It really depends on how much you love your PlayStation.

1933
02:26:12,323 --> 02:26:14,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, the phones are ringing, so let's go to the phones.

1934
02:26:14,103 --> 02:26:15,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1935
02:26:15,103 --> 02:26:15,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1936
02:26:16,884 --> 02:26:18,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is DS Lover.

1937
02:26:19,324 --> 02:26:20,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what's your name again?

1938
02:26:21,905 --> 02:26:22,705
[SPEAKER_14]: DS Lover.

1939
02:26:22,865 --> 02:26:23,665
[SPEAKER_14]: DS Lover.

1940
02:26:23,705 --> 02:26:24,405
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1941
02:26:25,986 --> 02:26:32,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Not much other than to talk about something that happened last night on the Cartoon Network.

1942
02:26:32,467 --> 02:26:35,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if the rest of you...

1943
02:26:36,016 --> 02:26:42,642
[SPEAKER_15]: and the rest of the anime community ever caught this, but Toonami was on instead of the usual Adult Swim bumpers.

1944
02:26:42,662 --> 02:26:43,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully this

1945
02:27:00,819 --> 02:27:05,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not just saying this, but you know how I sent you guys an email?

1946
02:27:05,182 --> 02:27:09,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, how you guys have risen above a podcast that just pretty much kicked us?

1947
02:27:09,764 --> 02:27:13,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm going to reveal that podcast name right here now.

1948
02:27:14,087 --> 02:27:17,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Games and More Entertainment Radio, like, they've just pretty much ceased.

1949
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:25,554
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not doing anything anymore, and just, like, I need my gaming news fix on a weekly basis, or else I'm still left.

1950
02:27:27,116 --> 02:27:32,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, is that another indie show, or is that a corporate-backed show?

1951
02:27:33,441 --> 02:27:35,142
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's another indie show.

1952
02:27:35,302 --> 02:27:52,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't like to throw shade at the other indie shows, because they all work hard at what they do, but everybody's got different preferences, so... Yeah, and I will say here, with the fact that 16th Empress beat Minya with the last one, the PS2...

1953
02:27:54,011 --> 02:27:58,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Has anyone heard any announcements for the PlayStation 3 versions at all?

1954
02:27:58,574 --> 02:27:58,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1955
02:27:58,894 --> 02:28:15,485
[SPEAKER_14]: We kind of think that Konami may have just given up on the whole damn series, which is a darn shame because I think there's opportunity there for them to do a massive collection on the PlayStation 3, but that would require them investing in another controller or at least a converter for the old ones, which I would think would be easy to do, but they don't want to do it.

1956
02:28:15,606 --> 02:28:19,688
[SPEAKER_15]: There are controller converters for the PlayStation 2 controllers.

1957
02:28:19,728 --> 02:28:22,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they already work for the Guitar Hero stuff.

1958
02:28:22,867 --> 02:28:24,747
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it shouldn't be that hard.

1959
02:28:24,767 --> 02:28:29,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they should be able to work on the Beatmania controllers.

1960
02:28:29,389 --> 02:28:34,630
[SPEAKER_15]: If anyone in the crowd would like to test that out, I'd be willing to import.

1961
02:28:34,830 --> 02:28:42,852
[SPEAKER_14]: There could be lag, I don't know, especially with the music game, lag could kill it, but I mean, if they did it with the guitars and so forth, then I don't see why it isn't possible, but...

1962
02:28:43,172 --> 02:28:44,673
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1963
02:29:10,232 --> 02:29:10,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1964
02:29:10,992 --> 02:29:16,815
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got to see that the fans are there for 2DX to sell on the PlayStation 3, and then maybe they'll do it.

1965
02:29:17,175 --> 02:29:20,537
[SPEAKER_14]: But certainly in America, Beatmania didn't sell.

1966
02:29:22,217 --> 02:29:31,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I think it was because the set list was halfway the problem, and that's what I've heard from many Pumani fans, was the set list was one of the few problems on top of

1967
02:29:32,857 --> 02:29:35,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's way too easy to get your place in this.

1968
02:29:53,607 --> 02:29:57,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, which is why I'm currently on the search for something like BM98 for the Macintosh or some of the equivalent, because

1969
02:30:23,789 --> 02:30:32,856
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking about getting one of those Joy-Cue keys or one of those PS2 to USB adapters for my computer just so I can play Beatmania.

1970
02:30:33,056 --> 02:30:36,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Or even a similar... You know what you need to do?

1971
02:30:36,639 --> 02:30:39,000
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to write a letter to Konami.

1972
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:41,302
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to say, I am a concerned fan.

1973
02:30:41,522 --> 02:30:43,984
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's once Konami hears voices.

1974
02:30:44,044 --> 02:30:46,646
[SPEAKER_14]: But anything is possible at E3.

1975
02:30:46,826 --> 02:30:50,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, wouldn't it be cool if maybe the Wii U could become a controller somehow?

1976
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:50,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1977
02:30:51,707 --> 02:30:53,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what about Twitter?

1978
02:30:53,728 --> 02:30:55,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure it's well, they have a Twitter.

1979
02:30:56,089 --> 02:30:57,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Tweet them!

1980
02:30:57,349 --> 02:31:02,431
[SPEAKER_15]: The body fans of the world, tweet Konami to bring Beatman to the PS3.

1981
02:31:03,031 --> 02:31:04,992
[SPEAKER_14]: It worked with President Kat, sort of.

1982
02:31:05,112 --> 02:31:12,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, DS, what was, DS fan, I gotta let you go and take more calls, but thanks for the call.

1983
02:31:14,261 --> 02:31:16,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, peace out and keep the shows rockin'.

1984
02:31:41,971 --> 02:31:43,653
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1985
02:31:43,753 --> 02:31:45,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1986
02:31:46,817 --> 02:31:48,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to some Tweety Tweets here.

1987
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:54,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Dartetsuya says, coming to the site this week, I've got something planned for the listeners to participate in.

1988
02:31:55,108 --> 02:31:56,490
[SPEAKER_14]: So stay tuned.

1989
02:31:57,051 --> 02:31:58,573
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't sound like an April Fool's joke.

1990
02:31:59,714 --> 02:32:00,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay tuned.

1991
02:32:01,996 --> 02:32:02,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

1992
02:32:02,977 --> 02:32:08,722
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100Matt tweets us, I know it's a video game show, but I played Cards Against Humanity, the card game.

1993
02:32:09,043 --> 02:32:10,844
[SPEAKER_14]: It's apples to apples, but M-rated.

1994
02:32:11,104 --> 02:32:12,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you've never heard of this now, Loki, have you?

1995
02:32:13,006 --> 02:32:14,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not.

1996
02:32:14,688 --> 02:32:17,050
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're very familiar with Cards Against Humanity, right?

1997
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:17,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1998
02:32:18,011 --> 02:32:21,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Cards Against Humanity is a very inappropriate apples to apples game.

1999
02:32:21,814 --> 02:32:22,775
[SPEAKER_14]: What makes it so great?

2000
02:32:22,835 --> 02:32:24,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Just its level of inappropriateness?

2001
02:32:24,517 --> 02:32:24,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2002
02:32:26,954 --> 02:32:27,234
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2003
02:32:28,355 --> 02:32:32,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to WatchDragon, who tweets us, Mr. Pandaria is great.

2004
02:32:32,598 --> 02:32:34,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Just finished the starting area.

2005
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:38,803
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you get past all of those freaking pandas and some of those quests?

2006
02:32:38,823 --> 02:32:40,264
[SPEAKER_14]: That must have taken a lot of patience.

2007
02:32:40,885 --> 02:32:42,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the art style is neat, though.

2008
02:32:42,366 --> 02:32:43,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like the way Pandaria looks.

2009
02:32:44,047 --> 02:32:44,567
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cute.

2010
02:32:44,868 --> 02:32:47,750
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to see it later, DarkSakura, we can fire it up on the computer before you go.

2011
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:48,690
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to peek.

2012
02:32:48,951 --> 02:32:49,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

2013
02:32:49,871 --> 02:32:50,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Be fun.

2014
02:32:51,272 --> 02:32:51,573
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2015
02:32:52,233 --> 02:32:54,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to some tweets from Tigerclaw.

2016
02:32:55,911 --> 02:32:58,333
[SPEAKER_14]: 1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2017
02:32:58,833 --> 02:33:04,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Tigerclaw says, why Soul Calibur V only had one-fourth of a full story mode?

2018
02:33:04,816 --> 02:33:08,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I did feel like story mode in Soul Calibur V seemed to be lacking a little bit.

2019
02:33:09,238 --> 02:33:11,019
[SPEAKER_14]: But what happened with Soul Calibur V?

2020
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:22,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently it's an interview that was on Train to Game with the producer Daishi Odashima says the story mode shipped with the game was a fourth of what they had planned.

2021
02:33:22,825 --> 02:33:34,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Quote, our first plan on the storyboard was that we add every character's story, and actually we do have it in the studio, but time-wise, manpower-wise, we weren't able to do it, and only one-fourth of what we planned to do is in the game.

2022
02:33:34,610 --> 02:33:36,371
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a dumb thing for them to admit.

2023
02:33:36,551 --> 02:33:39,532
[SPEAKER_14]: We could do it if only we had the DLC.

2024
02:33:39,552 --> 02:33:40,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

2025
02:33:40,552 --> 02:33:42,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that was a dumb thing for them to say.

2026
02:33:42,913 --> 02:33:46,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they should have kept those cards closer to their chest, sorry to say.

2027
02:33:48,837 --> 02:33:54,323
[SPEAKER_14]: But it did feel to me that story mode in Soul Calibur 5 was a little bit lacking.

2028
02:33:55,264 --> 02:33:57,687
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Tigerclaw sends us another tweet.

2029
02:33:57,847 --> 02:34:00,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Warhammer 40k Dark Millennium.

2030
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:04,495
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going single player because layoffs have hit Relic and Vigil.

2031
02:34:04,995 --> 02:34:06,836
[SPEAKER_14]: More layoffs, man, this is a bummer.

2032
02:34:08,037 --> 02:34:11,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So Warhammer 40K Dark Millennium, it's now a single-player action game.

2033
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:13,521
[SPEAKER_14]: It will have multiplayer elements.

2034
02:34:14,101 --> 02:34:23,047
[SPEAKER_14]: The president and CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell, put out a press release saying, quote, as previously announced, we have been actively looking for a business partner for the game as MMO.

2035
02:34:23,427 --> 02:34:34,615
[SPEAKER_14]: However, based on changing market dynamics and the additional investment required to complete the game as an MMO, we believe the right direction for us is to shift the title from an MMO to a premium experience with single and multiplayer gameplay.

2036
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:42,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Robust digital content and community features So, shit tons of DLC, y'all Actually

2037
02:34:43,527 --> 02:34:47,648
[SPEAKER_14]: As much as it sucks that these studios got closed and so forth, this makes sense.

2038
02:34:48,108 --> 02:34:52,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the MMO market is really volatile right now, and it's really tough to make a showing.

2039
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:55,770
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, look at where Star Wars is at.

2040
02:34:55,930 --> 02:35:02,012
[SPEAKER_14]: They've come the second best probably to getting wow, and even they're starting to lose some people who are getting kind of bored of the game.

2041
02:35:02,612 --> 02:35:04,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So MMOs are hard to do.

2042
02:35:06,033 --> 02:35:07,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Phone calls are a lot easier to do.

2043
02:35:07,473 --> 02:35:08,713
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a phone call coming in now.

2044
02:35:08,774 --> 02:35:09,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2045
02:35:09,854 --> 02:35:10,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2046
02:35:11,257 --> 02:35:12,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it's Porkchop.

2047
02:35:12,297 --> 02:35:13,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Porkchop, what's on your mind, buddy?

2048
02:35:13,918 --> 02:35:14,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

2049
02:35:15,238 --> 02:35:20,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good that you started talking about the whole Soul Calibur thing because I was really let down by that.

2050
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,900
[SPEAKER_01]: That pissed me off, something serious.

2051
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:23,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Porkchop, where are you from?

2052
02:35:24,261 --> 02:35:25,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on Ireland, actually.

2053
02:35:25,521 --> 02:35:26,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I could tell.

2054
02:35:27,182 --> 02:35:27,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

2055
02:35:28,222 --> 02:35:28,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

2056
02:35:28,902 --> 02:35:31,783
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys stay up late to listen to the show over there.

2057
02:35:32,123 --> 02:35:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I do.

2058
02:35:33,964 --> 02:35:37,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't that a dumb thing for them to say, that they only finished a quarter of it?

2059
02:35:39,736 --> 02:36:08,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so pissed off I mean I remember playing through the story mode okay and it was it took me a day I played it in one fucking day and I played that I paid like it'd be about what 40 or 50 euros something like that'd be about 50 60 dollars something like that in the exchange I went and played that it took me like two maybe not even an hour I played it and I said fuck this I'm really disappointed so what I did was I brought it back I got Arkham City and I was much happier

2060
02:36:09,813 --> 02:36:14,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God the creative character mode's at least still fun, and the fighting core game is still really fun.

2061
02:36:14,494 --> 02:36:17,455
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, the story mode was a little bit disappointing there, so.

2062
02:36:17,775 --> 02:36:20,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Christ, I mean, if you finish it in an hour, it's not worth buying.

2063
02:36:20,816 --> 02:36:22,076
[SPEAKER_01]: For that price, I mean, come on.

2064
02:36:22,096 --> 02:36:25,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't even buy full-price games anymore, never mind anything.

2065
02:36:25,577 --> 02:36:29,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, nowadays I just look in GameStop for games that are like two to three years old.

2066
02:36:30,018 --> 02:36:32,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just picked up Final Fantasy XIII for, what, six?

2067
02:36:33,339 --> 02:36:33,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Six euros?

2068
02:36:34,199 --> 02:36:35,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, it was cheap.

2069
02:36:38,103 --> 02:36:43,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been waiting 10 years for an angry Irishman rant on this show and it had to happen on April Fool's Day.

2070
02:36:43,767 --> 02:36:46,129
[SPEAKER_10]: You should really see the look on Rob's face right now.

2071
02:36:46,189 --> 02:36:48,730
[SPEAKER_10]: He just looks like he's won the lottery.

2072
02:36:49,531 --> 02:36:49,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2073
02:36:50,372 --> 02:36:53,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad I can fulfill your fantasy or whatever the hell is going on.

2074
02:36:54,795 --> 02:36:56,316
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Rob's final fantasy.

2075
02:36:58,457 --> 02:36:59,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

2076
02:37:00,639 --> 02:37:03,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, full price games nowadays really aren't worth it.

2077
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:04,561
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fact of the matter.

2078
02:37:04,621 --> 02:37:05,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I wait like for...

2079
02:37:06,494 --> 02:37:06,975
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

2080
02:37:21,776 --> 02:37:22,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, why not?

2081
02:37:22,877 --> 02:37:25,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm never going to pay full price for a game again.

2082
02:37:25,379 --> 02:37:27,540
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much how I'm looking at it at this stage.

2083
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:37,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Porkchop, let me ask you this then, and maybe I'm baiting you for another rant here, but it certainly begs worth asking when you kind of are sick of only buying these new games that are so expensive and so forth.

2084
02:37:37,727 --> 02:37:48,034
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you feel about this story we were talking about earlier that by the time the PlayStation 4 and whatever's next on Xbox are out, or Orbis or whatever it's called, that used games aren't going to happen.

2085
02:37:48,214 --> 02:37:49,355
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to block used games.

2086
02:37:49,375 --> 02:37:49,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2087
02:37:50,322 --> 02:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain in the fucking ass.

2088
02:37:52,064 --> 02:37:57,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as I said, I said in chat that I always favorite hard copies over digital anyway.

2089
02:37:57,672 --> 02:38:01,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I still buy CDs and I'm never going to use iTunes or any of that shit.

2090
02:38:01,821 --> 02:38:03,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still doing that to this day.

2091
02:38:03,342 --> 02:38:05,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like CDs are my vinyl in a way.

2092
02:38:05,703 --> 02:38:10,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to keep doing that and pray to fuck that Sony kind of cop out.

2093
02:38:10,124 --> 02:38:11,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Steam's really successful.

2094
02:38:12,045 --> 02:38:16,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of favor those guys because they aren't kind of overcharging the fans or anything.

2095
02:38:16,667 --> 02:38:24,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my best friend, he kind of works in the industry and he was telling me Steam are basically the daddy at this stage and they look to be like some sort of messiah.

2096
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:30,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's looking good on their end, but Sony are overcharging people way too fucking much as far as I'm concerned.

2097
02:38:31,252 --> 02:38:42,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know, and what's funny, what you made me think about while you were talking about Steam and the way that they're viewed in the industry, there was a rumor a couple weeks ago or maybe even last week on this show about the whole Steam box.

2098
02:38:43,239 --> 02:39:00,068
[SPEAKER_14]: And although Valve was quick to shoot that down that that's not actually happening, you can't help but think, holy shit, what if you have the PlayStation Orbis, which doesn't play used games, and you have the Xbox 360 or, excuse me, 720 or Lube or whatever it's called that doesn't play used games, and then you have the Steam box...

2099
02:39:00,748 --> 02:39:02,529
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the receipts he had for the past...

2100
02:39:21,468 --> 02:39:48,021
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of months and I looked at it and I compared PlayStation Store and I was like what the fuck am I doing with a PS3 if I can get all these games all the same games nearly every single title I have he had a receipt for and it was like oh god the sales that were on he picked up like 50 games within the space of 3 months and he totted it up and he showed me the end total which would have been if they weren't on sale was around 400

2101
02:39:49,642 --> 02:39:50,543
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like, wow.

2102
02:39:50,963 --> 02:39:53,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually said, I never paid that much for it.

2103
02:39:53,365 --> 02:39:55,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, holy shit, I want a Steam account.

2104
02:39:56,087 --> 02:39:57,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was me saying.

2105
02:39:57,348 --> 02:39:58,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Could that be a regional thing though?

2106
02:39:58,809 --> 02:40:04,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Because most of it here in the US, it seems like, especially when new games come out, it's about the same.

2107
02:40:04,413 --> 02:40:08,737
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd play on the PlayStation Network that you would on Steam or whatever, getting it on PC.

2108
02:40:09,077 --> 02:40:16,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of me wonders if PlayStation doesn't jack up the price even more overseas in other countries and maybe it's that price

2109
02:40:16,903 --> 02:40:25,253
[SPEAKER_14]: That pain of the, whatever you want to call it, translation of the cost or whatever is truly causing the difference.

2110
02:40:26,194 --> 02:40:28,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth is, it wouldn't surprise me.

2111
02:40:28,277 --> 02:40:31,140
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even he said games in America are way cheaper.

2112
02:40:31,601 --> 02:40:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as far as I know, I think they are anyway.

2113
02:40:34,204 --> 02:40:35,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's true.

2114
02:40:35,785 --> 02:40:38,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to sound like I'm bragging, but it's true.

2115
02:40:38,888 --> 02:40:51,258
[SPEAKER_14]: When we see how much you guys pay in euros or whatever currency we're looking at over there, it's pretty crazy how much you guys are paying for stuff over there than we are here.

2116
02:40:51,318 --> 02:40:52,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're paying on average 10-15% less.

2117
02:40:54,167 --> 02:40:54,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.

2118
02:40:55,187 --> 02:40:57,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you look at the exchange rate, you can see that.

2119
02:40:57,889 --> 02:41:15,576
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the prices, I'm sure, like, you know, in terms of, you know, denominations of notes or money with bills, as you call them, you know, I'm sure you could pay, use two 20s to buy a good handful of games, whereas that wouldn't even get you, well, it gets you close to one, which is fucking ridiculous.

2120
02:41:15,616 --> 02:41:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Ireland, apparently, the capital of Ireland, Dublin, is one of the most expensive cities in Europe at this stage.

2121
02:41:22,906 --> 02:41:49,507
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's fucking ridiculous and that's why I have to go wait a couple of years for these games to come out and I have to go look and I'll be like okay I'm two or three I just finished Deus Ex and that's like year two years I finished Assassin's Creed a couple of days ago or a couple of months ago pardon me and you know I'm playing catch up at this stage but you know what I don't care I'm not paying full price it's fucking ridiculous as long as you've got fun stuff to play now anyway

2122
02:41:50,461 --> 02:41:51,161
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

2123
02:41:51,221 --> 02:42:00,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a good collection as it is, and I've kept some of the really old ones and hope to play through and buy the rest of the sequels in the next five years, something like that.

2124
02:42:00,987 --> 02:42:05,490
[SPEAKER_14]: You could spend your entire life playing classic games and be totally satisfied.

2125
02:42:05,530 --> 02:42:08,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, look at the Classic Game of the Week segment we do here on OLR.

2126
02:42:08,692 --> 02:42:14,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was actually pleased you actually brought up Street Fighter because I'm a big fan, and I got the Capcom Classics collection.

2127
02:42:14,795 --> 02:42:15,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the shit out of that.

2128
02:42:16,056 --> 02:42:17,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, thanks for bringing that up.

2129
02:42:17,657 --> 02:42:17,957
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

2130
02:42:18,117 --> 02:42:19,098
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2131
02:42:40,672 --> 02:42:41,713
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's not even all of it.

2132
02:42:41,873 --> 02:42:42,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Brag, brag, brag.

2133
02:42:43,295 --> 02:42:46,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying, I mean, it's one thing.

2134
02:42:46,317 --> 02:42:52,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you actually got through most of them or are you waiting to play through them and kind of use one as game of the week at some stage?

2135
02:42:52,897 --> 02:42:54,218
[SPEAKER_10]: We've actually gone through most of them.

2136
02:42:54,298 --> 02:42:59,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a lot of the games that my husband and I picked up are games that we played when we were younger.

2137
02:42:59,683 --> 02:43:02,045
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a big Sega guy, and I was a big Nintendo girl.

2138
02:43:03,026 --> 02:43:08,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we got together, we both had the love of our systems and brought them together.

2139
02:43:08,771 --> 02:43:18,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So we go back, and now, though, we have staples that we play, but we'll pick up something every so often just because we've just had the biggest boner to play it.

2140
02:43:19,159 --> 02:43:27,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I went on a mad buzz about maybe two, three years ago and I decided, fuck this, I have a Dreamcast, I'm going to buy games for it.

2141
02:43:27,625 --> 02:43:31,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Jet Set Radio and Shenmue and I was like, okay, I don't regret this one.

2142
02:43:31,768 --> 02:43:35,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I thought it was going to be like, oh God, these games, why did I buy these?

2143
02:43:35,131 --> 02:43:37,172
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually enjoyed them and I love playing.

2144
02:43:37,212 --> 02:43:44,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I play them again and again and again every time I visit my mum's house where she keeps my old room and I have all the Dreamcast games.

2145
02:43:44,317 --> 02:43:46,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have some PS2 games in there, so...

2146
02:43:46,872 --> 02:43:52,354
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little fucking hermit's cave where I go back and just play games for the weekend or whatever.

2147
02:43:52,554 --> 02:43:55,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been tempted to hook up the Dreamcast because I actually want to finish Grandia 2.

2148
02:43:55,855 --> 02:44:00,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, that's an old... That's a fun RPG.

2149
02:44:01,277 --> 02:44:08,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Porkchop, I have absolutely loved having you on the show because I love accents, so I appreciate you calling in.

2150
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:12,261
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's going over a little bit, so I've got to wrap up to get some more calls.

2151
02:44:12,721 --> 02:44:14,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you quickly have any other final thoughts?

2152
02:44:15,559 --> 02:44:17,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Just basically, I love the station.

2153
02:44:17,762 --> 02:44:18,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all games.

2154
02:44:18,463 --> 02:44:20,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Orange Lounge, Dead Picks, all that.

2155
02:44:20,385 --> 02:44:23,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work, and I'll be listening through the early hours all the time.

2156
02:44:23,749 --> 02:44:26,833
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, and if Derek's listening, I know he's going to appreciate that shout-out.

2157
02:44:28,355 --> 02:44:28,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

2158
02:44:28,836 --> 02:44:29,116
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2159
02:44:29,176 --> 02:44:29,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

2160
02:44:30,598 --> 02:44:31,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.

2161
02:44:31,078 --> 02:44:31,439
[SPEAKER_14]: All the best.

2162
02:44:31,639 --> 02:44:31,879
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2163
02:44:31,919 --> 02:44:32,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

2164
02:44:33,462 --> 02:44:33,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

2165
02:44:34,102 --> 02:44:35,983
[SPEAKER_14]: The International Orange Lounge Radio.

2166
02:44:36,003 --> 02:44:44,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm even being asked in our chat room, I think I'm saying this name right, Delighter in our chat room says, Rob is very fond of the Irish, I take it.

2167
02:44:45,088 --> 02:44:47,449
[SPEAKER_14]: I get mistaken as Irish all the time.

2168
02:44:47,489 --> 02:44:47,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even tell you.

2169
02:44:47,989 --> 02:44:48,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of that red hair.

2170
02:44:49,010 --> 02:44:52,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, look at that little get up I wore to Umlaut with the hat and everything.

2171
02:44:53,492 --> 02:44:55,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I did look kind of Irish, even I'll admit that.

2172
02:44:55,973 --> 02:44:58,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I am actually, by heritage, I am half Scottish.

2173
02:44:59,395 --> 02:45:00,516
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look very Scottish.

2174
02:45:00,756 --> 02:45:02,477
[SPEAKER_10]: That means that you greet people by headbutting them.

2175
02:45:02,937 --> 02:45:09,861
[SPEAKER_14]: My real name is Dutch, so I have a little more in common with Syl from Girls Gone Wild than I do with that color.

2176
02:45:09,921 --> 02:45:12,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I married a Dutch ancestry.

2177
02:45:12,723 --> 02:45:13,343
[SPEAKER_14]: You did.

2178
02:45:13,503 --> 02:45:16,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Your husband has a very Dutch... It's funny that... You have a Dutch name now, too.

2179
02:45:16,705 --> 02:45:20,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a Dutch name, but none of my blood kin are remotely Dutch.

2180
02:45:20,688 --> 02:45:22,789
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we got another call on the line, so let's go to it.

2181
02:45:22,829 --> 02:45:23,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2182
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:24,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2183
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:26,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobuo Amatsu

2184
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,562
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple nights ago... Wait, wait, now, we don't need to hear about your romantic adventures.

2185
02:45:39,602 --> 02:45:40,603
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no.

2186
02:45:40,643 --> 02:45:43,504
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's actually the name... Well, that was the name of the little concert that he had.

2187
02:45:43,524 --> 02:45:44,965
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of dirty.

2188
02:45:44,985 --> 02:45:45,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2189
02:45:46,406 --> 02:45:46,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

2190
02:45:47,326 --> 02:45:49,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, don't tell me to shut up.

2191
02:45:49,648 --> 02:45:50,288
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my show.

2192
02:45:50,408 --> 02:45:50,708
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2193
02:45:51,309 --> 02:45:51,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay.

2194
02:45:52,809 --> 02:45:56,671
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but it was just this really small concert where it was just 150 people.

2195
02:45:57,372 --> 02:46:03,575
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Nobuo Matsu and Arnie Roth, who's this conductor in Chicago, and they had this string quartet playing...

2196
02:46:04,504 --> 02:46:28,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark World from Final Fantasy 6 and this new string quartet arrangement of Fight with Seymour from Final Fantasy 10 and it sounded really good and I was really excited about it so of course I had my phone on me and I tried sneaking my camera on and I recorded the whole concert and I tried putting it on YouTube actually that sounds awesome but you know what

2197
02:46:29,709 --> 02:46:30,410
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was worth it.

2198
02:46:30,450 --> 02:46:31,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

2199
02:46:31,351 --> 02:46:37,496
[SPEAKER_11]: The piracy, the jail time is going to be worth it because it was so good.

2200
02:46:37,877 --> 02:46:42,941
[SPEAKER_11]: When the songs were done, I turned around to see people climbing and stuff.

2201
02:46:42,961 --> 02:46:44,823
[SPEAKER_11]: People had their camera right in front of their face.

2202
02:46:45,143 --> 02:46:46,884
[SPEAKER_11]: They were being very obvious about us.

2203
02:46:46,904 --> 02:46:47,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, whatever.

2204
02:46:47,644 --> 02:46:48,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel bad anymore.

2205
02:46:48,465 --> 02:46:51,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, an intimate evening in Cell Block 5 with Stan.

2206
02:46:55,448 --> 02:46:56,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing, though.

2207
02:46:57,109 --> 02:47:03,692
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you get into this concert if it's only 150 people?

2208
02:47:03,712 --> 02:47:04,093
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2209
02:47:04,513 --> 02:47:09,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember where it was being advertised, but a friend of mine posted this link on Facebook, and I saw it.

2210
02:47:10,296 --> 02:47:12,177
[SPEAKER_11]: It said, intimate evening with Novo Matsun.

2211
02:47:12,197 --> 02:47:12,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I read the description.

2212
02:47:13,561 --> 02:47:14,722
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2213
02:47:45,194 --> 02:47:50,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I got my 3DS signed by Noble and Arnie.

2214
02:47:50,401 --> 02:47:51,322
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool.

2215
02:47:51,703 --> 02:47:53,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, hold on, wait.

2216
02:47:58,723 --> 02:47:59,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked Arnie Roth

2217
02:48:30,186 --> 02:48:45,671
[SPEAKER_11]: If he would ever consider having an amateur musician sit-down session reading the actual orchestral music, being able to experience the orchestra feel by being inside it, by paying like a small fee, and he was actually really interested in the idea.

2218
02:48:45,691 --> 02:48:55,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's what he told me, but it sounded really cool because I really wanted to play, you know, Final Fantasy music in an orchestral setting with Arnie Roth and Nobu playing, or

2219
02:48:56,848 --> 02:48:59,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured that'd be really, really cool.

2220
02:48:59,569 --> 02:49:01,910
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like a heck of an experience.

2221
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:04,671
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's obviously lots of band nerds who are video game nerds.

2222
02:49:04,711 --> 02:49:06,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say that endearingly because I was a band nerd in high school.

2223
02:49:07,291 --> 02:49:14,133
[SPEAKER_14]: There's lots of band nerds and video game nerds that are kind of into both those worlds that I think would just get the ultimate kick out of that.

2224
02:49:14,393 --> 02:49:16,794
[SPEAKER_14]: But now I'm going to have to ask you, what do you play in the orchestra?

2225
02:49:18,375 --> 02:49:19,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, actually nothing.

2226
02:49:19,815 --> 02:49:21,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I play saxophone.

2227
02:49:21,996 --> 02:49:23,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wouldn't even be able to do this.

2228
02:49:23,656 --> 02:49:24,677
[SPEAKER_11]: So does Dark Sakura.

2229
02:49:24,717 --> 02:49:25,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura is a saxophone.

2230
02:49:25,537 --> 02:49:26,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd probably have to...

2231
02:49:27,216 --> 02:49:31,939
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is a sax person too.

2232
02:49:31,979 --> 02:49:32,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing though.

2233
02:49:32,740 --> 02:49:40,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you couldn't play the Final Fantasy music as part of the jam, what you could do is when the time's right, you could just be there in the back and you can just bust out with this.

2234
02:49:42,446 --> 02:49:44,187
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2235
02:49:44,327 --> 02:49:45,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Be the epic sax guy.

2236
02:49:52,379 --> 02:49:54,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet, I'm the beatbox guy.

2237
02:49:56,162 --> 02:49:56,422
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2238
02:49:56,862 --> 02:50:00,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Stan, I'm going to have to let you go because the connection's a little bit shit, but that's not your fault.

2239
02:50:00,225 --> 02:50:00,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't worry about it.

2240
02:50:01,246 --> 02:50:02,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for sharing your experience.

2241
02:50:03,427 --> 02:50:06,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Please share the pictures online on Twitters or something so we can see them.

2242
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:08,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know what?

2243
02:50:08,551 --> 02:50:11,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll send you a link on Facebook or something because that's the only place I have it right now.

2244
02:50:11,633 --> 02:50:13,034
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to see the bootlegs.

2245
02:50:13,234 --> 02:50:14,415
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see the bootlegs very much.

2246
02:50:15,536 --> 02:50:15,836
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 minutes.

2247
02:50:16,116 --> 02:50:16,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's long.

2248
02:50:16,977 --> 02:50:17,777
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all right.

2249
02:50:18,338 --> 02:50:18,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.

2250
02:50:19,018 --> 02:50:19,319
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2251
02:50:19,819 --> 02:50:20,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, send it on over.

2252
02:50:21,080 --> 02:50:21,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Take it.

2253
02:50:22,475 --> 02:50:23,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

2254
02:50:23,175 --> 02:50:23,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're breaking up.

2255
02:50:23,976 --> 02:50:24,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one.

2256
02:50:24,596 --> 02:50:24,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Good night.

2257
02:50:25,617 --> 02:50:26,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, too.

2258
02:50:26,237 --> 02:50:26,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2259
02:50:26,737 --> 02:50:27,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2260
02:50:28,118 --> 02:50:28,378
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2261
02:50:28,398 --> 02:50:30,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Bummer about the connection, but hey, it happens.

2262
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:31,680
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you do?

2263
02:50:32,241 --> 02:50:32,561
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2264
02:50:33,101 --> 02:50:34,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if I can wrap up these Twitter topics.

2265
02:50:34,662 --> 02:50:36,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go ahead and close Skype for the night.

2266
02:50:36,183 --> 02:50:37,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

2267
02:50:37,444 --> 02:50:38,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

2268
02:50:38,504 --> 02:50:41,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but try again next week.

2269
02:50:42,046 --> 02:50:43,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, of course, you can always send us an email.

2270
02:50:44,088 --> 02:50:47,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2271
02:50:49,698 --> 02:50:51,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh shit, I was actually out of tweets.

2272
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:52,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I can do one more.

2273
02:50:52,261 --> 02:50:54,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let Tigerclaw have one more because this is pretty good.

2274
02:50:55,523 --> 02:50:58,226
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll do this other link from Tigerclaw here who sent us a link.

2275
02:50:58,626 --> 02:51:03,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Retired NFL players are getting the green light for a lawsuit against EA.

2276
02:51:04,693 --> 02:51:09,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you didn't hear, but retired NFL players actually filed a lawsuit against EA.

2277
02:51:10,295 --> 02:51:15,798
[SPEAKER_14]: A California judge rejected EA's case to have the whole thing dismissed.

2278
02:51:16,838 --> 02:51:19,739
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to turn this into a class action lawsuit, so $6,000.

2279
02:51:22,481 --> 02:51:34,516
[SPEAKER_14]: The alleged lawsuit here is that EA through EA Sports brand used the likenesses without consent in multiple Madden NFL games over the years.

2280
02:51:35,056 --> 02:51:40,002
[SPEAKER_14]: EA says it was basically fair use and real names were never used.

2281
02:51:40,583 --> 02:51:42,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

2282
02:51:42,284 --> 02:51:43,365
[SPEAKER_14]: EA is mad in games, though.

2283
02:51:43,385 --> 02:51:47,928
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a lot of historic teams that use stats, attributes, and other factors for fantasy players.

2284
02:51:48,309 --> 02:51:52,972
[SPEAKER_14]: They're close to the real-life counterparts, but not exact.

2285
02:51:54,053 --> 02:51:55,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Or so EA claims.

2286
02:51:55,794 --> 02:52:01,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't play these games, so it's hard for me to take an opinion on this one way or the other.

2287
02:52:01,478 --> 02:52:06,922
[SPEAKER_14]: But the judge certainly felt they had a case, so it could be very interesting to see how this plays out.

2288
02:52:06,942 --> 02:52:08,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

2289
02:52:08,283 --> 02:52:09,943
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it for our tweets tonight.

2290
02:52:09,983 --> 02:52:12,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2291
02:52:13,004 --> 02:52:16,005
[SPEAKER_14]: But that also brings us to the end of the show.

2292
02:52:17,065 --> 02:52:20,246
[SPEAKER_14]: But not before I ask for any last-minute stories from Loki or DarkSakura.

2293
02:52:20,606 --> 02:52:20,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good.

2294
02:52:21,486 --> 02:52:21,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Meh.

2295
02:52:22,106 --> 02:52:22,447
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2296
02:52:22,987 --> 02:52:24,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, shit, we're done then.

2297
02:52:24,107 --> 02:52:24,547
[SPEAKER_14]: We're out.

2298
02:52:24,607 --> 02:52:28,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do a last-minute... Let me do my last-minute kind of plea here.

2299
02:52:28,848 --> 02:52:33,029
[SPEAKER_14]: We are, of course, a free show, and we do this every week for nothing.

2300
02:52:33,069 --> 02:52:34,329
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't charge you guys.

2301
02:52:34,369 --> 02:52:36,390
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have ads in the show or ads on our website.

2302
02:52:36,870 --> 02:52:40,694
[SPEAKER_14]: All we ask is that you tell a friend or two or 50 about the show.

2303
02:52:41,154 --> 02:52:54,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Help us spread the word by leaving a nice review on a website such as iTunes or wherever you found this podcast or help tell people and spread the word about OLR because you'll help our little OLR army grow and we really appreciate it.

2304
02:52:55,966 --> 02:52:58,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2305
02:52:58,428 --> 02:52:59,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

2306
02:52:59,688 --> 02:53:10,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's ironic that Volition or THQ or Saints Row's April Fool's show was for a new thing, a DLC that actually sounded cooler than the DLC that they put out.

2307
02:53:12,654 --> 02:53:13,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Haha.

2308
02:53:13,635 --> 02:53:14,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Joke's on you.

2309
02:53:14,335 --> 02:53:15,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Your DLC sucked.

2310
02:53:15,616 --> 02:53:17,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't buy the last two bits of it.

2311
02:53:17,256 --> 02:53:18,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, read Ready Player One.

2312
02:53:19,818 --> 02:53:21,358
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do it.

2313
02:53:21,538 --> 02:53:22,399
[SPEAKER_13]: You won't be able to put it down.

2314
02:53:23,694 --> 02:53:44,581
[SPEAKER_14]: my final thought for tonight is I'm excited that it's taco night because it's sure to be better than that shit taco I had at Chevy's on Monday just saying that was a pretty who puts fucking mayonnaise on a taco what right it was cilantro mayonnaise is gross hated it DarkSakura how about your final thought

2315
02:53:45,678 --> 02:53:54,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I really have to give, uh, the, uh, April Fool's award to, uh, Google for Google Quest.

2316
02:53:54,924 --> 02:53:57,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we didn't even bring that up tonight, but that was amazing.

2317
02:53:57,326 --> 02:53:57,886
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

2318
02:53:58,286 --> 02:54:01,288
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the little commercial blowing in the cartridge and everything.

2319
02:54:01,468 --> 02:54:09,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved the Easter eggs of like the little landmarks being, and there's a whole list on Reddit of like all the different hidden landmarks.

2320
02:54:09,934 --> 02:54:10,854
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

2321
02:54:11,395 --> 02:54:11,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved it.

2322
02:54:11,875 --> 02:54:13,936
[SPEAKER_14]: They used all the Dragon Quest art in it.

2323
02:54:14,276 --> 02:54:15,037
[SPEAKER_14]: It was awesome.

2324
02:54:15,297 --> 02:54:18,239
[SPEAKER_10]: and the YouTube collection.

2325
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:20,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, I saw that.

2326
02:54:20,581 --> 02:54:21,221
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

2327
02:54:22,182 --> 02:54:23,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well that's it guys.

2328
02:54:23,503 --> 02:54:25,604

2329
02:54:25,624 --> 02:54:35,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back another week and next week it won't be April Fools anymore so it'll be a little more serious but we can still be a little silly tonight, right?

2330
02:54:35,691 --> 02:54:36,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good night.

2331
02:54:37,150 --> 02:54:59,788

2332
02:55:00,709 --> 02:55:02,450
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn!

2333
02:55:03,471 --> 02:55:04,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Ow, my foot!

2334
02:55:04,852 --> 02:55:07,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

2335
02:55:07,414 --> 02:55:09,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

2336
02:55:12,358 --> 02:55:13,399
[SPEAKER_12]: No, my foot!

2337
02:55:13,459 --> 02:55:14,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I need that for walking!

2338
02:55:15,681 --> 02:55:17,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.

2339
02:55:18,203 --> 02:55:19,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

2340
02:55:19,964 --> 02:55:23,327
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out.

2341
02:55:23,407 --> 02:55:25,008
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like, what the hell's the point?

2342
02:55:25,068 --> 02:55:29,452
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there.

2343
02:55:33,368 --> 02:55:36,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see the point.

2344
02:55:38,354 --> 02:55:40,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why men will never have babies.

2345
02:55:40,596 --> 02:55:43,039
[SPEAKER_16]: The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.

2346
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:46,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
