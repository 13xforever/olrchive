14067	15629	Tonight, April 29th, 2012.
15729	19414	The release date leaks for one big game this fall.
19714	26142	Nintendo will bring retail digital downloads to the Wii U. And could Microsoft be planning another music service?
31733	39301	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39802	45328	We are live as we are every week at VOG Network.
47610	51512	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
51912	54453	You can join us in our chat room at vognetwork.com.
54873	57535	I'll be talking more about the chat and some of those changes in just a minute.
57655	63637	But my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and lols with my co-host.
63677	65818	Say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers.
66078	66259	Hi.
66519	67019	How are you?
67299	67619	Voggy.
69820	70480	Wait a minute.
70540	72801	This isn't a station about volcanic fog.
73101	75182	Wikipedia told me VOG is volcanic fog.
75222	75682	What is this?
76083	77403	Wikipedia is wrong.
78744	78984	All right.
79044	80584	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
80705	81025	Hello.
81045	81985	How are you doing, Loki?
82145	82625	I'm full.
82965	83506	You're full.
83606	84426	Full of crap.
84646	86587	That's the same joke I made with her last week.
86687	88588	I just ate a big pizza.
89008	91109	I just ate some dried okra.
92109	96732	And I have breadsticks staring at me, but I can literally not fit anymore into my stomach.
97113	98894	So, some things never change.
99054	100915	Some things change, but some things never change.
101316	102476	Oh, I am getting hungry.
103377	105358	Just looking at those breadsticks is making me hungry.
105378	106059	I'm going to close this.
106519	110582	Alright, so before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about the big obvious thing that's out there.
110882	115906	We weren't able to talk about it last week because we were trying to transition from the old Network to...
116386	116646	Geek-Life.com
137694	138655	Voice of Geeks Network
159753	161754	Our eyes are... We started over.
161834	162234	That's right.
162274	165316	We are starting over.
165376	166616	It's not just about Bomani.
167176	168477	It's not just about games.
169017	171898	It's about all things geek is what this station is all about.
172059	173999	And that's going to be reflected in the playlist.
174240	177661	That's going to be reflected in the shows that you're going to hear on the network.
177961	180582	And most importantly, it's not just a radio network.
181003	186185	The VOG Network is going to be a whole website that has other things as well.
186305	188746	Forums and other ways to interact online.
188926	192268	with folks and some really exciting maybe metagames.
192288	195350	I don't want to spoil too much, but just say there's great things in store for VOG.
195390	212580	The site that you see there now at vognetwork.com, kind of a temporary what we call the phase one so that you guys have a way to continue to listen to us and so that way our shows aren't interrupted at all, but the later phases are going to bring more, more shows to the radio network, more things to see and do on the website.
213740	214361	It's going to be great.
214981	222572	So go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see, who do I give the first chat comment to tonight?
222632	227238	I'm going to give it to Hecht, who calls VOG the Voice of God Network.
227258	227399	Okay.
229023	230044	That's a whole other network.
230845	234047	Yeah, that might be, you know, got to go through the religious programming to get that.
234307	239171	And if you pay us $50,000, you'll be guaranteed a place in heaven.
239511	246316	Speaking of chat, we're saying goodbye to our old chat room, which was at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
247017	249559	And it was Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.
249599	250620	We're saying goodbye to that.
251140	253362	And I know some people are like, I don't like change.
253402	254543	Why do things have to change?
255223	281387	but um we wanted to you know for a long time when we were at our old home we had one chat room they had another and things always felt really disconnected and it was it was a little weird so we wanted to make sure this time we did it right and we merge into the general network chat room especially the fact that the shows that are all starting this network have a lot of listener overlap anyway it really made sense to kind of have a central home or a hub for that
282087	285169	Our new chat room is Channel VOG.
285509	287050	It's still on the Game Search Network.
288010	293673	If you want to join it really easy using the Java or whatever, the chat client online, just go to vognetwork.com.
294293	294894	You can't miss it.
294934	295754	It's right in front of your face.
295794	297155	It's the biggest thing on the page right now.
297215	300917	vognetwork.com and you will see the chat.
300997	304118	You don't have to use vognetwork.com to listen to the station.
304819	309181	You have little things that you can copy-paste into Winamp and mobile phones and all that.
309621	310722	That is going to be developing
311582	312542	all through the coming weeks.
313363	315363	I do want to put this out there for the podcast listeners.
315964	320065	Those that are listening on the podcast, nothing's changed for them.
320105	321766	They're just like, oh, hey, another week, another show.
321826	322226	Here it is.
322286	323586	And it sounds the same as it always has.
323927	324827	And that's the intention.
324867	326427	It's not supposed to sound any different to you guys.
326848	333590	If you do happen to visit VOG Network during the week, keep in mind we don't have the stream up 24-7 yet.
334370	338272	That is part of Phase 2 that's going to be implemented within the next couple weeks.
338352	339032	It's going to be fast.
339312	348318	So I just don't want you to be surprised if you go to vognetwork.com and it's not Saturday night or Sunday night, because Saturday is when Understation Live's on, Sunday's when we're on with Bobby, you're not going to hear anything.
348818	350640	That's going to be that way for a couple weeks.
350740	356023	We're slowly expanding with the network, and I'm so excited.
356744	357184	It's great.
358205	366270	Kind of sitting at the driver's wheel, being part of having created this, getting to steer this site in the direction we want to take it for geeks everywhere.
366830	372574	and giving everybody a voice through radio shows, through feature articles, through forums.
372734	374175	It's going to be awesome.
374476	375076	So excited.
376017	376277	All right.
376357	383602	So anyhow, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming week and so forth and the stuff we've been playing in the gaming world this week.
383662	384723	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
385183	385964	I ain't played shit.
386124	386564	No, I'm kidding.
386704	386904	What?
387585	402013	I played WoW, and then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7, only to find out that I'm missing my entire iTunes collection from about S down, including my ringtones directory.
402373	408077	So I've lost most of the ringtones that I've made, including my Doctor Who theme from Season 10, which makes me irritated.
408797	410098	Well, this is the interweb.
410158	411598	Surely you can find that in a heartbeat.
411858	412659	I made that one.
412859	416140	And the VOG Network probably has it in the upcoming playlist.
418401	421423	For anyone who I've ever sent those ringtones to, just send them back to me, please.
422043	426505	Anyway, so I played some WoW.
427205	428206	I've finally gotten the beta.
429006	431527	Well, I mean, I had the beta key.
431647	433028	I just wasn't beta-ing.
433688	434689	Now I am beta-ing.
435209	437670	I've made a panda named Sakurina.
439355	443317	Every time I try to play my 85s that I transferred over, the game crashes on me.
444298	444598	Oops!
445698	447079	So yeah.
448580	458905	And then we were loaned the Tekken Street Fighter poop game because my friend bought it on PS3 and promptly said, this is broken!
459526	460266	And loaned it to us.
460988	461909	You can play it.
462189	462649	I hate it.
463330	468973	So we were going to play it, but things have been busy with me trying to do everything.
469174	476238	And Tiger Claw, I backed up my entire iTunes directory, let it finish, double checked it, and somehow half of it was still missing.
476478	477199	So shut up.
478580	479220	You're so nice.
479480	479721	I know.
480641	481582	I'm a wonderful person.
482542	487966	By the way, Tiger Claw had suggested that this is why I make a backup of my entire iTunes library on a second hard drive.
488311	488832	That's what I did.
490013	501024	So anyway, at any rate, it's just been me trying to play catch up and working and I have two more weeks of school.
501805	503427	Then I'm going to Disneyland.
504628	505489	Oh, congrats.
505609	507571	I wish I could go, but I don't think it's going to work out.
507732	508713	This is everything else going on.
509553	509674	Yeah.
509694	509814	Okay.
511480	511941	LOL bye.
512401	512641	All right.
512661	512901	Bye.
513242	514182	You want to feature me for me?
514463	516324	Yeah, we can talk about that offline.
516344	516665	Why not?
517145	517405	All right.
517746	519247	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
519267	519647	What did you do?
520568	522810	I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
522990	523791	That's pretty much it.
524574	525234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
545302	556133	I had started it months ago, but I have been continuing on working on my full-size papercraft model of Portal Turret.
556673	557454	That's about 3.5 feet tall.
557474	559076	It will be 3.5 feet tall when it's done.
563620	566081	So, I posted a picture in the chatroom.
566542	575287	What I have done so far is pretty much just the two shells of the actual body minus the gun doors on there because those are actually separate pieces.
575488	578950	You can actually make it with the guns, but I'm not.
579030	580171	I'm just going to keep the doors shut.
580191	581612	It makes it easier.
581732	588536	By the way, we probably should get Ranma to put that to the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can see this thing that you're building.
588556	589397	Sure.
589775	590296	We can do that.
610394	612495	This is one of the least annoying projects, I'm sure.
612515	614455	It's just cutting paper.
614475	621857	I think it's cost me so far like $20, and that's only because I bought the wrong thickness paper at one point.
623177	630359	But it's just like cardstock with glue, the special glue, because it's quick-drying and works great.
631519	634080	And then just an X-Acto blade and stuff.
634120	634260	But
635339	636340	Thanks for watching!
655049	657350	It's not going to be just a regular Portal turret.
657450	661353	It's going to be the one from Portal 2 that you save.
661573	662693	Excuse me.
663074	664374	Excuse me.
665395	666256	No, that sounds awesome.
666296	667536	I can't wait to see the finished product.
668017	668997	I know you'll bring it to the show.
669157	670158	I will bring it to the show.
670178	670778	I know you will.
670898	671438	It'll be great.
672299	675361	So that whole video content we want to add to VOG eventually.
675701	677522	It'll just be a static camera pointing at your Portal gun.
677982	678382	Sounds good.
678643	679163	Very ominous.
679623	687887	Alright, so on my gaming week, I was reading some of the comments in chat room and earlier somebody had brought up Phantasy Star Online 2 and the whole beta that's going on.
688007	691749	I wish I was playing that, but I guess it's only in Japanese right now, which stinks.
691809	693870	I really want to check that out at some point.
694330	697571	I've had a lot of friends beta testing MMOs this week.
698292	702854	Guild Wars 2 apparently has got their thing going on for people that pre-purchased the game.
703374	706736	If you already gave them your money, you get to play the game a little early.
707317	708638	It's like an open beta test.
708658	710619	I was going to say, isn't that coming out soon?
710799	711780	Yeah, it's pretty soon.
711860	712780	I am interested in the game.
712880	716863	And for those that remember Irene, she used to go by Rice Princess years ago on this show.
716883	719845	If you remember Irene, she's really into Guild Wars, especially this new one.
719885	722006	And she says the PvP is awesome.
722407	724168	So I'm curious to check that out.
725248	752713	Xtifer from Horde House has been playing Terra which is apparently pretty good you can make some very fancy pants looking characters in Terra so I want to check that out too because the graphics in that look really good but the MMO that's been taking up my week is of course World of Warcraft hello what else but I have been playing some offline games as well on the Xbox 360 and again note the day note the time other big news besides the new network I didn't just beat one game this year you guys I
753573	755474	I beat two games this year.
755634	756955	Applause, please.
757695	757955	Good job.
758776	760557	So I beat Mass Effect, right?
760857	761877	And the new game I beat?
762458	763338	Mass Effect 2.
763738	764579	Congratulations.
764599	769501	Your freight train of intimate disappointment is full speed ahead.
769821	771022	Here's my quote for you.
772142	772663	Yeah, thank you.
772743	773063	Thank you.
774640	778523	So, of course, the other day, I think that was what, probably Monday?
778603	781965	Yeah, but Rob, when are you going to beat a game that came out this year?
784607	788849	Well, well, smartass, I just started Mass Effect 3!
789870	813913	go figure it was on sale for 40 bucks a couple weeks ago so I picked up a copy of Mass Effect 3 so I had it ready to go and away I went and so I've been playing that a little bit and I gotta say you know just like some things some little things change from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2 more things change to Mass Effect 3 and I I'm really loving it oh my gosh the story is great there's
814093	814613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
836193	839255	So, it's really cool getting to run into everybody and see them in part three.
839916	843539	And, you know, just the combat is so much better.
844080	849384	Like, even though they didn't really change a lot, like, it's still, you know, you have your guns and use your powers.
849865	851666	Everything just feels more fluid.
851707	852727	Like, I can't explain it.
852787	854569	Like, and just the graphics are up a notch.
854989	855470	It's great.
855570	857452	I'm having such a good time with three.
857772	859493	And here's the crazy part.
860234	867463	I'm playing multiplayer because Mass Effect 3 has a whole multiplayer thing online that you can go in and it's basically, it's all co-op.
867784	868525	It's not competitive.
868585	872189	You basically do these four-player co-op matches and, you know, it's not...
873197	881563	It's not as rich and as full as the main game, but you know that whole thing that apparently every game has to have multiplayer these days, especially if you're EA, right?
882083	888267	So Mass Effect now has this multiplayer mode, and it's basically four-player co-op surviving ten waves on a map.
888447	893391	And it's ten waves of enemies, but that could be, you know, little enemies, big enemies.
893731	896533	It could be hold a point on the map for a minute.
896673	902437	It could be go find the different markers on the map and activate the beacons or whatever within a certain amount of time.
902757	904138	There are little modes that they put in it.
904558	906578	But the fact that it's co-op makes it really interesting.
907579	910620	Now, so I've said a lot of great things about Mass Effect 3, right?
910660	912180	And I really do truly love this game.
912220	920303	And even if the ending blows ass, which I'm fully expecting it to, I've already been set up for disappointment, the experience of getting there is fine.
920544	923965	I feel like, especially because I bought it on sale, it's been money well spent.
924965	927106	By the way, even though I bought these games on sale...
928768	935735	I bought every single story DLC for Part 2 and I beat all of those as well.
936096	941222	Shadow Broker, Arrival, Overlord, Kasumi, Zaid, I played all of it.
942723	944746	And that was a very important thing I had to do before I started 3.
946287	962647	so speaking of online and DLC here's my problem with Mass Effect 3 and this is a big problem and this is my this is why I'm going to be hesitant to give this my game of the year extremely hesitant to give this my game of the year award and
964651	968592	It's basically the blatant money grab the EA is going for with this.
969672	975094	In multiplayer, you don't level the same character that you level in single player.
975674	982115	You level your character in multiplayer, and the way you do that is that you earn credits with every map that you do.
982455	985536	The more waves you survive, the more you contribute, the more credits you get.
985556	988877	And if you manage to make it all the way to the end and get airlifted out, you get a lot of credits.
989577	994901	and you use the credits to buy little boxes that are akin to a Magic the Gathering booster pack.
995281	999004	You can buy a cheapy box for $5,000 that'll have cheapy stuff in it.
999344	1007090	You can buy a slightly better box for $20,000 credits that has better stuff and are rare.
1007470	1012014	And then you can buy a jumbo box for $60,000 that has super rare or whatever in it.
1012054	1013235	I'm kind of paraphrasing here.
1013795	1014956	But where am I going with this?
1015497	1022643	Not only can you buy the boxes with in-game credits, but you can buy the boxes with Microsoft Points.
1023204	1026807	And I'm assuming on the PlayStation 3, you can buy it with PlayStation Store dollars.
1027347	1031071	And on the PC, I'm sure you can tap into their EA Network and buy them as well.
1031651	1035455	So in other words, you can use money to get ahead in the game.
1036095	1045845	And the other thing that's a little bit irritating with that is that if you want the A-plus best way to get through the game, you really have to play multiplayer.
1046065	1051310	Because multiplayer ties into this event called galactic readiness that starts at half, 50%.
1052091	1055073	The more you play multiplayer, the more the galactic readiness goes up.
1055814	1070780	technically you can get the best ending if you did everything perfect in Mass Effect 1 everything perfect in Mass Effect 2 like you'd have to use a guide online to do it you would absolutely have to use a guide online in order to be able to do it and never touch multiplayer so in other words
1071360	1092947	if you want the best ending which as I understand there isn't that big of a difference anyway between them but by the time the DLC comes out maybe that'll change if you want the best in single player you have to play multiplayer and real money gives you the edge in order to kind of get there as fast as possible because they didn't already take your money when you bought the game it makes me not want to play
1093610	1094830	It's kind of shitty.
1095710	1106173	EA, that's why you make gamers so angry that they rigged that poll to go vote you the worst company in America whether you deserved it or not.
1106893	1107933	That's the problem.
1108893	1112814	And I think it needs to be called out because guess what, gaming industry?
1112934	1115155	You can't have your cake and eat it too.
1115815	1120436	You don't get to charge people that type of money for a game up front and the additional DLC.
1121076	1123278	and then charge the money for Pokemon packs.
1124038	1124939	And I know what you're saying.
1124979	1126720	Well, if you don't like it, then don't buy it.
1126760	1127981	Rob, it's only going to get worse.
1128281	1128521	I know.
1129302	1134805	I mean, we're going to get into it later, but we've already gotten a glimpse of the future and it's only going to get worse.
1136526	1140448	Acidic Vampire in chat says, yes, but Rob, buying them with money is just an option.
1140568	1144330	If you beat the multiplayer on silver and gold, you will be swimming in credits.
1144750	1145691	And I understand that.
1146171	1151233	But there's some people that aren't going to want to play multiplayer that are going to be tempted to do that to give them an edge.
1151353	1151574	Why?
1151614	1153695	Because it ultimately does affect single player.
1154135	1155315	I hate multiplayer.
1155335	1157697	See, that's a poor decision.
1157797	1162319	Any way you slice it, having the multiplayer tie in that close to single player was a poor decision.
1163335	1164376	I really don't want to play it now.
1164896	1168999	I mean, honestly, it just has deflated any desire.
1169299	1173522	Well, I think you're robbing yourself of what is otherwise an excellent story and an excellent game.
1173542	1177945	To be honest, I hate multiplayer games unless they're in the house with me.
1178225	1180506	Technically, you don't have to play multiplayer.
1180526	1181467	You just won't get the best ending.
1182407	1186369	Well, even the best ending, it doesn't even matter because you can actually play multiplayer.
1186449	1190051	Well, you wouldn't have to buy those packs necessarily to get the experience that you need.
1190471	1202397	But like, I mean, there's some other games, Saints Row the Third, that just have really shitty DLC that they put out at a really expensive amount of money just so that you get more content to the game.
1202817	1204078	And it's just terrible.
1204098	1205219	It's only like 30 minutes.
1205519	1205579	Or...
1205999	1212444	Hey, we're teasing that there's a character that you love that we decided, hey, we're going to fuck you guys up and kill him in the very beginning of the game.
1212785	1214246	Oh, but he's going to come back, but not really.
1214286	1217448	But we're going to tell you that he's coming back so that you buy this $7 piece of crap.
1218069	1221532	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, you don't need to play multiplayer to get the best ending.
1221652	1226536	There's an app you can download on your iPhone or iPad that will help increase the galactic readiness rating.
1226596	1227097	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1245277	1270585	like you you're allowing people to buy a competitive edge when you know people are it's just it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth yeah defend defend Mass Effect all you want it's I still say it's a great game great story awesome characters wonderful gameplay but this is a shitty choice I'm looking at this app now take your galaxy with you wherever you go okay
1271277	1273137	You know, the galaxy is in Orion's ball.
1275398	1276318	Orion's necklace.
1276358	1280939	A city vampire also says, technically you could play the multiplayer by yourself to up the galactic readiness.
1281319	1290521	Yeah, but I did two player, which is me and Shane, yesterday, and we survived to wave three, and we were really excited that we got that far.
1291902	1293362	Yes, I misquoted that.
1293742	1295423	The galaxy is in Orion's belt.
1295983	1297283	It's been a while since I saw it in black.
1297611	1302875	Alright, so all that bitching aside, Mass Effect 3 is still going to be one of the year's best games.
1303356	1305978	I just think, I'm side-eyeing EA.
1306258	1307299	I'm looking at you, EA.
1307359	1308379	This is a shitty choice.
1308820	1313243	If game designers continue to go down this path, this is what's going to cause the next game crash.
1313543	1313964	Watch.
1315873	1332607	this and the no use thing and everything all these other money grabs gaming companies are trying to do in this economy is gonna tank it this is money grabbing light this is nothing compared to some of the crap they're pulling right now Skylanders Skylanders, I'm telling you right there that right there
1333550	1334331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1354028	1354428	Bitch, please.
1382791	1394746	When the job that you work requires your brain and then you have to use your brain some more, the brain does not have much juice left to think about multiplayer and shooting things.
1396689	1398331	I don't even ever want to play WoW.
1401034	1401354	All right.
1402115	1404697	Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week, really.
1404717	1405218	Mass Effect 3.
1405278	1407240	Oh, no, I guess I should give one other little shout out.
1407460	1408040	Quick one, guys.
1408080	1409241	Quick one, and then we can get into the news.
1410082	1415627	I will say quickly, I watched a friend of mine last night play Silent Hill Downpour, which is the new Silent Hill game.
1416127	1417549	I went to a friend's house to watch him play it.
1418169	1418249	Um...
1419250	1420770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1444115	1470432	but there's a lot of I mean I you can't judge the whole game based off that one like silly part you know otherwise and plus I didn't really spend quality time with it and I wasn't the one playing but look and ambience aside it is it does seem like there's a lot they got right like there were some oh shit moments like there's a part where he's walking across this fallen tree that like you know he might fall at any minute and then he like a twig snaps off the tree and and goes plummeting down you know
1470752	1474773	Cheap ass scares like that that you come to love out of playing these scary video games.
1475054	1476674	There are some cool little things like that.
1477614	1483236	I didn't play enough of the game to really tell you if it's worth it or not, but I will tell you my friend seems to be enjoying it.
1483737	1490419	It's not Silent Hill 2 or Silent Hill 3, but let's be real, nothing ever will be.
1490779	1495761	Shit, Silent Hill 2 and 3 that just came out last month isn't Silent Hill 2 and 3 anymore.
1496701	1520267	so if you can let that go I think this is a pretty decent game from what I understand it actually did occur to me there was some other gaming that went on at my house Dan playing through Gradius 3 and me failing miserably at R-Type just saying sorry to hear that sorry to hear that just because I wanted to hear the level 1 music and then when I'm done with level 1 it's kind of like I don't want to play anymore
1521710	1529854	Alright, go to our chatroom at vognetwork.com if you want to join us as we are live on this Sunday evening as we will be every week from here on out at the VOG Network.
1529934	1537357	vognetwork.com Looking through some comments in chat, Zether says, I heard the Silent Hill HD collection sucks.
1537957	1538897	Yeah, I heard that too.
1539738	1541818	It did suck, unfortunately.
1541978	1546079	I mean, I haven't played it myself, but just what I'm reading isn't good.
1546299	1550981	Apparently, next-gen consoles can't handle last-gen fog.
1551441	1552501	That's ridiculous.
1552621	1555482	Downpour, I watched, played on a PS3, and it had plenty of fog.
1556502	1557102	And here's the thing.
1557482	1561524	If you can't render the fog, then why bother releasing the game?
1561724	1566645	It's like if you can't create an emulator or whatever to run the old code...
1568425	1571006	Don't release a broken game.
1587490	1592393	The parts that I heard, again, in my limited viewing, was decent enough.
1592493	1599236	It was enough of a cop drama TV show mixed with some of the little themes, like the little...
1601122	1606965	That little thing that you hear in the beginning, a little mandolin or whatever, it's enough of those kind of mixed together, it's the elements.
1607025	1612548	But again, if you're going to go into the game going, I just know nothing is going to compare to Akira Yamaoka.
1612708	1614449	This game is never going to compare to Akira Yamaoka.
1614469	1622053	If you're not willing to take those blinders off and go, okay, it's a new game, let's just deal with what it is, I think you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.
1622533	1624434	So, just kind of want to throw that out there.
1627053	1632216	Nietzsche in our chatroom says, is the original Silent Hill still playable or is it painful to play through?
1632636	1634838	Got a free copy through PlayStation Plus.
1634898	1637099	Yeah, don't forget it is free on PlayStation Plus.
1637139	1638160	I need to grab it myself.
1639200	1641221	That is a direct port of the PlayStation 1 game.
1641281	1643843	So as I understand, everything should be fine.
1644243	1652988	It's not going to be up res or any of that stuff besides the very, very, very basic like texture smoothing and some of the things that the PlayStation 3 will do to PS1 classics.
1653608	1667939	um otherwise you're getting a pretty legitimate experience as long as you're willing to play a game with 1997 graphics then you'll be all right you know just keep that in mind it was the game's getting to be almost 15 years old so all right um
1668419	1669400	That's it with our Gaming Weeks.
1691474	1693735	Facebook.com slash VOG Network.
1694115	1695935	Orange Lounge Radio is also on Google+.
1696075	1696796	Search for us there.
1697176	1698796	VOG's not there yet, but it will be.
1699916	1703337	And I think that's it for all the plugs.
1703518	1705558	Please help spread the word about the new network.
1705598	1706358	We so can't wait.
1706678	1713961	And I again really want to thank the folks at geek-life.com for all the work they did in promoting today's launch.
1714501	1716061	Go visit their website and click on ads.
1717302	1718342	It would go a long way.
1718382	1718822	Thank you much.
1719554	1720335	All right, let's move on.
1720375	1722197	Let's get into some gaming news this week.
1722377	1723057	Loki, start off.
1723338	1734508	So Sony is not one to be outdone by Nintendo in the form of, you know, mascot character battle royale deathmatch or whatever.
1735229	1741335	So now they have the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which is coming to the PlayStation 3 this year.
1741895	1742736	I wish it was coming at the beginning.
1742756	1743357	That would be kind of cool.
1743957	1756125	But, um, it's being developed by Superbot, and it features characters from all sorts of different PlayStation franchises, new and old, including, um, Parappa the Rapper was in there, that was kind of cool.
1756885	1759627	Um, Kratos... He did study Kung Fu!
1760268	1762049	Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.
1762229	1767572	And they actually took that into account, so he does have some Kung Fu moves that he uses, so... Well, he damn well better.
1768093	1773096	Actually, Parappa's lethal move is he gives you the most bitchin' paper cut you've ever had in your life.
1774336	1774937	That's what he does.
1776297	1778598	But of course, Sly Cooper is in there.
1779659	1780439	Fat Princess.
1781480	1784721	And also some other characters they were mentioning.
1786422	1789043	Obviously Cole from Infamous is probably going to be in there.
1789303	1792925	And they're going to have some characters from Resistance and all sorts of different things.
1794446	1796026	And it looks extremely like...
1797307	1800289	I'm trying to think of other big Sony products that they could bring into this game.
1800309	1801250	Oh, Sackboy, obviously.
1802350	1804452	The little cart dudes from Mod Nation Racers.
1804912	1805733	Maybe, I don't know.
1806093	1807534	What about the cast of the tester?
1807634	1809975	Should we call Asuka to see if they did any mocap?
1810135	1811296	Sweet Tooth was going to be in there.
1812757	1825127	One of the things I did like about the game that they kind of showed in the trailers, since this whole thing is kind of like this mashup thing, they have, like, in the background, kind of like two different worlds clashing at the same time.
1825587	1830251	So, like, for example, they all have... It was actually really cool.
1830271	1837697	They had, I think, one of the demons, Hades from God of War, was actually attacking the Patapon.
1838417	1839438	So that was kind of cool.
1839498	1840698	They had that kind of going on there.
1840938	1841699	There was one I saw.
1841759	1849462	It was LittleBigPlanet's world kind of crossed with... What the fuck is their damn... Buzz?
1850342	1851683	The Buzz game?
1851723	1852563	Like the quiz show thing?
1852603	1853264	Oh yeah, Buzz.
1853664	1855244	A little host dude.
1855545	1857345	Yeah, so I'm wondering if he's a character or something.
1857365	1858726	But it was interesting.
1859046	1861287	But the gameplay itself looks exactly like Smash Bros.
1861987	1863148	Exactly like Smash Bros.
1863488	1867670	Have the creators addressed that gigantic pink elephant in the room that...
1868070	1870534	Hey, your game looks really damn familiar.
1870654	1872578	I think I've seen this somewhere before.
1874730	1874930	No.
1877072	1878072	It doesn't seem like they have.
1878112	1881755	I mean, it's going to play a little bit different, but damn, does it look like Smash Brothers.
1881875	1883216	Well, here's the question.
1883436	1886498	I mean, is it okay what they're doing?
1886978	1892522	Because, you know, I kind of go, well, there's several different basketball games that come out.
1892562	1893382	I think it's fine.
1893443	1894964	All these dance games that come out.
1894984	1895864	It's just like fighting games.
1895924	1898586	I mean, all the fighting games are pretty similar.
1898726	1899386	Right, that's true.
1899427	1904270	So there's, I think, enough different with it that it'll be, you know, its own thing.
1905511	1905891	I don't know.
1907312	1911035	Obviously, one of the things people are going to think of is, wow, this really looks like Smash Bros.
1911255	1912276	No, that could be good or bad.
1912376	1912736	I don't know.
1913456	1916359	Did people call out Smash Bros.
1916459	1920101	for having the four-player thing like Power Stone?
1921122	1926466	I mean, even if Power Stone was full layout, and not the semi-2D...
1928227	1944600	Um, Zether in the chatroom says Nintendo should sue, but RawSteelUT in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com follows that up with, well, but hold on, because, you know, um, Smash Brothers wasn't really the first game to do it either, and links to a game called The Outfoxies.
1945615	1951699	Which I don't remember this game at all, but certainly there's probably older games in the past that were similar.
1951839	1955020	I remember playing one on the DS that was very similar.
1955040	1956381	I guess that would be after Smash Bros.
1956421	1956982	in the 64.
1957042	1963565	That was the Top Trumps, or not Top Trumps, it was all the comic characters.
1963625	1966587	Yeah, and Snake from Metal Gear was in it.
1966947	1968508	I played it at a comic convention once.
1969149	1972671	There was a game on the DS that was total just like it, and it existed.
1973391	1975172	No, it was a Shonen Jump game.
1975192	1976333	That's what it was, not Top Trumps.
1976353	1977394	That would have been really boring.
1978174	1979335	Top Trumps is a card game.
1979475	1981417	I understand that, but it was Shonen Jump.
1981957	1983698	It was their game that they had.
1985219	1989783	Bob Coffee in our chatroom says, Smash for N64 came out before Power Stone, if I recall.
1989823	1990323	That is true.
1990523	1991084	That is true.
1991904	1995987	And Power Stone actually was full-on 3D rotational everything.
1996427	1998329	Several folks in our chatroom all jumping in there.
1998369	2000050	Jump All-Stars is the game I'm trying to think of.
2000510	2001771	So, you know, this type of thing.
2001931	2004354	And there was the Ninja Turtles game on GameCube.
2004674	2009278	There's been some other kind of heavily inspired, shall we say, by Smash Bros.
2010379	2020007	I gotta say, as much as I kind of chuckle at this game being heavily inspired, shall we say, by what Nintendo's got going on, I want to play it.
2020648	2021609	It looks pretty cool.
2022329	2026373	I love the fact that it'll be HD and it's gonna get online right.
2029225	2031387	I guess Smash Bros.
2031687	2034169	Melee did as well as it could with the online.
2034789	2038092	I'm thinking this has got to be coming out for the Vita.
2038372	2038832	Oh, yeah.
2039333	2043656	I would think it would be a mistake not to put it out on the Vita, especially it's something...
2044176	2050958	Although, although, maybe the reason it's not coming on the Vita is because they really have issues with doing network play.
2051238	2057919	You know, it's like, well, you can do it via Wi-Fi or you can do this asynchronous multiplayer bullshit.
2057959	2060820	Doesn't Street Fighter X Tekken, isn't that going to be PS3 and Vita?
2060920	2063361	Well, it is going to be, yeah.
2064461	2068442	But, I mean, you know, Capcom's had more experience working on the PlayStation 3.
2069178	2072080	That's why they couldn't add certain features to the Xbox version.
2072640	2075642	ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sky, this is a PS3 game.
2075662	2078404	There's no guarantee that online will be done right.
2078824	2081086	That may be true, but I'm sorry.
2081146	2084528	I give Sony more credit than I give Nintendo when it comes to doing online right.
2084548	2087030	Yeah, I would trust them with online better than Nintendo.
2087050	2088431	Granted, Smash Bros.
2088491	2092834	Melee probably did a hell of a lot better than any other Nintendo game before it as far as online goes.
2093294	2097277	But keep in mind, Nintendo had that whole friend code garbage you had to work with.
2097337	2098898	So that didn't make anything fun.
2099798	2102520	So, all right.
2102901	2106323	So, anyhow, again, if you want to join our chatroom, vognetwork.com.
2106363	2108065	Meanwhile, let's go to some other gaming news.
2108965	2110766	This is a little bit of a surprise.
2112127	2114529	And it's not because it's always about patents.
2114589	2122035	You know, patent – I get the sense that patent laws in this country are going to be headed somewhere different soon, especially you hear –
2122555	2124776	There's just so much in the news about like what, Twitter?
2125256	2125977	Was it Twitter?
2126197	2130558	So one of them acquired all these patents and said that they're only using them defensively.
2130899	2133900	They don't plan to use ever like sue for patent or whatever.
2133920	2139002	And then you have Facebook suing Yahoo and Yahoo suing Facebook and all this stuff over patents.
2139342	2143944	I mean the money that's getting sucked away into all this is just amazing.
2144364	2147726	And here we have another result of the whole patent warfare.
2148306	2168767	The Xbox 360 has been found infringing on four patents that were owned by Motorola According to the website The Verge, the patents that were in question deal with the video codec, the H.264 That is also going on with some other legal proceedings with Microsoft and Motorola right now
2169247	2171628	The other two are about Wi-Fi technology.
2171948	2176751	There's also a fifth patent about communication between the Xbox and its accessories.
2177171	2180493	However, one of the Wi-Fi patents was found not infringed.
2180833	2184234	And one claim regarding one of the video patents was invalid.
2184715	2187476	But some were found to be valid.
2187936	2193379	So Microsoft is seeking to force Motorola to license its standard patents forever.
2193779	2196781	under more fair and reasonable terms.
2197121	2201763	But this original ruling by the judge is a bit of a blow on Microsoft's effort.
2202124	2206186	However, as most things in the legal system, appeal, appeal, appeal.
2206226	2208267	And the appeal step is a panel of six judges.
2208287	2213310	I want to say that they're also suing... I want to say that they're suing Apple, too.
2213610	2217512	It was some other big company that Motorola was going after.
2218352	2219253	I think it was Apple.
2220720	2223381	When Zether and our... Didn't Motorola used to make Apple's processors?
2224641	2227182	All the tech companies have helped each other and then stabbed each other in the back.
2227742	2228382	It's crazy.
2228482	2230162	Zether and her term says patent trolling.
2230843	2236804	Usually I reserve the term patent troll for a company that exists to do nothing but this.
2238624	2241765	But you're talking Motorola and Microsoft.
2241945	2243346	They're both really big companies.
2243406	2244686	Motorola makes lots of phones.
2245006	2246886	I don't know if I'd call them a patent troll.
2247267	2248687	This is just patent warfare.
2249207	2250408	This is Apple, by the way.
2267523	2269323	They've tried to become a bit of a portal.
2269623	2273984	They have their Yahoo Mail, but they haven't really been able to break through.
2274324	2276425	Google kind of stomped on them and so forth.
2276485	2277945	I still use Yahoo here and there.
2277985	2281806	They're a good portal, but they're struggling, and they've had to lay a lot of people off.
2282446	2283566	So what did Yahoo do?
2283646	2295428	They sued Facebook over 10 patents that Yahoo had, and a lot of it tied into, I think, the My Yahoo that they tried to develop that has a lot of aggregate feed type stuff that Facebook also does, to kind of put it in a nutshell.
2296509	2297850	So what did Facebook do in return?
2298231	2300313	Sued Yahoo right back over other patents.
2300753	2302655	That's just patent warfare.
2302775	2306599	I don't want to say it's patent trolling, but it's clear that Yahoo's struggling.
2306999	2312164	And this is something that they're doing to try and kind of get themselves back up a little bit.
2312425	2313826	Or maybe just try to stay relevant.
2314767	2315528	In a way, maybe.
2315948	2319110	Well, I found the other one, and actually it is Apple.
2321011	2326635	It's for a patent for noise elimination and other interference during voice and data transmission.
2328896	2332398	Now, does this mean the Xbox 360 is going to suddenly stop being sold?
2332798	2333859	I kind of doubt that.
2334259	2336400	It's gone a little far at this point.
2336741	2339622	But could Microsoft end up having to pay huge amounts of money to Motorola?
2340003	2343885	Could they have to agree to some pretty hefty terms for the technology?
2344305	2345406	Yeah, it's possible.
2345746	2348989	Could they perhaps not put Rumble in their next console?
2349009	2351150	Because it's not really that important anyways.
2351170	2353052	It has nothing to do with the fact that they infringed on patents.
2353072	2353872	Oh, remember all that?
2353892	2355393	Yeah, that's a great comparison.
2355453	2356014	Remember that?
2356074	2358476	That's why you didn't have Rumble in the original PlayStation 3.
2358516	2360777	No, it wasn't because they were infringing on patents.
2360838	2363640	It's because it wasn't important until they decided to put it in there.
2363660	2365001	Oh, sure, sure, whatever.
2365121	2365321	Not bad.
2365441	2365882	Exactly.
2365922	2369207	Not the fact that they got sued over the PlayStation 2 controllers.
2369247	2371430	No, it wasn't important right then.
2372171	2373433	It became important later.
2373673	2375696	Six Axis was the future of gaming.
2375736	2377820	What was the last game that used Six Axis?
2379818	2381620	Six Axis was a pain in the ass.
2382200	2385603	I know the last thing that I played that included it was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2386664	2387184	I think that was it.
2387204	2388546	That game's a few years old.
2388706	2392849	I think there's still some games that use it, but man, it's not something that they're like, hey.
2392929	2395732	Little Big Planet is one of the last ones I can think of that uses it.
2396632	2399834	Um, yeah, Six Axes.
2400714	2402135	You can use that as a steering wheel, right?
2403916	2405356	Yeah, it works great, too.
2405756	2406457	Awesome.
2406697	2408217	That's why I still have a NegCon.
2408318	2409978	I will say, actually, I thought of it.
2410719	2412840	There is a Six Axes game that was pretty bitchin'.
2413220	2413520	Flower.
2415669	2419050	That's like the only six axis game I can sit here and say I truly enjoyed it.
2419270	2421951	I can use it to slightly adjust the camera in Journey.
2424572	2426233	Moving on with more news.
2427593	2430134	How about something that doesn't have to do with a really crappy controller?
2431114	2431615	How about it?
2431875	2432835	How about some Call of Duty?
2435014	2435574	How about it?
2435655	2436355	Bang, bang, bang.
2436735	2441359	Well, the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 has been leaked.
2441759	2444161	Which I don't know if it was on purpose or not.
2444601	2448484	I love when they say leaked, but you don't really know.
2449145	2449425	Anyway.
2450666	2456210	So there was an image of the PS3 and Xbox 360 pre-order cards for Target.
2456991	2459032	And it was posted by IGN earlier.
2459493	2461354	This says it's going to be on November 13th.
2463619	2466221	So, we have a shake of the head.
2466962	2467282	Loki?
2467322	2468003	I think they're guessing.
2468724	2469544	Nothing's been announced.
2469985	2474949	They're seriously guessing because I don't even think the game's going to be called Black Ops 2, to be honest.
2475430	2480094	Because they've registered trademarks for Eclipse, Call of Duty Eclipse.
2480594	2489242	And they're guessing because already in blogs, like Kotaku and some other places, they've speculated that it's going to be on the 13th because there happens to be a full...
2489762	2496924	Lunar Eclipse, or Solar Eclipse actually on that date, which also happens to fall on a Tuesday during November.
2497024	2501986	There's a fucking election, presidential election happening the same day as the Halo release date.
2502166	2502926	To continue.
2502946	2504167	Solar Eclipses don't matter.
2504707	2510268	There was indication first of a Black Ops sequel with an Amazon France listing that got pulled.
2511389	2514710	But there's supposed to be actual news coming out on this on May 1st.
2515629	2534443	And the other reason I call bullshit on this too is because Call of Duty, they're using the Roman numerals for Black Ops 2 when it's most likely they normally just use actual numbers for their titles.
2534563	2536044	I just don't think it's going to be Black Ops.
2536104	2537646	I think that they're just guessing.
2537766	2541408	And what's it really going to hurt if they have some sort of...
2543830	2547434	Pre-order card or whatever to get people excited about a new Call of Duty game.
2547975	2549256	So what if it ends up being something else?
2549276	2550517	They'll just have to reprint cards.
2550978	2553880	But we're going to find out soon enough.
2554101	2557344	If they've got a card dated with it though.
2557544	2561268	If you think about the cost of printing and on a national scale...
2562529	2564791	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2565331	2572917	Are you saying that Target would just put a release date in their system and then put these fake things on the shelves to entice people to pre-order?
2573238	2576380	I've never heard of that done before in the gaming retail industry.
2576480	2581384	And it's not like that big major changes have not been wrong, you know, in printed marketing material.
2581404	2583186	Like, for example... It doesn't really matter.
2583586	2584327	According to Best Buy...
2584927	2585987	You know, shit.
2586348	2587968	Diablo 3 should have been out months ago.
2587988	2592430	Wait a minute, that was one Best Buy in like Wisconsin or something.
2592510	2597292	In the whole thing, it doesn't really matter because they're making an announcement on it in three days.
2598032	2599713	So, again, does it matter?
2600293	2600473	No.
2601214	2602274	But it's all about firsties.
2602334	2606676	It's all about who did it first, who called it first, and because that's why we have the whole patent wars.
2606776	2609097	And that's a whole big pile of who gives a shit.
2610690	2624200	That's so that all these websites can go exclusive exclusive release date exclusive pictures of the exclusive exclusiving exclusive that we have You know what an actual exclusive is?
2624860	2628163	Is if the company went to hey hey IGN
2628743	2632644	We want you to have the date officially from us.
2633144	2634225	That's an exclusive.
2634665	2638186	Getting it off of a card from a target.
2638346	2643047	You mean like certain radio entrepreneurs may have gone to a geeky website to give them the exclusive on what was happening?
2643067	2643567	Exactly.
2643827	2648749	When they come to you and say, we want you to do it first because you've been good to us.
2649409	2677226	but if I use the word exclusive as much as exclusively possible in my article then I'll get more hits and I'll get to go to E3 because that's what this industry's turned into exclusive Jamie shut her mouth for the first time here on Orange Lounge Radio that's a Rob Roberts exclusive actions speak louder than words and none of you can see this action and I'm getting the finger
2677631	2679432	I mean, yeah, it's a good guess.
2679532	2682833	I mean, obviously they're not going to launch the same day as Halo.
2683594	2691377	And it's typically the second Tuesday of November that they normally launch Call of Duty.
2691417	2694418	So, I mean, it's a good guess.
2695278	2696639	And they could be right.
2696699	2697879	I was not purring.
2698660	2702822	I mean, it's only like one in four shot of being correct.
2702842	2702962	Yeah.
2703002	2703122	Yeah.
2705876	2708658	We're actually one and two because it's going to be in the beginning of the month.
2708718	2714562	They might have to recall all those cards or in the great retail big box way, get a big black marker.
2716243	2717004	Get the new guy.
2717244	2719226	Hey, new guy, take this giant stack of 500 cards.
2719246	2724970	You're going to take this Sharpie and everywhere you see a 13, you're going to write a 20.
2727171	2728172	You think you can do that?
2728672	2729613	When do I get my break?
2729813	2730934	That's not how it works.
2732659	2734160	They'd have to pay that guy more.
2735061	2740404	To be honest, for the time that it would take him to do all that, then it would just be to print up 50,000 new cards.
2741545	2743486	Can I go on a tangent?
2743906	2745187	I want a VOG tangent.
2745487	2747008	No, we don't do tangents on this show.
2747048	2748569	I want our first VOG tangent.
2748890	2750351	We already had one of those, Rob.
2750551	2751651	It was Okra.
2752252	2754754	I went grocery shopping with Alan yesterday.
2754774	2755894	We went to the grocery store.
2756535	2757515	I know, right?
2757916	2758436	I know, right?
2758936	2760157	So we went to the grocery store.
2760177	2761078	Exclusive Rob went shopping.
2764979	2768100	And we bought probably like, I don't know, $120 worth of groceries.
2768280	2768740	Exclusive!
2769280	2771641	Thanks to couponing, I got it down to $115.
2772901	2774462	But anyway... How very Dutch of you.
2774522	2777503	The point is... Well, it is in my heritage.
2777883	2779843	But anyway, we get the cart.
2779883	2783404	You know how you take the cart up to the little thing and you put everything up on the conveyor belt, right?
2784044	2785225	One of the employees...
2785945	2786866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2804722	2808203	But it does kind of make me go, gosh, I feel really fucking lazy.
2808283	2812805	And I'm like, is everybody else in the grocery store just watching this poor grocery clerk do this for me?
2812845	2817827	And if I was in a wheelchair or had a cast on or something, I could understand why they do that.
2817887	2821288	But Alan and I are both perfectly healthy individuals.
2821768	2822728	Exclusive.
2822748	2823609	Rob and Alan are healthy.
2825776	2826657	And yet she was doing it.
2826717	2831220	So I was like, well, thank you for loading the groceries on the conveyor belt.
2831921	2833262	So whatever do we owe this?
2833362	2834483	I don't usually see this.
2834543	2838426	And she said, well, we're really overstaffed right now.
2838466	2840928	We have a lot of new people that just started today.
2841008	2842309	So we have so many people.
2842389	2844291	She's like, I was just here.
2844351	2845352	I needed something to do.
2846373	2849755	And she's like, I spent all morning in the produce department just arranging things.
2850416	2851337	And I'm thinking to myself...
2853138	2860239	and I'm thinking to myself apples and bananas as much as I appreciate that she has a job she has good employment so that
2861756	2862517	Offer his union.
2862577	2863717	See if she wants to go home.
2864158	2864738	She's union.
2865899	2866739	Is that a union thing?
2867520	2869781	I didn't even think of that, but you're probably right.
2870022	2877246	Keep in mind, I worked for a grocery store for all of three freaking days, and I quit after the old man tried to be a bitch to me, and I told him he couldn't buy his beer.
2877266	2879468	I haven't said that story on the air, have I?
2880449	2891456	But I know that you got guaranteed a certain number of hours, and you got guaranteed this, and if you were scheduled to work, you had to work, and this crap.
2892817	2895778	AcidicVampire in chat says, that's like someone pumping your gas.
2896839	2897179	Oregon.
2897519	2899440	It did feel very Jersey or Oregon.
2899480	2900001	Take your pick.
2900561	2910566	Now, I have to tell you one thing, and this just goes from my childhood and visiting my granny in Dothan, Alabama, that we would go to the Piggly Wiggly.
2911827	2912128	I know.
2912448	2913969	Best name for a grocery store ever.
2915071	2916853	I'm going to go get pork at the Piggly Wiggly.
2917934	2930487	And they had these type of conveyor belts that the back end of your buggy would unlatch and it would push right up to the belt and then the cashier would unload for you.
2930587	2931949	Oh yeah, they used to have those here too.
2932569	2935930	There were those kind of tall, flat, flatter type of buggies.
2936090	2939552	Some of the old Raleys here still had that where you just push, you don't even have a conveyor belt.
2939572	2944634	You push the cart right up to the counter and then they open the front of it and just pull everything off of it and go over the standard.
2944654	2945834	Which I think is great.
2945934	2946514	Yeah, I do too.
2946955	2952897	I mean, but now it's, you know, I also hate self-service.
2953658	2961126	and then, well, yeah, I was going to say, Ross DLUT in our VOG chat room says, here in Florida, we got Winn-Dixie's with the self-checkout counters.
2961166	2968634	Yeah, we have that too, but when you're buying like $120 worth of groceries, I don't want to use the self, because those things are a pain in the ass.
2968954	2971256	Old school Winn-Dixies, by the way, had the old style thing, too.
2971296	2984506	The self-checkouts are great for when you need just a pint of ice cream and Doritos, but when you're buying legit groceries for the week with produce and everything, you don't... No, I would not use the self-checkout.
2984546	2985327	It would take forever.
2985747	2986688	I have an expert do it.
2988149	2988449	Anyhow.
2990602	2992464	Everyone's talking about what their grocery stores are.
2992504	2992765	I know.
2993846	2996388	This is the most the chat room's talked about all night.
2996408	2998350	Perhaps we should become a grocery store podcast.
2998951	3003436	Nietzsche in our chat says, Here in Kansas, your groceries are always bagged and sometimes carried to your vehicle.
3003516	3004357	No questions asked.
3004457	3004997	Rayleigh's here.
3005518	3005918	Does that.
3005958	3008020	Well, they always ask, but I'm always like, no, no, no.
3008080	3009522	But the thing is, they're required to do it.
3009542	3010183	It's part of their job.
3010383	3010583	Really?
3010723	3011103	Yeah, it is.
3011503	3012584	So Dan and I have them do it.
3012964	3015685	Again, if I'm buying ice cream and Doritos, I don't want to help out.
3015705	3017666	Well, if you're buying two things, that's one thing.
3017706	3024089	But if you're getting all your groceries for the week or for the month or whatever, then it's kind of nice.
3024469	3025289	It's part of their job.
3025369	3027971	It's what they're supposed to do.
3028351	3032753	Honestly, we asked one of them flat out, do you really mind doing this?
3033553	3034714	I like getting out and getting some air.
3035234	3037355	Hey, I want all those grapes individually bagged.
3039645	3042447	I need you to go through this bag of M&M's and pick out the green ones.
3042947	3047931	Now DJ Morpheus in chat is saying that's the Rob Roberts diet ice cream and Doritos.
3047991	3049072	I think that's your family crest.
3049972	3064282	It's a big bag of Doritos with big pulps of ice cream coming out of the top of it and like Hello Kitty over the bag of Doritos and the word penis or something.
3064383	3064803	I don't know.
3067338	3074442	Well, so in great internet fashion, we have apparently dropped this for the podcast listeners.
3074742	3076323	We're trying to reconnect to the feed right now.
3076643	3078685	I hope this isn't a repeat of what happened last week.
3078725	3079905	That would be most unfortunate.
3080526	3081806	I don't think Comcast is anything.
3081866	3083928	It is trying to reconnect right now, and there it is.
3083968	3084968	It reconnected, apparently.
3086129	3088930	Just watch the bandwidth, guys, if you have anything else going on.
3089231	3090131	I just have to get that out there.
3090171	3090711	I'm not doing shit.
3090731	3093193	I know, but these things happen, so...
3094031	3095332	Yeah, I agree with GameGuru.
3095372	3097293	VOG is so popular, everyone is crashing it.
3097313	3098154	We'll just go with that.
3098574	3099615	You guys are just crashing it.
3099635	3100835	Grocery Lounge Radio.
3101075	3101736	All right, anyhow.
3102056	3103377	Yeah, you are the general manager.
3103577	3105078	All right, can we move on with more news?
3105758	3107339	I don't know how I got on that tangent.
3107660	3109061	I don't even know what that had to do with anything.
3109121	3113003	Oh, because you were talking about the guy with the pen who would get paid too much to do that.
3113063	3116505	And I'm like, they pay people to do crazy stuff, like the chick who put my stuff on the conveyor belt.
3118747	3119547	Blink, blink.
3119927	3121088	I like Mass Effect.
3121328	3122069	It's a good game.
3123711	3128158	I have to do a trolling dedicated to Dark Tetsuya, if I may.
3130462	3131404	Listen, Ranma.
3133453	3135075	I do not torrent porn.
3135375	3136176	Or torrent anything.
3136216	3138498	Torrenting is so goddamn slow.
3138958	3140780	Why would I torrent anything when there's Usenet?
3140800	3142061	I'm gonna torrent that breadstick.
3142221	3142982	Go right ahead.
3143622	3144683	You're gonna torrent me half of it.
3145063	3147806	And I don't torrent hentai or porn.
3148126	3148987	At least not here.
3149027	3149728	I mean, shit.
3149808	3151609	This connection's too damn slow for that.
3152550	3155913	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about Woodstock.
3156554	3157434	No, I'm not talking about the...
3158735	3161957	The Gathering of Musicians and Sweaty People.
3162357	3168441	I'm talking about Microsoft's brand new music service for the Xbox 360.
3169861	3170502	Whoopty shit.
3171802	3174064	I guess because Zoom maybe is not taking off too well.
3175244	3177165	DarkSakura, Loki,
3199597	3202718	But it's going to be similar to Spotify.
3202738	3208199	And they're going to have some sort of Facebook integration as well where you can share your playlists and that kind of stuff.
3208640	3210100	And you can buy bottled water for $7.
3210320	3210820	What?
3213121	3214181	So it's a Starbucks?
3214541	3216502	There's a Woodstock 94 joke in there.
3216582	3217362	Come on, people.
3218943	3219403	Oh, Rob.
3238337	3254655	and you know how much all of the people at the original Woodstock got paid like oodles and oodles and oodles to freaking be there and they like underestimated the number of people that would come and there was no toiletries and people died and babies were born but the Woodstock I was thinking of was a cute little yellow bird that hangs out with Snoopy
3258277	3261179	I just... Cool, they're going to have a music service.
3261279	3264061	I hope it's free because otherwise I'm not going to be interested in it.
3264241	3266142	Let's talk about this other half of it then.
3267643	3274208	Why is Microsoft relaunching this again when they've really tried that Zoom thing and it just didn't work?
3274388	3278091	Because now they're trying to be the entertainment hub.
3278131	3283374	They want the Xbox 360 or even whatever the next console is to be this entertainment hub.
3283754	3286776	They're trying to get away from just being a games console.
3286797	3287177	They want...
3287697	3289538	It's a kind of replace like your set-top box.
3289578	3294579	You put it in, you know, your living room with your TV and you're watching movies on there.
3294599	3295819	You're playing games on there.
3295859	3297720	You're having parties in front of it with Kinect.
3297780	3299940	You're, you know, listening to music.
3300301	3303061	They want it to be integrated with your life, basically.
3303782	3305422	And that's what they're trying to do with this.
3305462	3306342	They're adding music to it.
3306522	3308163	I agree with Infanel in the chat room.
3308203	3309643	Wainstock was much safer.
3310243	3310623	That's true.
3310663	3313544	If they called this Wainstock, I would... Are you kidding?
3313584	3314324	And give my right arm...
3316845	3317125	Yes.
3318106	3319106	No, right eye, that was it.
3320927	3321267	All right.
3322888	3326889	Let's move on with some more news, and this one has to do with Skyrim.
3327189	3330891	Hey, and it has nothing to do with arrows and body parts, I swear.
3331271	3336073	This has to do with a Skyrim expansion pack, maybe, question mark.
3336453	3341495	Apparently, in the latest Skyrim patch, there are several references to what's called Snow Elves.
3341955	3345617	including a Snow Elf Prince who has some dialogue.
3346237	3351459	There's also files talking about crossbows, a whole folder called DLC01.
3351799	3353280	Hmm, what could that be about?
3353700	3357422	So apparently this is information about the first DLC pack for Skyrim.
3357822	3362224	We don't know a whole lot else about it, although there's certainly that part of me that says, I'm gonna buy it.
3362604	3366306	Well, that and, gee, this took a little while for this to come out.
3366326	3367907	You too can take an axe to the elbow.
3368127	3370828	Good things come to those who wait, usually.
3371949	3388606	I have more faith in Bethesda and DLC versus any other company on the face of the earth just because it seems like their content is very thoroughly rich and full of actual new things and not stuff that was on the disc.
3390322	3390662	DarkSakura
3420652	3447904	how about some Vita crap because it is actually kind of performing like crap in Europe anyway the Vita is being outsold by both the Wii and the PSP in Europe they're basically saying that and this is actually a quote from Iwata of Nintendo saying that based on sales information by market research companies in each European country
3448944	3464532	Um, basically, uh, the, uh, PS3 is the top, with the 3DS and Xbox 360 in second, the Wii in fourth, PSP in fifth, the Vita in sixth, and the DS, um, I guess right after that?
3465973	3472496	So yeah, um, the Vita's basically selling 25,000 units a week, um, and there's still 70,000 PS3s being sold weekly.
3474465	3476066	Well, that's some good news for Sony.
3476086	3477708	At least the PS3's on top over there.
3477808	3479829	But, Loki, any idea what this looks like in America?
3480010	3480650	Is this the same?
3481111	3482692	Are Sony having the same issue here?
3482892	3485634	I'm surprised that anyone's still selling a ton of PSPs.
3485955	3492000	I know we don't sell any PSPs, and by we, I mean my customers, because no one's asking for them.
3492600	3494222	Hell, there's nothing coming out for the PSP.
3494442	3497344	I mean, the last thing was MLB 12, or MLB, yeah, MLB The Show 12.
3497384	3498425	Wait, no, MLB 2K12.
3502268	3507911	And then there's a few Atlus RPGs, but that's all that really is coming.
3508311	3515354	According to Iwata right now in the US, actually no, this isn't just according to him, but there is a listing on here.
3515974	3524618	At the top of it is Xbox 360, then PS3, then the 3DS, and the Vita right behind the 3DS and 4th, then we have Wii, DS, and PSP.
3526280	3528162	Why is Iwata talking about the Vita?
3528222	3529683	Oh, I see.
3529723	3532446	Because he's trying to say the 3DS is so much better, blah, blah, blah.
3532646	3535709	He's saying that right now the 3DS is dominating in Japan.
3535729	3537971	Well, it's been out for a year.
3538111	3538971	I mean, come on.
3539032	3540713	I mean, why are we even comparing these two systems?
3540733	3544657	You're talking about a system that launched two months ago versus a system that's been out for a year.
3544757	3549281	Well, and the Vita is kind of in that point where the 3DS was at this point after its launch.
3549321	3552323	We're like, hooray, we had the launch with all the big launch games.
3552424	3552944	Now we're in a low.
3553144	3563050	Yeah, it's like, listen Iwata, you better fucking keep that good karma coming because if you start talking, you know, crap about this, you've got a system launching pretty soon and it could tank pretty easy.
3563250	3573596	Well, really he's just been, you know, just speaking, more not, instead of, you know, pooping on everybody else, he's just more been speaking about, oh, the 3DS is doing very well.
3574357	3576618	We're very confident in how the market's going.
3576738	3577719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3595891	3618884	and you know the Vita does had a more robust launch lineup but it is still there's nothing to really get I mean Mortal Kombat whether you know it is what it is it's been out already it is a port of a game that's already been out for a year I would think come the holidays E3 this year we're gonna hear more about what the holidays have in store for the Vita and that's some things are really gonna pick up for them again to be fair that's one more Mortal Kombat game than the 3ds has
3621508	3621788	True.
3622109	3623770	No one's porting shit to the 3DS.
3623790	3632278	True, unless you want to say, well, you can play DS games on the 3DS, and I think there was, I think Deadly Alliance or one of them got a port to the DS.
3632558	3634160	Probably wasn't very good, but it's there.
3634756	3637257	I mean, there's a Street Fighter 4 game.
3638838	3639178	I don't know.
3639558	3643419	It's just, yeah, I don't really think it's fair to compare them yet.
3643620	3647261	It's still, you know, compare their one-year numbers, okay?
3647361	3652623	Compare the numbers of the 3DS versus the numbers of the Vita in a year and see where they're at.
3652663	3654164	I'm not surprised that they're behind the 3DS.
3654184	3657565	A lot more people are picking up 3DSs because I think they're cheaper now.
3657845	3663610	ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Avita price drop will be announced to E3 if Sony is smart.
3663910	3664170	Agree?
3665772	3666312	They could.
3666612	3671877	I know that the 3DS isn't dropping in price anytime soon, so I mean, they could.
3672057	3675300	It would be smart, but I hope I get some free games with it.
3675820	3701288	I don't think a price drop will come but I think they'll sweeten the pot of the existing pack what I mean by that is larger memory card and probably more like throw-ins like comes with an eight gig memory card that already has little big planet vita oh what oops that's another big game that's coming out at some point right now that got pushed back right it's not coming out they haven't announced today all right then fucking mod nation racers vita I don't just
3701388	3704070	I don't want the Vita to fail, but I feel like it's going to happen.
3725276	3726057	It's too early.
3726157	3730280	Yeah, it's too... Again, you gotta go back to where the 3DS was at this point.
3730300	3739287	Everybody said, 3DS gonna fail, 3DS gonna fail, and then bam, price drop, bam, Mario, bam, you know, it's just, everything just hit it once, and the system really recovered.
3740468	3745652	You know, and the PlayStation 3 early on was hideous.
3746693	3748935	Too damn expensive and nothing on it.
3749335	3751417	You know, but PlayStation's really come around.
3751477	3754460	So, you know, I think it's too early to bury the Vita
3755757	3759981	is the Vita flying off shells in the must-have technology that Sony wanted it to be?
3760401	3764464	All right, maybe not, but that doesn't mean it's a dead and dying system.
3764665	3765866	They tried, I think.
3765926	3770390	I mean, they had a better launch than the 3DS had, that's for sure.
3771110	3772832	And they have a lot more games coming out.
3772992	3775454	And even the 3DS, I mean, there's games coming out, but...
3776954	3786299	I would think that the hardcore gamer using the 3DS, I think there's only a handful of games really coming out before the end of this year that they might be interested in.
3786819	3793222	Whereas I think there's going to be a lot more of that for the... I'm sorry, the 3DS has a handful of games.
3793522	3797004	The Vita, I think they've got quite a bit of potential games coming out for it.
3797044	3805307	I mean, hell, there's some big first-party games still on their way in the next couple months, and Call of Duty's going to help.
3805768	3808029	I mean, fuck, a portable Call of Duty game?
3809269	3818994	Not necessarily the PSP ones, because they're kind of... But one on the Vita that's... If you've got Black Ops 2 or whatever they're going to call it on the Vita, that could be pretty big.
3819014	3819894	Yeah.
3820194	3823898	Slidekick in our chatroom says, Girl, PS3 is still hideous, Rob.
3824078	3824619	I disagree.
3824839	3825920	I really disagree.
3826982	3835210	LittleBigPlanet, there is nothing like it on Nintendo, there's nothing like it on Microsoft, and it is an incredible video game.
3835551	3837593	And it's Sony's franchise.
3837633	3841077	That's just the one that comes up to the mind as most important for me.
3841938	3864817	I still say Sony despite all our jokes earlier about 6-axis I think now Sony has the better controller I prefer to play games with the Sony controller than I do the 360 Sony does have the free online for whatever it's worth you know I don't mean to sound like a fanboy there's reasons why I like 360 as well but you know I don't think it's all doom and gloom with the PlayStation 3 I think I think consumers have a real choice to make
3865578	3867840	and when somebody asks me, Rob, what should I get?
3867860	3870581	A PlayStation 3 or a Xbox 360?
3871522	3873283	I have to go back to the golden rule of gaming.
3873383	3875404	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3875424	3875925	What do you want to play?
3875945	3878066	Do you want to play Halo or do you want to play LittleBigPlanet?
3878426	3881888	Do you want to play Fable or do you want to play God of War?
3882889	3884610	It's really about those issues.
3886280	3889823	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some release dates.
3889843	3894026	We're going to travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon in a store near you.
3894427	3895427	There's not a lot this week.
3895527	3896128	It's pretty dead.
3897189	3904054	So, starting things off, we've got Sniper Elite V2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3904675	3907617	Terra Online and the Collector's Edition as well.
3907917	3911020	That's coming out on PC, which will be pretty awesome.
3911340	3914182	Speaking of Mortal Kombat for the Vita, that is coming out this week.
3914863	3914943	Um...
3917706	3923591	and... and I honestly think that's probably it because it's pretty dead.
3923611	3926995	I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
3928036	3928516	Yep, that's it.
3929297	3932340	Alright, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases over there in Japan.
3932420	3935823	Nothing on the 3DS this week which strikes me as kind of odd but yeah, no, nothing.
3936144	3937585	Oh my god, the system's dying!
3940734	3941654	Well, how about the Vita?
3941674	3942635	What's the Vita got this week?
3942755	3943475	Also nothing.
3944635	3945556	That is also dying.
3945996	3946796	They're all dying.
3947196	3952318	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Starhawk on May 10th, although I think that's really next week, actually.
3952338	3954399	That's the week after, yeah.
3954439	3955999	Is there a holiday in Japan this week or something?
3956019	3957080	Because nothing on the PlayStation 3?
3957840	3959100	And on the Xbox 360?
3959721	3960021	Nothing.
3960781	3961401	Oh my god.
3962121	3964422	All game systems are gonna die.
3964922	3965883	They're all dying.
3966243	3966643	All of them.
3968678	3970759	I don't know what's going on.
3970799	3971460	There must be something.
3972821	3974542	Not a lot of releases until May 17th.
3974943	3976103	Things are kind of slowing down over there.
3976924	3979286	So I have nothing to report for Japanese releases.
3979946	3984570	Hey, the good news is, for those of you who like to import games, your wallet is spared this month.
3985586	3987048	There's a few in Europe.
3988069	3989030	We have... Thank you.
3989110	3990331	Golden Week is this week.
3990511	3990952	That's right.
3990992	3992173	The chatter's all just chimed in.
3992213	3992913	It's Golden Week.
3992934	3994795	That's when everyone goes back to their hometown.
3995076	3995276	Yep.
3995836	3995997	Yep.
3997058	3999180	What, no handheld games for the train ride there?
4000552	4026103	No Animal Crossing Places are closed all week See, I knew the chatters would know something cultural that I was missing So yeah, Golden Week is the reason Us ignit gamers I know, stupid Americans, sorry In Europe, on May 2nd we have Velocity for the PSP On May 3rd we have Terra for PC And on the 4th we have MUDFIM, Motocross World Championship And that is it
4028439	4028799	Next!
4028959	4031060	It must be Golden Week in the UK as well, huh?
4031961	4033441	I want a Golden Week.
4033461	4034962	Why don't we have a Golden Week in the US?
4035242	4036163	Because we have Spring Break.
4038184	4039504	I wish we had Golden Week too.
4039524	4041605	Shit doesn't close on Spring Break.
4043326	4046088	People here have no respect for their hometown.
4046148	4046648	End of story.
4046928	4050850	You're comparing Golden Week to Spring Break.
4050930	4052191	Let's examine the two.
4052651	4053371	Golden Week.
4053811	4056833	A great chance for me to go visit my family and really...
4057453	4060235	Spring Break Bitches be getting drunk and topless and horny
4072620	4074822	I'm gonna get laid on spring break.
4074882	4077404	It's golden week in Mexico.
4080066	4081728	It's golden week in Cancun.
4081748	4083729	Yeah, I mean, because they're like cha-ching.
4084730	4087172	Here's our yearly revenue in one week.
4088413	4091756	It's golden peso week.
4091836	4092216	I don't know.
4093177	4093777	Exactly.
4094638	4098862	Slidekick in our chatroom says spring break is better because it has wet t-shirt contests.
4098902	4100203	I didn't see that in golden week.
4102028	4102869	Can we move on, please?
4103810	4105231	Yes, we can move on.
4107112	4107553	Loki.
4108514	4113017	Golden week all throughout the year if there's wet t-shirt contests involved.
4113978	4115159	And drunk sluts.
4116921	4118942	Well, for some people, that may be their hometown.
4118962	4120183	That's just Friday.
4120704	4121785	That's just Friday.
4123466	4124907	In here, it's always Friday.
4127693	4131877	Yes, Nintendo has some losses to report.
4133358	4138643	Yeah, they may have lost a little bit of money with 3DS.
4138983	4140985	$461.2 million in losses to be exact.
4141765	4146890	And of course, they've kind of rebounded a little bit, but the initial hit from the new...
4148350	4158554	3DS launch and the Redux selling also dropping the price of the Wii and they're saying the Strong N and other things factored into it.
4158994	4159874	Not a big surprise.
4160074	4174499	Of course, their brand new fiscal year started April 1st and they're aiming to not sell the 3DS under cost because right now they're actually losing money on each system that's being put out and
4176340	4177101	But not much.
4177341	4183326	I mean, they're... I believe it's... Actually, no, it doesn't say how much they're losing there.
4183346	4184507	I thought it was only like a few bucks.
4185067	4187329	But, you know, they're taking losses on each system.
4187429	4195836	And, of course, Nintendo, unlike the other companies out there, actually like making profits on each piece of hardware that goes out, which they were doing, obviously, when it was $250, but not necessarily now.
4199198	4219434	Um, and then of course, uh, they're saying that with the Wii U launch and the Wii console, um, by the end of next fiscal year, uh, which would be March 31st, 2013, they're gonna have, uh, combined sales of 10.5 million units, um, during that whole year.
4219894	4221896	Um, mm.
4222920	4223320	Eh, maybe.
4223940	4232982	I guess, well, fiscal 2012, they sold 9.84 million Wii units, so they're planning on growing that a bit more.
4233182	4238923	Honestly, I don't see the Wii selling as fast as, you know, it was before.
4239363	4242524	Although, if they announce another price drop, because there's a new console coming out.
4242544	4245865	I was going to say, a price drop, that has to factor into this somehow.
4245885	4248105	If they drop the price again, that could be interesting.
4249878	4250438	Is that Wii?
4250699	4252540	Isn't the Wii already like 99 bucks?
4253081	4253901	No, it's still like 149.
4254182	4257824	Okay, so let's say they're going to come out and the Wii is 99 bucks.
4257945	4263429	That's going to be hard to ignore, especially for the... You know what the big audience is for that?
4263469	4267612	It's nobody that listens to this show unless you have a 5 to 12-year-old.
4267773	4268393	But here's my problem.
4268413	4270315	I think it's a huge sweet spot for the Wii.
4270615	4274798	That is a huge sweet spot for the Wii, and it will cannibalize the Wii U sales.
4276440	4290418	I can buy this brand new console, it's basically a Wii but it has better graphics for $2.99 or I can pay $99 and get a Wii and play all these Mario games that I really want to play and that's it.
4290785	4293407	and later on I'll upgrade to the new Wii.
4293687	4306938	If there was a new Xbox or Playstation this year I might agree with you but I actually think core gamer interest may be a little higher especially if Nintendo does it right and throws out a new Zelda game with this although I'm not expecting it.
4307158	4312623	Or a Metroid or something you know that the core gamers are going to jizz over.
4313003	4318707	Just like seeing the lineup just like kind of the whispers and stuff of their lineup a lot of it is like
4319748	4346566	Batman Arkham City great I get to play that on the Wii U but it's been out for a fucking year Darksiders 2 okay well that might be delayed by the time we get there to the launch of the Wii but it'll be out Ninja Gaiden 3 a game that sucked on the Xbox 360 and PS3 I think we really don't know though because what Nintendo was trying to do with that was say hey we can compete with everybody else now we're gonna have all the games that the other systems have so leave us alone
4346986	4349627	We don't really know what's coming until this evening.
4349647	4351068	I really do know what's coming.
4351248	4358012	Batman Arkham City is coming for the Wii U. I mean... What if, heaven forbid, Loki, what if they're actually keeping some secrets?
4359272	4360273	They may have some first party stuff.
4360293	4362314	Animal Crossing Wii U. Oh, God.
4363194	4364955	I'm not buying it for... I'm sorry.
4365095	4366956	I will not buy a system for Animal Crossing.
4367036	4368677	Now your little Wii pad is a strip mall.
4368797	4370518	I did that for GameCube, okay?
4370818	4373980	But I will not do that for... No.
4374900	4375340	Seriously.
4375460	4375881	It's just...
4377607	4380410	They will probably have a Zelda game or something like that.
4380450	4381571	That would be pretty smart.
4382151	4384613	I don't think a Pikmin game is going to launch that goddamn system.
4384953	4392179	I hope I'm not stepping on a story coming up later because I remember reading this earlier, but Nintendo has been talking about a new franchise.
4392420	4394682	Maybe it's time for a new character.
4394722	4395943	Cool.
4396103	4396963	I'm down with that.
4397084	4397664	Absolutely.
4398144	4399425	They need some new franchises.
4399446	4399826	Why not?
4401223	4401703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4424468	4428813	Although I do not disagree, what about something that doesn't exist yet?
4428933	4433237	I mean, Animal Crossing didn't exist until, well, here in America, the GameCube, but the 64.
4433317	4434398	I completely agree with you.
4434418	4435639	You know what hasn't existed yet?
4435880	4439343	A fucking sequel to Excite Truck is what we need.
4439363	4440544	We need Excite Truck 2.
4440624	4441445	No, seriously.
4441645	4442986	The best racing game of the week.
4443387	4444468	Let's just piss it away.
4444548	4448131	We're going to make a game with fucking mini games in the middle of a race.
4448171	4448712	That was genius.
4448932	4449833	All right.
4449893	4451996	Look, I have more Wii stuff I got to get out of here.
4452136	4463029	This is important because when the Wii U launches, one thing Nintendo is committed to, I should say, sorry, excuse me, misspoke, exploring, but when I read something like this, I go, they're going to do it.
4463750	4466574	Digital distribution of full retail games.
4466974	4471957	Starting on the 3DS, not even just the Wii U, but starting on the 3DS with New Super Mario Bros.
4472338	4477241	2 will be available digital download as well as full retail release.
4477341	4479222	But they made it very clear, choice.
4479402	4480043	You have a choice.
4481464	4483025	Apparently... And no price break.
4483145	4491550	They are being aggressive about the Wii U. Iwata did announce Wii U games will be both in stores and digital distribution at launch.
4491570	4493092	See, I thought I had heard it confirmed in there.
4493112	4495033	So I guess the 3DS is the one that's being explored.
4496874	4497495	DarkSakura.com
4512598	4513779	Why would you do that?
4514019	4517081	I mean, I understand why you would do that, so you can take your games with you.
4517741	4522024	But remember, they tie to the system, not the account, which is very important.
4522584	4531390	I'm assuming if you ever upgrade your system, there's a way to transfer the licenses, because I think there is with the Ambassador program on the DS, but, you know, just kind of keep...
4532390	4533971	So anyhow, oh, yeah, they do.
4534031	4536633	I guess they came out later and said, yes, we are doing it.
4537393	4539755	August 2012 is when New Super Mario Bros.
4539775	4541656	2 is going to be the first game that's out.
4542396	4545999	Packaged and digital formats, consumers can make the choice.
4546279	4551382	Also, a game called Onitore, which is a temp name, is also supposed to be sold like this.
4551402	4552323	It's a brain age game.
4552683	4552843	Yeah.
4554104	4554564	Interesting.
4556552	4566434	One other thing about the 3DS, it's all going to be connected, excuse me, the Wii U and the 3DS are all connected through Nintendo eShop.
4566514	4574095	And they say, quote, the majority, key word, of first party 3DS and Wii U games will be sold this way.
4574195	4583557	The dual distribution strategy, digital downloads on launch day, you'll be able to get 16 digit codes through the Nintendo eShop if you want to go buy it in a store or whatever.
4583997	4587238	That doesn't mean that I'm going to open up a box and then it's going to be a card, does it?
4587258	4588178	Because that's kind of shitty.
4589458	4591739	No, but Sony has tried that before.
4591759	4592919	They had Patapon 2.
4592999	4593799	It was like that.
4594219	4595940	It was like, here's a case.
4595980	4597700	Those Vita games aren't far from it.
4598580	4601961	There is nothing in that Vita case but a little plastic slot to put in that cartridge.
4601981	4602501	But you know what?
4602541	4606842	At least that's something that I can sell back at some point if I feel like it or sell it used.
4607002	4607442	That's true.
4608183	4608363	But...
4610143	4630701	Once again, though, I mean, this sounds like a great idea, but then we have to realize, you know, it works for the Vita, I think it could work for the 3DS, but when we're talking games that are gonna be significantly larger in size, and I'm talking about, like, actual storage space on, like, a Blu-ray disc, it's gonna get fucking annoying.
4631321	4635625	Yeah, I can download a title, you know, on my Wii U, but...
4637202	4638103	I don't know, why would you?
4638243	4643108	But at the same time, the 3DS, it makes sense because people want to take their games with them.
4643148	4645250	They don't want to have to carry a bunch of cartridges.
4645290	4649253	They can, you know, store a bunch of games on there and be done with it.
4649574	4651195	But for the Wii U, it doesn't make any sense.
4651476	4658062	I mean, I understand some people download full digital games on the PS3 and stuff, but you can upgrade the hard drive and that thing.
4658082	4660824	I have a 500GB hard drive, so that doesn't really bother me too much, but...
4662005	4668108	You know, they better have adequate storage, and it also takes a really long time.
4668168	4671929	Like, I downloaded Infamous 1, which is a good 8-gig game.
4671969	4673150	That took a couple hours.
4673870	4678312	You know, I'm not going to want to do that for a game that's larger than a DVD-R.
4679413	4683714	You know, we're talking like double that size, maybe even triple that size.
4684575	4686195	Why would you do that and kill your bandwidth?
4686215	4689917	All right, let me give one other quote here about the license rights so we can talk about that real quick.
4690457	4707825	Iwata did state that the 3DS retail games will be stored in the SD memory card and be playable only with the hardware to which it was downloaded so that unlike how you get to share a package software, the consumer cannot share the software with other 3DS systems owned by other members of the family or friends.
4709125	4714687	but that's not any different than the eShop games that are there now like say VVVVV or whatever is the same way.
4714887	4737557	It's too bad they couldn't have just added a feature to the cards where you can download it to a certain system and once it's downloaded to that system it marks something in the card that shows that it's been downloaded to a system and you can't download it again but you can still play the card or you can revoke your privileges and then it clears out whatever that is and granted I'm sure someone could possibly hack it but
4737837	4740559	It's sort of like how iTunes has authorizing computers.
4741119	4741800	Something like that, yeah.
4741860	4743361	Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.
4743381	4748043	I mean, but that would have required them to have forethought for this stuff.
4748083	4752586	And since they didn't do that at launch and it's been out for a year now, it's probably not going to happen.
4752846	4757489	Porkchop in our chatroom says, If the market goes entirely digital, it's a massive middle finger to the gamer.
4757990	4760571	And ShadowNextGen says, That'll eventually happen, Porkchop.
4760731	4761372	It's inevitable.
4761632	4762933	It's not going to happen.
4763193	4764974	It's not going to happen anytime soon.
4765396	4768600	I don't think it'll happen soon, but... It's not.
4768920	4772204	The consumer can ultimately reject it.
4772584	4774606	I want a return of Neo Geo-sized cartridges.
4774807	4777249	The PSP Go was rejected by the consumer.
4777289	4781894	It's not going to happen because, first off, the consumer likes having physical product.
4782495	4783216	Thanks for watching!
4796707	4800071	Just to be fair, ShadowNextGen in the chat says, I didn't say it would happen soon.
4801293	4803175	I don't think it's going to happen any time in the near future.
4804256	4805538	It's too convenient.
4805558	4807621	It's more convenient to go to a store.
4808261	4814990	Seriously, am I going to spend 10 minutes driving to a local store and picking up a copy of a game?
4815470	4816551	Oh, that's such an inconvenience.
4816752	4819375	Or wait six hours for the same game to fucking download.
4819415	4826943	I'll tell you what's fucking convenient and not to sound like a commercial, but Amazon will have that fucker on my doorstep when I get home from work.
4827564	4829026	That's convenient to me.
4829326	4829426	It's...
4830587	4832209	We need to take a step back, you guys.
4832309	4833510	We need to take a step back to simpler times.
4851647	4863350	we need to go back to when digital distribution wasn't even a thang it was nothing you know how you digitally distributed something you got it on the back of a truck to your nearby Chuck E. Cheese that was distribution
4864537	4866017	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4866037	4867978	The first classic game of the week at VOG.
4885623	4886184	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan
4911484	4919591	Defender came out for the arcade done by Williams in 1980, which is a shooting game all 2D back in the day.
4921392	4926337	You have to basically defeat all these different invading aliens while protecting your astronauts.
4927397	4937987	It was developed by Eugene Jarvis, who I've actually, at Classic Gaming Expo a few years back, I got to sit in on a panel with him, and it was just awesome listening to this guy talk about it.
4938067	4943512	By the way, this video that we're playing the audio from is already quiet, and this game didn't really have a lot of noise.
4943572	4945333	It was pew-pew.
4946154	4948376	Not a lot to hear, but there are some laser noises for you.
4948396	4949257	Pew-pew, pew-pew.
4950412	4953813	Anyway, this was the first game that Eugene Jarvis programmed.
4953853	4955353	He was a pinball programmer before that.
4956554	4959134	And he was inspired by Space Invaders and Asteroids.
4961255	4968216	The plan was to display the game at the Amusement and Music Operators Association, but it was delayed.
4969216	4975158	The game itself, though, was highly successful, sold 55,000 units, and it was their best-selling arcade game.
4976579	4990855	and basically it's the game pretty much that put Eugene Jarvis' name amongst the top contributors to the video game industry there is.
4990956	4991757	So that's pretty cool.
4993478	5001100	At any rate, when it was developed, it was Williams' first attempt at a new video game.
5001921	5004902	The earlier one that they had was basically a version of Pong.
5006122	5012104	And they were really, really trying to cash in on how popular video games were getting in 1979.
5013864	5020626	So, they had basically one of their best pinball programmers get right to it.
5021326	5025847	He also, he headed the department, and there's other big names that were involved with that.
5026107	5031509	Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, Paul DeSalt, they were all involved in this.
5031809	5034050	They worked under him as the head.
5035770	5051042	So basically, Jarvis, just going into the development history, spent three to four months working on different versions of Taito Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids, and tried to work games that had similar mechanics.
5051142	5058167	Asteroids, of course, was Vector, had a special monitor, but this one he wanted to really work on a conventional monitor.
5058967	5068812	So, basically, they just took what they liked from Asteroids, being the warping effect they really liked, and then wanted a player to be able to fly back and forth across the screen.
5070872	5079996	He only wanted it to go from left to right, but a person who I have met convinced him to make it scroll around.
5080016	5081077	You know who that is?
5083038	5083398	Who?
5083458	5084039	Steve Ritchie.
5084520	5084620	Oh.
5084980	5092087	Who was the man that designed, he actually was the voice of the Black Knight and the voice of the Skull in No Fear.
5092187	5093269	Was he the voice of Sinstar?
5094189	5094670	Beware.
5094710	5094910	Yes.
5095271	5096412	That guy's awesome.
5096472	5097092	I think it was him.
5097393	5098774	I want him to do bumpers for VOG.
5099014	5100176	But I could talk to him.
5100816	5101177	Sweet.
5101837	5106322	But he's also the guy that designed Twilight Zone.
5107842	5110224	and Black Knight, Steve Ritchie.
5110344	5112546	And he is the sweetest, sweetest guy.
5113006	5114427	Anyway, moving forward.
5115428	5118190	He basically was the guy that suggested that it should scroll in either direction.
5118330	5124635	So it took six months to develop it and they really pushed it through and...
5125696	5133519	So now they have, basically they added in the Planetscape background as sort of an afterthought.
5133639	5140642	And if you'll notice, it's only a pixel wide, those lines, because this hardware wasn't powerful enough to do anything better.
5142575	5147661	So basically after that six months, they really pushed it forward to try to get it done by AMOA.
5148561	5153126	But it took a lot later to do, and they incorporated more things.
5153146	5155589	They had the swarmers, the pods, all the different gameplay.
5156169	5157331	And then they had...
5158872	5164898	They created erasable programmable read-only memory chips for the game to install the cabinets, but they didn't work.
5165339	5168242	So they actually had to do more to get it to work.
5168662	5173967	They got the Attract Mode operational, they got all of the stuff done, and finally had it playable.
5174768	5189795	So the game itself is basically, it's Monaro Sound, it's Pixel on CRT, and it's being run by Motorola again, 6809 central processing chip, which is big stuff in 1980.
5191289	5208799	So the game actually, it didn't really attract a lot of attention in 1980 when it came out, but it ended up being well received in the arcades, and there were tons of crowds during the playtesting, so they actually did a cocktail version of this as well.
5209379	5211220	So like I said, they sold over 55,000 units worldwide.
5214587	5236365	by 2004 the game was a collector's item the upright cabinets you could still find but the cocktail tables of course you know how that went you could hardly find them at all and it was actually considered one of the most successful games in 1981 it outperformed Pac-Man just saying
5238547	5241891	I mean, the graphics at its time were completely revolutionary.
5242853	5244935	It did things that you hadn't seen in the game before.
5245796	5250983	And, you know, all this by a guy who had not ever done a video game before.
5251283	5254968	He did pinball, but... Sometimes it just takes a different perspective, you know?
5255512	5264898	Yeah, but I mean, since then we've had so many different games reference it, so many different games actually work off of things of it.
5265299	5274885	There were software bugs in the game that allowed people to extend their length of time, and there was another one that kept track on how it scores, so basically people could keep earning extra lives and stuff.
5275285	5277747	I mean, we're talking early game hacking, you know.
5278627	5283451	This, you know, hacking, you know, Street Fighter X Tekken is nothing new.
5283511	5284712	People were doing it in the 80s.
5287154	5289156	You remember the dude that did Pac-Man Fever?
5290097	5291058	Little Buckner and Garcia?
5291078	5291539	Yeah, of course.
5292140	5297566	They did a song called The Defender on that album.
5298988	5302011	And Beastie Boys actually referred to it in Body Movin'.
5302892	5303853	Because Beastie Boys are awesome.
5305294	5312219	So, I mean, and if you think about this, how many other games do we have come out since then that... Like, my favorite game, Fantasy Zone.
5312840	5314601	Is that not pretty much Defender?
5315742	5316182	Inspired.
5316242	5317583	Heavily inspired, yes.
5317603	5318364	With cutesiness?
5320165	5327371	You know, we had... And of course, this, you know, basically opened the door to all kinds of other games, like GORF and Phoenix.
5328672	5328932	So...
5330658	5331700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5343911	5349454	Some folks in chat, by the way, talking about Defender 2 on the NES, which was Stargate.
5349615	5356819	As far as other home versions came out, like Defense Command, Repton, Drop Zone, Protector 2, that copied the design.
5358040	5366085	Chopper Command for the Atari 2600 and Choplifter for Apple II were, again, mimics of Defender.
5366105	5366845	I didn't even think about that.
5366885	5367205	You're right.
5367225	5368967	Chopper Command really was the same damn game.
5369407	5370868	I remember my friend owned that.
5371488	5371849	DarkSakura.com
5388857	5393158	Sorry, I just wanted to look really quickly at a chopper command here on the Atari 2600.
5393298	5395979	Yeah, see?
5396420	5398080	You have to protect your dudes on the bottom.
5398180	5399320	Yeah, little trucks on the bottom.
5400681	5402001	Did they get lifted up by the choppers?
5402101	5403522	I forgot how that worked.
5404762	5406363	Oh no, they're just getting... That's the difference.
5406383	5407143	They don't get lifted up.
5407183	5408523	They just get attacked.
5408583	5411123	You have to save the little astronauts in Defender.
5411564	5412964	That guy's not very good at chopper command.
5414664	5427467	But anyway, I mean... And then in 2002, there was the sequel that was just called Defender that was...
5429728	5432830	and I believe the 3D that worked similarly.
5434311	5435071	But yeah, Defender.
5435692	5437913	There it is, your classic game of the week, Defender.
5438574	5439034	Good choice.
5439114	5441476	Now I actually really do need to get a hold of Steve Ritchie.
5442677	5446900	All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but don't go anywhere.
5447000	5457627	Part B is coming up next here on VOG and we're going to start off with some big news in part B so I hope you guys don't go anywhere because we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5463533	5472317	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on our inaugural broadcast here on the VOG, vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network.
5472478	5475219	And right now, just three shows on the actual radio network.
5475319	5481222	VOG Network will be more than just a radio station, but that's the centerpiece of the dinner table right now is the radio station.
5481862	5487685	Just ourselves and Bobby Blackwolf, who you heard before us, and the great folks at Under Sedation Live in their 11th year.
5489766	5492428	God bless them or whatever you believe in.
5493628	5497271	8 o'clock on Saturday, Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.
5497351	5500192	They're late night because they're dirty, but it's a good time.
5500212	5500673	They're dirty.
5500693	5502414	They're a little dirty, but it's a good time.
5502834	5503954	You should definitely tune in.
5504094	5506076	I'll say this because I know Jessica's in the chat right now.
5506396	5509378	Jessica will whip Travis into shape on Saturday night.
5509858	5513640	So if you want to hear him get a whooping, tune in on Saturday.
5513720	5514961	No, it is a really good time.
5515901	5518902	Uh, anyhow, I gotta go back on that show and guess sometime, for sure.
5519083	5526706	Anyway, we are here and, uh, talking about video games and, thank God, some late-breaking news.
5526806	5530868	Some late-breaking news here on the VOG and Orange Lounge Radio. 🎵
5540772	5545515	Well, our breaking news, and we have to go to our correspondent for this story.
5545555	5546776	This isn't even my thing.
5547697	5553680	We've got to go to our correspondent for this story, so I'm looking him up to give him a call right now.
5555241	5555742	Oh, there he is.
5555862	5557203	I always look under the wrong name here.
5557223	5562666	So let's give our correspondent a little call here so we can talk about the breaking news this evening.
5563607	5565868	All the way in New York City, Ranma is joining us.
5565908	5566569	Hey, Ranma, you there?
5567116	5568137	Hey, I'm right here, Scott.
5568157	5569939	How are you guys out in the Sacramento studios?
5570219	5577507	I'm relieved because the show is actually online tonight because, trust me, there was a plan B in case VOG didn't work.
5577847	5578448	But it works.
5578488	5582913	I mean, despite the hiccup earlier that was a Comcast fail, shit, we're used to those.
5583713	5586476	We've had 10 years of those on the other networks we've been in.
5586917	5588879	So otherwise, VOG's working great.
5588959	5589900	And I got to say this.
5590600	5592481	I am so happy.
5592521	5593321	I can't even tell you.
5593741	5599063	We have hit higher numbers tonight on this new network than I've seen in a long, long, long time.
5599103	5609027	And I think a lot of that really is just the combined forces of Bobby's audience and our audience and the curious looky-loos, the people that Geek Life brought in, just all kind of joining together tonight.
5609207	5610708	And I'm just so happy.
5611028	5613069	And I hope the momentum continues through the few weeks.
5613829	5614789	I'm all for that.
5615029	5615529	Yeah, me too.
5615850	5618330	So anyway, you're not calling us to talk about VOG tonight.
5618370	5620711	You have some news for us, I guess you've become privy to.
5620751	5621671	What's going on, Ranma?
5621731	5623031	Yes, yes, yes, I do have news.
5623191	5630793	Now, recently with Anime Jam Session, we've gotten connected to another podcast out here called the Brooklyn Otaku.
5631133	5633634	We've been joining forces and working on some projects.
5634094	5641616	Now, one of the hosts of the Brooklyn Otaku hooked me up with some very privy information today at the Sakura Matsuri.
5642929	5643289	What's that?
5643709	5670936	First off, Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival I was going to let him explain, but that's alright There he goes, fair enough So, Sakura Matsuri, you ran into your friends at Brooklyn Otaku and One of the hosts there has told me that the return of one of the greatest arcades in New York City will be back Chinatown Fair is reopening this Friday
5671636	5674359	Yay, Chinatown Fair reopening this Friday.
5674399	5675801	I've never been to Chinatown Fair.
5676602	5683590	The legendary arcade in these parts was Arcade Infinity, which when I say in these parts, I mean six hours away.
5684051	5686374	But what makes Chinatown Fair so special?
5686414	5688236	Why is this big news for the East Coast folks?
5689091	5691793	It's like the bastion of arcade gaming.
5691833	5698237	It's like this is where you go to play all the greatest, at the time, fighting games, dancing games, all types of video games.
5698257	5699758	This is where you came.
5699838	5707764	It's like nowhere else in New York City you could go except here because it was quiet or loud, however you want to take it, and it was fun.
5708044	5712227	Plus, there was also a chicken that could tell you fortune.
5713448	5713648	Okay.
5716554	5728204	I didn't go to any of the other shops around there, so they could have had fortune-telling chickens.
5729385	5735771	I do believe the grand opening will be this Friday, and from my understanding, they're changing things around a little bit.
5735791	5740315	It's going to be more of a Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster style place.
5741590	5745341	I shudder when I hear Chuck E. Cheese, but Dave and Buster, does that mean they're selling booze?
5745822	5748991	Exclusive Chinatown Fair to carry booze in the parking lot.
5749836	5750837	I hope so.
5751577	5755620	I do believe I'll be going down there Friday after work to check it out and see what's going on.
5755780	5762744	Well, then I need pics and stuff for the VOG website feature stuff that will come later.
5763525	5764305	Oh, definitely.
5765066	5768348	Yeah, that would be great.
5769168	5771970	Exclusive kids band from the new Chinatown Fair.
5772050	5772471	That's good.
5772531	5772871	That's good.
5773450	5796102	well they were kind of sort of banned before pretty much if you were in school and you were there during school hours you were escorted out of the place but I've never been there during those times to see if they actually enforce that rule alright well thank you for sharing the news with us Ranma and thanks to your friends at the other show too since we have you on the line I know you like to call in during the show later anyway is there anything else you want to share with us tonight about your week?
5798743	5802365	yeah but how about I save that for that portion of the show
5803458	5804058	Okay, then.
5804518	5806339	I guess we'll wait for that call later on.
5806799	5809020	And if I can't make it on, I can't make it on.
5809120	5811140	It is what it is, because we have a lot of new listeners.
5811160	5811440	That's right.
5811460	5813421	We also let the fresh blood in, you know?
5813481	5815721	Yeah, you got to let other people have a turn once in a while, Ranma.
5815761	5817022	All right, take care, buddy.
5818102	5819062	We're going to get back to the show.
5821283	5821783	Oh, he hung up.
5821803	5822143	There you go.
5822383	5823524	All right, there it is, breaking news.
5823604	5825324	And also, breaking news exclusive.
5825444	5828425	Loki's mic was off that whole time, says the chatters.
5828445	5829505	Oh, whatever.
5830105	5830525	Can we hear you?
5830565	5831266	I still can't hear you.
5832186	5832466	Is your mic on?
5833591	5834092	Is mine on?
5835054	5835816	I hear my voice.
5838441	5840705	Your mic is... Talk for a minute for me.
5844779	5845620	Oh, God.
5846180	5847922	Didn't you, you didn't fiddle with anything over here?
5848202	5848802	No.
5849163	5849263	Oh.
5849383	5851205	Rob had one mute.
5851245	5854527	You fiddled with my microphone, you bastard.
5857350	5859311	I had nothing intelligent to interject.
5859372	5863215	And the fail award of the evening goes to Rob for mute button fail.
5866505	5867726	Like I'd fiddle the microphone.
5867746	5868266	What do you think I'd do?
5868426	5869126	Hey!
5869146	5870067	Scords!
5870247	5871627	I'm gonna take on those!
5872167	5875168	He's gonna pretend he's Sanrio and chew on them.
5877129	5877829	Alright, whatever.
5878029	5881511	I'm gonna hop up on the table and Rage!
5881571	5882211	Throw the like...
5883266	5885288	So Rob, this coffee is delicious.
5885408	5885728	Thank you.
5886089	5886589	Oh, you're welcome.
5886629	5886809	Anytime.
5886869	5889271	I've just put up two pictures on the OLR website.
5889311	5890492	Sure, that's what they wanted to see.
5890653	5892875	One of them was coffee and the other one was my mouse pad.
5892895	5893535	All right, I'll take it.
5893555	5896157	Sure, we're going to get to rapid fire news, but sure, I'll take a question.
5896258	5897859	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
5898219	5902343	So sometimes we get thrown random ass questions in the VOG chat room and I'll answer them.
5902523	5906447	Nietzsche, OLR, did you guys happen to play any of the Diablo 3 open beta?
5906647	5907948	If so, what class did you play?
5908248	5908648	Hell no.
5908808	5914271	I didn't play the open beta, but I played the closed beta back in October and I played a monk and it was a lot of fun.
5914311	5916813	I played monk and witch doctor and I really preferred monk.
5917393	5918554	It was a good time.
5918814	5920054	I called witch doctor.
5921595	5922876	It looked interesting.
5922916	5925978	I played the original Diablo and I had fun with that.
5926418	5928199	I did not play any of the betas.
5928459	5936226	I got invited to the beta for Mists of Pandaria, but I don't play WoW, so I have no interest in that.
5936587	5939610	Everyone pretty much got invited in the last wave.
5939990	5941211	Rapid fire news.
5941271	5942592	Let's get to it, Loki.
5942873	5944034	So this is interesting.
5944114	5946176	Joyride is getting a sequel.
5947797	5948078	Why?
5948238	5950360	It wasn't a very fun game.
5965818	5986084	and apparently we'll have absolutely no Kinect support whatsoever and it's going to be just standard controller support which is fine if you think about it because originally it was supposed to be just an Xbox Live Arcade title that was supposed to be free and then they were going to have a bunch of other crap that you could download and expand it with because it was going to be a free-to-play type thing.
5986104	5991506	They're going to have an all-new stunt park and I guess you can do different stunts like jumping off cliffs and whatnot.
5992226	5994087	Um, but that'll be coming out later on.
5994408	6000611	Maybe if it's, you know, supposed to be in the summer or something, maybe a part of their summer thing that they're doing.
6000731	6001692	I'm going to be willing to bet.
6002533	6003913	Um, you know what?
6004033	6011458	Actually, it sounds kind of interesting then if it is without, you know, Connect because Connect kind of hurt that game, but it could have been fun.
6013840	6016021	So, I'd be willing to check out the demo at least.
6016241	6017342	I'll check out the demo at least.
6018482	6018963	So, hmm.
6019123	6020203	Alright.
6020323	6028568	Now, something I really could care less about, or couldn't care less, I guess, Pikmin 2 is getting its new play control game on the Wii this June.
6029128	6042476	Now for those who may not remember, they did this thing called New Play Control way back in 2009 where they were taking some of these old GameCube games and adding some Wii support on top of them and that's about it.
6042616	6045898	And they had a couple games that came out and then they kind of stopped.
6046419	6049701	And this actually came out in Japan and Europe in 2009.
6049981	6053303	But for whatever reason they decided, hey, we're going to bring it out in the U.S.
6053403	6053623	now.
6055168	6058513	Thanks, Nintendo, for bringing this to us.
6064915	6065135	What?
6065195	6065995	It's escaping me.
6066455	6069136	The last story is coming out, yes.
6069376	6070736	I was going to say Litterbox Chronicles.
6071397	6080739	No, the last story is coming out in June, but honestly, they haven't had a first party Wii title since, well, Mario Party 9 had been the last first party Wii title, and that was in the beginning of March.
6082519	6088141	I mean, they have the Pokemon Conquest game, which, you know, Dynasty Warriors cross Pokemon.
6089341	6111776	Hey, I'm, I'm curious, let's just put it that way, I'm a little curious Um, I just think it's kind of like, here, here you go, this is something that you really wanted So, so we gonna like, what is it, we gonna get the, fuck, I don't even remember the other games that have been released in other territories but not Are we gonna get Captain Rainbow at some point, you know?
6112097	6113618	Are they gonna like localize that?
6113638	6115539	What the hell is Captain Rainbow?
6118129	6130579	It was a game that came out in Japan that was... It was all these, like, old... What was the one with all the sexy men dudes that was, like, hole in the wall, basically?
6130599	6131639	Oh, that did come out here, didn't it?
6131659	6132300	That did come out here.
6132720	6135202	Yes, that came out here, but Captain Rainbow did not.
6135242	6138585	Captain Rainbow was the one that had, like, all of the misfit Nintendo characters.
6139085	6142168	Like, Birdo was in it and stuff like that, and it was just ridiculous.
6144389	6145010	I want that.
6145050	6145970	There's Birdo right there.
6146531	6146951	I want that.
6146971	6147291	I want that.
6148587	6154031	What are you playing as?
6154051	6156332	Captain Rainbow.
6156352	6157573	Captain Rainbow, dummy!
6158014	6158214	Shut up.
6158274	6161336	It's like, just this panned out thing, I was like, he's falcon punching.
6161356	6162677	His eyes are big flames.
6169041	6172743	He's doing rainbow things to that door.
6174964	6175804	He's plugging in.
6175944	6178025	Maybe they just think we wouldn't get it.
6178825	6179385	I'd play it.
6180406	6180966	Exactly.
6181086	6181966	It's really weird.
6182326	6185447	But there was another game, though, that was...
6187168	6190249	and I don't remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.
6190289	6193990	It was like Disaster Day and Crisis or something like that, I think.
6194050	6195311	You know what else we don't have here?
6195591	6197932	Tingle's Adventure or whatever that game was.
6198192	6199852	Yeah, it's because it sucked.
6200412	6201813	I'm sorry, no Tingle game here.
6204063	6205123	They got the postcards!
6205143	6208624	That's the new franchise Nintendo needs to explore, Tingle.
6209044	6210084	Listen, no they don't.
6210464	6212165	He is a really fucking annoying character.
6212745	6216746	We do not need to bring this crap back up.
6216766	6218026	Tingle's Epic Quest.
6220746	6221446	Epic Tingle.
6221827	6222667	I will tell you what.
6222747	6225387	You know what, I think Epic Tingle would be a better game.
6225607	6229048	If they launch the Wii U with a Tingle game, I will buy that system.
6230094	6232279	Oh, I thought you were going to say you'd dress up finally.
6232559	6232619	No.
6232639	6234423	The bet we've been trying to get forever.
6234723	6238772	You know, that would actually be like the easiest costume ever because all you have to do is like sweats and a hoodie.
6239032	6239373	All right.
6240979	6243681	Moving on, do you have any other rapid fire news or is that it?
6244502	6250626	No, I got one more and that's a little bit better and I'm sure this may actually sell some Vitas for some people.
6250967	6262976	DGMax Technica Tune is actually coming out to the North America region for the Vita this summer and it looks pretty awesome.
6262996	6264357	It looks just like the arcade stuff.
6267523	6267923	Valuesoft
6291132	6293073	You may not know what ValueSoft is.
6293354	6294815	I'm well aware of ValueSoft.
6294855	6296716	They make budget PC games.
6297977	6298977	Budget Wii games, too.
6298997	6302380	$10 rack at Target of PC games and all that.
6303420	6305061	These games are in there.
6305101	6307263	I want to see the room by Activision at one time.
6307703	6311427	Maybe, but they're not going to be run by THQ anymore because they just sold it off.
6312228	6314450	Apparently, they are the second largest U.S.
6314510	6317574	retail publisher of PC games in terms of units sold.
6317614	6318274	I have no idea.
6318895	6322779	But anyhow, I guess what is happening... Oh, no, I'm sorry.
6323240	6327965	Cosme is buying them, and together it will make them the second largest U.S.
6328025	6328886	retail publisher.
6329486	6330267	So I see where it is.
6330307	6334329	So ValueSoft wasn't, but now they will be with Cosme, who they've sold it to.
6334510	6337572	To be fair, they do have their purpose in the industry.
6337612	6349920	It's like, you know, seriously, if you're having a game that you're putting out that maybe is not that great, and not necessarily that it's not that great, but at least there's a publisher out there for your independent game if you really want to do it.
6349940	6353143	So if OLR, the game, ever becomes a reality, maybe on ValueSoft, right?
6354483	6355484	Yeah.
6355624	6356425	Yeah.
6356725	6357886	Digital is probably the better way to go.
6358522	6366213	So heads up to those folks that play games like City of Heroes, Champions Online, and Star Trek Online, which would be DarkSakura.
6366293	6369717	Cryptic Studios found out that their systems have been hacked.
6370418	6370979	That's right.
6371720	6374204	They were hacked in December of 2010.
6376516	6377016	That's not very routine.
6396901	6397942	Once every two years.
6398722	6403065	Account information, including passwords, may have been accessed by an unauthorized party.
6403105	6405267	Of course, by now you probably would have had your account hacked.
6405627	6407348	Maybe that's how they got into the Xboxes.
6407408	6409850	No crap happened to my account, just letting people know.
6410891	6413993	I logged in and everything was still there.
6414313	6415294	Man, those hackers are good.
6415314	6417475	They turned Star Trek to free-to-play.
6417796	6418336	They're pretty good.
6419969	6421451	I spent an hour playing Dabo.
6421691	6426414	Yet another great tip to change your passwords and use unique passwords on every site.
6427555	6434020	And it says that your network provider checks their security logs more than once every 16 months.
6434841	6439744	Alright, and last but not least for my rapid fire news, Adam Sessler left G4.
6441385	6442045	Good for him.
6443306	6443846	You know what?
6444306	6445546	Hey, I understand.
6446427	6448547	You may be joking, but you know what?
6448987	6453929	That guy, sadly, he was one of the good things from G4.
6454049	6461391	Well, one of the good things left on G4 and one of the good things from Tech TV back when they were around.
6463051	6463871	Bravo to him.
6463931	6466312	I'm actually moving on to probably some better waters.
6466372	6466612	I mean...
6467225	6470887	I don't know why the game blogs feel the need to continually cover G4.
6471988	6474129	G4 is not a gaming network and hasn't been for some time.
6474149	6475289	I don't think that they're covering G4.
6475369	6476710	I think they're talking about Adam Sessler.
6476770	6478971	I don't think they care a rat's ass about G4.
6479011	6481373	I think they care about Adam Sessler.
6481513	6483774	There's one response for that, Rob.
6486635	6487396	Did you kill a fly?
6489277	6512889	I think people maybe are hoping that he's going somewhere that will actually be gaming related but it is important to say apparently it was a contract dispute that got him out and Comcast who owns G4 I'm sure wants to save money anywhere they can and probably doesn't throw a lot of money at a network that some didn't DirecTV threaten to pull the plug on G4 or maybe they already did
6513309	6515370	Listen, we have enough cheater and cops reruns.
6515390	6516910	We don't need you guys around.
6517411	6523253	Honestly, G4, to me, seems like a network that would be better suited for the internet.
6523573	6524093	You know what I mean?
6524153	6529535	Just having digital content on the internet because they don't have much content to begin with.
6529835	6533296	It's literally cops and cheaters reruns all the fucking time.
6533316	6534617	But the internet doesn't need them now.
6534637	6535117	They have us.
6536337	6540040	And in fact, there's several folks in the chatroom that say, Sessler should come to VOG.
6541620	6542601	The door is open.
6542621	6544622	I would love to interview Adam Sessler.
6544642	6545643	We can't pay you, though.
6545663	6546924	Don't pay him in Starbucks.
6547384	6547944	Exactly.
6549045	6551506	He will probably be getting less money than you're getting with G4.
6553447	6574440	some folks seem to think he could go to Polygon again this is all rampant speculation because you know he I don't think he was planning on leaving he thought the contracts would go through but they didn't Polygon of course is that whole kind of Voltron of the guy who used to be the editor in chief of Kotaku and the like three editor guys from Joystick and a bunch of people all coming together for that one so
6576901	6579282	Anyhow, he's gone.
6580403	6582844	And G4 takes one more step away from gaming.
6583684	6584605	Moving on, DarkSakura.
6585945	6588747	Well, moving... No, we won't pay him in Pinkberry.
6588787	6589827	That Pinkberry's for us.
6590347	6590748	That's right.
6590788	6591988	I'm not giving up my Pinkberry.
6592148	6592529	Hell no.
6592629	6594069	He can have my portion of Pinkberry.
6594089	6594369	You know what?
6594409	6595550	He can have the peach Pinkberry.
6595790	6599552	You can have the peach, all the peach, and the lychee shit when it comes back.
6599832	6601213	Oh, yeah, you can have the lychee too.
6602333	6609780	So, the Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for Portal 2 will be available for PC and Mac on May 8th.
6610200	6613063	And I'm downloading the shit out of it!
6613143	6616686	But there's nothing saying about it being on any of the consoles.
6617894	6618534	I second that.
6618594	6625216	I mean, I haven't redeemed my copy of Portal 2 for the PC on my Steam thing that came with the PS3 version.
6625236	6628316	You know, it might have had an expiration date, so you might want to look into that.
6628376	6628756	Damn it!
6629077	6629977	You better be careful.
6630077	6630517	Whatever.
6631917	6633317	It's like super cheap anyway now.
6633758	6633998	Yeah.
6634998	6643420	But I'm totally going to be writing a review on that when I download it because, you know, my favorite thing to do in Sims 3 was build houses.
6643860	6645400	Now I'll be building tests.
6647833	6649214	Would you like to play a game?
6649514	6649954	Oh, God.
6650874	6659057	So, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, which is the Wii... Sorry, I'm just imagining your dream OLR Studios level.
6660438	6662419	With Loki and I in perpetual fall.
6663919	6664419	Oh, my God.
6664459	6666520	You guys would be the perfect Atlas and Peabody.
6667761	6669241	That should be your cosplay as Atlas and Peabody.
6669261	6670102	I know who's Atlas.
6672883	6673503	Moving on.
6673988	6686237	So anyway, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, which is the MMO, launching in Japan on August 2nd, Squeenix has told everybody.
6686437	6692541	It will be, for the actual disc, is 6980 yen, which is about 86 bucks.
6693461	6694722	And it's 20 days of free play.
6695143	6699906	It will include a USB memory stick for an extra 2000 yen, and like 23 bucks here.
6701987	6706270	And there is going to be a Wii U version, but they have no details on this one.
6706810	6713073	The subscription fee is 1,000 yen, basically 1,235 in US dollars.
6713714	6716856	And that's a 30-day voucher that gets you to play up to three characters.
6716876	6717656	60 days is 1,950.
6717696	6718356	90 days will be 2,900.
6723143	6723543	Dragon Quest X
6754016	6756597	Oh god, I hope Versus makes the holiday this year.
6756997	6758817	I really want Zero to come out over here.
6759818	6760378	Oh yeah!
6761438	6762798	Because I want to play the hell out of that.
6763038	6764199	Let's talk about Final Fantasy XV.
6764219	6767360	How about my last bit for rapid fire news?
6768260	6769560	Silent Hill Downpour.
6770380	6772441	There actually is a patch.
6773041	6774381	There's two patch announcements.
6774862	6779783	One for Silent Hill Downpour and then we have Silent Hill HD Collection to fix the frame rate problems.
6780443	6784807	Audio Sinking and Downpour, and the Autosave in the Silent Hill HD Collection.
6785828	6789671	And they should be coming out, and the quote is, in the coming weeks.
6791113	6796177	But there's no patch yet to make a Silent Hill HD Collection good.
6797318	6800040	Yeah, we should spend a little bit more time on figuring out how fog works.
6800060	6801141	Fog is hard.
6801201	6801982	Fog is hard.
6804955	6806917	It's just like, come on.
6807517	6808238	Silent Hill.
6808959	6810180	The monsters don't work.
6810600	6812042	Well, let's just release it anyways.
6812742	6815745	I mean, that's about as integral as the fog.
6815945	6817326	The fog is kind of important there.
6818848	6820830	All right, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6820850	6824153	We've kind of missed this the past couple weeks, so I think it's time we get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6824173	6825234	I haven't missed it at all.
6825674	6826535	Why haven't you missed it?
6826655	6827416	Are you hating on the Fugle?
6827436	6829558	No, I'm being a bitch.
6830000	6832982	Except, oops, I didn't have the Fugle theme song up tonight.
6833163	6833723	Shame on me.
6833823	6834223	Fail.
6834284	6834744	Fired.
6835144	6836685	We're hiring Adam Sessler, Rob.
6838267	6838847	You guys would fire me.
6838927	6841089	Exclusive Adam Sessler to replace Rob.
6841830	6842290	Here it is.
6842330	6842750	There it is.
6842991	6843871	Fugle Music.
6845072	6845733	Fugle!
6845913	6850076	Every week on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community, we ask a question and get your answers.
6850237	6852198	Combine Facebook and Google and you get Fugle.
6852358	6853779	That's why it's our Fugle Question of the Week.
6853799	6854240	I like it.
6854784	6857005	Now that Sony has announced their own Smash Bros.
6857045	6860006	style game, should Microsoft start working on one?
6860546	6863007	Why or why not wouldn't this be a good idea?
6864107	6866688	If you think it's a good idea, what character would you most want to see in the game?
6867068	6870289	We got one answer on Google+, so there are people using Google+.
6870349	6875991	Danny K says, I don't really think they have enough first party games to justify a game like that.
6876091	6881132	That's a theme we're seeing quite a bit through some of the answers going over to Facebook where we had lots of answers.
6881152	6882853	And I love this one from Bobby Blackwolf.
6883413	6906184	who posted a link to a picture on a NeoGAF forum of what an Xbox Super Smash Brothers game would look like and it's just a select screen for Xbox 360 Ultra Heroes Ultimate Fight and it's 15 different versions of Master Chief all in different colors and shapes on the select screen.
6906884	6910306	You know what this is missing though is the female Master Chief with a bow in her hair.
6913855	6914414	Mrs. Chief
6917862	6929728	Katsuhiko Janai says I don't want to play as Microsoft Bob or Clippy See, I like thinking, think outside the box Don't just make it the video games, make it all the Clippy would be awesome Is that thinking outside the Xbox?
6931589	6940594	Getting to kick the shit out of Clippy I think would sell Or the damn dog That ugly ass dog You know what character needs to be in the game, Rob?
6940674	6944396	Seriously, Comic Sans So I can beat the shit out of it
6944736	6944996	All right.
6945637	6947540	Stan H says, I agree with Black Wolf.
6947580	6951965	Microsoft doesn't have enough first-party characters to fill a decent-sized roster for today's fighting game.
6952306	6958914	You need to have at least 15, and I can't think of anyone besides Master Chief and Milo, unless they have a Kinect that has legs and arms with boxing gloves on.
6958934	6959675	Milo, wow.
6960275	6962077	I know, that was funny.
6963798	6968541	James A. says, though, I must confess, I'd love to see Joanna Dark in such a game.
6968781	6969562	Cameo, too.
6970102	6971323	So some folks are starting to think of some others.
6971683	6983292	RedTheHayes says, no, even though Microsoft has far more popular titles with characters like Master Chief, they just don't have as much of a history to draw from like Sony or Nintendo since they're relatively new to the console gaming business.
6983672	6985713	They have a few recognizable characters to choose from.
6985753	6989235	They have Master Chief, Fable Dude, Gears of War characters.
6989915	6993897	Another thing, most of the popular characters on the Xbox are from shooter games.
6994378	6996739	Throwing characters from shooter games into a Smash Bros.
6996779	7001501	type fighting might not go so well with the dude bro gamers who are primarily into the Xbox shooters.
7002262	7006724	Though if they ever made one, I would love to see the President and Vice President from Metal Wolf Chaos.
7006784	7008145	That would totally change my mind.
7008945	7010166	Now I like what Jim H. said.
7011496	7015920	They really, even if they don't, even if they can muster up a roster, they really don't make those kinds of games.
7016241	7017502	Maybe an all-star shooter.
7019203	7023267	So like an all-star melee rampage in first person.
7023287	7027371	Just call it like a Microsoft... The Make Jamie Barf game.
7027391	7028492	Capture the flag.
7028512	7029233	I don't know.
7029634	7030114	There you go.
7032064	7032385	Let's see.
7032805	7034747	Now, Giovedeo goes a different way with this.
7035368	7041154	Well, considering Nintendo was able to use Sonic and Snake, it doesn't have to be characters exclusive to Microsoft.
7041495	7043297	Just characters they're willing to pay money for.
7043637	7053708	And since there are games like Metal Gear, Final Fantasy XIII, Devil May Cry that have come into the Microsoft franchise, I can see them paying for the use of those characters as well as Microsoft exclusives.
7054248	7059972	Also, since it's Microsoft, perhaps a paperclip that fights with well-placed sarcastic comments and uses itself like a sword.
7060032	7063695	You're also forgetting the fact that there's Xbox Live Arcade.
7063735	7066096	There's plenty of shit on Xbox Live Arcade.
7066137	7066637	That's true.
7066857	7072621	You do Castle Crashers, you can have, you know, um... What was it, uh... You know what's funny?
7072701	7073962	Tony B said that.
7074222	7075343	Xbox Arcade characters.
7075683	7082348	Swap out Master Chief for Bastion, Tim from Braid, Knights from Castle Crashers, Dude from Plants from Zombies, Splosion Man...
7084237	7084790	So there you go.
7086347	7088228	Orange Right says Microsoft owns Rare.
7088608	7089829	Rare has the Battletoads.
7090249	7090870	Think about it.
7091210	7096733	President Cat would not work, by the way, Tigerclaw, because that... Didn't Rare also do Killer Instinct?
7097433	7097593	Yes.
7097673	7099434	Oh, but Nintendo technically owns that.
7099474	7099974	I don't care.
7100034	7101615	Let's do a new Battletoads game.
7101795	7103276	Fuck any of this other shit.
7103316	7104137	Who gives a crap about this?
7104157	7105897	Battletoads is the devil.
7106558	7106878	I don't care.
7106898	7107939	That game's freaking hard.
7108859	7112041	Battletoads with, like, even more difficulty.
7112221	7113882	And then it had that, like, level music.
7113922	7114002	The...
7115794	7125261	last character idea Clover N this will be the last one I read sorry I didn't get to all of them but lots of responses on Facebook thanks you guys Clover N says Alan Wake could be a character have him go up against Master Chief
7125717	7126858	So there's... That'll be boring.
7126878	7130201	I'm going to flash my flashlight at you.
7130461	7131582	I'm going to shoot you in the face.
7133203	7133683	Done.
7134064	7134664	All right.
7135204	7139188	If you want to give us some tough stuff to talk about, we are going to take phone calls later.
7139208	7145032	We also have our mailbag, mailbag at orangeonstranger.com and the Twitter, which we'll take Twitter topics later, twitter.com slash OLR.
7145372	7149656	And Milo would be terrible too because he'd be like, I have family issues and I'm going to shoot you in the face.
7152043	7155184	Alright, let's get back into some other news, Loki.
7157284	7157764	Exclusive?
7157784	7159124	No, I'm kidding.
7160324	7164905	So, yes, there's a little bit of talk about the next Smash Bros.
7164965	7165225	game.
7165425	7167126	No, we're not talking about PlayStation 1.
7168586	7170786	For the Wii U and the 3DS.
7171406	7179828	And one of the things that they're really pushing for is cross-support for those two platforms to be able to brawl against each other, of course.
7181768	7189410	It says there's a certain dead end we come to if we just expand the volume of the game.
7190910	7193951	Of course, I intend to change the direction a little bit as we go.
7194011	7201173	The key is that there's going to be dual support for 3DS and Wii U. So they're going to have some sort of...
7202557	7227658	you know cross play between the platforms which really in this day and age is not that big a deal I mean the PSP and PlayStation 3 do that the Vita and the PlayStation 3 do that not a huge deal it depends though how like you know well integrated it is too you know well you know with that Wii U controller being the bottom half of a 3DS I'm pretty sure that they'll be able to pull it off
7228959	7229419	NBA Baller Beats
7253004	7256048	NBA Baller Beats You play this game with an actual basketball in your living room
7273986	7282769	and so much more.
7283569	7290531	Apparently, USA Today got their hands on the game and say it's a rhythm music game, not like a dribbling coach, but like a rhythm music game.
7290571	7292592	You bounce the ball to the beat of the music.
7293072	7318609	you have a visual cue that's a line of basketballs on a musical trail and you have to do specific moves like an icon might prepare you for an upcoming basketball move also in time with the music you might have to cross over from one hand to the other dribble between the legs do a pass fake or a shot fake it's creative I gotta give it that but I'm like how in the fuck is this gonna work because if you're playing it in your living room how do you bounce a ball on your carpet
7319769	7324051	I used to live in a house with hardwood floors, but even then I don't think my roommate would appreciate me playing this game.
7324452	7330975	Well, apparently dribbling is going to be very close to the body because that's the way it is in basketball.
7330995	7333536	They don't encourage you to dribble at the TV or whatever.
7335817	7336217	Let's see.
7336437	7341260	Apparently it is possible to play baller beats in a carpeted room.
7342640	7344982	The ball will work on most services.
7346482	7349223	I guess shag rugs won't work, but the carpet should.
7349303	7350904	I don't know what the heck to take from that.
7350924	7352525	I feel like I should say that's what she said.
7354766	7355146	I'm sorry.
7355206	7356646	It's just like this sounds stupid.
7359487	7362449	I'll give them props to the fact that it's a unique game idea.
7363069	7364109	There's a little trailer here.
7364129	7365230	I've got to take a look at this.
7365250	7368611	Nothing has been tried like this before, but I think for good reason because it's stupid.
7369331	7374575	I don't think this is going to work well, Kinect.
7374956	7377358	I think this is going to be annoying if you're in a goddamn apartment.
7378058	7380000	Especially if you're upstairs.
7380040	7383262	Yes, especially if you're upstairs.
7385164	7389067	I was looking in this trailer for clips of the game, but I don't think I'm going to see it.
7389407	7390108	Oh wait, no, there's a guy.
7391208	7393690	It's just him in the living room.
7394691	7395372	Founcing a ball.
7395432	7396812	But he doesn't actually shoot the ball.
7396832	7397813	I mean, you kind of care.
7397833	7399034	Yeah, you fake shooting it.
7399414	7403777	But which icon's going to indicate me throwing the ball into the TV?
7403837	7407179	Because that's kind of a risk.
7407339	7409220	Hopefully this thing is made out of Nerf.
7409280	7412962	Because that's the only way you're going to not break your TV.
7414223	7417505	How many lamps is this game going to take?
7417605	7419186	There's no in-game footage at all.
7420387	7420587	None.
7420647	7421107	Okay, whatever.
7424597	7429703	I'm sorry, but these games that come out for Kinect, nobody can fucking take this shit seriously.
7430024	7434409	To be honest, Majesco hasn't really had a lot of games that take the Kinect seriously.
7434869	7438934	I think their last game that they released for the Kinect was the Twister game.
7440536	7441397	Twister for Kinect.
7443079	7443239	No.
7443960	7444080	No.
7444321	7444481	Just...
7448159	7451001	This should be an Xbox Live Arcade game, but it's not.
7452122	7455765	You can't get a little nerfy ball from Xbox Live Arcade.
7456206	7457126	Nerfy, derpy, whatever.
7457207	7463472	This will be on the aisle right next to Babysitting Mama with the little Wii baby that you shoved the Wiimote up its butt.
7463492	7464453	Yeah, that did well.
7464773	7466675	It's on sale at Target right now.
7466695	7467636	Yeah, it's incredible.
7468077	7471481	Porkchop in chat says, My ears are burning at the sound of this asshattery.
7471501	7474304	And that's pretty much what most people in the chat room boils down to.
7474764	7480351	You know, I got to admit, as dumb as this sounds, you guys, I'm not going to lie.
7480711	7483453	I kind of want to try it, just to say I did.
7484154	7487837	Because it's not like any other Kinect game I've seen yet.
7488978	7495743	I guess it's kind of a dance game at its core, but if I could do the thing with the ball like that guy, hey, I'd be fly.
7496804	7497544	I could get chicks.
7499286	7501948	DarkSakura, would I be hot if I could dribble the ball?
7503109	7505511	Rob, you're becoming whiter.
7509902	7511083	I didn't think it was possible.
7511103	7511943	All right, knock it off.
7512003	7513684	All right, we're going to go to the mailbag.
7513784	7515204	Every week you guys send us emails.
7515865	7516345	No, they don't.
7516905	7518585	And tell me about the things I shouldn't be doing.
7518946	7519526	No, they don't.
7520166	7524748	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com They really don't send anything.
7525388	7526268	We have one email.
7526628	7527569	One email this week.
7527849	7532150	I guess everybody just thought with the network switch we wouldn't have time for emails.
7532410	7533411	I'm going to hope that was it.
7534451	7552587	so this comes from Robert M I was wondering whether DarkSakura has had a chance to try the pinball arcade either the iOS version or the latest console download although video pinball simply can't really compete with the experience of real physical tables what her overall impressions were actually I did download it I haven't had a chance to play it yet
7553038	7555420	I thought I talked about this on last week or the week before show.
7555440	7556140	I have the iOS version.
7556661	7556881	Yeah?
7557301	7560644	And I have literally not downloaded it.
7560684	7560944	That's it.
7561004	7561464	I played it on 360.
7561745	7565147	It's a faithful recreation of the tables.
7565607	7569971	It really is just like the compilations they already put out.
7570091	7572052	It's just this is kind of a different way of distributing it.
7572352	7573794	And I think it's some different tables too.
7574234	7577016	I was thrilled to be able to play Theater of Magic.
7577376	7579438	Theater of Magic is like one of the greatest tables ever.
7579838	7580678	I could try loading it up.
7580698	7584660	So to be able to play that and Arabian Nights, is that what the table's actually called?
7585440	7587141	Or does it have another name to it?
7587161	7592443	That's why I always think of it as... But I love Theater of Magic, so to be able to play that again is great.
7593704	7597405	You know, there's things I like about Pinball FX2 and there's things I like about this game.
7597485	7598906	Certainly this game has the...
7599766	7602347	Classic Table, Black Hole, Theater of Magic, Bride of Pinbot, Medieval Madness
7620990	7621170	Yep.
7621992	7623154	I fucking love Medieval Madness.
7623174	7625538	There's more games on the iPhone than there are on the Xbox.
7625818	7627762	Unless it's all DLC I haven't checked out yet.
7627782	7628102	Let's see.
7628783	7629244	Probably.
7629545	7629965	Connecting.
7629985	7632870	Would you like to restore your purchase tables on this device?
7632890	7634814	Ah, so you gotta purchase them on there too, sucker.
7635635	7635995	All right.
7636916	7638398	I'm buying the hell out of Medieval Madness.
7638678	7642862	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send us more emails next time.
7643363	7645124	Now we're going to get into... There was more, Rob.
7645665	7646045	Oh, I'm sorry.
7646065	7646365	What the hell?
7646386	7647106	There was more than email.
7647126	7648508	I thought that was the end of the email.
7648548	7648588	No.
7648628	7648788	My bad.
7649629	7650850	You know what happens when you assume?
7651611	7653873	You make an ass out of you and not me.
7655114	7656916	Wouldn't that be asu not me?
7656936	7659919	That sounds Japanese.
7661857	7662837	It was my golden week tribute.
7662857	7665279	Anyway, anyway, whatever.
7666179	7671581	It says, incidentally, as far as I'm concerned, it would only be ironic if it was raining during the wedding of a local weather reporter.
7672822	7673162	That's it.
7674163	7676884	Oh, I'm so glad we held up the whole goddamn show to hear that.
7676904	7677464	You know what?
7677524	7683087	We have to read every little word that's on our listeners' email out of respect, Rob.
7683107	7683547	You're right.
7683847	7684847	Out of fucking respect.
7684888	7686088	It's the voice of geeks.
7686288	7686868	Fucking closing this shit.
7686888	7689930	Even when they're talking about rain on your wedding day.
7690710	7694755	That's a current song and of course the joke is as current as that.
7694775	7696376	Oh my god, they play that at work.
7696496	7697738	Anyway, done.
7697898	7699419	It's current at the dentist's office.
7699499	7701361	Alright, moving on.
7701401	7705105	Hey, the dentist's office is the pulse of the entertainment community.
7705326	7707488	What a perfect time to segue into the FUs of the week.
7724625	7727927	F you to this thing for not letting me download this.
7728927	7731128	However, the table pack is like five bucks.
7733449	7733809	Sucker.
7734029	7734409	Yeah.
7735030	7735350	Loki!
7737051	7740212	Um, F you to the fact that I'm full and there's more breadsticks.
7741994	7743555	F you to the fact that I'll eat the... No, I'm just kidding.
7743575	7745315	I gotta save room for dinner.
7745735	7754118	Actually, I had a really fucking amazing week, so I can't really say F you to the... F you to the fact that I'm moving at work on Thursday.
7754718	7758379	It's not that I don't care about the whole reorder or whatever.
7758399	7759620	I think it's gonna be interesting.
7760400	7766962	But the fact that I have to actually physically move, meaning pack up all my shit at my desk into a box...
7767662	7769544	F you to the fact that I sound really lazy right now.
7790219	7790659	That's really it.
7790719	7792481	Otherwise, I had an amazing, amazing week.
7792541	7794363	And I really can't wait.
7794983	7797726	I want to talk more about what happened this week on next week's show.
7798286	7799487	Because I can't talk about it now.
7799627	7800468	But I'll talk about it next week.
7801149	7801389	All right.
7802410	7802850	Moving on.
7803611	7804412	Let's get some more news.
7804472	7804672	Loki.
7806155	7808216	So, this is kind of interesting.
7808236	7812738	It leaked out on the PlayStation Network store.
7813558	7816459	One of the PlayStation 1 classics for the Vita.
7817239	7819760	It was actually in the European store.
7820160	7822401	Buzz Lightyear of Star Command was the game.
7824202	7826923	It's been pulled so far, but however...
7828423	7829463	It doesn't work yet.
7830244	7832964	It's like it's missing a patch or something like that.
7834265	7842467	But apparently that is a very good indicator that they're going to be having some PlayStation 1 games available very soon for the PlayStation Vita.
7842587	7843087	Thank God.
7843127	7844007	I hope they all are.
7844047	7847849	Because that would be a great library to just open my Vita to.
7847909	7849469	You know, Final Fantasy VII, hello.
7850629	7851130	What else do I own?
7851150	7851570	Castlevania.
7851590	7853310	And now you're getting some of these through PS Plus too.
7853410	7856051	Silent Hill, the original, is free right now on PlayStation Plus.
7856531	7884411	hopefully the plus stuff works on the Vita maybe they have to get all that worked out I don't know but yeah I'm looking forward to that that's gonna I know it sounds really weird that like you know it's like oh I'm excited about old ass 15 year old games on my portable console but you know I don't know I just there's a lot of stuff I have now that I didn't when my PSP was all the rage and those screens are so big and crystal clear like I'm it's most likely something they'll announce at E3 yeah
7885615	7886835	I think I gotta wait that long.
7888056	7896157	I will only accept that if it's one of those, well, we're gonna be patching the PlayStation 1 titles into the Vita today.
7896477	7899218	You know how sometimes there's that whole today announcement.
7899578	7901218	Like, what did Microsoft have?
7901618	7904239	Googly eyes on the Kinect today.
7904959	7906579	Kinect Labs, that was it.
7906839	7907900	Googly eyes.
7908320	7909180	Laser pointer.
7911129	7939857	you know I liked it better some of that stuff was cute no no I liked it better was that the second year we went to E3 2006 and they fucking had hey listen you know what I know a lot of you people can't go to E3 so we're gonna put some of those demos that are at E3 on your console that was fucking great that was great but they don't do that shit anymore they never do that anymore it was like Lost Planet and I'd play the shit out of that demo over and over again and MotoGP but I didn't give a shit about that
7940257	7944520	But at least Capcom got it for once, you know, there.
7944560	7946281	I mean, they should really do that again.
7946341	7949763	Or as Orange, right, in the chat room says, Saturn is coming out today.
7950524	7951804	Things were different back then, though.
7951844	7954646	When the Saturn came out, technology wasn't the way it is now.
7955026	7958529	Like, I think if they were to do a system launch like that, it would be a lot different.
7959309	7964052	Or at least, like, you know, maybe not today, but, like, it's coming out next Friday.
7964372	7966894	Apple does that.
7967814	7968335	Works for them.
7969315	7969876	All right, anyhow.
7970736	7972978	Well, you just talked about one thing Capcom does right.
7972998	7974820	Let me tell you about something Capcom does very wrong.
7974840	7977182	Oh, that's a long list.
7977202	7978803	The Mega Man franchise.
7980044	7990734	It is of note, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show, that the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3 actually hit 100,000 members this week.
7990794	7991774	I'm one of them.
7992095	7992215	Yeah.
7992675	7995057	I think I am too, so there you go.
7995298	7998360	And that is something that the million moms couldn't accomplish.
7998461	8003725	The one million moms against Ellen or whatever dumbass hattery that stuff was.
8004526	8007269	So the 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends.
8007329	8009771	I liked, they set a reasonable goal.
8009871	8012974	They didn't say millions for Mega Man Legends.
8013374	8016217	They said 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends.
8016377	8016818	Thanks for watching!
8028810	8029710	That's great.
8030050	8030391	100,000 strong.
8030411	8041974	It's important that if you are a member of the group and you have not joined the dev room community as part of Capcom, make sure you do that because that's what Capcom is actually looking at, assuming that they're actually looking at something.
8042834	8046215	Maybe this is going to pressure Capcom into an announcement this E3.
8046255	8046655	We'll see.
8048075	8075412	well you fans you demanded it so we're gonna finally port those games over that we've been promising oh I'm sorry that's into Ranma in our chat room says Sky I know people on that group they fucking occupied the Capcom booth at Comic Con as hilarious as that imagery is that's kind of messed up because the people at the booths manning the floor especially at an event like Comic Con probably aren't really the decision makers yeah but the word will get back
8075892	8083805	I guess that's true, but I don't know if that's exactly the best way to go about doing it, to make a scene like that, but whatever, different strokes for different folks.
8086929	8087530	Thanks for watching!
8106264	8107885	Yet, it worked.
8108405	8109825	We're having to eat our words a little bit.
8109865	8114667	It worked, or GameStop decided, hey, we're in a backlog, we need to bring it over here, and then another publisher took over the last story.
8114687	8116487	Let's say it worked for the last story.
8117427	8119708	Well, the last story was a different publisher, and Nintendo didn't have anything.
8119828	8120688	Well, but it still worked.
8121028	8124770	Somebody noticed, and somebody put it out, and somebody took the risk that Nintendo wouldn't take.
8124850	8127170	And no one fucking recognized President Cat.
8127370	8131432	I mean, seriously, President Cat, there was a big campaign behind it for a few weeks, and then...
8133292	8151970	well I'm maybe President Cat will be a Wii U launch title perhaps we need a hundred thousand strong for President Cat I think we had a good 50 on Twitter 50 period all right and that's how many copies of the game sold in Japan too apparently all right DarkSakura another story please
8152711	8155113	Well, there was a leak.
8155593	8172447	Yeah, I know everything I've talked about so far has been leaks, but there was video footage out for Rayman Legends that was the Wii U version, and it showed how its graphical power, the touchscreen tablet, the near-field communication...
8173107	8196724	basically it had everything on there and then we had a statement put out by Ubisoft that said yeah this is real and they're working on it at the Montpellier is that how it's pronounced studios right now and basically they said that yeah it's not the final game don't use that as representative but in fact here's actually what they're the actual statement is I'll just read it
8197404	8198064	Thank you for watching!
8215234	8239627	Who often create game prototypes with work-in-progress development kits Ubisoft confirms the development of Rayman Legends Handled by, I guess that's Michel Ancel And his team in Montpellier So, that's it Well, sucks for them that that got out But these things tend to happen I don't know why you would create a sizzle reel For a different department in your company
8240444	8240564	Demo
8255951	8271429	I have heard from people that I know that work in development and so forth that they do sometimes these you know because when you have these offices all over the place all over the world you do sometimes have these powwows be it virtually or whatever where folks are kind of like this is what we're working on this is what we're working on
8272409	8273430	Any industry does this.
8273490	8275751	In my job, it's called best practices.
8275811	8278953	I'm a trainer, and my training department gets together with other training departments.
8278973	8281434	We talk about what are we doing right now?
8281474	8282594	What can we learn from you guys?
8283275	8284215	That's what we do.
8284295	8285956	I mean, any big company does something like that.
8286016	8286716	It's not a secret.
8287497	8288957	So I think this is just a part of that.
8291259	8294940	Now they're going to get with other departments about not leaking your stuff.
8294980	8295160	Yes.
8295621	8298182	Now that's the meeting that has to be held next.
8300126	8305214	Anyways, as I was alluding to earlier in the show, this is what's wrong with the goddamn industry right there.
8305995	8311845	I'm assuming that most people have seen the video, and they're talking about...
8313962	8315983	The Wii U integration and stuff like that, which is cool.
8316263	8322285	You know, the whole like, oh, one person's on the Wii U tablet and they're, you know, moving the platforms or whatever.
8322305	8326067	It's kind of like how they do it in LittleBigPlanet with like the move support and the like original thing.
8327187	8334570	Although the near field communication stuff scares me because that shit Skylanders all over fucking again.
8334590	8336831	I mean, it's like, oh, hey, you want Rabbids World?
8337151	8339552	Place the Rabbids statue on the tablet.
8339932	8341073	Oh, you want to play it with Enzo?
8341573	8343234	Place the ends of the statue on the tablet.
8343374	8344295	Oh, you want hearts in the game?
8344335	8345836	Place the heart statue on the tablet.
8345856	8353362	Just deposit 25 cents into your Wii U. It's physical DLC is what that shit is, and people are fucking stupid and will buy this shit.
8353723	8355544	I want a statue of a rabbit!
8356104	8363570	And you've suckered somebody into purchasing a piece of DLC that would have been $2 normally, but it's a fucking cheap-ass statue that you're going to pay $8 for.
8364821	8372351	Not gonna lie though, if I could like get a Kaden statue that would unlock an all Kaden level in Mass Effect, I would be all over that.
8373112	8375475	I would bow down to that statue.
8375495	8376757	I love you Kaden.
8377398	8378419	I'm just saying it's...
8380161	8383842	Nintendo's tried this with fucking AR cards with Kid Icarus.
8384362	8388664	They're just experimenting with this because they saw how successful Skylanders was.
8389104	8391604	Skylanders was a franchise that doesn't really exist.
8391724	8395906	It has Spyro in it, but fuck, it's not really Spyro anymore.
8396426	8400607	It's not really a Spyro franchise, but it's a brand new franchise with no backing.
8401287	8403968	They sold toys and people were like, oh my god, I need
8404008	8405329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8426354	8429035	Oh, I need all the Pokemon statues so I can unlock them in-game.
8429615	8430276	Can you imagine?
8430296	8433197	I know you're probably thinking, oh, that's ridiculous.
8433357	8433837	No, it's not.
8433997	8436958	It's fucking in a couple years' time is what's going to happen.
8439159	8440780	And then it's going to get fucking ridiculous.
8442181	8445462	RawSteelUT in the VOG Network chatroom says, Calm down, Loki.
8445522	8446943	There are going to be cash-ins for this.
8447283	8449184	You're not going to see this take off long-term.
8449644	8452425	Actdeft says Nintendo already did this with the e-reader.
8455017	8482841	but I don't think the e-reader necessarily took off it was a neat idea and I think it was a great idea with some of like the stuff they did for Animal Crossing and stuff but I mean that was a little different unlocking the Legend of Zelda or Super Mario Brothers in a game is pretty cool compared to like you know and how much were those cards they weren't that expensive man the old school Animal Crossing on the GameCube did it the best with the whole like old games oh man that's such a deal that Nintendo wants you to forget ever happened
8484474	8484774	All right.
8485214	8489817	So I got to share this funny comment from Shane because I was talking about the Caden statues.
8489857	8493079	So Shane's in our chat room at thevognetwork.com.
8494220	8495620	Excuse me, vognetwork.com.
8495680	8496941	I almost said the old chat room.
8498022	8501384	Everybody in chat's waiting for one of us to fuck up tonight and say something old.
8502484	8508388	Shane says, I would buy all those statues, talking about the Caden statues, all up before you could even see one, Rob.
8508988	8510469	Can I tell you a funny story about Shane?
8512362	8512803	Oh, Rob.
8512883	8515446	We were talking in the car while I was on my way.
8516046	8519410	This week, I drove to LA at midnight.
8519771	8522113	I drove to LA from midnight to 5 a.m.
8522734	8527740	I had Victoria with me, but I had to drive to the Stockton area to pick Victoria up from Sacramento.
8527760	8530803	She lives in a town called Livermore, for those of you guys familiar with California.
8530823	8532365	So it's about an hour and a half away from where I'm at.
8532745	8535546	So I'm driving down there about 10 o'clock at night, and I call Shane on the road.
8535606	8536986	I'm like, Shane, entertain me.
8537466	8539667	So he's talking about, I'm trying to pick out a new gamer tag.
8539767	8543768	And I can't think of what gamer tag to pick out, because I want a new gamer tag.
8543788	8545249	And I asked him if I could share this with you guys.
8546269	8550770	And I said, well, Shane, you need to just put something you really love in your gamer tag.
8550810	8553371	He's like, I can't get Caden.
8553731	8555132	Everything Caden has taken.
8555192	8558853	I said, why don't you make your gamer tag Shane Alenko?
8558873	8559593	Yeah.
8560293	8561574	You know what would have been good?
8561594	8561694	What?
8561714	8562095	Cadence.
8562115	8563015	No, that doesn't work.
8578681	8579342	All right, anyhow.
8580403	8580803	There it is.
8581143	8582404	That was your random tangent story.
8582725	8583946	Hey, two more stories.
8583966	8586508	Which is a lot more interesting than your grocery store tangent.
8586568	8587089	Thank you.
8587189	8587509	Thank you.
8587549	8587889	Shut up.
8588290	8590412	All right, two more stories, and then Twitter and Skype.
8591312	8594275	Well, this is an unusual chain of events.
8595196	8598559	Apparently, Nexen is looking to take over EA.
8599500	8601922	They're actually bidding to buy EA.
8601942	8602162	Okay.
8603663	8609107	Apparently, they're really big in South Korea, and they have a lot of money.
8609628	8617233	I don't think that they're actually going to take them over, but it's interesting that they're trying.
8618594	8627921	It's kind of funny that somebody's trying to take on EA, but everybody's laughing, kind of pointing and laughing, going, how cute, and you're just waiting for it to flip the other way.
8628681	8630542	Why don't we buy you, Nexon?
8630562	8632524	There's always a bigger fish.
8635390	8637352	Who do you think could buy EA, if anyone?
8638072	8638853	Microsoft?
8639633	8640094	Sony?
8641395	8643637	I mean, who's bigger than EA at this point in the gaming world?
8643657	8644638	Why would they want to?
8644698	8646519	Like a Viacom or something like that?
8646619	8650622	To stop EA from all this multi-platform online stuff they're trying to do?
8651343	8654766	And lock EA and all their games into one particular system?
8654926	8656547	Can you imagine if Microsoft did that?
8656667	8657028	Oh, yeah.
8658128	8659970	Hey, sports games, we have them.
8660130	8660691	No one else does.
8660711	8666416	If Facebook is going to pay $1 billion for Instagram, surely there's a way.
8666516	8677686	If Microsoft wants it bad enough, they could snap up EA and every EA exclusive is now a Microsoft exclusive, including the sports franchises, Mass Effect, Dragon Age.
8677766	8679727	I'm thinking of all the Bioware stuff because that's the stuff I like.
8679747	8680368	Battlefield.
8680388	8681028	Battlefield.
8683010	8687614	I mean, but because of that, EA probably just cost too damn much.
8688815	8691758	Team Ron in our chatroom says, Ted Turner should buy EA.
8693219	8693880	Ted Turner!
8694440	8696122	Actually, they tried to do gaming.
8696222	8697944	Turner was GameTap.
8698804	8702587	The Turner Network stuff started GameTap back in the day, back when GameTap was alright.
8703027	8704688	GameTap was really interesting when it first came out.
8704708	8706589	I still think they could come back if they really wanted to.
8706609	8708430	Yeah, it kind of went to crap since the beginning.
8709030	8710211	Now it just blends in with the rest.
8710231	8716415	When it had its own player, and they were talking about the desktop stuff and all that, and it had its own launcher, it was really neat looking.
8716875	8722979	Now it just looks like any other... It blends right in with everything else, like what GameFly is doing and all that other stuff.
8724600	8724740	So...
8725313	8728614	and plus for a while GameTap was like the only place you could play Myst Online.
8729174	8729934	Some of that other stuff.
8729974	8731234	They should come out with a console.
8731274	8733075	It'll be a PC from like 10 years ago.
8733195	8734695	They'll play all the old stuff.
8735275	8735815	Maybe.
8735936	8736476	Who knows?
8736496	8739316	Hey, what are we going to do with these old PCs?
8739476	8740577	I've got an idea.
8740777	8743437	Don't you see that happen with the NES stuff?
8743977	8749439	Like you see those 101 built into the NES?
8749659	8752960	Because all the patents on the old NES stuff have expired.
8753000	8754020	The actual hardware.
8754140	8754940	Pirates don't give a fuck.
8755720	8756301	Yeah, exactly.
8757161	8759342	Well, and Nintendo doesn't really protect it very well either.
8759702	8768627	I don't know if they can't or what the deal is, but... Let's see, DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom says, Totally forgot about GameTap, lol.
8769007	8771368	Yeah, that's GameTap's problem.
8771629	8773409	They used to have really funny commercials.
8773830	8776711	And the reason why was because they had Turner Network behind them.
8776751	8780053	So they had the ability to do some fun TV stuff.
8781454	8782975	Seg in our chat room.
8783015	8783355	Hi Seg.
8783655	8787678	Says, yep, GameTap resurrected Myst Online or Uru was the name of that.
8787798	8789979	I did, Myst Online was creepy.
8790479	8792000	This is kind of a creepy game to me.
8792521	8795763	By the way, since Seg's in chat, I should say, everybody check out Walking Dead.
8796363	8796843	Just came out.
8797984	8799665	I think Seg would appreciate me throwing that out there.
8801026	8801326	All right.
8801786	8802647	One more story for you guys.
8803047	8809151	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8810748	8815612	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8834537	8835458	Well, somebody does.
8836599	8840942	Actually, I think it was a pretty big game in the 80s, but because it never had a home port, I think a lot of people forgot it.
8841362	8855012	Well, what's interesting, Howard Scott Warshaw, who made Yars' Revenge, E.T., love him or hate him, he made some great games and some bad games on the Atari 2600, he said StarCastle could never be stuffed into a game cartridge.
8855312	8859075	That's why they never did it, because there was no way they could have done it in 8K.
8859495	8860556	Well, Scott Williamson...
8860896	8888034	who was one of these guys back in the day that was doing stuff for the 2600 he never believed it so here we are 30 years later I love this this is like something Loki would do don't you ever tell me I can't do something because damn it someday I'm gonna fucking do it and here we are 30 years later and Scott Williamson achieved it he got Starcastle down into a format for the Atari 2600
8889275	8892678	He is now the technical director at Development Studio High Voltage.
8893339	8899204	What I think is really cool though, they made this custom cartridge and I actually really love this.
8899244	8900766	There's a great YouTube where you can check this out.
8901206	8903828	The freaking cartridge lights up.
8904349	8913437	They built these little lights into the cartridge so that as you're playing it, I'm trying to get to like a part where you see it in the video here because I don't want to play the whole like two and a half minute video.
8914198	8914779	It's pretty cool.
8915459	8935021	yeah oh yeah the game looks great but there's a part in it where you actually see the little cartridge is like lighting up with the game it's technology like at the time oh my god can you imagine if somebody had done this when Atari 2600 was like new yeah oh oh there it is here look at this part here in the video see like it's lighting up with the game
8936522	8937762	And you can actually buy that cartridge.
8937942	8938483	You can.
8939003	8944066	And if you want to get a copy of the cartridge, you know they're trying to fund an effort right now to get that cartridge made.
8944086	8945687	They want to make a lot of these and sell these.
8946107	8950189	So where does everybody go when they need money fast in this day and age?
8950250	8950970	Kickfarter.
8951070	8951910	That's right.
8952031	8953191	It's a kickfarter.
8953651	8958934	So if you go to Kickstarter, it's the Atari 2600 Star Castle.
8958995	8959915	I gotta say, this one's...
8962248	8963269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8990709	8992970	Just for the fact that I'd be buying the actual cartridge.
8993090	8995732	I am forever more than going to refer to those things as kickfarters.
8996292	8997353	I think that's a great name for it.
8997373	8998393	I am so against them.
8999534	9001175	Except if they give me money.
9001715	9002395	I don't know, man.
9002996	9005717	I've contributed to two, and both are pretty good.
9006117	9008039	Video Game High School and Shadowrun.
9009399	9010880	Because I like me some Shadowrun.
9010920	9012321	And Freddy Wong, man.
9012961	9015082	Whatever he makes and wants money for, I'll pay for it.
9018074	9021618	Alright, I think that's about the time where we're going to open up the Skype line.
9022039	9022980	Oh yeah, I have Skype open.
9023000	9024162	I just had it on DND.
9024883	9026304	So let me unlock that there.
9026444	9028367	I'm going to cast Magic Missile.
9029508	9030049	It's open.
9030169	9031230	It's on DND, right?
9032252	9033073	Do not disturb.
9033093	9033834	You're a little disturbing.
9036724	9038065	Oh, you have a last-minute story for us.
9038125	9039185	I do have a last-minute story.
9039265	9039946	All right, go for it.
9040026	9041467	I was interested in Awesomenauts.
9042307	9050212	It turns out that their publisher, DTP Entertainment, filed for, as they say overseas, insolvency, which is pretty much the equivalent of bankruptcy.
9050732	9054094	So it may not make the May 2nd release date.
9056195	9061438	But Romano Games, which is the developer, is really trying to work on getting it out, so...
9062648	9064930	So I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
9065150	9070854	I noticed Seg is suddenly getting an impromptu interview in the chatroom because people were like, Seg, did you work on Walking Dead?
9070914	9072416	That was awesome.
9072956	9077480	I have not played it myself yet because I haven't watched the show, although I understand the game is based off the books.
9077860	9080882	I do still want to check it out because I hear it's really good.
9081082	9082143	Everybody's really loving the game.
9082183	9083804	So Seg is giving an impromptu interview at...
9084765	9086166	VOG Network dot com.
9087347	9089729	And I want to mention what Blackwell says in the chat room.
9090109	9093872	Fifty dollars is about how much you'd be paying for a custom 2600 cartridge anyway.
9093932	9094933	So that's a decent price.
9095353	9097314	I paid 40 bucks for Halo 2600.
9097735	9099136	Somebody actually did Halo 2600.
9100036	9100297	All right.
9101037	9102138	Let's go to the phones.
9102258	9104079	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
9104099	9104400	Who's this?
9105248	9106711	Shane, Shane Alenko
9118562	9124809	No, actually, I was thinking about stuff, and so I decided to call on said stuff.
9124949	9132417	You can hear more about the WoW beta on Best Little Horde House in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com.
9132737	9137102	We have nothing to say about Horde House and VOG yet, but we'll see.
9137262	9138884	So anyway, Shane, what did you really want to call in about?
9140231	9148278	I was thinking about those rumors of the Midnight Purple 3DS since it's popping up all over the place on online sites.
9148618	9149259	It's not a rumor.
9149279	9150219	It's not a rumor.
9150239	9151180	They have a picture of it.
9151480	9155104	Well, because it was at E3 as one of the concept colors a long time ago.
9155604	9158727	Well, it might not be that specific color.
9159207	9160589	It could be slightly changed.
9161109	9161429	If that...
9162390	9175577	If that color comes out, that will be the first time I will ever, as I call it, quote, pull a Shane and buy a $250 system just because it's in a nice new color.
9177318	9181040	I'm going to upgrade if that's the case because I can't tell the difference between blue and purple.
9181100	9183362	So to me, it's a new blue system for me.
9185303	9186503	I'm really happy with that.
9186543	9187624	But wouldn't that...
9188288	9194701	Make it all the less likely they would announce a redesign at E3 for the 3DS?
9194901	9195021	No.
9195675	9201681	No, because they were still releasing, even after the DSi XL came out, they released the DSi in pretty pink and all this stuff.
9202061	9203342	So not necessarily.
9203983	9206285	Plus, it may still be too soon.
9206365	9209108	This year still may be too soon for the redesign.
9209528	9211130	The 3DS is only a year old.
9211310	9213352	I see this as the kind of thing that's in a two-year cycle.
9213392	9219738	And also because they're trying to make sure that they're not losing more money on there, adding more components to a system might not be a good idea.
9219918	9224883	Yeah, this year is about the Wii U. I mean, certainly they still want people to buy the 3DS.
9225284	9228407	They could do a 3DS XL with the extra add-on built in.
9228527	9232772	I just don't think they would do a 3DS XL or whatever and the Wii U in the same year.
9233332	9237096	I think this year will be the Wii U. Next year will be their 3DS redesign.
9237437	9241020	Year after that, some huge add-on for the Wii U or something.
9241764	9243185	Okay, then what about this?
9243646	9247689	What game are they going to launch that makes that color make sense?
9248289	9248910	What, purple?
9249530	9254254	Yeah, because they tend to launch games that kind of fit with the new color schemes.
9254294	9259078	Like they had in Japan, they had the Fire Emblem Blue.
9259298	9262120	They've had stuff similar to that.
9262180	9262561	I don't know.
9262601	9263121	I can't think.
9263141	9264422	Pokemon Purple.
9264582	9264863	No.
9265523	9268265	Luigi's Mansion 2 or Animal Crossing.
9269386	9272928	Waluigi takes over the world because he was purple, right?
9273748	9276370	Yeah, maybe he's in crappy Luigi's Mansion 2.
9276690	9279131	That hopefully is better than that E3 demo I played.
9279171	9279772	There you go.
9281192	9282913	Or what else is purple?
9284334	9284874	Barney.
9285115	9286375	Barney the dinosaur.
9288016	9288877	He's coming back.
9289397	9293400	Well, maybe the license on Barney now that it's been 20 years is so cheap.
9293440	9296523	Maybe somebody else has licensed him and now we can finally get our Barney killer.
9297584	9298204	Barney Sniper.
9298224	9299345	That's so 90s.
9299385	9300646	Birthday Party Barney Sniper.
9300666	9303028	20 years after nobody cared about it anymore.
9303088	9303688	Hold on.
9304029	9304529	Hold on.
9304909	9312235	Are you all sitting here and telling me that if some company released a game called Birthday Party Barney Sniper, you would not be the least bit interested?
9312295	9313496	No, I would not be actually.
9313516	9314016	For real?
9314096	9314977	I am so over that.
9315037	9315898	Excuse me.
9316258	9317439	Excuse me, Shane.
9317759	9319140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9340316	9367411	but they are doing a Power Rangers Samurai Connect game I told people at work that also care about Power Rangers and they all freaked out about that just like I did so that work there will at least be four people that buy that game well there you go and that's all the copies that will sell that's more people than bought President Cat in Japan alright Shane anything else you want to share with us tonight or ask about or whatever
9368188	9369269	I don't know, my eye hurts.
9369289	9370550	Does that count?
9371070	9374813	No, but here, let me ask you about this, since you're the guy that always likes to talk about Mass Effect.
9375454	9376174	Yes, I am.
9376835	9380137	What did you think about my little negative aspect of Mass Effect 3?
9380177	9382980	Some people in the chatroom didn't take too well to that.
9383100	9387363	Wait, say it one more time for me, because I don't know if I fully grasped what you said.
9387383	9397191	I don't like that it's not that I hate that you have to play multiplayer in order to do better in single player, especially in light of the whole iOS thing.
9397951	9410421	I really hate that A, it's the easiest way to do it and B, what really pisses me off is the fact that you can buy those little boxes with Microsoft points as well as in-game credits because to me that's trying to have your cake and eat it too.
9410461	9415665	You're trying to do a free Facebook game and charge me $60 for the game up front.
9415685	9417627	That's what I didn't like about it.
9417867	9426714	I don't really agree with your negativity because A, if there are people that want to pay real money to unlock
9427788	9433611	Extra guns or extra customization on their characters instead of just playing through the modes like you should.
9433991	9434411	Let them.
9434651	9437332	They're not making me pay for it, so I don't really care.
9437352	9442094	Well, I'm saying please don't do it because you're encouraging them to do it in other stuff and more often.
9442154	9444055	I think it's a bad precedent to set.
9444455	9446417	If these people don't do it, someone else will.
9458993	9459693	DarkSakura.com
9483387	9496899	Even if there wasn't an iOS game to help you raise your galactic readiness level, I hated the idea of having to play multiplayer just to get a quote-unquote better ending because they all suck.
9497540	9497820	But...
9498723	9499963	Thank you for watching!
9518110	9521572	I thought you were going to try and recruit somebody to play with us.
9540908	9542669	Nope, can't play tonight, that person.
9542689	9548191	So you need to send out some sort of whatever you call it.
9548832	9550472	Get on Xbox after the show.
9550532	9551713	Mass Effect 3 meetup.
9552253	9552713	There you go.
9553514	9553734	Yes.
9554874	9556135	And we'll be the ones dying a lot.
9556595	9559957	Just in case they can't find us where the corpse is.
9560577	9562238	Alright, I gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
9562978	9563358	That's fine.
9563378	9564899	You go check out my eye because it hurts.
9565099	9565419	All right.
9565639	9567160	I hope you didn't ruin your eye.
9567260	9567520	Bye.
9568300	9569601	Bye.
9569621	9573382	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9573442	9577504	If you want to, you know, give us a call.
9577684	9579345	Say hey to us on the VOG Network.
9580565	9582286	Here we are after all on VOG.
9583166	9584106	Hey, we got another call coming in.
9585247	9586187	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9586207	9586547	Who's this?
9587568	9588328	Hey, it's Porkchop.
9588348	9588728	How's it going?
9588928	9589889	Hey, I'm good.
9589929	9590209	How are you?
9591215	9591816	I'm not too bad.
9591836	9596340	I just want to say, first of all, congratulations, and I hope VOG goes well for you guys.
9596780	9597181	Thank you.
9597221	9597961	We hope so, too.
9598141	9599963	If it crashes and burns, well, oh, well.
9600003	9600724	It was fun trying.
9602697	9603297	Well, I doubt it.
9603317	9604778	You guys do a pretty good job anyway.
9604998	9605539	You know what, though?
9605959	9606820	This is important to say.
9606920	9611042	When we started Orange Launch Radio and the old network, I think you can, you know, I can't say this enough.
9611463	9620268	We did Orange Launch Radio for 12 people for a very long time, you know, and a lot of people really didn't know about us.
9620288	9623070	And it's not like we have thousands and thousands of listeners now.
9623450	9626772	It's relatively still a really small show, but we're okay with that.
9626832	9630575	You know, we feel like we're really connected with our community, and it's cool.
9631255	9631596	I like it.
9631856	9635020	I suppose it's a very dedicated kind of community as well.
9635060	9636782	So, I mean, I like this.
9637463	9640086	I guess you got me staying up till all hours.
9641308	9642710	Well, that is a great compliment.
9642730	9645533	I'm not going to talk too much because I can't talk over you all the time.
9645813	9646154	That's all right.
9646314	9652600	I was just going to say, when you sacrifice the greatness that is sleep to listen to this show, we take it as a great compliment.
9652881	9656044	But anyway, what did you want to talk about or ask us about tonight?
9656504	9659227	I wanted to mention, remember you were talking about Six Axes.
9659307	9663451	One of the games that was pretty overlooked, I don't know if many people bought it, was Loco Roco.
9663892	9666995	I remember buying that on PSN and I played the shit out of that.
9667515	9669157	I mean, on PSP it was okay, but...
9670137	9672581	You could actually control everything with the six axis.
9673042	9676247	You could rotate the screen, you could turn everything around and stuff.
9676848	9679272	So, I mean, that was one of the best ones, I think.
9680870	9683472	Was that a gun that went off in the background?
9684692	9686253	No, it was my Android.
9686273	9688634	I was like, what the hell is that?
9688674	9691255	People are sending me messages in chat while I'm actually talking.
9691976	9692256	Okay.
9692556	9693236	It was a duck.
9693656	9694917	Do they have ducks over there?
9695357	9695497	No.
9696038	9698519	LocoRoco is pretty awesome.
9698539	9698879	You're right.
9698999	9701340	I forgot about LocoRoco, and that's a good one to remind us of.
9701780	9706543	Does this mean LocoRoco needs to show up in the Sony Super Battle Royale Uber?
9706563	9707123	I'm sure they will.
9707823	9708904	A LocoRoco level?
9709264	9709725	That's a good idea.
9709745	9710065	I want that.
9710185	9710665	I want that.
9711986	9712246	Yes.
9713447	9714368	That would be hilarious.
9714388	9719492	You're actually able to flip the screen somehow and turn everyone on their heads.
9719652	9721773	Dude, Porkchop should be designing games.
9721853	9722734	I love that idea.
9722834	9726356	The whole flip the screen, get a power-up that does that.
9726537	9727277	Oh, that would be awesome.
9727958	9728098	Smart.
9728118	9728798	That would be awesome.
9729679	9732641	Well, Porkchop, are you looking forward to the Super Sony Fighter or whatever it's called?
9734376	9735356	I'm in two minds about it.
9735396	9739320	I mean, the first I've heard of it was tonight, so I'm still thinking about it.
9739380	9740861	I'm wondering, is it going to be worthwhile?
9740901	9743063	I mean, it's not going to be Super Smash Bros.
9743083	9743723	That was fun.
9744304	9750168	And again, I mean, as long as Microsoft don't try it, I mean, that's going to be an all-time piece of shit, if you ask me.
9750909	9754292	It's just going to be 12 Master Chiefs, as it was said in chat.
9755753	9756934	Well, we'll see.
9757034	9757895	We'll see what happens.
9757935	9758195	All right.
9758435	9760317	Portchop, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?
9761503	9765326	Uh, yeah, kickfarter for that Barney sniper party thingamajig.
9765346	9767387	Yeah, I definitely want to see Barney get shot in the head.
9767547	9768407	Now you're talking.
9768447	9769628	That's when I can get behind.
9771349	9772450	Alright, poor Chop.
9772510	9773270	Have a good one, buddy.
9773290	9773931	Thanks for calling.
9774651	9775352	Have a good one, guys.
9775432	9775852	All the best.
9776092	9776693	Alright, you too.
9776773	9777573	Bye.
9779494	9780515	Alright, let's go to the phones.
9780555	9781355	We have more calls coming in.
9781375	9782276	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9782296	9782656	Who's this?
9784177	9787179	Oh, um, hi, this is, uh, this is RawSteelUT.
9787659	9789480	Hey, RawSteelUT, what's up, buddy?
9789861	9790161	Hello.
9791901	9795844	Nothing much, you know, just wanted to call, say congratulations.
9796144	9798646	Thank you, we're just really happy to be here.
9801048	9801788	I bet, man.
9801828	9810894	I mean, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing where VOG goes from here and hell, where all games go from here.
9811175	9812816	Me too, on both fronts.
9813376	9814777	It's going to be exciting for both.
9816098	9819721	Yeah, I mean, I just hope that all games are going to go the direction of G4.
9819741	9819901	Yeah.
9820996	9822157	It'll be interesting.
9822217	9822537	Hey, um...
9845782	9849068	Just on a technical note, I've noticed I've been getting some feedback when I'm talking.
9849369	9850952	I've been hearing pieces of myself.
9851266	9872933	You might, yeah, because in studio here we're too cheap to have headsets for everybody so we actually play the calls over the speaker so sometimes you get picked up just a little bit by our microphone so sometimes our callers complain of that so apologies about that but, you know, one of these days we'll have to go, I don't know, sell things on the side of the freeway to get money for proper headphones for everybody.
9872993	9876314	Actually, that was something I thought about doing for the studio but just never got around to it.
9876474	9876854	But anyway.
9878537	9880199	Yeah, that might be a good idea.
9880219	9883421	I mean, it's not like you can't get office headsets or something.
9883722	9884322	Oh, of course, of course.
9884382	9887285	I just thought it was just a hiccup from the station condition.
9887305	9887405	Yeah.
9906530	9908531	Well, lately I've been playing a lot of Soul Calibur.
9908891	9909572	Soul Calibur 5.
9910212	9910993	Soul Calibur 5.
9911653	9916576	Yeah, one of our listeners and I were trying to meet up to play, and it just wasn't working out for various reasons.
9916956	9920278	But, man, some of the custom creations.
9920298	9922219	And I think he posted some of them on Facebook.
9922279	9923920	Stan posted it on Facebook.
9924920	9927362	It's hilarious what people are doing with those custom characters.
9927402	9928262	It's so robust.
9928622	9930063	But, yeah, Soul Calibur 5 is a good time.
9931344	9931704	Oh, yeah.
9931744	9933245	I saw this one video on YouTube.
9933265	9934226	It was a Voldo player.
9934566	9934786	Uh-huh.
9935906	9943592	and he made this character based off of Waldo with a huge purple furry phallus.
9943913	9952760	Sorry, I was just going to say it's an old classic saying that we say about video games.
9952820	9954121	It's called time to penis.
9954521	9957743	Whenever something new comes out, it's the TTP, the time to penis.
9958084	9964689	Whenever something new comes out where there's either a peripheral... For a peripheral, it's how long until someone puts their dick on it.
9966730	9975513	Oh yeah, it was not long at all.
9975573	9979395	I think the YouTube video was from February, so it was very soon after the game came out.
9979415	9980896	It was not long at all, that's what she said.
9980996	9984237	I mean, it was ridiculous.
9985597	9994101	But the thing that, I'm sorry, I'm laughing a bit, but the thing that's got me about, since I've been playing a lot of Soul Calibur, is that
9994688	10000891	It's very hard to find fighting coverage that isn't really centered around Capcom.
10002112	10016740	It's gotten to the point where, I don't know if you follow tournaments at all, but it really feels like a lot of the players are forcing themselves with Street Fighter X Seconds, because playing the Capcom games seems to be the only way to get any coverage.
10018533	10019954	Yeah, that's the thing.
10019974	10020814	Technically, it's a Capcom game.
10020834	10022094	The thing is, people play these games seriously.
10022114	10024035	I mean, maybe not as much, but there's still a lot of people.
10024095	10024295	I mean...
10043737	10048759	You know, Soul Calibur V and Mortal Kombat 9 are part of the games being featured in Major League Gaming now.
10049340	10053301	But, you know, it's hard to find coverage if it's not a Dicastron game.
10053321	10055903	So it's hard to find, you know, people talking about it.
10055963	10060685	People, you know, any sort of coverage of the events or things like that.
10061434	10062394	Why do you think that is?
10062894	10064975	You know, as you're saying that, you're kind of right.
10065035	10069616	Whenever I hear about fighting game community, it does seem like Capcom first, other games second.
10069636	10073798	I mean, granted, there are other games like Stance as King of Fighters, which is another good one too.
10074078	10075578	You know, Soul Calibur, as was mentioned.
10075618	10078519	It's not like there's not other good fighting games out there, but you're kind of right.
10078579	10083401	Whenever I hear about fighting game tournaments and who's popular, it's always Street Fighter something that it comes down to.
10083741	10084301	Why is that?
10084341	10085181	Why do you think that is?
10086982	10088322	I mean, it's hard to tell.
10088362	10091143	I mean, obviously part of it is because, you know,
10091656	10094499	One of the first big fighting games was Street Fighter 2.
10095179	10098282	I mean, that's the jump off for a lot of players.
10098743	10099043	True.
10099423	10108231	But I think at this point, you have a lot of major sites that really, you know, it's like anything else.
10108251	10109853	They don't want to go out of their wheelhouse.
10110453	10115178	And it's kind of frustrating when you have to dig around for science sites for other games.
10117102	10122836	I have to tell you though, my experience was a lot different when I was teenager and young adult in Alabama.
10123277	10124119	It was all Mortal Kombat 2.
10125817	10127679	Well, because the blood was cool.
10128299	10128640	Well, no.
10129421	10132283	When we did our tournaments at my college, it was on Killer Instinct.
10132323	10133965	We didn't have any Street Fighter machines.
10134005	10135867	We had a Vampire Savior.
10135887	10143774	That would also be the period of time, though, when all the Street Fighter games that were coming out were essentially just Street Fighter 2 Champions, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Street Fighter 2 Super.
10144054	10150020	And then there was Street Fighter 3, which kind of, I mean, it didn't have that same fire.
10150080	10154603	It's funny to hear that because the way it's presented to me and the way I remember from my own youth is that everybody gravitated to Street Fighter.
10174607	10175868	and it seems to continue.
10176229	10177970	That might be more of a West Coast thing.
10178230	10186696	And it is, well, it is also, I think if you look at the internet and a lot of stuff, like a lot of the fighting game stuff on the internet, I don't doubt what Raw Steel is saying at all.
10186736	10190879	It does seem to be heavily dominated with Street Fighter, especially the esports stuff.
10191240	10194622	All this stuff we're talking about, that didn't exist in the era you're talking about.
10194742	10197424	Esports wasn't a thing back then, you know?
10197504	10199186	So now that it's... Even before esports...
10201400	10230079	like when Mortal Kombat came out I remember a lot of people didn't take it seriously and the post arcade Mortal Kombat they never got any tournament play even though they were popular games Mortal Kombat 3 especially was kind of a joke in the fighting game community because of all the not just the over the top stuff but the combos and the juggles that go on forever and just kind of the style is so much different I remember that game was really not well received by the fighting game community you know casual people liked it enough but
10231742	10238107	It's funny you say that because a lot of people, they're huge into Marvel.
10239668	10243711	And that's all bullshit juggles and 99-hit combos and shit like that.
10243871	10244311	That's true.
10244571	10247193	All right, Ross Steele, I've got to let you go for time.
10247473	10248674	But thank you so much for calling in.
10248714	10249675	I really appreciate it, okay?
10250856	10251236	All right.
10251256	10251796	See you later.
10251917	10252317	Take care, buddy.
10253311	10254773	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10254813	10259938	I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through, but it was a popular first night here on VOG.
10260219	10261019	Send us an email.
10261480	10262101	Put your thoughts there.
10262141	10262621	Write them down.
10262661	10263142	Get a pen.
10263903	10271511	Write them down and then put it in an email and send it to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com because DarkSakura needs work to do next week, right?
10273553	10274293	That's my response.
10274594	10277255	Let's go to our Twitter because we got to get some of these out real quick here.
10277295	10279676	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10279796	10284679	13xForever tweets us saying, Loki OLR looks much cuter in this picture than I remember him.
10287538	10288919	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10307167	10307647	No, Eddie.
10307707	10308648	That was from the Eddie set.
10309108	10313909	Tia did the very, very first one a long time ago that was on the album art for a while, and Eddie did a set.
10314529	10315169	Oh, that's right.
10315409	10316529	God, my hair was awful in that.
10316669	10317330	Yeah.
10317350	10318010	No, I loved it.
10318410	10318870	But anyway.
10318910	10319590	It was awful.
10320230	10320890	I thought you looked cute.
10321351	10322471	But we need new ones.
10322611	10324231	We need to find a photographer friend.
10324251	10325612	Maybe, I know a couple.
10325752	10327492	We'll get some new ones taken.
10328052	10329473	And you can see how cute Loki is now.
10331883	10334806	Trials Evolution popularity is due to true skill, according to RedLynx.
10349922	10358487	Uh, Trials Evolution, of course, is on the Xbox Live Arcade, and it set a one-day sales record, uh, apparently because of how well Trials HD had done.
10358827	10363309	This is the game that's, like, kinda excite-bikey, at least that's what it is at first look.
10364090	10364190	Um...
10365611	10368714	Why are people loving this so much?
10369434	10377622	According to Taro Vertala, who's the managing director at RedLynx, I think there is a more positive explanation than sheer masochism.
10377983	10384809	It's like in real life when you start practicing something very physics-based like tennis or billiards, there's no limit to how far you can develop your skills.
10385149	10387732	In trials, it's also about your own true skill.
10388172	10390573	Not the skill of your avatar or game character.
10390933	10394895	The sense of accomplishment is that much more genuine because it was all your own doing.
10394975	10396615	Your skill, your persistence.
10396795	10400357	And also, I believe they are referring to not a picture of me, but a picture of my cat.
10400517	10402237	And yes, my cat is much cuter than I am.
10403238	10404178	Oh, is that what it is?
10405719	10407719	Oh, because you just tweeted a picture of your cat.
10407819	10410060	I put the cat in there for size reference, okay?
10410080	10413241	Because it's large.
10413261	10415122	Someone asked right at the beginning, is that Shermie?
10415182	10417223	I'm like, no, Shermie hasn't moved to Loki's house.
10417768	10424194	Alright, moving on, TigerClaw says there's a Portal cartoon being made, what?
10424955	10429199	Yeah I didn't hear about this Is this a real thing or is this a fan thing?
10429219	10434604	Well it's a fan thing I shouldn't say it like that, it's not like a fan thing can't be real, I should say is this an officially endorsed thing?
10435645	10438987	No, but it's being done by a professional animator.
10439207	10440828	It's Alex Zemke.
10441268	10452036	He worked on the movies called Companionship, and he is a professional animator who, in credits, include Disney movies like G-Force and The Smurfs, as well as Uncharted 2 and 3.
10453637	10454117	Very cool.
10454137	10456539	And it looks very interesting if you want to.
10456559	10458180	Yeah, the art style kind of looks like those movies.
10458200	10459120	I want to see this.
10459200	10460161	That looks awesome.
10460801	10461762	Well, you go, guy.
10462322	10463063	I hope you get it done.
10465499	10469463	I'm just trying to quickly see if there's any other tweets to read.
10469663	10472165	I'm going to leave it at that because we're trying to wrap up shop tonight.
10472185	10473666	I'm sorry if I didn't get to you tonight.
10474086	10475107	It's just a popular night.
10475147	10475728	What can I say?
10476248	10477609	Any other last-minute stories from Loki?
10478150	10487718	Just real quick, there was apparently an effort to remake Pokemon Crystal for the Game Boy Advance, and apparently it is finished.
10487898	10493563	So now there's Pokemon... What do they call it now?
10494404	10496225	Liquid Crystal You hear that, Shane?
10498727	10500168	I guess... Well, actually, no.
10500208	10502851	It's not done yet, but it's available to pick up.
10503191	10504852	Beta 3.1 is out now.
10504872	10507875	Of course, you need a flash cart or an emulator to play it.
10508075	10508696	You hear that, Shane?
10510017	10511658	I'm sure he's listening.
10512879	10513420	It looks neat.
10516423	10520585	Also, why am I not surprised to see a Price is Right Save Mart ad right here on your table?
10520885	10530529	Because if you must know, we had like a stack of stickers like that high and we were trying to collect and win.
10531369	10537732	Thank you for telling everybody my business and how Alan and I have turned into extreme couponers in our spare time.
10538732	10541453	Hey, we got some good deals.
10541874	10542534	It's adorkable.
10544184	10555213	Alright, if that's it, then we're going to go around and wrap up the show and say goodnight to everybody and close up our very first show here on the Voice of Geeks Network or the VOG.
10556514	10557795	DarkSakura, I'll let you go first.
10557815	10558775	You already packed your shit up.
10558795	10559316	You're ready to go.
10559396	10562198	Well, just because I got to go to bed because I have work tomorrow.
10562398	10563279	What's your final thought tonight?
10563359	10564260	I have indigestion.
10564820	10565721	I'm sorry to hear that.
10567855	10571458	and reject false icons.
10572319	10573340	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10573520	10582328	The Star Fox video that I'm watching that someone remade the beginning of Star Fox with it's all pretty is pretty neat.
10584002	10589025	My final thought tonight is please watch the RuPaul's Drag Race finale tomorrow.
10589446	10591867	It's going to be awesome and full of surprises.
10592067	10592608	That's all I can say.
10592628	10593448	Talk about dork.
10593768	10598452	Hey, RuPaul's Drag Race is the best show on TV and it's only going to get better.
10598492	10599292	That's all I'm saying.
10600133	10601233	You know what I did during the show?
10601373	10601574	What?
10602274	10608778	I bought a battery recharger for my iPhone to take to Disneyland for $3 including shipping.
10609559	10610620	Well, yay you!
10612884	10614565	Excuse me, it was my final thought.
10614645	10615145	All right, anyway.
10616306	10617827	And the final thought from all of us.
10618307	10619048	Thank you guys.
10619348	10621749	Thank you for listening all the way to the end of the show.
10621869	10622710	You guys are awesome.
10622730	10624231	If you're listening live, thank you.
10624891	10626212	Thank you to the podcasters.
10626252	10627492	Thank you guys so much for listening to us.
10627553	10630514	And most importantly, following us on our crazy adventures.
10630594	10632836	This was a huge first night for us here on VOG.
10633176	10639239	We didn't think that we'd have quite the audience that showed up tonight, especially with as little notice, less than 24 hours notice.
10639559	10640520	You guys fucking packed the house.
10640560	10641881	And of course, tell a friend
10662328	10663690	about Orange Lounge Radio.
10663810	10664531	It's word of mouth.
10664652	10666494	We don't ask for your money to do this show.
10666815	10668097	We don't run ads or anything.
10668137	10672743	We just want to spread the love and spread the word.
10672763	10673805	We're into oral.
10674265	10675347	We're into oral.
10676148	10676388	What?
10677049	10678011	Oh, A-U-R-A-L.
10678760	10678980	No.
10680001	10680701	You used your mouth.
10682203	10682883	You're disgusting.
10683804	10684064	All right.
10684344	10684945	That's it, guys.
10685125	10685725	Until next week.
10685765	10687627	We'll be back next week to do it all over again.
10687687	10688727	We hope you'll come back and join us.
10689048	10690809	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
10690909	10692090	And yes, it's a new closing.
10692110	10692810	We had to redo it.
